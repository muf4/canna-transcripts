1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,719
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,879
University uh so next up are more

3
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:13,919
research briefs we are going to be

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,160
talking about weeds and then also the

5
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,000
farmer data lab so I'm going to be

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,439
introducing the next speakers first we

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,039
have Eric Youngerman and so Eric was

8
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:24,839
born and raised in the Rolling Hills of

9
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:28,720
the birkar Massachusetts okay western

10
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:30,359
Mass okay I'm assume everyone knows that

11
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,879
Eric Youngman joined the sustainable

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,879
cropping systems lab in uh 2022 where

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,760
he's a research support specialist and a

14
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:39,839
firste PhD student his work spans the

15
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,839
Northeast uh focusing on advancing

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,399
sustainable Pest and disease management

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,640
in organic cropping systems uh for the

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,558
past two years Eric has been invest

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,558
investigating the efficacy of inter

20
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:55,078
mowing for weed control in soybean and

21
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:57,679
dry bean he's particularly excited I am

22
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,039
too about its potential as a

23
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,640
supplemental uh strategy for managing

24
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,359
weeds in organic noil systems so he's

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,000
going to talk first I also just want to

26
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:08,040
take the opportunity to introduce the

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,478
next speaker as well there this is U

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,640
going to be done at the same time here

29
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:14,920
so Lou longchamps um earned his PhD at

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,239
Laval University working on sight

31
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,280
specific weed management he did his

32
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:21,199
postoral studies at Colorado State

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,599
University working on Precision nutrient

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,960
seed and Water Management as an

35
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,919
assistant professor of digital Agronomy

36
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:30,519
at Cornell University he explores the

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,519
potential of observational res research

38
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:35,640
and on Farm experimentation so Dr L

39
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,719
Champs is the current chair of the on

40
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,439
Farm experimentation community of the

41
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:41,280
international Society of precision

42
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,199
Agriculture and again he's going to be

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,840
talking about the farmer data lab right

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:51,560
after Eric so Eric take it

45
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:54,759
away okay cool wow that was a lot um

46
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,640
about me and Lou uh berkers did

47
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:57,519
everybody know that was in the

48
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,960
Massachusetts Matt did not so I'm just

49
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,478
pointing them out right now

50
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:05,399
I assumed everybody here would know that

51
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,560
okay so as Matt said I'm a a research

52
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,000
support specialist and first year

53
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,598
graduate student uh theable cropping

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,759
system PL I'm going to be highlighting

55
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:14,280
some of the work that I've been doing

56
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:17,519
with the inter Mower and also some of uh

57
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,759
the other students in L as well so um

58
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:20,319
I'm not going to go over the benefits of

59
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:21,919
cover cropping I don't think because we

60
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:26,039
already have our benefits of cover crop

61
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:29,199
based no till um but um primarily I I

62
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:32,840
guess we like it because uh it's great

63
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:34,759
for uh it's soil benefits um earlier

64
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,120
I've heard a lot of people asking about

65
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,560
uh what does it actually look like I

66
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,680
know we've seen some photos of roller

67
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,439
cing people also talk about uh I guess

68
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,959
do we roll or plant plant and roll in

69
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:49,158
our lab this works not here cool in our

70
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,360
lab we generally do it at the same

71
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:55,519
time um so we are rolling our our

72
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,440
material ride um and then we're we're

73
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,640
doing it all one path with a planter the

74
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,639
people in the back can't hear so you got

75
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,598
a s from

76
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,798
cool all right and so we really enjoyed

77
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,639
this system um to the point that our

78
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:09,719
Labs actually with with a lot of help of

79
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:11,958
people from in this room have developed

80
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,840
an organic noil planted soybean

81
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:15,239
production guide uh this guide is

82
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,799
available in the back for those of you

83
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:20,480
who are interested Matt's now standing

84
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:22,519
next to the pot um and although we've

85
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:26,639
highlighted a lot like benefits

86
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:27,799
of erosion control or soil Health um

87
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,000
what we haven't really talked about too

88
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:33,560
much is how effective these

89
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,360
are at weed

90
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,120
suppression so in this case we have

91
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,040
amazing weed suppression you essentially

92
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,560
see no weeds coming up through that M

93
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:46,280
layer does this always happen

94
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,598
though

95
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,280
no and so the question is are there

96
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,280
options available so we can

97
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,719
meet are are those options available I

98
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,318
don't like the stand mov voice are there

99
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:00,680
options available for us to maintain

100
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:03,479
that mul biomass layer

101
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,719
um without disturbing without disturbing

102
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:07,719
the

103
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:07,719
soil

104
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,319
so okay okay we

105
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,600
good excellent

106
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,279
so one option I think what a lot of

107
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,600
people do in this room typically which

108
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:29,119
it does involve some level of soil

109
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,919
disturbance this is high resid

110
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,800
cultivation

111
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:35,000
um how resid cultivation works it's kind

112
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,360
of great it works well especially it's

113
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,759
typically used for uh when we have too

114
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,600
many weeds and we go in at the end of

115
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:44,280
the season um I've heard that people

116
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:48,560
today talk about it um now one issue

117
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:50,719
though is you are disturbing that that

118
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,478
that mul layer you're also disturbing

119
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,479
your soil so this is kind of a funny

120
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:56,599
example because we don't really have

121
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,639
that many weeds here um but so you're

122
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,240
also ideally would be tearing up

123
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,759
those another option one that we are

124
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:07,160
especially excited about though is inoo

125
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:12,280
because down you can control your weeds

126
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:14,360
a mul system with literally no soil

127
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:17,239
disturbance yes you can point out oh

128
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,639
well what about oh it's also

129
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,079
really sweet video

130
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,439
too so we really like

131
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,879
this um there a couple other models out

132
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:28,038
there on the market but we've

133
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:30,959
collaborated with this group and what we

134
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:35,038
like about it is has 5 rotary

135
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:37,839
M um enable us to move pretty much

136
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,519
between anything that's 30in space and

137
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,519
we can adjust the cutting height from 26

138
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:45,719
in above the surface and you can use it

139
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:48,719
until you are are at risk of can

140
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,479
closure so we like this so much that a

141
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,479
few years back a graduate student of

142
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:58,279
ours who um have since moved on compar

143
00:05:54,478 --> 00:06:00,399
the of M with two other management

144
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:02,439
options one the weed which VI was

145
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:06,560
talking about earlier as well as

146
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:09,800
increased seeding rate well this word

147
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,639
found this was in was that uh they

148
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,120
moment reduced we biomass by 60%

149
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,598
compared to the non-re control and there

150
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,120
was a increase by 14% in the

151
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:21,918
yield so this was pretty cool this was

152
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,280
quite

153
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:28,159
H but we want to know how does this

154
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,198
compare to more till based practices

155
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,720
like H res cultivated

156
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,919
um so we designed an experiment that's

157
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,800
the name of this the talk Ino is a

158
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:40,399
supplemental weed management tool in

159
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,000
organic soil to evaluate Intero weed

160
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:48,959
management and crop field in both F

161
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:52,038
based cultivation and organic sod where

162
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:54,159
not so I'm going be presenting our

163
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:56,240
results from the past three years for

164
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,280
three site years uh this all took place

165
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,960
up at M research New York some of you

166
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:04,359
might SE it if you came to our field

167
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:06,959
crop Bay um we had some pretty great

168
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:10,520
great soybeans out there um s was

169
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:12,198
planted at 185 pounds per acre sorry I

170
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:15,318
know I put three million of pure live

171
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:18,960
seeds per acre um and we developed

172
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:20,520
randomiz block design with five Tre roll

173
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,159
seral ride with no additional weed

174
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:26,719
management roll seral ride with intergro

175
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:30,560
mowing L with high residue cultivation

176
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,560
till witho and until with with inter

177
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,000
cultivation and the idea behind this

178
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,519
structure was we wanted to increase so

179
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,120
as we're going down we are increasing

180
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:42,240
soil disturbance so the goal here is how

181
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,639
can we manage our weeds by by with

182
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,639
minimal

183
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:49,279
disturbance so now just have a couple

184
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,399
pictures of each treatment so you're

185
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,638
like oh that's what it looked like so

186
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:56,679
roll with no additional weed management

187
00:07:53,639 --> 00:08:02,199
pretty much we terminated our C at 70

188
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,199
approximately 75 in theses we just left

189
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,759
it and this you can see some gaps and

190
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:10,758
that has to do with some Ur

191
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,759
issues

192
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:18,120
damage for high resid cultivation um we

193
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,680
used a John

194
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,478
Deere Chris what was it 886 thank you

195
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,918
886 High residue cultivator

196
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:28,240
approximately 20 inle sweep you can see

197
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:31,439
on this side and we did it once per the

198
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,439
gr season

199
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:43,399
um we then also us our t r to treatments

200
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
um so occurrence happen twice per

201
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:49,600
growing season um it's kind of neat here

202
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,879
in this picture the top you can see um

203
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,839
pre Mowing and post mowing until you can

204
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:58,360
see quite reduction of the weeds within

205
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:01,440
the R zone and same on the bottom except

206
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,440
this is in our r Treat

207
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,200
and

208
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:10,519
thenation picture this John 900 standard

209
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:14,079
on the back um use finger weers as well

210
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:17,959
as standard inter cultivating I make UND

211
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:17,958
side and this occurred four

212
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,278
times so before I show the results I

213
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:27,799
want to emphasize a few things one is

214
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:31,120
that there was a lot of variation in the

215
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:34,719
biomass of the m three different

216
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:38,919
fields um quite a bit of variation with

217
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:43,079
actually enough I'll show you later but

218
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:43,078
well so we

219
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:51,560
with first so in the following so the

220
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:53,958
field that we had the most R biomass

221
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:55,719
which we anticipated or expected have

222
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:57,759
the greatest pressure or the least

223
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,879
pressure typically when we think about

224
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,360
what how much m is required you have a

225
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:03,320
standard gold which is about 8,000 kg

226
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,600
per

227
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,760
Hector pound per acre it's probably

228
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,759
about

229
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:13,159
9,000 about the same eight and half okay

230
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:16,039
so which field do you think

231
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:20,039
had the highest

232
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:20,039
am as as far as like

233
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,519
biom a

234
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,240
wish still kind of like really cool

235
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,320
because sometimes you can have a really

236
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,560
high M we biomass I didn't go over this

237
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,360
in the beginning I apologize but you can

238
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:44,638
also have really high SE density in your

239
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,839
weeds or sorry in your soil um and so

240
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,360
you can end up having really high

241
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:50,920
numbers we so that first picture that I

242
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,440
showed you really nice looking field

243
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:55,399
with no weat with field p and the second

244
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,560
but was still

245
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:00,759
eight and so another point to make is uh

246
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:03,479
with the result of show you we had

247
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:08,480
really low we weed pressure across site

248
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:09,600
years um and so uh it's hard to design

249
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,600
an

250
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,680
experiment just plant a ton of weeds um

251
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,200
and then Lo so there's some we

252
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,919
anticipate some of these results to be a

253
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,920
little bit more

254
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:22,919
uh

255
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:30,000
more we would expect more clearer

256
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:33,199
results with greater weeds

257
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,240
so here's the weed biomass this we

258
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,480
pulled across our site years on the

259
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,440
x-axis we have our R our treatments

260
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:45,039
going from least disturbance to greatest

261
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,600
disturbance and our we biomass

262
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:53,559
ACC um so the interesting thing about

263
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,560
these RH is primarily inter actually

264
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:01,839
increased come to that later

265
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:01,838
on and something else that I want to

266
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:11,719
highlight is how we actually sample

267
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:15,199
we um and this is just um you'll see

268
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:17,959
second um so typically when when most

269
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:17,958
researchers I

270
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:25,559
think s

271
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:27,719
Quant um we s our along the RO so the RO

272
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:30,769
be which have been removed these

273
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,959
pictures we

274
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:35,879
[Music]

275
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:38,439
that

276
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:40,919
report so the in row

277
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:44,880
mower uh as I pointed out earlier has a

278
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:47,120
22 in deck so right now when we're

279
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:50,120
including this we're kind of we're

280
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,159
including the we that not been touched

281
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,159
by

282
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:54,919
that

283
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:58,600
so quick

284
00:12:54,919 --> 00:13:01,759
breakdown what we did in addition to uh

285
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:05,000
the the entire uh the half meter

286
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,679
quadrant is we divided also into two

287
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,879
inter row

288
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:15,000
zones combine those um so we're

289
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:17,360
excluding not make using the from

290
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,198
RS so when we do that we get something a

291
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,720
little bit different um and so now we

292
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:27,879
see inter

293
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:30,120
mowing is actually reducing it by 7%

294
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:33,240
when compared to our control we still

295
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,639
get really like hardly anything theyed

296
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,039
but it's quite

297
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:42,320
exciting

298
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:42,319
on there was no difference

299
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:49,120
between and that's okay interested hey

300
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,000
can we get these we out of here and once

301
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,679
you can figure out how to do that then

302
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,198
then we can really kind of start looking

303
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:59,198
at what we can do

304
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:59,198
to um

305
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:07,399
in conclusion in increase bi until to

306
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,480
the control we think that's because

307
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:12,000
primarily most of the weeds within that

308
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,000
area are going to

309
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,360
beeses but we essentially just causing

310
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:18,480
and grow and grow and grow so I would

311
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,759
not

312
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:25,199
necessarily in uh in

313
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:27,519
treatments

314
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:30,389
decrease compar to

315
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:33,159
the uh

316
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:34,720
[Music]

317
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:39,360
in

318
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,360
so can replace

319
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,000
cation effectiv effectively control

320
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,560
without

321
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,559
impacting so

322
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,399
quick at

323
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:57,559
this in organic noal

324
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:01,480
drivings um and what's interesting about

325
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:03,799
this is we also at how in can not only

326
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:07,440
uh control weeds but also can control

327
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:10,198
weed seat um and we noticed with the

328
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,160
late mowing so here no mowing early

329
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:16,278
mowing late Mowing and as dat mowing uh

330
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:19,078
and we notic that um the we seeds

331
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:22,159
reduced by up to 50% compared to the

332
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:24,479
Onre control so we're also removing

333
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,439
seeds which is pretty we don't have to

334
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,959
think about that but we're just focusing

335
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:33,360
on Le

336
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:35,638
control BL we also removing corn um and

337
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:41,039
so an organic Noto corn this is another

338
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:45,839
graduate student our Adam is in the

339
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:48,120
A and preliminary results from a large

340
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:52,079
experiment is demonstrated once again

341
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:54,839
that can remove biom we biomass the more

342
00:15:52,078 --> 00:16:00,719
excitingly cor at least in this

343
00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:00,720
experiment can also improve your use

344
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:06,078
[Music]

345
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:08,799
one question while we switch over to uh

346
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,439
Dr long so uh I should just say that

347
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,039
those were some really good soybean

348
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,160
yields that you were looking at earlier

349
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:16,240
right some high Bean yields those corn

350
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:17,719
yields that Eric was showing at the end

351
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,480
there those were quite low but those

352
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,680
were averaged over a bunch of treatments

353
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,240
some suboptimal treatments so um they

354
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:27,198
were lower than what we would like to

355
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,079
see here of course any question question

356
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:33,679
for Eric

357
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,958
Adam I'm curious about uh the ability of

358
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:39,039
the in

359
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:40,439
mower to Red reduce Che bang Che bang

360
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:44,360
can you talk a little bit more about

361
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:46,440
that we sure so in in the followup

362
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,759
experiment in our driving the idea is

363
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,399
that you're you're targeting weeds

364
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:53,120
before they are flowering and producing

365
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,198
seeds but to analyze that or to measure

366
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,959
that we put out pit traps that that

367
00:16:56,198 --> 00:16:59,639
patch some mus we measured the

368
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:02,078
production of about s

369
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,000
ofine and so then we noce how many seeds

370
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:06,519
are being removed there's so many seeds

371
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,558
being added to the seed over here so

372
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:12,240
removing any biomass you would think

373
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:13,519
would be uh would be removing seeds but

374
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,838
actually

375
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:19,838
quantitated have Quan is

376
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:19,838
really

377
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:30,839
yeah the week continues to grow thepit

378
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:30,840
is going to REM SE again when when the

379
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:37,599
that's true yep yep um so one so I guess

380
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:41,119
one thing that be Target and try to

381
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:42,319
Target with the late mowing is do a

382
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,319
dominant assessment of what weeds are

383
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,879
out there so okay the most dominant weed

384
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:48,038
is going to be common raged you're going

385
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,320
to Target that common rag when it is

386
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:52,919
going into

387
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:55,279
flower yes there are cases where that

388
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:57,679
that common R can still grow back and

389
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:59,319
put off almost tiller put off little PES

390
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,840
but you're still reducing the number of

391
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:06,038
weeks by I don't think the exact ratio

392
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:08,359
by large number um yeah so I think it's

393
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:10,359
a NE option to explore and so just

394
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:13,240
prevent the production been going on and

395
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:14,719
trying to destroy them which is why B

396
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,679
project is so cool because it's going to

397
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,279
be preparing

398
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:21,000
all thank you Eric so Eric will be

399
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:23,839
around later you can talk with him about

400
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,839
in mowing

401
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,520
by farmer data

402
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,080
lab great you very much mat thank you

403
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:34,599
Christen for the

404
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:37,519
invitation yes it's my pleasure to be

405
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:40,839
here and I uh I see that this is a crowd

406
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:44,319
that is experimenting a lot conversation

407
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:46,480
we had and J and some of the the

408
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:48,439
discussion that happened today all come

409
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,759
forc me to see that this is this is this

410
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:55,240
is a great crowd for for for this topic

411
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:59,000
here um yeah so my background is PR and

412
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:01,960
agriculture um I've studied it over the

413
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,200
last maybe 20 years and and over those

414
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:07,840
those years I mean we developed ways to

415
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,759
capture the data organize the data and

416
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:13,798
look at uh and ways to interpret it to

417
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:17,200
to learn from the spatial variability

418
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:19,079
and all those layers of data and um

419
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,480
working with with

420
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:25,079
Farmers uh I kind of bought into the

421
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:27,400
idea of wondering what happen What would

422
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:32,599
happen if we put the the farmers

423
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:35,000
themselves in the driver seat and um use

424
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:37,158
all that technology to the service of

425
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,640
their own experimentation without

426
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:42,640
telling them what to do how to do and

427
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,880
what topic to experiment but just like

428
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,840
providing that that service and here in

429
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,919
this presentation that's what I will

430
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:51,558
explain try to to to show you what what

431
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:53,679
we are trying to do okay I want to start

432
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:56,158
here with a quote from the book The

433
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,880
Fifth Discipline from Peter and J it's a

434
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:00,640
little bit of a long text but from a

435
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,320
very young age we are taught to break

436
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,960
apart problems to fragment the world

437
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:08,000
this apparently makes complex tasks and

438
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:12,000
subjects more manageable but we pay an

439
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,759
enormous price um the idea here is that

440
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
if I have a research topic that I take

441
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:19,000
and I I isolate that very thing after

442
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,798
that when I try to put it together in

443
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,798
the big picture it's like trying to put

444
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:25,798
together a broken mirror it's never

445
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:29,519
going to look exactly like like the

446
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:32,879
entire thing see U so the idea here is

447
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:36,038
to try to see could we bring everything

448
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,480
together into a learning or organization

449
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:41,558
and another little piece here before I

450
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:45,038
start about the farmers that IAB is uh

451
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:49,879
there's a push here uh it's at the

452
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:51,960
bottom here of the the qu um sever 70

453
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,280
organizations are calling for Food

454
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,400
Systems approach so basically again

455
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,639
trying to sit down isolate thing but try

456
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:04,720
to see what happens if you think of it

457
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:06,880
as a system and uh going after or or

458
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,279
working directly with Farmers think

459
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,120
about it when you experiment something

460
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:13,200
it's something that will lead towards

461
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,879
the vision that you have for your farm

462
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,360
or something that makes sense this year

463
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:21,520
with your equipment the resources that

464
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:24,479
you have your soils so basically what

465
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:27,599
you try is an integration of all your

466
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:31,360
system rather than if I arrive comp my

467
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:34,000
life try to sell it to you then it's

468
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:36,639
there's just one chance out of many CH

469
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,000
that that it will fit in your operation

470
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:44,360
okay when we start thinking system in

471
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,798
Agronomy uh what I'm trying to do here

472
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:49,959
is to merge several disciplines okay the

473
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:51,599
first is obviously Agronomy because

474
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,759
we're looking for consistent

475
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,719
interpretation we need to understand how

476
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:59,359
things work to to know what we are

477
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,919
observing and understand it

478
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:04,678
but there is now data science that we

479
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,880
can use because everything that happens

480
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:10,120
generates a lot of data and if we are

481
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,600
able to capture that data now in our

482
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:14,798
conversation and exchange when we

483
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:16,959
discuss we have that data to increase a

484
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:20,200
certainty of of the conversation the

485
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:23,880
outcomes and what we observe and then

486
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,798
after that there is social science um

487
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,039
the idea here is to make sure that we

488
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:31,639
have an effective effective process

489
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:34,400
because if uh if we're not considering

490
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:38,480
the system as a whole considering the

491
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:41,120
humans that we are all uh the process

492
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,159
can be disconnected from reality okay

493
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:46,759
and at the center of this is on Farm

494
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,799
experimentation which is the the topic

495
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:53,000
that I'm working on in the in the

496
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:55,918
farmers that okay so why we decided to

497
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,240
focus on on Farm experimentation systems

498
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:02,278
approach it's real world we're working

499
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,558
with that from The Real World and we're

500
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:07,000
asking Farmers to change towards

501
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:09,440
sustainable agriculture well this is how

502
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,240
change happen you experiment with things

503
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,480
here and there and slowly you you uh you

504
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,640
progress towards your

505
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,558
vision okay so to support on Farm

506
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,038
experimentation what we are trying to do

507
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:24,319
is to say okay let's bring expertise

508
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:28,038
skills okay so we have students in the

509
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:29,240
lab that have skills and time to work on

510
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:31,158
the data

511
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,919
then we work with agronomist to be able

512
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:37,039
to uh to reach you where you are on the

513
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,960
ter on on the territory and then we have

514
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:44,359
researchers for in for instance last

515
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:47,480
year we did a project on Biologicals I'm

516
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:50,079
not a so microb biologist but at Cornell

517
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:53,558
I have access to all the best scientists

518
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:55,720
so I connected with so microbiologist

519
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:57,678
and you taught us like how to collect

520
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,000
the data how to transport it how to

521
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,840
process it and then when we get the

522
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,079
numbers how to interpret it you see

523
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:07,158
so this is a process that that is expert

524
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:09,759
enable so we have access to those

525
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:11,799
experts then after that I was talking

526
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:14,558
about prision we have all those tools

527
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:17,400
now we have uh tools on the web that

528
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:19,319
allows us to communicate easier then we

529
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,038
have a little bit of funding coming from

530
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:23,200
projects here and there that we can put

531
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:26,200
to the service of your experimentations

532
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,000
for instance we have a bunch of biomass

533
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:32,038
samples soil samples and then we have

534
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,519
equipment so we have a drone we have uh

535
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:36,440
things that we can provide and just fly

536
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:39,158
your field and learn more from the

537
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:42,200
experimentation that you are doing with

538
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:44,039
this we are hoping that it will help you

539
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,840
get validation so when you're trying

540
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:47,119
something you want to see if it works

541
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,678
then it will kind of increase a

542
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:52,158
certainty of your

543
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:55,120
experimentation also if we all work

544
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:57,399
together and we lift that data then we

545
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:59,759
can start learning from each other and

546
00:24:57,398 --> 00:25:02,479
something that works on a farm that may

547
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:04,440
not have spread as fast now all of a

548
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,159
sudden we can share those Innovation and

549
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,278
find things that are

550
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,720
happening in the real world and not

551
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:14,759
necessarily just in in lasts basically

552
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:17,360
here what I'm trying to say is that I as

553
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:20,440
scientists we don't have the Monopoly of

554
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:22,759
innovation see so I'm very good at

555
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,360
quantifying stuff but I'm not better

556
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:27,798
than you to invent something new BBE

557
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:30,319
then after that we're hoping that this

558
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:34,278
way we can accelerate change because if

559
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:36,519
we capture and we uh increase the

560
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:39,119
learning potential of everything that

561
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:41,398
you're doing on your farm then we learn

562
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:45,398
faster so then we progress faster

563
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:49,639
B and then uh the idea here is to try to

564
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:52,479
say can we scale the speed and the

565
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,799
learning process rather than finding a

566
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,240
solution and try to scale that solution

567
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:59,440
see so what we are after is really the

568
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:02,399
way you learn and the way you uh you

569
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,840
progress towards your vision okay so in

570
00:26:02,398 --> 00:26:07,599
the next few slides I was I will show

571
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:10,798
you how what we were doing to to go

572
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:14,278
towards like building that farmers that

573
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:17,000
okay the first thing we did is just get

574
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:20,278
our f w we just went and selected the

575
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,359
topic um that a lot of farmers were

576
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:24,919
experimenting with and then we just went

577
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:30,199
with it and work with with Farmers so in

578
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:33,038
this campaign here we covered 24

579
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:36,038
um so we were trying to do two things

580
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:38,679
okay the first thing was are we able to

581
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:41,720
get a conclusion for each site and each

582
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:43,399
year okay if as a scientist this is I've

583
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,200
never been after something like that

584
00:26:43,398 --> 00:26:47,359
what I would do is that I would repeat

585
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,080
it in two three sites over two three

586
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:53,158
years and then get the conclusions but

587
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:55,480
here if I want to create value for the

588
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:57,840
farmers I don't want to ask you to

589
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,880
repeat whatever you do for three years I

590
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:03,278
want to be able to uh come to some

591
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,399
interpretation within one year because I

592
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:07,759
know that you guys how you work is that

593
00:27:05,398 --> 00:27:10,319
whatever you learn this year you use it

594
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:12,480
to iterate for the following year and

595
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,079
you iterate like this until it works and

596
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,000
not necessarily repeating the same thing

597
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:18,798
over time okay so there's a there's a

598
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,240
little bit of adaptation from my side to

599
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:21,960
be able to to meet you with your meet

600
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,038
your

601
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,640
expectations okay so that's the first

602
00:27:24,038 --> 00:27:29,038
thing we're trying to do to try to

603
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:32,120
conclude in one year okay so uh to do

604
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:35,720
this we consult with Farmers with people

605
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:39,599
in the network and with experts to uh to

606
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:41,759
identify um to better learn the process

607
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:44,918
of what we are doing because if we are

608
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:47,240
not using a replicated control trial

609
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:49,038
like we would do on a research Farm then

610
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:52,599
we need to rely on something else to

611
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:55,759
increase a certainty and what this is is

612
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:59,000
a agronomic logic we can call it this

613
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:02,440
way so the idea here is to say if I do

614
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,359
this I expect to have more yeld so now

615
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,759
we need to kind of backtrack and think

616
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:11,199
okay what would make this generate more

617
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:14,480
y so in this project here we that our

618
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,558
told was on biological so we said okay

619
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,519
you put those bacteries in the

620
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:21,720
soil then there will be something in

621
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:24,038
between before you you see more you

622
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:27,679
first will it survive so we went and

623
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:30,398
collected samples to see if um the

624
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,320
organiz organisms lived in the soil it

625
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:33,959
didn't live that means that it was

626
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,398
obviously not doing anything so if it

627
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:39,759
lives okay good first step we pass the

628
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:43,439
first step then we went and measured the

629
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:44,919
change the nitrogen status of the plant

630
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,159
and if there we didn't see any

631
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:49,000
difference like maybe it didn't do much

632
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:51,320
if it did then after that it's worth

633
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,759
looking at yes then it translated into

634
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:57,359
yield so now you see instead of relying

635
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:58,720
on an experimental design to draw our

636
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:01,519
conclusions

637
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,480
we do a little bit of a more detective

638
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:06,399
approach trying to put the the piece of

639
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,440
the puzzle together until we get a

640
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:11,558
conclusion okay um so this is the first

641
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,440
thing the other thing and I'm not going

642
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:18,119
into this but when we are working as a

643
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,360
network and we get data from all those

644
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:22,959
Farms all of a sudden we can start

645
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:27,278
seeing patterns and things so for

646
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:30,840
instance here uh my student did a an

647
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:33,640
analysis use using AI that allows to

648
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:36,398
identify Farms where it worked Farm

649
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,480
where it didn't work and now you look at

650
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:40,879
all those data that we collected for

651
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,919
each farm and then see what was the

652
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,360
driver to for the Farms where it worked

653
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:47,120
or didn't work you see so now we start

654
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:50,158
quickly understanding what are the

655
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:52,479
drivers and that allows to inform for

656
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,200
following iteration of your

657
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,679
experimentation maybe what could the

658
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,399
what are the success factors or the the

659
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:04,399
factor that could decrease your chances

660
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:07,439
okay okay then after that um we're

661
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:09,199
working on tools to make it easier EX

662
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,600
for the first iteration everything was

663
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,440
on paper and that was a mess that we had

664
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:14,918
to go back and forth trying to

665
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,798
understand and when we started talking

666
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:21,000
about rotations and trying to record all

667
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:22,558
the rotations for all those 24 sides

668
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,079
that was really a mess so now we are

669
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:27,798
trying to build tools that will make the

670
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:30,278
exchange a little bit easier okay so

671
00:30:27,798 --> 00:30:33,079
here this is an experiment card and that

672
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:36,159
kind of takes you towards a path of

673
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:38,798
thinking your your experimental like a

674
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:41,120
scientific process so we believe that

675
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:43,879
this would be your hypothesis then to

676
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:45,639
verify that we will that will be like

677
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,640
what will you do in your field right

678
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:51,120
side by side and I will change the

679
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:54,000
nitrogen rate or I will put a biological

680
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:56,278
I will do this I do that then after that

681
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,440
and measure what will you measure what

682
00:30:56,278 --> 00:31:02,119
will be the metric that you use to

683
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:05,600
interpret your your result and then we

684
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:08,199
are right if that's for you to start

685
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:10,359
thinking when I get those numbers how

686
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,240
will I interpret it to see it worked or

687
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:14,759
it didn't work and that will kind of

688
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,798
help you draw conclusions on your your

689
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:19,638
experiment but once we have access to

690
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:23,079
this so we have an online form that you

691
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:24,918
can f once we see this then that's kind

692
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:27,439
of the start of the conversation now we

693
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:30,440
can ask you will you need biomass sample

694
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:34,759
s so sample will you need to have a

695
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:36,639
contract uh applicator contract deal

696
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:39,440
mapping and things like that okay so so

697
00:31:36,638 --> 00:31:42,798
that then we can engage after that we're

698
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:46,200
working on different web tool to uh to

699
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:49,038
find ways to to when we have all that

700
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,759
information to allow you to have access

701
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:53,839
to your data as well and to uh to

702
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:56,359
interact with your experimentation a

703
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:58,240
little bit more easier than if it's on

704
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:00,199
several different places this just

705
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,880
bringing everything

706
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,679
together um okay then we are working on

707
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:09,360
a survey so some of you may see this

708
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,759
it's going on right now um trying to see

709
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:12,879
what is the state of un Farm

710
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:15,519
experimentation there is one survey that

711
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,840
exists that was run in Australia on this

712
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,558
and 90% of farmers are experimenting and

713
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:22,240
actually I would think that it would

714
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:24,678
should be about the same

715
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,200
here then after that we're developing

716
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:30,720
the farmers that so they uh the the

717
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,240
website I me so here we are just

718
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,798
bringing all resources have a little bit

719
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:39,079
of material for you to learn but also to

720
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:41,480
to engage with us and that's becomes

721
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:45,158
like a platform where we can

722
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:49,120
communicate and uh I am also working on

723
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:52,639
the global unarm experimentation network

724
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:56,199
uh because there's Community around the

725
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:59,079
world in Australia UK South America

726
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:02,159
friends that are engaged in this process

727
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:04,638
and working on developing it and uh and

728
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,559
we're creating like a network of who is

729
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:08,038
who is doing what where to learn from

730
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:10,798
each other

731
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:13,599
basically okay the last slide here is

732
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:16,440
just to inform you that we have a new

733
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:18,879
project that is funded by the New York

734
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:22,399
corn and soybean Association grow

735
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:26,559
Association this means for adjusting

736
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:28,479
nitrogen rates in corn after cover crops

737
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:31,240
so if you are experiment thing with

738
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:35,038
nitrogen rates and corn after a covered

739
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:37,880
crop that qualifies you to to to work

740
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:40,079
with us on this one and basically we we

741
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:42,760
got some funding and we make all that

742
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:45,558
funding available for just to support

743
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:48,000
your your experimentation in terms of we

744
00:33:45,558 --> 00:33:50,278
will visit your field collect samples

745
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,798
process samples and organize all that so

746
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:56,000
uh that's what I had and I just wanted

747
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:58,000
to uh to show to to talk to you about

748
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,720
the farmers that all we have a boot that

749
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,599
back there if you want to grab a card or

750
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,600
discuss it later thank you very

751
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:12,320
much this has been a production of

752
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:15,320
Cornell University on the web at

753
