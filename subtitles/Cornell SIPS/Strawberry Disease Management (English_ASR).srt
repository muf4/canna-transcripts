1
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:10,800
it's after

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,839
1 this um session is being recorded so

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,600
that people can um access this later

4
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:18,960
from the Cornell Berry

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,800
website and now we'll move into the meat

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,439
of our program and this is where I want

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:28,199
to make another um explanation I have to

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,560
apologize to Dr Mike Ellis who is our

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,039
guest um from the Ohio State

10
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:36,238
University he is a professor and

11
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:39,479
extension State specialist um in uh

12
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:42,718
Plant Pathology diseases of fruit crops

13
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:45,640
and he um agreed to do this months ago

14
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:49,239
and for some reason next to his uh topic

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,359
I wrote down fruit rots and in uh excuse

16
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:53,519
me root rots instead of fruit rots but

17
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,719
he will be talking about fruit rots

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,359
today which according to the feedback

19
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:58,960
that we got is actually a really good

20
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,519
thing because that is a problem for most

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,118
of you now at this point I'm going to

22
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:08,158
turn it over to Dr Ellis and Mike you

23
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:09,560
can turn your microphone on and um I'm

24
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,680
going to let you take it from here I'll

25
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:16,519
turn mine off okay can uh can you hear

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,080
me yes we can hear you

27
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:21,959
beautifully okay well I've um hello

28
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:24,359
everybody um um this is uh quite an

29
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,759
experience being on this webinar it's

30
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:28,319
the first one I've ever done and uh I'm

31
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,040
glad it's working out I know Laura's

32
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,679
worked real hard on it um my

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,720
presentation I've been working on it I

34
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,439
hope I keep it right at about 30 minutes

35
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,359
so I'm going to have to get going I hope

36
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:41,438
I don't go too fast but uh there's a lot

37
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,118
of things I'd like to share with you I

38
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:44,798
would like to emphasize I see quite a

39
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,519
few people on here that are

40
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,320
professionals uh Educators and the

41
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,199
Talk's really designed primarily for

42
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:54,478
Growers but uh hopefully you'll find it

43
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,680
interesting uh again that's Mike Ellis

44
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,158
I'm Ohio State University I've been here

45
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,719
about 30 years so I've I've been working

46
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,840
with mberry fruit rots for quite some

47
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:10,878
time uh how do I start the

48
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:14,680
PowerPoint um Mike just you can uh

49
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:16,439
just hit the little arrow at the bottom

50
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,040
and we can

51
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:21,878
um okay I've got it all right might want

52
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,919
to get rid of there we go

53
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:26,039
okay okay

54
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:28,559
yep all right let's hope we don't have

55
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:30,280
any more technical difficulties at any

56
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,640
rate it's a pleasure to be here me get

57
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,878
going first of all when I talk about any

58
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,839
type of disease management I try to

59
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,039
emphasize uh the importance of

60
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,840
developing integrated Management

61
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:43,439
Programs uh for uh diseases or whatever

62
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,598
you're working with and uh I'm going to

63
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,199
be talking about strawberry fruit rots

64
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,000
here today for me uh the major

65
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:52,719
components of an integrated program are

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,878
disease resistance cultural practices

67
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,878
biological control if you have it

68
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,439
minimal fungicide use whenever I talk

69
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,479
about fungicide use I like the word use

70
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,359
the word minimal and the knowledge of

71
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:06,079
disease biology uh for me this knowledge

72
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,680
of disease biology is something that a

73
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,239
lot of people really

74
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,319
Overlook and uh I want to take the first

75
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,519
part of my presentation today to try to

76
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:17,079
emphasize the importance of

77
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,200
understanding diseases or at least

78
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,080
having a basic understanding of them in

79
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,439
order to be able to control them

80
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,959
effectively um the knowledge is critical

81
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:28,239
to development of uh disease management

82
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,080
strategies and I always say this to our

83
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,878
Growers I say how can you affect ly

84
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,360
manage a plant disease or actually

85
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:36,798
anything without some knowledge about it

86
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,080
you know basic knowledge on ecology or

87
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,719
epidemiology the more you know about

88
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,519
what you're trying to control the better

89
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,919
off you're going to be in terms of

90
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:46,920
controlling it and one thing I try to

91
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:48,919
emphasize wherever I speak to Growers is

92
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:50,759
they need to find out what resources are

93
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:53,199
available that have this information now

94
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:54,919
Most states have excellent information I

95
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,679
know throughout the Northeast there is

96
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:58,759
in the midwest we have a series of

97
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,799
Publications this is the Midwest small

98
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:02,518
fruit Pest Management handbook it

99
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,079
contains all the information I'm going

100
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,799
to be presenting on fruit rots here

101
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:09,000
today we also have a Midwest strawberry

102
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,920
production guide it has all this

103
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,039
information in it I'm not trying to sell

104
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:15,238
these I'm just trying to emphasize the

105
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,680
importance of Growers knowing what

106
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,798
resources are out there and and getting

107
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,079
them and uh looking at them learning

108
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,918
from them so let's talk a little bit

109
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,720
about the epidemiology and control of

110
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,719
strawberry fruit rots and here I'm going

111
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,880
to try to go through the three major

112
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,759
fruit rots and emphasize some some

113
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,478
things that we've learned that help us

114
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,520
uh understand them better and hopefully

115
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:36,879
control them better our three major

116
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,478
fruit rots are

117
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:42,439
betrus leather rot and

118
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:44,279
anthros I'll start with betrus uh fruit

119
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,360
rot or grey mold this is a typical

120
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:48,719
symptom on a ripe fruit it looks like a

121
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,080
a dead mouse anybody that's raised

122
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,120
raspberries or or strawberries is

123
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:55,560
familiar with petritis it's probably the

124
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,240
most common uh fruit rot disease and

125
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,319
it's probably responsible for most of

126
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,478
the fungicides worldwide that are

127
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:03,000
applied the

128
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:06,000
strawberries um again this is symptoms

129
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,120
in the field now when I first started

130
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,120
about 30 years ago uh growers in the

131
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,639
Midwest and the East used to spray

132
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,840
fungicides for Bettis to control it from

133
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,519
early spring pre-bloom through Harvest

134
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,119
this could result in four to six

135
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,120
applications of fungicide or more and

136
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,879
this is what was perceived was the need

137
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,280
in order to control this

138
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:28,719
disease um I got to remember where to

139
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:30,638
click here I just want to go over some

140
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,840
studies that uh were conducted you know

141
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,840
many years ago actually but have really

142
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:36,198
let us develop a good understanding of

143
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:38,758
this disease and I think it really

144
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:40,879
allows us to control it better first of

145
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,520
all we used to think that metritis was

146
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:45,478
everywhere it came in from outside the

147
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:48,359
planting and it was just umcu everywhere

148
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:51,000
actually we've learned that uh the the

149
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,038
fungus actually forms latent infections

150
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,478
during late summer and fall and

151
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,918
apparently healthy leaves uh you can

152
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:58,758
have a planting out there looks

153
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:01,079
absolutely beautiful perfectly healthy

154
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,520
but it can be in infected with petritis

155
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:04,120
some of the leaves in this planting

156
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,439
right here are infected and if you clear

157
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,598
them you can actually see the mycelium

158
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:12,719
of Bettis within the leaves well uh you

159
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:15,240
go into the fall the plants go dormant

160
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,199
you cover up with spring and obviously

161
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:22,360
this is perennial matted row um but

162
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,080
underneath that straw that uh fungus uh

163
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,598
the leaves die uh uh the fungus becomes

164
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:30,079
sapric active and if you go out there in

165
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:31,759
the spring and uh dig out of the leaf

166
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,198
litter this is a student of mine that

167
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:38,038
was actually studying sporulation uh

168
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:39,598
several years ago um and you put it you

169
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:41,279
get down there and look you can actually

170
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:46,759
see petritis

171
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:48,719
sporulating um uh on the surface um I

172
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,479
don't know how to I I forgot how to use

173
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,160
the mouse on this thing Mike I think

174
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:56,918
right you got yeah I've got it right

175
00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:00,479
here there you can actually see um the

176
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:03,120
uh fungus expor relating uh this is just

177
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:06,399
a closeup of some uh uh additional

178
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,840
litter um trying to get the handle on

179
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:12,159
the mouse here anyway the point we're

180
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:15,279
trying to make is virtually uh 99% of

181
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,319
all the uh um inoculum that comes from

182
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:20,279
betrus in your in your planning comes

183
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:22,598
out of that Row in the litter uh early

184
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,638
in the spring but what's most important

185
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:28,519
that we've learned is the fact that

186
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:31,598
virtually all probably 90% or more of

187
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:33,519
the uh infect that occur from Bettis

188
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:37,120
occur during Bloom now this is a

189
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:39,839
extremely important Point um and it was

190
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,879
uh um um really emphasizes the

191
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,839
importance of uh having some knowledge

192
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:47,280
and this is a flower the fungus

193
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:51,439
colonizes uh old flower parts ccent

194
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:53,598
parts it actually moves down into the um

195
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:55,918
uh receptacle of the fruit where it

196
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:58,439
develops a latent infection it sits

197
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:02,038
there because the tissue on green fruit

198
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:05,199
is not susceptible uh to rot um this is

199
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:08,199
from some work that we were doing uh um

200
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,360
on um infection of the fruit and

201
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:13,240
actually this Center uh Berry right here

202
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,680
has a latent infection in it so it sits

203
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,079
there you're looking at your field you

204
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,079
got green fruit everything looks great

205
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:22,240
and then as the fruit starts to mature

206
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,318
the fungus the fruit physiology changes

207
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,158
the fungus becomes active and it causes

208
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,039
a rot you can see here that the rot

209
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:31,279
really developed around the Kix end of

210
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:33,879
the of the fruit or the flow and this is

211
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,759
when the symptoms of Bettis show up and

212
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:38,120
this is what you see in the field in the

213
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,319
past people would see this they would

214
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,399
start spraying obviously if the

215
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,039
infection occurred during Bloom any

216
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,919
sprays that you're putting on out here

217
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:51,559
now or a waste of money and th and uh um

218
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:54,919
very inefficient use of uh of fungicide

219
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:57,759
at any rate uh so this I hope this is

220
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:59,679
probably about the best uh definition of

221
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,679
of understanding the disease and how

222
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:04,000
it's helped us to control it so we know

223
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,639
for control of betrus uh applications of

224
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,480
fungicide during Bloom are absolutely

225
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:11,480
critical

226
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,399
um and uh actually as far as the success

227
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,800
story I would say in Ohio now instead of

228
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,200
four to six applications per year for

229
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,120
Bettis Growers just targeting um

230
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,879
applications during Bloom and matted

231
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,480
Rose systems probably SP spray twice

232
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:29,720
maybe at the most three times so we're

233
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,159
looking at at least a 50% uh redu and

234
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,920
fungicide use now anthros fruit Rod of

235
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:40,399
strawberry um anthracnose is an

236
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:42,479
extremely devastating disease um and um

237
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,240
it's it's very interesting and difficult

238
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,920
to work with this is the symptom on

239
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,159
fruit uh this is on a plastic culture

240
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:51,719
Berry Chandler with several lesions on

241
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:54,919
it uh these lesions are actually covered

242
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,920
with Spore masses this uh fungus is

243
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:59,519
Splash dispersed so when a raindrop hits

244
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:02,000
that leion it just blows uh spores all

245
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,000
over uh surrounding fruit so it can

246
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,919
spread very rapidly in the

247
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,559
field in the past anthros was thought of

248
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:10,278
a warm weather or Southern disease of

249
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,439
strawberry it was not considered a

250
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:15,679
problem in Northern production areas

251
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:18,560
when I first got here again 30 years ago

252
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:21,519
we never heard of anthros anthros fruit

253
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:24,119
rot caused by katum was epidemic for the

254
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,320
first time in Ohio in

255
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,759
1991 uh economic damage was uh not

256
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:34,640
observed prior to this date as far as I

257
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:38,000
know um anthros again it likes hot wet

258
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:41,319
weather in 1991 we had 80° temperatures

259
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,919
85 to 90 uh throughout the Midwest and

260
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,320
Northeast from the beginning of Bloom

261
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:48,199
through Harvest with plenty of rain

262
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,320
therefore this anthros uh epidemic

263
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,680
developed uh and it occurred across the

264
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,560
entire Midwest and Northeast this is a

265
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:58,838
planting of late grow strawberries that

266
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,319
uh um um it's in its second year of

267
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,639
production this is on a farm near

268
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,760
Worcester where I've done a lot of

269
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:07,600
research and this is about 2 Acres out

270
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:09,278
of 10 acres and actually uh this is the

271
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,879
second year the first year of production

272
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:15,559
it was beautiful production uh no fruit

273
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:17,159
rots this year is 1991 the hot year

274
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:18,719
grower called me up and said hey we got

275
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:21,199
a problem we're seeing spots on the

276
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,120
fruit I went out and looked and within a

277
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,000
week 85% of the fruit and that 2 acre

278
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,360
planting look like this it's infected

279
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,559
with anthros extremely devastating this

280
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,639
was one of the most devastating losses

281
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:36,239
uh that I'd really ever experienced uh

282
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:39,360
in a strawberry planting at any rate uh

283
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,480
anthros once it shows up it is uh an

284
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,720
absolute

285
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,879
nightmare our big question was where did

286
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,399
it come from this grower that uh uh

287
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:49,200
where this Lake glow planting was uh

288
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,639
been growing strawberries for over 40

289
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,120
years and this was the first time we'd

290
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,639
ever seen it so our big questions are

291
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,440
where did it come from and how was it

292
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,560
introduced into the planning well we

293
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,680
know that anthros is introduced into the

294
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:03,799
field on Infected

295
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:05,799
transplants um some beautiful work by U

296
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:08,639
Mark Gleason at Ohio State and his

297
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:12,078
students this Leaf right here uh is a

298
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,399
perfectly normal healthy Leaf but uh

299
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:16,879
when you look at it microscopically uh

300
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,320
this is a piece of melium of colotto

301
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,278
acutum actually growing on the surface

302
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,399
of this healthy leaf and producing a

303
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:26,320
canidia these canidia are infective

304
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,679
here's another shot of some melium on

305
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,959
the surface of the leaf and canidia so

306
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:36,078
um this fungus can move around very very

307
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:38,518
effective effectively on healthy looking

308
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,679
Nursery stock so you don't know if you

309
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:43,480
have it there's no indexing program for

310
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:45,319
it um so we know that it moves around

311
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,399
and it's just a kind of a pig in the

312
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,839
Poke uh if you're lucky you don't have

313
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,958
you got clean plants and if you're

314
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:54,519
unlucky you have uh um uh the potential

315
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:57,919
for anthracnose epidemic in your in your

316
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:59,480
uh in your planning so uh and we don't

317
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:02,879
know if you don't know if you have till

318
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,440
it shows up so what uh I've been telling

319
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,399
Growers and trying to work with them is

320
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,240
in growing Seasons where you experience

321
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,480
hot weather uh through Bloom and harvest

322
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,399
hot wet weather you should consider

323
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,199
having fungicides in your program for

324
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:17,879
anthracnose

325
00:13:15,198 --> 00:13:19,799
control in relation to plastic culture

326
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:23,480
which is growing uh in popularity

327
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:25,759
rapidly in Ohio and and in many areas

328
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,800
the use of a fungicide a good fungicide

329
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:29,958
program for control of anthros is

330
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:32,319
mandatory it's just the nature of this

331
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:34,599
uh production system and thros is a

332
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,440
Potential Threat all the time and you

333
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:40,040
need to have a good um funus side

334
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,680
program for anthracnose control and

335
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:46,039
plastic culture uh Mike could I just up

336
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:47,799
for a second did you did you see that um

337
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:50,240
question from gwy Smith about

338
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:52,919
everbearing and whether or not you can

339
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,360
control well because of the continuous

340
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:57,319
Bloom and and maybe you don't want to

341
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,720
answer any questions until the end of

342
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,320
your presentation I don't know

343
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,278
I think I think I better get through

344
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,519
this and answer them at the end but that

345
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:09,439
that that is an excellent question and

346
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:11,839
uh um I try to talk to that primarily in

347
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,800
my handout but uh let me go on through

348
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,680
okay that sounds great but people keep

349
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:17,399
um typing your questions as they come to

350
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,039
you and we can go back over them at the

351
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,839
end of the

352
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,399
presentation that that that is an

353
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,199
absolutely excellent question the

354
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,039
difference between perennial mted row

355
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,639
and plastic culture is is um you know

356
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:31,559
it's a whole different word

357
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:33,320
most of everything we've worked with and

358
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:36,799
and the bulk of our production is

359
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:39,320
perennial matted row but uh um um that

360
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,519
is a good point in terms of timing

361
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,040
fungicides but uh I'll try to talk to

362
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,159
that later I got this down pretty well

363
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:49,679
hopefully to about 30 minutes so I've

364
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:51,439
tried to uh hang with that and uh I

365
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:53,599
think we'll have about 15 minutes at the

366
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,519
end anyway I'd like to talk a little bit

367
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,000
about leather rod right now um leather

368
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:01,879
rod is a a very serious problem in Ohio

369
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,039
oh and uh in some states it's worse than

370
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:08,198
other states it's usually associated

371
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:10,399
with heavier soils and uh um um poor

372
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:13,000
drained soils but any rate this is a

373
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,480
typical symptom um leather rots

374
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,759
particularly problematic in that uh what

375
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:21,079
infected fruit have a terrible taste and

376
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,399
smell but the taste is just horrible and

377
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:25,278
often times people will see this uh

378
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,320
White area and think it's just under rpe

379
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:29,720
cut it off and go ahead and put the

380
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,639
strawberries on the short cake and uh go

381
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,639
ahead and eat it and it tastes terrible

382
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,839
so they know where they got the berries

383
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:37,799
and they're a little bit upset about it

384
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,920
also we found that one or two berries

385
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:43,039
and a gallon of uh of uh infect or a

386
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:45,919
gallon of fruit will throw the flavor

387
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:47,519
off of jams so leather rot is um it's

388
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:51,039
kind of The Producers nightmare if you

389
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,039
go even 1% of it in you're

390
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:59,480
planting Mike um we lost we lost your

391
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:01,639
audio just for a second so um I don't

392
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,079
know what happened but just uh maybe if

393
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:06,159
you want to repeat if you said anything

394
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:06,159
important we better hear it

395
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:09,198
again

396
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:15,359
it well I I don't I don't know what cut

397
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,639
out I hope everything's important but

398
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,120
anyway uh at this point I'm just going

399
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,318
to keep going I was talking about

400
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,318
leather rot uh I'll back up a little bit

401
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:27,159
on that but uh leather rot um um is a

402
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:29,399
kind of a nightmares producer and the

403
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:33,120
fact that it produces a very bad bad

404
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,879
taste and uh um sometimes the fruit

405
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,399
doesn't really look like it's rotted it

406
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:40,278
just maybe under wpe and people will use

407
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:42,559
those and uh it really results in some

408
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:45,198
serious uh customer relations when

409
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:48,439
people get bad taste in berries at any

410
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:50,719
rate um when we look at the disease U

411
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,399
this is an infected fruit in the

412
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,879
field this is uh uh in time these

413
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,360
infected fruit actually dry down and c

414
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:01,159
and develop into these things we call

415
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,000
mummies it's actually a combination of

416
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:05,838
the pathogen and the host it's a hard

417
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,599
dry object but inside of that thing is a

418
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:11,879
thick walled resting oospore of phyo

419
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,918
cactorum and this oospore can stay in

420
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,199
the soil for 30 years and I'll just bet

421
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,759
you any place where there's been

422
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,400
strawberry production uh these o spores

423
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:22,078
are present in the grounds but the key

424
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,880
thing about this o Spore is it's just

425
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,159
going to sit there until you have

426
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:30,080
saturated soil so the key to this

427
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:33,880
disease is saturated soil water water uh

428
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:35,960
saturated soil um once you get that for

429
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,240
a relatively short period of time uh

430
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,798
they germinate and form sporangia and

431
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,679
these spanga then uh develop uh what's

432
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:46,558
called zal spores little biflagellate uh

433
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,080
spores similar to a sperm cell that can

434
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,000
actually swim in the water in the soil

435
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:53,439
and in

436
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,440
puddles and uh therefore the key to

437
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,120
controlling leather rot is drainage

438
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,840
anytime I see standing water in a

439
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:03,839
strawberry field I cringe

440
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:06,199
um here's a uh fruit with phyo actually

441
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,959
sporulating on it you can bet that that

442
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,798
water is just uh full of Zo spores so

443
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,400
every time a a raindrop hits in there it

444
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:15,480
just splashes the healthy fruit and it's

445
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,280
off and running and you've got an

446
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,480
epidemic on your hand so understanding

447
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:22,558
the fact that saturated soil is

448
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,960
important for this disease should help

449
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,839
us to control it and for me the the

450
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,798
major control for leather rot our

451
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:32,000
cultural practices um

452
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:34,639
uh primarily uh sight selection good

453
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,359
soil drainage and the use of mulch now I

454
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,559
just went over those things that's kind

455
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:40,759
of uh like the first half of the talk I

456
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,079
just tried to show you some instances

457
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:45,679
where where understanding or that

458
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:47,359
demonstrate that when we understand more

459
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,679
about the diseases the better equipped

460
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,000
we're going to be to control them and I

461
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:52,840
think Bettis is probably the the real

462
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,599
classic example where we've really made

463
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:57,918
strides and in understanding the disease

464
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:01,399
and controlling it better but moving on

465
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,759
into an inte ated Management program

466
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,600
again I tried to emphasize the

467
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:07,798
importance of disease uh uh biology or a

468
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:10,719
knowledge of it disease resistance

469
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:13,879
cultural practices bio control uh and

470
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,000
minimal fungicide use disease resistance

471
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,520
you know it's a no-brainer it's the

472
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,159
first line of defense if you got

473
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,240
resistance you use it in my extension

474
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,000
programming in Ohio I say leaf spot

475
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,319
diseases you better be looking at

476
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,240
resistance for those or you're going to

477
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:29,960
be doing a lot of extra spraying um and

478
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,200
in the p past at least we've had some

479
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,079
excellent varieties with good leaf spot

480
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,240
resistance unfortunately we do not have

481
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:38,918
good resistance to the fruit rots there

482
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,720
is some potential for resistance and

483
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:45,200
then thros and some of the uh uh plastic

484
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:48,038
culture or or annual uh uh varieties but

485
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,519
it's really not out there yet so if we

486
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:53,119
don't have uh uh any resistance we're

487
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:55,279
completely dependent upon fungicide use

488
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:58,759
or uh cultural practices for the

489
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:01,359
controls so fungicides are very very

490
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:02,519
important for uh controlling uh fruit

491
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,399
rots on

492
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:06,038
strawberries fortunately we have an

493
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,559
excellent arsenal of fungicides for

494
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:10,720
controlling all the major fruit rot

495
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:14,319
diseases petritis leather rot and

496
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,558
anthros um I could give you a whole day

497
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:17,960
workshop on the use of fungicides I do

498
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:21,038
have a handout that's going to be

499
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:23,640
available to print off uh Lura should be

500
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:25,119
able to get it to you uh at any rate I

501
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,679
want to go through and mention a few

502
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:30,000
things but this is going to be pretty

503
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:32,080
brief for fungicides for tritis we just

504
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,919
um uh about 10 years ago we started

505
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:35,639
losing fungicides and I was concerned we

506
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,880
weren't going to have any but we have an

507
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:41,240
excellent Arsenal fungicides for uh

508
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:45,039
control of Bettis and all of these uh

509
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:49,679
these would be the um U the Cadillac

510
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:51,558
fungicides um over on this side uh um

511
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,280
all of them are excellent Topson I would

512
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:55,240
probably put at the bottom of the list

513
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,279
because uh it's been around so long

514
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,279
there's probably resistance but switch

515
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:02,038
Elevate pristine and SK

516
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,158
wonderful materials for Bettis I like to

517
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:06,720
use them combined with captan early in

518
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:10,520
the season the combination may help uh

519
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,278
with some fungicide uh uh resistance um

520
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:16,158
prevention also using captan with it

521
00:21:13,278 --> 00:21:18,519
early uh may help uh uh prevent some of

522
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,360
the buildup of anthracnose in the

523
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:24,679
planting um on those apparently healthy

524
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:26,240
looking leaves uh anthos fruit Trot let

525
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:28,038
me mention one other thing all of these

526
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,880
fungicides are in different classes of

527
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:32,119
chemistry so they can all be alternated

528
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,919
with each other in resistance management

529
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:37,479
schemes for anthros in the past we had

530
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,600
captan and thyrm not really very

531
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,440
effective cap Tan's not bad but you got

532
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,719
to spread awful lot of it if you've got

533
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,440
a problem with

534
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,079
anthros fairly recently the stroby urine

535
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,000
fungicides

536
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:52,960
abound

537
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,960
um trying to use my porner abound Cabrio

538
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,120
and pristine were introduced these are

539
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,038
really Cadillacs for anthracnose and

540
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:01,839
really gave us some effective tools

541
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:04,119
for controlling it switch is a fantastic

542
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:06,319
material for petritis but it also does a

543
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:08,719
good job against anthract those so

544
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:11,798
fortunately we do have some good uh

545
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:15,839
fungicides to help us uh in control of

546
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:18,558
enros leather rot um we actually have

547
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:20,158
quite a few in the past uh captan and

548
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:22,798
tham again were the only things that

549
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,120
were available not very effective but

550
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,879
Rim rill's been around a long time but

551
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:31,278
it's very effective for leather rot

552
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:36,159
control the phosphorus acid fungicides U

553
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:38,000
fosol uh agrias topaz profite and alet

554
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,520
are very effective for leather rot

555
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,599
control and the stroby urines again uh

556
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:45,879
remember these strobe urines these these

557
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:47,359
things are excellent uh fungicides to

558
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,320
help us with strawberry disease

559
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:54,199
management aoxy strobin abound pyac

560
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:55,759
strobin Cabrio and pristine pristine um

561
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,319
all of these are excellent for leather

562
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:01,200
rot as

563
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:02,678
well um um again I have some suggested

564
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,720
guidelines they should be you should be

565
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:07,200
able to print them out uh uh at the end

566
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,519
of this presentation if not contact me

567
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,759
and I'll be happy to get get them to you

568
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:14,679
but uh I've tried to to outline

569
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:16,640
everything all my uh best

570
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:20,919
recommendations for using fungicides for

571
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:23,360
controlling strawberry fruit RS yes Mike

572
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:27,038
hello thank you so much um that was very

573
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:28,558
good and I um I just want to let people

574
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,798
know that when we mooved to the very

575
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,960
final portion of this program we will be

576
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:36,519
able to download your handout which is

577
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:39,600
very comprehensive so I I'll Point

578
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:41,839
directly to that to folks and we do have

579
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:46,359
a couple of extra minutes so if people

580
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:49,000
would like to ask um Dr Ellis a question

581
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:52,000
this is the this would be a good

582
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,558
time so other than that one question

583
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:59,319
from gwin Smith about uh

584
00:23:55,558 --> 00:24:00,480
everbearing Disease Control well they're

585
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:02,678
probably thinking about it and we'll

586
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,319
have another opportunity at the end of

587
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:08,559
the program so that you can do that as

588
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:12,079
well um I just I wanted to check I I

589
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:14,879
don't see Scala listed in the New York

590
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,519
State guidelines um for use in New York

591
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,679
state yet so I just wanted to mention

592
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:23,480
that for New York State Growers um and

593
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:25,640
there's a couple people typing right now

594
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,319
so maybe they know better they probably

595
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:32,600
do um but what while we're getting that

596
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:34,599
answer let me change this and we'll

597
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:38,000
uh

598
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:41,798
okay okay um Kathy Henri is answering

599
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,599
that and scalla is um listed in the pmap

600
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:46,359
so it is labeled for strawberry grey

601
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:50,798
mold and Allan has a

602
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:53,879
question I had I had a couple of uh uh

603
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:56,720
just other real quick comments first of

604
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,159
all in relation to these uh Strobel urin

605
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,360
abound in Cabrio the the for anthract

606
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:06,679
those fruit

607
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:06,678
rot Mike we lost you for a second

608
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:12,918
andpress um Mike we're losing your audio

609
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:15,720
for some

610
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:17,559
reason and one last I I had some other

611
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:21,079
stuff

612
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:22,839
but okay keep going can you hear me now

613
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:25,839
yes we can hear you now I don't know why

614
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:30,398
it went can you hear me

615
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:33,319
yes yes we can well uh actually I had a

616
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:38,239
couple other points to make here okay

617
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:40,240
pristine pristine is an outstanding

618
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:46,558
material can you hear

619
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,558
me yeah you cut out a little bit M go

620
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:53,720
ahead all right all right

621
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:56,519
pristine uh is an outstanding material

622
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,919
for controlling strawberry fruit rots

623
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:02,278
It's a combination of Cabrio the Strobel

624
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:05,520
urine and boscul which is a Bettis and a

625
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:07,839
um um powdery mildew material but it is

626
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:09,639
the only one fungicide that provides

627
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,480
excellent control of all three of the

628
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,720
major fruit rods Bettis anthracnose and

629
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,360
leather rod it's good for Lea spots good

630
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,880
for powdery mildew and it'll give some

631
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:20,639
post Harvest control of Bettis I was

632
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,919
going to mention some things on cultural

633
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,840
practices but I guess I'll stop right

634
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:28,840
here all right we have one other

635
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:30,240
question um from shiaka County

636
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:32,079
they're talking about at what rate

637
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,038
should the chemical be applied and I

638
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:36,158
think all of that is in the guidelines

639
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:40,038
so you'll have to check that for

640
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:42,320
whatever state all all of that all of

641
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:44,679
that is in the guidelines one thing I

642
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:48,200
would like to um

643
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:50,480
emphasizes um especially when we're um

644
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,399
in plastic culture whenever I'm uh

645
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,519
making a spray for Bettis or anything

646
00:26:53,398 --> 00:26:58,439
I'd like to include captan into the

647
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:59,960
program early uh I think it's going to

648
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,558
help prevent some of the buildup of

649
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:05,000
anthracnose if anthracnose is an issue

650
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:07,639
so especially in plastic culture I'd

651
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,919
like to keep capan and the in virtually

652
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,799
about every spray up until the point you

653
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,080
have to worry about visible residues on

654
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:15,679
fruit once you start getting fruit

655
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:18,079
developed and you worry about visible

656
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,559
residues you have to back off on the

657
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:21,158
captan because you don't want those

658
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:23,440
visible residues and all these other

659
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:25,440
materials will not result in visible

660
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:29,000
residues all right great we have one

661
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:33,519
other question um Mike from and he's

662
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,519
wondering about bio controls for these

663
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,319
diseases uh bio controls you know I I

664
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,840
really wish that there were some things

665
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:43,558
out there that I could recommend for Bio

666
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:46,480
controls uh but quite frankly there are

667
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:47,879
not uh and I'm not prepared to recommend

668
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,480
them unless I know they're going to take

669
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,720
care of the of uh of the situation under

670
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,599
heavy disease pressure I know that there

671
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,519
are a few materials out there I've

672
00:27:54,599 --> 00:28:01,038
tested them but uh um um I just haven't

673
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:04,120
found anything that I've uh incorporated

674
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:07,480
into my uh um recommendation all right

675
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:10,398
great um and Sonia schloman has a um

676
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,558
great comment about getting pristine it

677
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:16,000
was a challenge this year for Growers so

678
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:19,519
buying ahe is a good idea and then Kathy

679
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,599
heidenrich has put the link to the um

680
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:24,120
label for some of this um the materials

681
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:26,158
that we're talking about so that would

682
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,959
be helpful thank you both for those

683
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,559
comments and thank you Dr Ellis for your

684
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,120
presentation I'm hoping you're going to

685
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:35,319
be still here because I anticipate that

686
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:38,079
we'll probably have some more

687
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:42,879
questions and um now we're going to

688
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:47,599
switch slightly um to uh Dr David Gori

689
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,600
and let me just try to um bring

690
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:54,839
up oh I think this is the wrong one hold

691
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:57,398
on this is the wrong one

692
00:28:54,839 --> 00:29:00,038
sorry that was a practice one that we

693
00:28:57,398 --> 00:29:00,038
had um

694
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:07,159
um here we go sorry about that Dr Gori

695
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:10,000
let me try to get your share screen on

696
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:11,720
um Dr Gori we're going to be looking at

697
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,200
his presentation right off of his

698
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,000
computer because he had a couple of

699
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,679
graphs that didn't come through so we

700
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,720
practiced this earlier and it worked

701
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:25,000
beautifully so let me see if we can find

702
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,798
that you know what I think I'm going to

703
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,720
bring up a brand new sharepod um David

704
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:33,240
and then you can just go right to your

705
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:38,558
computer

706
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,558
screen and I'll let you turn your

707
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:44,720
microphone yeah there we go

708
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,038
perfect and David you could just click

709
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:50,880
your microphone on when you're

710
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:54,879
ready I do it great um Dr Gori is a

711
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,960
plant pathologist with Cornell

712
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,039
University um working out of the

713
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,840
Agricultural experiment station in

714
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:04,558
Geneva and he has done a lot of work

715
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:07,038
with strawberry powdery mildew and um

716
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:10,558
we're very pleased to have him so uh

717
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,558
David I'll just turn this over to

718
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:17,640
you

719
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:21,839
um David if you want to toggle on your

720
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,840
speaker and Mike if you could toggle off

721
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,960
yours

722
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:43,000
David try that um toggle on toggle off a

723
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,399
couple times perhaps um maybe it'll do

724
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,398
it for

725
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,720
you we I'm not hearing you I don't know

726
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,720
if anybody else can hear

727
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:59,919
you

728
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:06,278
okay yeah maybe come down and toggle it

729
00:31:04,038 --> 00:31:08,599
on before you fill up your there you go

730
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:10,679
we're watching what you're doing perfect

731
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:15,079
how's that perfect thank

732
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:19,120
you okay now we're back okay uh

733
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:21,960
so do that and now we do that there you

734
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,839
go great great all right now can

735
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,919
everyone hear

736
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:29,558
me yes like

737
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:31,360
that you guys can put agree if you can

738
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:34,158
hear them it looks like they can hear

739
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:37,240
you terrific okay good and well then off

740
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,240
we go well good afternoon everyone uh as

741
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,638
you can see by the uh the number of

742
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,679
authors on the title slide uh I'm the

743
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:45,638
one that's talking today but this is uh

744
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,559
this is not really an individual effort

745
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:50,199
it it represents about three years of

746
00:31:47,558 --> 00:31:53,119
collaborative work uh between Cornell's

747
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:56,558
Department of Plant Pathology at Geneva

748
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:59,079
and some colleagues of ours uh in of all

749
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:03,240
places norways National agricultural

750
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:05,038
research center near Oslo now I come to

751
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,359
Strawberry powdery mildew from a

752
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:10,119
background of about 20 years of research

753
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:11,439
on a a closely related disease powdery

754
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:14,959
mildew of grape

755
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,000
vine what I find intriguing uh about

756
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,399
strawberry powdering Milo are there many

757
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,278
parallels uh between these two diseases

758
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:24,479
so in the next few minutes i' I'd like

759
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:26,159
to go over some things uh we know and

760
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,519
and and that we don't know about this

761
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,480
disease because we've only generated

762
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:34,759
new knowledge on the biology and Ecology

763
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:37,200
of the pathogen and we've also had to uh

764
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:40,079
unfortunately unlearn some long

765
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,080
established facts regarding strawberry

766
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:44,199
uh powdery mildew so let's get started

767
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:48,439
on

768
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:50,960
that well all living organisms are are

769
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,880
subject classification by a group of

770
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,000
scientists who who call themselves

771
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,600
taxonomist now taxonomists are the the

772
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,319
people who choose the names for these

773
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:02,359
path pathogens uh they're a lot like tax

774
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:04,480
attorneys in that they they tend to

775
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:06,839
create confusion and then they profit by

776
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,278
it and the name of the moment that

777
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:11,439
they've applied to the strawberry

778
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:14,919
powdery mildew is podospora

779
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,240
AIS uh but you will find that in uh in

780
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:19,440
many other Publications listed by many

781
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,240
other names it's it's all the same

782
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,960
pathogen there really is only one

783
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,679
powdery Milo on

784
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,558
strawberry uh and it goes by many names

785
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,519
so just keep that in mind it's all the

786
00:33:27,558 --> 00:33:30,678
same

787
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:33,278
pathogen uh with respect to powdery

788
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:35,159
milus in general I think we've been

789
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:37,359
lulled into a sense of

790
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:39,320
complacency uh about powdering milus in

791
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:42,158
general because for many years as as

792
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:44,240
Mike pointed out uh we've had a wealth

793
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:47,200
of very effective fungicides that limit

794
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:50,159
the amount of damage they can inflict uh

795
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,519
however powdery milus as a group are

796
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,080
historically among the most Troublesome

797
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:58,159
pathogens with respect to fungicide

798
00:33:55,079 --> 00:34:00,480
resistance in fact complete failures of

799
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,760
entire classes of our best modern

800
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,919
fungicides have now been reported for a

801
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:06,839
number of different powdery Milos on on

802
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,000
different

803
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:11,719
crops and it's it's quite possible that

804
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,079
we may see a similar pattern of

805
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:16,759
resistance uh eventually in Strawberry

806
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,919
so resistance management and the minimal

807
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:22,240
use of fungicides as they're needed is

808
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:24,078
is a very important factor to consider

809
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,918
when you're deploying fungicides against

810
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,599
this pathogen it has a very high

811
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:31,519
potential to develop resistance

812
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:34,240
uh when this resistance uh inevitably

813
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:36,519
occurs in some of these Fung uh

814
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,000
fungicides uh there may be very little

815
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:40,519
in the research pipeline that will

816
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
replace uh the fungicides that we have

817
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:45,679
today uh that should especially concern

818
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,440
us as we move towards production in

819
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,398
systems uh such as high tunnels where

820
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:54,679
powdery milu uh can develop much more

821
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:57,239
explosively than they do in Open

822
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:59,960
Fields so I've taken as the uh the

823
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:02,719
inspir for this talk uh one of my

824
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,480
favorite authors Mark Twain who observed

825
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:06,759
that it ain't what we don't know that's

826
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,880
the problem it's what we do know that

827
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:11,920
Ain't So and I've used that as the uh

828
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,599
the organizational organizational

829
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,400
structure of the talk we'll start with

830
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:19,680
what we thought we knew that is not

831
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,039
necessarily so and then we'll move on to

832
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:25,039
what we didn't know until quite recently

833
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:28,639
so let's get started on

834
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:31,159
that it would be reasonable to assume

835
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:34,199
that this pathogen like many powdery

836
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:36,118
Milos infects uh the meristematic

837
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:39,480
tissues deep within the crown of the

838
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:41,240
plant and survives winter there uh it's

839
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,240
easy enough to find this assumption

840
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:46,479
stated as a fact in in many sources on

841
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:49,159
this disease the trouble is that when

842
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,760
you try to find conclusive experimental

843
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:53,879
proof for this as a form of

844
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,000
overwintering uh in any of the previous

845
00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:00,039
research it it's just not there in fact

846
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,559
when we strip red dormant crowns of the

847
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:05,838
Milo infected leaves and then forced

848
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:08,960
them to regrow in confinement they

849
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:11,920
remained mildew free and significantly

850
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,159
when we did not remove those ccent but

851
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,920
persistent leaves a small but very

852
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:18,879
important percentage of the plants

853
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,280
developed Milo on the new leaves as they

854
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,039
emerged so the source of infection seems

855
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,359
to be those persistent leaves not uh

856
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:28,559
overwintering in the

857
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:30,799
crowns so so we can't prove that the

858
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:33,159
fungus never survives in the crown it's

859
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,680
it's very difficult to prove a negative

860
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:38,440
only that we can't detect it and neither

861
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:41,279
has anyone else to our knowledge however

862
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,200
these ccent persistent leaves appear to

863
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,000
be quite suitable for carrying the

864
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:48,318
pathogen through winter often uh very

865
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,239
well protected under layers of mulch or

866
00:36:48,318 --> 00:36:54,159
fleece and in places with uh with real

867
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:57,039
winter uh

868
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:59,279
snow and I'm going to return to those uh

869
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:01,639
persistent leaves in a minute but I want

870
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,400
to first move on to the next thing that

871
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:06,519
we thought we knew but recently had to

872
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,680
rethink and that's the role of these

873
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:11,559
small spherical uh Spore containing

874
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:14,440
structures here which you can see as I

875
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:16,519
move the cursor around uh those

876
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,480
structures form late in the season and

877
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:20,039
they're called cloth thesia they form in

878
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,519
the mildew

879
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:24,800
Colony uh these are cloth thesia forming

880
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:27,800
on the underside of a severely mildewed

881
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:30,640
Leaf uh because no one had ever

882
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:34,000
succeeded in infecting strawberry plants

883
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:36,480
with the spores contained in these kesia

884
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
they were routinely dismissed as a major

885
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,760
source of

886
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,960
infection now over the last 3 years uh

887
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,800
we've learned much more about these as

888
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:48,760
sources of primary infection we've

889
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,519
learned that like many powdery mildew

890
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,480
strawberry powdery mildew is composed of

891
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:55,838
two mating types essentially male and

892
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:58,679
female types that means that the

893
00:37:55,838 --> 00:38:01,400
populations are uh essentially

894
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:03,078
divided both of those have to be present

895
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,960
and then they have to be paired on the

896
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:08,720
same Leaf before those cloth thesia will

897
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:11,440
form consequently formation of cloth

898
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:14,559
thesia is uh is affected by disease

899
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,519
severity and by time there has to be

900
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:18,880
enough disease and for a long enough

901
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:21,800
period that the compatible mating types

902
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,358
become paired on that same Leaf

903
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:28,079
essentially they have to find each other

904
00:38:24,358 --> 00:38:29,960
once they do the kesia are initiated and

905
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,519
thereafter they take about four weeks

906
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,960
before they look

907
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:35,960
mature however they need a much longer

908
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,960
period before they become uh

909
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:41,199
physiologically mature and are able to

910
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:44,358
release those infectious spores in the

911
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:46,239
field that uh maturation process is

912
00:38:44,358 --> 00:38:48,679
delayed by the arrival of winter

913
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:51,479
temperatures but in Spring the St when

914
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:52,799
the strawberry plants resume development

915
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,159
so do the

916
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,039
kesia I'll have more to say in a minute

917
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:59,279
about which leaves are susceptible

918
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:01,480
but when susceptible leaves are

919
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,960
inoculated with spores from overwintered

920
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:06,920
kesia it it's really not difficult to

921
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:09,199
reproduce uh this disease so they are a

922
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:12,039
functional and often very abundant

923
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:14,960
source of primary

924
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:17,039
infection I had mentioned Leaf

925
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,760
susceptibility there are a number of

926
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:21,480
reports in the literature noting that

927
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,800
powdery M of strawberry is found

928
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,280
primarily on the lower surface of older

929
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,318
leaves and therefore the lower surface

930
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,440
must be more susceptible or the pathogen

931
00:39:28,318 --> 00:39:34,159
is very uh sensitive to solar radiation

932
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,079
now those are reasonable speculations

933
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:38,920
because they're easily supported by

934
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:41,240
observations in the field the disease is

935
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:45,240
indeed more common uh in commercial

936
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:48,239
plantings on the lower surface of older

937
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:50,598
leaves but in fact when we conducted

938
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:53,838
controlled uh

939
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:56,400
an ulations of strawberry leaves at

940
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:59,119
different stages of development we found

941
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,318
that first only the very youngest leaves

942
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,079
were highly

943
00:40:00,318 --> 00:40:04,800
susceptible uh secondly there's no

944
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:07,240
difference in the susceptibility of the

945
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,960
upper or lower surface of those leaves

946
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:12,679
and lastly the upper Leaf surface

947
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:16,079
escapes infection during the susceptible

948
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:19,279
stage because it's obscured by by Leaf

949
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,359
folding uh you can see how highly folded

950
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,680
uh these very young and very susceptible

951
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:27,759
leaves are um by the time that upper

952
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:30,078
surface is exposed the leaf has

953
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,839
essentially developed age related or

954
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,800
what we call antigenic resistance to

955
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:36,599
powdery mildew and that resistance that

956
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,119
that natural resistance of the older

957
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:41,760
leaves is quite suppress uh suppressive

958
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,760
towards new

959
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:46,800
infections so the end result is that the

960
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,440
disease is often confined to the lower

961
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,640
Leaf surface until quite late in the

962
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,800
season uh but the distribution of the

963
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:56,440
disease on the lower Leaf surface of

964
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,760
older leaves has more to do with the

965
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,679
opportunity

966
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,920
uh to infect a particular Leaf surface

967
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:03,838
during that narrow window of

968
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,358
susceptibility than it has to do with

969
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:06,358
any other

970
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,559
Factor now I said I would return to the

971
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:15,440
subject of uh the ccent but persistent

972
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:17,920
green leaves that often survive winter

973
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,240
uh strawberry is not a typical deciduous

974
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,119
perennial plant that sheds its leaves in

975
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:26,479
Autumn uh in powdery milders of many if

976
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,800
not most uh deciduous perennial plants

977
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,159
the kath

978
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,599
are readily dispersed by rain from

979
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:34,679
colonies on the leaves and then they

980
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:36,318
tend to attach to the bark of those

981
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:39,000
perennial plants where they survive

982
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:41,358
winter but the kesia on strawberry

983
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,480
leaves are very tightly bound to the

984
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:45,838
mildew colony and they're very resistant

985
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:49,599
to removal in fact they're quite well

986
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:52,799
embedded in a sort of A Rat's Nest of uh

987
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:55,440
these hyy these uh threadlike uh

988
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,318
structures of the fungus and that keeps

989
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,559
them uh very well attached to the leaf

990
00:41:57,318 --> 00:42:01,559
they've they've obviously learned over

991
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:04,159
uh several millions of years that these

992
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:06,880
leaves aren't going anywhere uh and and

993
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,879
so why should

994
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:12,799
they well if the kesia are one source of

995
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,838
primary inoculum and the colonies

996
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,359
overwintering on the senescent leaves

997
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:19,838
are the only other source what would

998
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:21,920
happen if we eliminated both and we've

999
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:24,519
just completed the uh the third year of

1000
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:28,119
field trials in uh both New York and

1001
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:29,960
Norway uh to try to answer that question

1002
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:31,920
without getting into too much detail we

1003
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,440
essentially established pathogen-free

1004
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,639
plantings from either seedlings or from

1005
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:39,720
tissue culture plants and then we left

1006
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:41,960
them unsprayed for powdery mildew now

1007
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:44,719
even though these were within 200 yards

1008
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:47,760
of severely diseased plantings and

1009
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:49,318
they're located in areas where uh both

1010
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,200
commercial strawberry production is

1011
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:54,838
present and there are numerous wild

1012
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:57,838
strawberry plants those plantings

1013
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:59,880
established from uh clean plants

1014
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:01,920
uh they started clean and they developed

1015
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,800
only traces of powdery Milo during year

1016
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,680
one even though they were never sprayed

1017
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:08,039
with fungicides and these were highly

1018
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:10,838
susceptible

1019
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:12,719
varieties while nothing lasts forever uh

1020
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:15,239
when the plants were left untreated for

1021
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:17,000
2 years uh the disease eventually

1022
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:20,519
increased to severe levels on the

1023
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,159
foliage and occasionally on the fruit

1024
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:24,358
but the experiments clearly show that

1025
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:27,118
the benefit uh is there from starting

1026
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:29,920
with mildew free Plants uh the level of

1027
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:32,920
disease was influenced far more by the

1028
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:36,440
resident uh pathogen population than by

1029
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,440
contamination from outside

1030
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:41,558
sources so what are the applications of

1031
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,200
of this new biological and

1032
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:46,920
epidemiological information on pathogen

1033
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:48,719
uh on the pathogen first there are

1034
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:51,159
substantial benefits to be gained from

1035
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:53,000
starting with mildew free plants and

1036
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:55,639
taking steps to keep them in that

1037
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,760
condition for as long as possible by

1038
00:43:55,639 --> 00:44:00,318
doing so uh you may first avoid

1039
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:02,640
contaminating the planting by

1040
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:05,119
introducing the pathogen on senescent

1041
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:08,118
leaves that's one source of an ulum you

1042
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:11,119
can uh greatly reduce or even

1043
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:14,160
eliminate secondly you can prevent the

1044
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:17,400
formation of clesia perhaps indefinitely

1045
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:20,519
as their formation requires severe and

1046
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,400
protracted disease because the pathogen

1047
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:24,639
population is composed of two mating

1048
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,519
types so unless the disease gets severe

1049
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:30,039
or persists for a very long period of

1050
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:32,960
time uh those clesia will not form

1051
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:35,679
that's the only other source of primary

1052
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:38,358
inoculum uh thirdly you'll improve the

1053
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:40,358
performance and increase the longevity

1054
00:44:38,358 --> 00:44:43,279
of the fungicides that are applied and

1055
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:45,119
reduce uh the risk of fungicide

1056
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,880
resistance that's going to become

1057
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:50,720
increasingly important as uh the number

1058
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:53,480
of available fungicides dwindles and the

1059
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:56,039
remaining options are inherently uh

1060
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:58,240
perhaps less active against this

1061
00:44:56,039 --> 00:45:00,440
pathogen

1062
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:03,078
now additionally uh the rapid

1063
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:06,000
development of antigenic or age related

1064
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:08,640
resistance in strawberry leaves means

1065
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,519
that it's the very youngest foliage that

1066
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:13,799
has to be the target of the fungicides

1067
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:16,759
directed against powdery Milo if you

1068
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:19,760
effectively uh protect those disease

1069
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:22,559
they very soon become resistant and uh

1070
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:25,240
will no longer require your assistance

1071
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,400
if you fail to do so there's very little

1072
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:29,358
that you can do to eradicate the

1073
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,800
established and very well protected

1074
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:33,400
colonies on the lower surface deep

1075
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,800
within the plant

1076
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:39,079
canopy and so I'll I'll leave you with

1077
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:41,400
these words of wisdom uh start clean and

1078
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:43,720
keep it clean I'll thank you for your

1079
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:46,000
attention and I'll be happy to answer

1080
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:48,199
any questions in in whatever time

1081
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,440
remains and I haven't touched on uh

1082
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:52,558
varietal resistance but we can uh deal

1083
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:55,559
with that in the question

1084
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:58,599
period thank you all right thank you so

1085
00:45:55,559 --> 00:46:00,760
much David and I see a couple of people

1086
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:04,318
typing so perhaps we're going to get

1087
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:07,480
questions uh Dr Mike Ellis and Dr David

1088
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:10,000
Gori are still here for some questions

1089
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:14,280
so please um take the opportunity we

1090
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,039
have a a little bit extra time and um

1091
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,240
they were two terrific

1092
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:20,480
presentations I do want to while people

1093
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:23,239
are typing I do want to say that some of

1094
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:27,000
you may have had some somewhat broken

1095
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:28,838
audio and I am not sure why that happens

1096
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,039
I think it has something to do with

1097
00:46:28,838 --> 00:46:32,759
bandwidth um and depending upon the

1098
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:35,480
usage perhaps you're at a major

1099
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:39,599
institution and there's a lot of usage

1100
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:41,920
that may affect why um why you're not

1101
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:45,119
getting consistent audio and I think

1102
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:47,480
it's different for every location a one

1103
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,720
thing that I can say is that we did find

1104
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:52,960
that people who are on a wireless

1105
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:56,639
connection that does seem to result in a

1106
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,119
more broken audio so um that that's

1107
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:01,358
something that you might want to

1108
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:03,599
consider um Molly Shaw has a question

1109
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:06,558
here it says do dormant plants from the

1110
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,880
nursery tend to come with powdery mildew

1111
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:10,720
on the few clinging leaves and how do

1112
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,559
you make sure you start a planting

1113
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:16,519
without powdery

1114
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:19,680
mildew and uh are there any U owners of

1115
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:21,800
uh strawberry nurseries on the line here

1116
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:24,759
before before I get into

1117
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:26,920
trouble okay uh there's no way of

1118
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,280
knowing without a microscopic in

1119
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,400
inection of the plants whether or not

1120
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,960
they carry powdery mildew it's very

1121
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,599
likely though that they do uh although

1122
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:38,960
the nurseries tend to intensively uh

1123
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:41,640
spray those plants uh not so much in the

1124
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:44,240
United States but in Europe uh the

1125
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:46,039
nursery plants that are heavily sprayed

1126
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:48,159
are thought to be one of the primary

1127
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:50,679
means by which fungicide resistance

1128
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:52,799
strains are introduced uh and that

1129
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:54,358
becomes a particular problem in the high

1130
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,559
tunnel production which is much more

1131
00:47:54,358 --> 00:47:59,558
common in Europe uh here I I couldn't

1132
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:01,640
say uh certainly if you're getting

1133
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:04,480
tissue culture plants or plants grown

1134
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:06,598
from seed uh there's much less of a

1135
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,838
possibility or likelihood that they're

1136
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:11,400
coming in with powdery mildew uh

1137
00:48:08,838 --> 00:48:15,199
otherwise I think you

1138
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,200
uh uh you just take your

1139
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,319
chances all right great um we have a

1140
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:22,719
couple of other people that are

1141
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:25,599
typing and

1142
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:27,959
um I'm going to uh move I'm going to

1143
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,720
move us uh into the the final setting so

1144
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,358
that people can download the handouts

1145
00:48:29,719 --> 00:48:34,799
while we are

1146
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:36,960
talking uh I don't know if you folks oh

1147
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,359
I think this is for David um Marvin

1148
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,559
pritz has a question about managing

1149
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:42,558
powdery mildew in high

1150
00:48:45,318 --> 00:48:49,440
tunnels all the things that I mentioned

1151
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,760
regarding the management of powdery

1152
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:55,039
mildew in uh in field plantings become

1153
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:59,920
much more important uh in high tunnel

1154
00:48:55,039 --> 00:49:02,239
production certainly uh if you had uh

1155
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,559
the option of growing a a variety with

1156
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:07,358
good uh base level of powdery mildew

1157
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:10,319
resistance that becomes almost critical

1158
00:49:07,358 --> 00:49:13,440
in high tunnel production uh If you're

1159
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:15,719
receiving uh dormant crowns and you

1160
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,798
suspect that there may be powdery Milo

1161
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:21,519
melium harbored on those uh persistent

1162
00:49:18,798 --> 00:49:23,119
green leaves uh you may want to consider

1163
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:25,679
actually stripping those before the

1164
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:28,280
planting is started uh thereafter you

1165
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:31,558
want to be especially diligent with the

1166
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:34,119
application of fungicides in particular

1167
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:36,599
uh as those new leaves emerge and to

1168
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:39,358
keep that uh epidemic under almost

1169
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:41,079
continual suppression in particular if

1170
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:44,000
you're growing a a highly Milo

1171
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:46,640
susceptible

1172
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,719
variety all right great there's also a

1173
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:51,159
question about wild strawberry as a

1174
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:51,159
source of

1175
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:57,359
inoculum uh it's it's minimally

1176
00:49:53,960 --> 00:50:00,838
important for powdery milde okay

1177
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:03,119
and then shiaka county has a question um

1178
00:50:00,838 --> 00:50:06,759
about recommending what do you recommend

1179
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:09,000
for application equipment to use um for

1180
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:11,920
the application of fungicides and maybe

1181
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,400
this is actually for both uh Dr Ellis

1182
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,400
and Dr

1183
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:21,000
gdor I'll let Mike go first okay Mike do

1184
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:24,559
you want to there you go can you hear me

1185
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,318
yes beautifully um you know when you get

1186
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:29,319
into application equipment that's kind

1187
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:31,279
of a science onto itself and ever since

1188
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:33,440
I started working with strawberries this

1189
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,960
question comes up you've got range from

1190
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,599
people putting uh materials on through

1191
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:41,159
the irrigation system through all kinds

1192
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:43,039
of different sprayers and what I tell

1193
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:45,199
people is number one I don't know what

1194
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:46,838
the best system is but the most

1195
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:48,558
important thing is you've got to have a

1196
00:50:46,838 --> 00:50:50,759
system that's going to give you complete

1197
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:53,200
coverage of what you're trying to spray

1198
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:57,760
and I can't get any better than

1199
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:59,239
that I would say only that the the the

1200
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,160
timing of those fungicides and the

1201
00:50:59,239 --> 00:51:02,598
choice of the materials uh in

1202
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:04,358
conjunction with all of the other things

1203
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:07,960
you should be doing to manage powdery

1204
00:51:04,358 --> 00:51:09,519
milue are probably uh more important

1205
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,599
than the particular piece of equipment

1206
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:13,920
assuming the equipment is suitable for

1207
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:16,838
spraying strawberries in the first

1208
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,920
place I I have I mean that's that's well

1209
00:51:16,838 --> 00:51:21,639
said there's no doubt about that one

1210
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:24,318
thing that's just kind of a um an

1211
00:51:21,639 --> 00:51:26,719
observation if you will um if you are in

1212
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:28,838
a program where you are going to be uh

1213
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:30,679
spraying um you know you're going to be

1214
00:51:28,838 --> 00:51:33,358
spraying a lot I think the layout of the

1215
00:51:30,679 --> 00:51:35,358
field has is is very important I think

1216
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:37,838
it's important to have some grass strips

1217
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:39,199
that you can actually run the tractor on

1218
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:42,000
and have a sprayer that's going to

1219
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:45,639
deliver out about 10 rows uh to keep you

1220
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,798
out of that planning um um most of the

1221
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:49,358
Growers that I know up here are in Ohio

1222
00:51:47,798 --> 00:51:51,639
are doing that and it it really makes

1223
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:55,960
life an awful lot

1224
00:51:51,639 --> 00:51:58,440
easier all right that is excellent um if

1225
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,519
I want to draw people's attentions to

1226
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:04,960
there's two the fungicides for

1227
00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:08,199
strawberry fruit rots um that is a

1228
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:10,000
uh um handout that Dr michelis developed

1229
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:12,558
and you can upload that onto your own

1230
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,880
computer it's very comprehensive and

1231
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:18,760
then there's a powdery mildew um fact

1232
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:22,680
sheet that you might also want to have I

1233
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:25,480
will add um the uh PowerPoint

1234
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:27,960
publication from Dr David Gori to this

1235
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:29,679
so you can access it later but I'm just

1236
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,599
having some problems doing that right

1237
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:35,719
now but that will be available on the

1238
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:37,000
recorded version and I just uh want to

1239
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:39,039
let people know they have a few more

1240
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:43,079
minutes before we even reach 2:00 if

1241
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:44,358
anybody has any other questions but yes

1242
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:47,920
hey

1243
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:49,719
Laura um if if you could make my uh

1244
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,079
PowerPoint available I'd appreciate it

1245
00:52:49,719 --> 00:52:55,838
too happy to do that

1246
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:57,640
certainly and uh um when we get when we

1247
00:52:55,838 --> 00:53:00,039
get into question I'd like to address

1248
00:52:57,639 --> 00:53:02,558
that one about uh plastic culture versus

1249
00:53:00,039 --> 00:53:04,358
matted Row in terms of the fruit rot SP

1250
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:07,319
and I think we're right there so you can

1251
00:53:04,358 --> 00:53:12,119
go ahead and talk about

1252
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:15,558
that okay um first of all um you know

1253
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:17,559
the difference between matted row U um

1254
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:19,920
the control of fruit rots in matted row

1255
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:22,359
and and the plastic culture or annual

1256
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,798
Productions is just a world apart and

1257
00:53:22,358 --> 00:53:26,480
the point uh well made that in the

1258
00:53:24,798 --> 00:53:30,400
annual production you've got this

1259
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:33,199
constant flush or or or flushings of of

1260
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,880
uh um um flowers that need to be

1261
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:37,519
protected for Bettis

1262
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,880
control at any rate in perennial matted

1263
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:42,480
row I think it's a pretty simple system

1264
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:45,720
um U at least in Ohio we do very very

1265
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:48,719
few sprays uh prior to the initiation of

1266
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:50,639
Bloom uh we target sprays during Bloom

1267
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:52,239
and this is fairly easy to do you've got

1268
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:54,558
to do it for each variety but you've

1269
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:56,919
usually got about a two- we no more than

1270
00:53:54,559 --> 00:54:00,040
three that you target uh sprays for

1271
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:02,680
Bettis control and then Growers kind of

1272
00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:05,159
play it by ear if it's a normal year and

1273
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:06,639
it's not hot and it's not extremely wet

1274
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:08,480
uh you may not need very many more

1275
00:54:06,639 --> 00:54:10,838
sprays but in hot years you might have

1276
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,599
to think about some anthracnose sprays

1277
00:54:10,838 --> 00:54:15,679
or if you saw anthracnose the year

1278
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:18,240
before at any rate um I think you've got

1279
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:20,318
a lot more options and you can you can

1280
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:22,479
look at the weather more you can you

1281
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:24,880
have more IPM type things that you can

1282
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,559
consider in perennial matted Row in

1283
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,920
plastic culture I don't think you the

1284
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:31,798
leeway for that the investment that you

1285
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:34,119
have uh just the nature the the U it

1286
00:54:31,798 --> 00:54:37,759
seems like the introduction of anthros

1287
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:41,039
on uh tips and on Plants is is very very

1288
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:42,480
common and um at least if I had my

1289
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:44,558
investment in the plastic culture

1290
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:47,719
planning I would maintain a pretty

1291
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:49,960
strict straw or uh fungicide program uh

1292
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:52,159
starting early in the season uh with

1293
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:55,159
just straight captan to keep populations

1294
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:57,960
of anthros down when Bloom came I'd have

1295
00:54:55,159 --> 00:55:00,118
a a program that going to control uh all

1296
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:02,838
the major fruit rots and we and if you

1297
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:04,358
look at the the options you can put

1298
00:55:02,838 --> 00:55:06,279
together a program that'll take you

1299
00:55:04,358 --> 00:55:08,480
right up through Harvest it's pretty

1300
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:10,519
intensive but if you let something like

1301
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,639
anthracnose get loose on you in those

1302
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:15,798
plantings it's uh yeah you just can't

1303
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:18,719
get back on top of all right that's a

1304
00:55:15,798 --> 00:55:21,480
great Point um it looks like there's a

1305
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:25,318
question Kathy heyen rake said asks with

1306
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:27,280
straw over the plastic help reduce fruit

1307
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:30,159
rods

1308
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:33,480
well this is um I didn't quite finish my

1309
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:35,838
talk here this afternoon um but at any

1310
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:37,000
rate I would did want to mention um

1311
00:55:35,838 --> 00:55:40,798
cultural

1312
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,920
practices straw is extremely beneficial

1313
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:46,400
in the planning uh for preventing fruit

1314
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:48,559
rots almost all or all of the U diseases

1315
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,960
are are spread pretty well with Splash

1316
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:54,798
dispersal and straw um uh between the

1317
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:58,079
rows especially in perennial matted rows

1318
00:55:54,798 --> 00:56:00,639
I'd never want to see soil never want

1319
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:03,400
berries in contact with soil leather

1320
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:05,480
rots just going to be a major problem uh

1321
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:09,000
at any rate a good layer of straw mulch

1322
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:11,280
we've shown that uh even on on uh fairly

1323
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,639
poorly drained sites a good solid layer

1324
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,920
of mulch will give you a very very good

1325
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:17,879
control of leather rot it protects uh

1326
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:21,358
the fruit from contact with the soil

1327
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:23,920
even if you get puddling on top the soil

1328
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:25,759
uh the rain the or the uh straw breaks

1329
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,318
up the raindrops and it prevents it from

1330
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:31,119
splashing it has a very profound effect

1331
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:33,358
on Splash dispersal I think even in

1332
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:34,640
plastic culture if you can afford it

1333
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:37,239
there ought to be something between

1334
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:39,519
those rows rather than just bare soil I

1335
00:56:37,239 --> 00:56:43,038
think it's more important in the uh in

1336
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:44,639
the perial matted row but uh um you know

1337
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:46,680
a lot of our Growers will put a layer of

1338
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:49,000
straw down in between the rows and in

1339
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:51,318
their plastic culture as well but it's

1340
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,400
it it really goes along thank you and

1341
00:56:51,318 --> 00:56:55,798
then Alan has a questions about whether

1342
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:58,480
or not insects play a role in the spread

1343
00:56:55,798 --> 00:56:58,480
of fruit fruit

1344
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:06,358
rots um I think insects are their own

1345
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:08,358
problem when I think about uh

1346
00:57:06,358 --> 00:57:10,199
controlling these fruit rots and and the

1347
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:14,119
development of these fruit rots insects

1348
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:17,759
to me uh are not a uh a major uh factor

1349
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:19,280
in their spread um uh if they are I'm

1350
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,280
just not aware of it they they're

1351
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:23,599
they're kind of their own problem that

1352
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:26,880
have to be taken care of uh within the

1353
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:29,000
overall um Management program um there

1354
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,640
is another question probably for both of

1355
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,159
you uh Shaco County asks if there's an

1356
00:57:31,639 --> 00:57:37,440
advantage to applying a fungicide now

1357
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,440
before you put the straw

1358
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:44,000
down I'll I'll I'd like to go first on

1359
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:46,920
that

1360
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,798
um when when when a lot of the this real

1361
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,639
good work on Bettis was done there there

1362
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:55,400
was really some tremendous work done a

1363
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:58,598
lot of it by uh um Sutton up in G will

1364
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:00,559
Cox and pritz in New York we did some in

1365
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:02,559
Ohio but there were a lot of things

1366
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:06,079
looked at and one of them was an

1367
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:08,798
application of fungicide in the fall I

1368
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:10,960
think it's a waste of money um um I

1369
00:58:08,798 --> 00:58:13,559
would not recommend it uh if you want to

1370
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:15,280
try it do it uh certainly not against

1371
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:18,240
the law but I think it's a waste of

1372
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,880
money I think uh um um you're still

1373
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,639
going to have plenty of inoculum there

1374
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:25,039
to start out in the spring and I think

1375
00:58:21,639 --> 00:58:27,558
I'd I'd put my emphasis on on targeting

1376
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:30,119
uh a program at protecting the the

1377
00:58:27,559 --> 00:58:32,280
blooms um we did do some work here in

1378
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:35,318
Ohio and I could never find any benefits

1379
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:39,160
from it I I'd agree with that Mike uh

1380
00:58:35,318 --> 00:58:41,880
for for powdery Milo in particular uh

1381
00:58:39,159 --> 00:58:44,960
the cloth thesium is has evolved to uh

1382
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:46,599
to withstand a very harsh environment

1383
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,159
and it's it's very resistant to

1384
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:50,720
penetration by fungicides that are

1385
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:53,000
applied and fall so you much better off

1386
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:55,239
reducing the amount of disease and that

1387
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,639
alone will prevent the formation of the

1388
00:58:55,239 --> 00:58:59,639
overwintering structure then you would

1389
00:58:57,639 --> 00:59:02,960
be in trying to eradicate it once it's

1390
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:05,400
formed uh so by the time fall rolls

1391
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,760
around uh it's really too late to do

1392
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,838
much about powdery mildew for the

1393
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:10,319
following

1394
00:59:07,838 --> 00:59:14,920
year in terms of applying a

1395
00:59:10,318 --> 00:59:14,920
fungicide to uh get at the overwintering

1396
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:19,759
stage it is a good question and it's

1397
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:22,358
been looked at but like I said I I don't

1398
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:24,839
recom right um I I have to admit I did

1399
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:27,519
not have time and I apologize to put any

1400
00:59:24,838 --> 00:59:30,279
uh final um pulling questions to you

1401
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:31,960
folks but I I do hope that you en

1402
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:34,119
enjoyed these talks I thought they were

1403
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:37,000
absolutely wonderful and it's great to

1404
00:59:34,119 --> 00:59:39,400
be able to have access to nationally

1405
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,480
known experts on these topics so it's

1406
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:45,440
really nice um without having to drive

1407
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:47,920
to Ohio and uh so it's great to have

1408
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:51,039
both uh Dr David gdor and Dr Mike

1409
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,039
Ellison I want to thank

1410
00:59:52,119 --> 00:59:58,838
you sure um Laura I'd like to make one

1411
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:00,639
more comment before we break up uh Dave

1412
00:59:58,838 --> 01:00:06,239
uh Dave didn't mention anything about

1413
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:08,400
varietal um um suceptibility but for me

1414
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:12,038
U one of the major things that I try to

1415
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:15,000
push in my extension programs uh mainly

1416
01:00:12,039 --> 01:00:17,920
for leaf spots and powdery mildew um I'm

1417
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,318
not an expert on powdery mildew but um

1418
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,440
you know we have some very good

1419
01:00:19,318 --> 01:00:24,599
resistance and especially when I first

1420
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:26,358
started uh um working with strawberries

1421
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:29,519
uh the varieties coming out out of our

1422
01:00:26,358 --> 01:00:31,519
USDA program and and Jean Getta they

1423
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:33,719
really had excellent and still do have

1424
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:36,079
excellent resistance to the leaf spots

1425
01:00:33,719 --> 01:00:37,838
and uh a lot of varieties you just don't

1426
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:39,318
have to spray for powdery mildew and

1427
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:41,400
then all of a sudden we'll start getting

1428
01:00:39,318 --> 01:00:43,759
some introduced and they're just

1429
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:47,760
indicators for powdery mildew and leaf

1430
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:49,359
spot and uh I I try to tell our Growers

1431
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:52,039
well you really better check these

1432
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:54,598
varieties out and if you're dealing with

1433
01:00:52,039 --> 01:00:56,200
an uh a case of extreme susceptibility

1434
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:57,200
you ought to try to avoid it or you're

1435
01:00:56,199 --> 01:00:59,759
going to be

1436
01:00:57,199 --> 01:01:01,960
spraying and I still think we have some

1437
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,799
excellent uh uh resistance in a lot of

1438
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:05,798
different varieties that people could

1439
01:01:03,798 --> 01:01:08,440
take advantage of and it's especially

1440
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:12,119
true resistance when we talk about the

1441
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:14,838
uh uh the root rot diseases um um we

1442
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:17,559
really need to emphasize uh uh the use

1443
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:20,159
of resistance whenever we can get it I I

1444
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:23,640
would go along with that Mike

1445
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:26,639
especially the uh as you move towards

1446
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:28,838
High tunnel production uh powdery mil is

1447
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:31,279
is not uh routinely destructive under

1448
01:01:28,838 --> 01:01:33,038
field conditions it is routinely

1449
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,920
destructive in high tunnels in

1450
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:38,119
particular when you're growing a a milde

1451
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:39,880
susceptible variety and so very often we

1452
01:01:38,119 --> 01:01:42,119
develop these attachments to certain

1453
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:43,960
varieties because they have just uh well

1454
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:46,400
they have wonderful taste good

1455
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:48,358
Horticultural properties and in field

1456
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,200
plantings we can manage powdery mildew

1457
01:01:48,358 --> 01:01:51,558
with

1458
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:54,598
fungicides uh it's a very different

1459
01:01:51,559 --> 01:01:55,920
world as as uh you you quickly find out

1460
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:58,200
when you move into high tunnel

1461
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:01,920
production and the resistant varieties

1462
01:01:58,199 --> 01:02:04,199
there uh it just makes a lot of sense to

1463
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,760
start with that as the as the base of

1464
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:07,759
the disease management program all right

1465
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:11,520
th those are wonderful points and there

1466
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:15,720
is a question about um powdery Milo

1467
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:17,880
resistant varieties um in our uh in our

1468
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:20,519
particular guidelines we don't have any

1469
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:23,160
listed we have some that are definitely

1470
01:02:20,519 --> 01:02:26,000
um susceptible and that those would be

1471
01:02:23,159 --> 01:02:28,239
listed in the guidelines but maybe um

1472
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,079
maybe Mike or David you have some that

1473
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:33,239
you know are actually resistant to

1474
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:33,240
powdery mildew that you

1475
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:40,079
could I I don't have them uh memorized

1476
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:44,358
but in all of our literature and I know

1477
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:46,318
in the Mid-Atlantic Berry uh guide and

1478
01:02:44,358 --> 01:02:49,038
in our literature there's tables that

1479
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:51,558
have the relative susceptibility uh for

1480
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:55,278
almost you know most of the currently uh

1481
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:56,960
um uh used varieties and uh I think the

1482
01:02:55,278 --> 01:02:58,000
information

1483
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:01,559
Fairly

1484
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,798
reliable um I a few kind of stick out in

1485
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:07,960
mind that are extremely susceptible this

1486
01:03:03,798 --> 01:03:10,278
Dar select is one that is uh is really

1487
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:12,400
an indicator for power rebuild do but

1488
01:03:10,278 --> 01:03:14,960
that's another reason I like to emphasiz

1489
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:17,400
you know having these resources this

1490
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:19,679
information having it and uh and

1491
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:21,798
referring to it but I'm sure that u y

1492
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:24,558
all have some information on relative

1493
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:26,880
susceptibility of the varieties to Leaf

1494
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:29,519
spots and powdering M yeah I I would

1495
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:32,720
check the uh the extension resources

1496
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:34,599
online or the published resources to see

1497
01:03:32,719 --> 01:03:36,358
uh not only what's resistant to powdery

1498
01:03:34,599 --> 01:03:38,039
mildew but what has some pretty

1499
01:03:36,358 --> 01:03:40,159
broad-based resistance to some of the

1500
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:41,839
other diseases as well uh you don't want

1501
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:43,598
to have a resistant variety to powdery

1502
01:03:41,838 --> 01:03:45,480
mildew and then you know take comfort in

1503
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:48,760
that as it as it

1504
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:51,278
rots oh yeah you know one thing I was up

1505
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:53,160
talking to the growers in Nova Scotia

1506
01:03:51,278 --> 01:03:55,278
several years ago and I didn't realize

1507
01:03:53,159 --> 01:03:57,519
you know Leaf Scorch it just never

1508
01:03:55,278 --> 01:03:59,760
seemed like a serious disease to me

1509
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:01,719
never saw it much it's cuz we have

1510
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,880
excellent resistance I guess up there

1511
01:04:01,719 --> 01:04:05,480
it's just a horrible disease and if you

1512
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:07,480
don't have Leaf Scorch resistance you

1513
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:09,639
don't you don't raise strawberries up

1514
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:11,880
there so well thank you guys very much I

1515
01:04:09,639 --> 01:04:14,118
will try to get my hands on a table and

1516
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:16,400
also post that in this file share so

1517
01:04:14,119 --> 01:04:19,358
that people can access that quickly for

1518
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:21,559
both uh some of the other diseases um

1519
01:04:19,358 --> 01:04:23,278
leaf leaf spots as well as fruit rats

1520
01:04:21,559 --> 01:04:25,440
and certainly powdery Mila will try to

1521
01:04:23,278 --> 01:04:28,039
make sure that that is available to all

1522
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:30,119
of you you um again I want to thank the

1523
01:04:28,039 --> 01:04:32,720
speakers I want to thank all of you that

1524
01:04:30,119 --> 01:04:35,400

1525
01:04:32,719 --> 01:04:37,519
your attention to the fact that um the

1526
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:40,160

1528
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:45,558
Friday October 30th at 1:00 in the

1529
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:47,400
afternoon again um all of you that are

1530
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:50,000
registered will receive the connection

1531
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:53,760
information for that and that will be on

1532
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:56,000
We control in strawberries um Dr Marvin

1533

pritz and Dr Robin bellinder will be

1534
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:02,159
talking about cultural and chemical

1535
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:04,159
control options and um I also want to

1536
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:06,440
urge those of you who have enjoyed these

1537
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:09,038
to please um let other people know

1538
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:12,400
especially Growers who might be somewhat

1539
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:14,799
reluctant to try this particular uh form

1540
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:16,278
of program delivery we think it's very

1541
01:05:14,798 --> 01:05:19,038
accessible and I think they're going to

1542
01:05:16,278 --> 01:05:21,440
be pleased with how easy it is and the

1543
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:23,680
quality of the lectures so please talk

1544
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:26,559
to your colleagues and other Growers and

1545
01:05:23,679 --> 01:05:30,399
Farmers um we'd love to have more people

1546
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:33,720

1548
01:05:33,719 --> 01:05:38,480
lecture so I just want to urge you we're

1549
