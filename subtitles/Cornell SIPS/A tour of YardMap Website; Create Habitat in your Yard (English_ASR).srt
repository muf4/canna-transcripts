1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,039
University my name is Jacob Johnson I'm

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,400
with the project yard map at the Cornell

4
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:14,439
lab of ornithology a citizen Science

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,920
Program aimed at creating habitat in

6
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:19,559
your yard show you the yard map

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,160
application online and the website and

8
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:24,159
how we use that yard Maps essentially

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,480
allows scientists to better understand

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,198
how landscape use and gardening choices

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,239
affect birds and wildlife populations in

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,520
a residential or Urban

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,599
settings in terms of coexistence we're

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,399
realizing also that a greater diversity

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,840
of birds and a greater diversity of

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,799
plants and Wildlife around a

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,239
neighborhood or around a group of people

18
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:49,519
improves their well-being and this is

19
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:52,159
true in almost any demographic and

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,000
almost any society and so what yard map

21
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:57,078
seeks to do

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,079
is um collaborate with groups of people

23
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:04,359
to join people together and to create a

24
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,000
community of yard mappers a community of

25
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:10,079
people making connections or connecting

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,040
points connectivity is a very big

27
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:16,959
Concept in ecology that connects large

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,360
expanses of wild areas through small

29
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,359
expanses of wild areas like

30
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:26,359
yards one

31
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,079
yard that's yard mapped and is being

32
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:31,280
managed for wildlife is great two yards

33
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:33,199
is even better

34
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,920
because that provides stepping stones

35
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,719
from say a national forest to you know

36
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,200
lake sarac or something then you have

37
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,200
you have these Stepping Stones of

38
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,319
habitat and when you have Stepping

39
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,879
Stones connected you have corridors so

40
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:52,199
you have corridors and stepping stones

41
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:54,158
and all of this you know when a

42
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,879
community works together to provide all

43
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,320
the necess necessary or essential parts

44
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:02,438
of a habitat across the landscape that's

45
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:05,158
when we can all make a really big

46
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:08,038
difference so what I want to do is show

47
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,039
you some of yard

48
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,360
map and some of the uh some of the best

49
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:17,518
practices that we suggest and some of

50
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,000
the tools that we have for um for

51
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:23,360
planning it yourself and this is our

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,639
website this is our new page our new

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,360
homepage and it sort of demonstrates

54
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:30,559
what I was just referring

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,599
to the actions of you and your

56
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,239
community and

57
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:38,199
create you know a larger

58
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:41,759
more uh efficient

59
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:44,719
and useful habitat so a anatomy of a

60
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:47,399
yard map a yard map takes a Google image

61
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:50,800
of your house you outline

62
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,920
it and then you fill in the habitats and

63
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,879
then you place objects like trees and

64
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:58,719
bushes and bird feeders on that habitat

65
00:02:55,878 --> 00:03:01,840
and it creates a yard map like this I'll

66
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,840
show you that in a second

67
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:09,119
here's our active

68
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,519
participants

69
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,680
adding habitats or objects to their

70
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:18,840
yards and then when you do when you add

71
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:21,120
say um you know a native flower bed or

72
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,560
native flower garden to your yard you uh

73
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,640
you document that and you it tells the

74
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:31,840
scientist here at yard map so let's see

75
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:35,158
up here on this top bar we have a lot of

76
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:39,680
resources the explore resource will show

77
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:42,280
you will take you um if you put in your

78
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,280
ZIP code

79
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,400
here this will show you your uh plant

80
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:55,479
hardiness Zone and your Eco region and

81
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,840
give you the list of um bird reports

82
00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:00,399
local experts States native plants this

83
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,598
is a really nice uh link here that gives

84
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,000
you uh

85
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:06,719
suggestions of available plants that you

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,639
can buy and then here's places where you

87
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:12,239
can buy them and here's places where you

88
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:14,759
can get together with Community um Comm

89
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,918
community events that are around you and

90
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:18,399
that's all based on your zip code and

91
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:22,279
plant hardiness zone so that's one of

92
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:24,679
the things that yard map allows or um

93
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:26,198
you know provides a resource for and

94
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,199
then we have the top learn we have the

95
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:32,520
learn articles which are constantly

96
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:38,720
updated articles referring to um best

97
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:38,719
practices basically um Native Lawns

98
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,759
replacing na or non-native plants with

99
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,199
native plants Zer escaping you know what

100
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,120
I mean anything you can think of rain

101
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:53,439
barrels cats and so there's um just a

102
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:57,399
lot to learn from that section

103
00:04:53,439 --> 00:05:00,719
there but what are what we the citizen

104
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:03,918
science part of it here is the

105
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,759
mapping and here's our this is an

106
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,758
example here of a map that's been

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,879
created and we can take a look at some

108
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:18,319
other maps that have been recently

109
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,639
created there right now there is a

110
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:24,160
project going on up in

111
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,600
Canada where they um are encouraging

112
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,160
elementary schools to map their schools

113
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,280
so here's a map what each of these

114
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:37,240
sections has been outlined with a

115
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:37,239
tool and then each of these trees

116
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,199
replaced I'll just take a quick

117
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,799
second and show you a little bit of

118
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,840
mapping so first you find

119
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,359
oops first you would find your house say

120
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:04,519
this is my house here

121
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,520
here you use a site outline

122
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:10,800
tool you pick whether you're using a a a

123
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,160
home or it's a school or a community

124
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,879
garden you can map Farms Parks preserves

125
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,880
and if you have something else that's

126
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:19,959
unique like we have a couple of yard

127
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:21,399
mappers that map their balcony you know

128
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:24,359
they live in a giant apartment building

129
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:26,318
but they have a wonderful B Garden on

130
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,080
their balcony so they use this other to

131
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:33,479
just map the balcony so I'm going to

132
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:33,478
pick a a home and I'm going

133
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:39,959
to assume that I know the boundaries of

134
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,439
this house this property and so that's

135
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,879
what it takes

136
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:49,680
there it saves

137
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:53,319
it and then you use a habitat

138
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,319
tool outline the

139
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,240
lawn I'm going to be really rough about

140
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,240
this but you can I'll show you some

141
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,478
intricate examples that are really well

142
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,478
done and there's some Forest

143
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:15,758
here all of the dots are movable you can

144
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,120
either expand the range or you can move

145
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,120
the whole piece around like this

146
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,878
and there's

147
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:36,879
also

148
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,639
buildings so this

149
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:46,560
gives this gives us

150
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:49,240
area and type of habitat but it doesn't

151
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,038
give us everything but you want what

152
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,918
happens next once these things are

153
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:57,478
mapped you go into

154
00:07:53,918 --> 00:08:00,038
the you go into the characteristics

155
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:02,680
page and you can put in information I'm

156
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:06,000
going to call my

157
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,478
house my home the characteristics does

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,439
it have a

159
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:13,959
garage or is it a home this is a home so

160
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:16,439
then like we want to know about the roof

161
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:18,279
does it have a green roof or does it

162
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:19,879
have a white roof because white roofs

163
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:23,478
help with

164
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:25,240
uh albo effect with CLE warming of the

165
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:26,918
climate around you and things like that

166
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,439
you can put in some comments and you can

167
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:30,680
upload

168
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,918
photos and that's for almost every

169
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,879
object every object has and every

170
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:37,958
habitat is going to have um these

171
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:41,038
characteristics that you can

172
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:43,038
include information for like the lawn do

173
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:46,120
you use an electric lawn mower or gas

174
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:47,360
powered lawn mower or push re lawn mower

175
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,240
that sort of thing everything is going

176
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,560
to have a different collection of

177
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,799
characteristics once you get the entire

178
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:58,159
area filled I'm not going to fill it

179
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:00,519
right now but once this area is filled

180
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,759
that's when you go back through

181
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:04,799
you find you go to the object tool and

182
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:07,720
then you can start adding

183
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:12,879
trees and say this

184
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,879
tree not sure what happened there Pard

185
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:40,879
par me just give me one second here

186
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,879
doesn't seem to want to save for

187
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:49,599
me oh there's the tree

188
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:52,278
okay so when you open the

189
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,879
tree you can type in the type of what

190
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:56,360
you want to call it say it's you know

191
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:58,879
it's my uh I have a big swing in the

192
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,800
tree or something and then this is an

193
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,838
interesting part here you can put in

194
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,159
this and say it's a red maple I'm going

195
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,519
to put in

196
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:10,360
Acer and as I start to type species

197
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,799
lists will come up this is where the

198
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:17,800
citizen science data comes in really

199
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:20,719
handy because then we have

200
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:21,559
species and abundance on the in each of

201
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,560
these

202
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:27,719
properties so that's one of the one of

203
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:27,719
the things that you can do with yard map

204
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,958
and then

205
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,360
also we are starting to really integrate

206
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:48,119
the yard map with all of the other

207
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,680
citizen scientist uh programs so if I

208
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,278
open this site

209
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:56,039
again I can I keep getting that error

210
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:58,320
message I can list all the birds that I

211
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:00,679
have seen on this site and this uses the

212
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,320
eBird

213
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:06,559
this uses the eird citizen science

214
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,320
program and so what you do here is you

215
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,479
add data to the

216
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,680
eird program through the yard map

217
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,959
program and then that ties them together

218
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:16,159
and eventually what we'd like to be able

219
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:21,439
to do

220
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:24,439
is U connect Nest watch and feeder watch

221
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,639
with these so that when you put a bird

222
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,000
feeder let's see let me find a bird

223
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:30,360
feeder there's a lot of objects down

224
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,879
here on the bottom if you look there's

225
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,000
Planters cactuses everything

226
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:38,439
from um wild flowers to bat houses and

227
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,639
be nests here's a birdhouse I'll put a

228
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,639
birdh house in the lawn

229
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:48,919
here so then it won't be long before you

230
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:51,519
can um connect your nest watch data with

231
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:53,399
bird houses that you put on your land or

232
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,919
on your yard

233
00:11:53,399 --> 00:12:00,200
map so like if you notice here yard map

234
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:02,639
is in beta we are constantly growing and

235
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:07,560
expanding but right now it is is very

236
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:09,600
usable and um very very fun to use we

237
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:11,919
have a lot of people that enjoy it and

238
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,480
we're really glad that um folks like you

239
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,519
are interested in learning about it so

240
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,720
that you can take it to your

241
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,679
communities and put it to use and get

242
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:25,639
get feedback for us here at the coral

243
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:29,439
lab of orthology and um provide um much

244
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:29,440
better habitat more

245
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,958
efficient more efficient habitat

246
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,919
for I'm sorry I seem to be losing

247
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:53,919
this okay well if anybody would like to

248
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:55,879
see anything else let me know this is a

249
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,799
just a quick demonstration of this but

250
00:12:55,879 --> 00:13:00,559
ites definitely takes a little bit of

251
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:04,159
learning curve to learn to use first you

252
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:08,119
you know here's a and some exploring to

253
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:08,120
use the uh website here

254
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,720
but once you get the hang of it it's

255
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,680
fast and a lot of fun so uh we do have a

256
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,680
lot

257
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:18,679
of

258
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:25,120
um

259
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:27,639
um extension members um using this with

260
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,159
their communities um to create groups

261
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:33,399
and things like that and so what we've

262
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:37,480
been focusing on recently is let me see

263
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:37,480
if I can give you all a sneak

264
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,278
peek this is behind the scenes this is

265
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,399
not a live site here but what we are

266
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:49,439
working on now is this groups function

267
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,919
and this is what we'd like uh people

268
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,240
that work with the communities people

269
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:59,319
that work U with uh other like Community

270
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:01,079
gardeners or Planters to uh

271
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,440
collaborate together and to work

272
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:05,958
together in a group so this is the new

273
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,639
function that we're starting

274
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:11,719
here and these groups um you can find a

275
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:14,600
group to join you can start your own

276
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:18,399
group and you can

277
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:21,278
create let's see you can uh let me see

278
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,078
if I can pull one up here yeah and then

279
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,639
you can compare your group to other

280
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:27,120
groups and you can compare yourselves

281
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,560
within the group so if you're in a group

282
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,679
that say native lawn see you know native

283
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:34,719
lawn group and you're all trying to get

284
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,439
the least amount of lawn on your yard

285
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,759
and the most amount of native plants or

286
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,639
something then you know you can you can

287
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:42,680
compare each other's efforts through

288
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,759
this group function here and that will

289
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:47,919
probably be live in a few

290
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,839
weeks so that's something to look

291
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:53,599
forward to

292
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:56,240
there through uh the the learn and the

293
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,320
explore

294
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,278
tabs but eventually after the group

295
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,879
functionality that we're working on now

296
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:06,519
the next part the next tool that we're

297
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:09,039
going to add to the yard map U network

298
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:12,879
is called a planning tool and that will

299
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:15,958
be a second math that you sort of lay

300
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:18,679
over the math that you have so that you

301
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:22,439
first will assess what you have and then

302
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:25,239
after that you can plan what you want

303
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:28,120
and yard map will make the connections

304
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,600
for you so if you want you know to put

305
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,440
in a Native Garden

306
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,120
yard map May pop up and say Here's

307
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,040
native plants for your area that will

308
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,318
work to attract the birds that you

309
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:38,958
listed you want to attract you know what

310
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:42,000
I mean something like that right now

311
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,679
it's sort of uh using the resources to

312
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,720
explore on your own but very soon it

313
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:48,879
will be one that is a planning tool that

314
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,278
gives you the resources and

315
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:53,639
suggestions what you would do is go to

316
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:59,519
the explore Tab and put

317
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:59,519
in um your ZIP code here

318
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,919
and one of the best resources that I

319
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,759
found that we've found for plant

320
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:15,519
suggestions is this uh your States

321
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:18,639
native plants it takes you to the um

322
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,000
Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower

323
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,399
Center and it will give you a suggestion

324
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,639
of of

325
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,360
uh native plants and you can filter that

326
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:28,560
suggestion too if you want trees or if

327
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,800
you want bushes or if you want them to

328
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:34,318
flower in June or if you want them to be

329
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:36,958
you know dry dry sight type flowers you

330
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:38,000
know what I mean there's a number of

331
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,638
ways you can

332
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,679
filter um the selection to get kind of

333
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,959
what you have in your yard if you have a

334
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:46,519
dry site that gets lots of sun with

335
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,318
acidic soils and you want something that

336
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:53,519
gets about four feet high you can enter

337
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:56,439
all that into that uh so there's 16 uh,

338
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:59,480
almost 177,000 sites across the country

339
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:02,040
um we do have some sites in Mexico lots

340
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,038
of sites in Canada we've got a couple in

341
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:06,720
like Costa Rica a couple in Europe we're

342
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:08,838
really trying to work together with the

343
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,400
the Google Earth or the Google Maps to

344
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:14,359
make that more accurate right now the

345
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,000
the the software isn't as accurate as it

346
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:17,958
needs to be you know lining up a Google

347
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,359
Earth picture with our with our our

348
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:22,279
mapping tools doesn't quite work very

349
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:24,479
well so people have some difficulties

350
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:26,279
outside of the Country Canada and Mexico

351
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,919
seem to be fine but any further outside

352
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:30,599
of that and it's um has to do with

353
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,640
ejections with map projections and

354
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:35,279
things like that that we're working on

355
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,520
um but the engagement is always going up

356
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,160
this number was 200,000 Acres mapped

357
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:42,079
just a few weeks ago so we've almost had

358
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:45,240
40,000 Acres mapped in a couple of weeks

359
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:47,119
um so people are always um coming back

360
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,880
to it there's no commitment to come back

361
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,879
to your map although we do try to

362
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,640
encourage people to always be adding and

363
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,440
changing and updating um what what

364
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,520
they've done to their yards you know if

365
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,159
any changes you make to your yard we

366
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:02,000
want to know about it you know and then

367
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:04,880
know any any differences that uh may

368
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,240
have come about from that so there's no

369
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,159
like I said there's no commitment but as

370
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,400
often as you want or as few as you want

371
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:10,919
we try to keep people coming back at

372
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,200
least once a year with any changes that

373
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,440
have made if a tree fell over or you

374
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,679
know they changed their gardening

375
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,558
techniques or something like that yard

376
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,640
