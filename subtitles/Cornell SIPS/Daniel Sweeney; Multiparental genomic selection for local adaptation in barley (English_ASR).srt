1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,839
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,179
University

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,280
okay so I'm gonna be talking about

4
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:10,048
malting barley today which is barley

5
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:15,179
that's used to make beer and whiskey

6
00:00:10,048 --> 00:00:16,469
which makes for some fun okay so as many

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,480
of you know there's a lot of craft

8
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:20,278
brewing that goes on in New York so much

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,500
so that were the fifth largest producer

10
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:24,028
of beer in the nation some of that

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,829
growth has been spurred by the farm

12
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:27,719
brewery bill which is passed by the

13
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:30,239
state government in 2012

14
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:32,269
this gives economic incentives to local

15
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:36,060
Brewers to use local ingredients

16
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:39,359
ingredients being malt and hops so right

17
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,940
now these farm brewers have to use 20%

18
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,460
of their ingredients being from New York

19
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:47,039
however by 2019 that's gonna bump up to

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,780
60% so as you can see we're not growing

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,019
a whole lot of barley in New York right

22
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,509
now

23
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,790
it's creeping up but we have some

24
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:58,320
progress to make so we can meet that 90%

25
00:00:53,789 --> 00:01:00,539
minimum by 2024 so the small grains

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,359
group has been trialing moulting Bart

27
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,569
barley and starring some research since

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,879
about 2013 but for many reasons which

29
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:11,188
I'll go into we decide to actually start

30
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,839
some breeding research which we're

31
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:14,879
calling the born bred and brewed a New

32
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,329
York project which I will hereafter

33
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:20,789
referred to as the DPP okay so our main

34
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:22,108
goals here are to actually breed barley

35
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:25,109
that's adapted to the unique conditions

36
00:01:22,108 --> 00:01:26,998
of New York understand how genotype

37
00:01:25,108 --> 00:01:29,449
environment and Gbowee interactions

38
00:01:26,998 --> 00:01:31,739
affect multi across the state

39
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,569
established best management practices

40
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:36,179
for New York growers since this is a

41
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:38,039
very new crop in New York we still don't

42
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:40,710
really know what best way to grow barley

43
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:43,170
is and then variety trying and

44
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:44,759
recommendation my work focuses on these

45
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,819
first two points which I'll be covering

46
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,069
today okay so before I continue I wanted

47
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:51,478
to give a brief overview of the malting

48
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:54,929
and brewing process for those who aren't

49
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:58,108
familiar so with any crop it starts with

50
00:01:54,929 --> 00:02:01,228
seed I'm working in spring barley so we

51
00:01:58,108 --> 00:02:03,958
plant this in middle mid to end of April

52
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:06,299
and harvest in early August so this is a

53
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:10,640
picture of my nursery of this summer at

54
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:14,040
the Helfer field so you need clean plump

55
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,469
disease-free grain to malt malting is

56
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:17,519
three steps you steep the grain so it

57
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,859
imbibes water

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,800
can germinate germination the second

59
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,410
process and then you dry it and kill a

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,230
heat to develop enzymes color and flavor

61
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:30,439
so this is germinating barley right here

62
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:33,599
these little reutlitz are called chit

63
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:35,699
and then this is a almost finished malt

64
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,609
product you can see the dried reutlitz

65
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:40,889
right here this has been dried so once

66
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,660
you have the malt you go on to the

67
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:46,139
brewing process which starts with

68
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:48,270
grinding them all steeping it in water

69
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:50,039
to remove the sugars that gives you a

70
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:53,550
kind of a malt soup which is called

71
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:55,799
worked this is work here you add hops to

72
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,650
the work you boil it to extract hot

73
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:02,189
compounds and sterilize it cool it add

74
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,590
yeast fermentation commences and then

75
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:06,900
after fermentation you sometimes filter

76
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,900
it let it rest for a little bit and then

77
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,360
you bottle it so you can enjoy it

78
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,860
okay so I mentioned that there are some

79
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,810
challenges for growing barley in New

80
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,150
York mostly because of the weather we

81
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:21,210
have so this map this graphic is from

82
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:23,819
the USDA harvested barley acreage in

83
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:25,200
2016 as you can see New York is

84
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,989
producing so much barley that they

85
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,429
didn't even serve a New York most of it

86
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,170
is being grown in the Upper Great Plains

87
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,719
in the Mountain West where they have

88
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:36,750
warm days cool nights and low humidity

89
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:39,120
low humidity means low disease and it

90
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,340
also means that it will not pre harvest

91
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,740
sprout so that's what happens when the

92
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,599
grain has low dormancy it gets wet

93
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,000
before harvest and the grain starts the

94
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,709
germination process this is bad because

95
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,680
it means that barley is not malts very

96
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:54,930
well because malting is germination um

97
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,420
the other big problem we have in humid

98
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,159
areas is Fusarium head blight which is a

99
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,829
fungal pathogen that infects the

100
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:06,060
developing spike and produces a nasty

101
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:08,880
mycotoxin called the ox so even up here

102
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,629
in middle nowhere montana malting barley

103
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,219
is a tricky crop to grow so the main the

104
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:15,689
the traits that we're really interested

105
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:17,459
in and that are going to be key to

106
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:20,339
actually getting malting barley to work

107
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,800
in New York are disease resistance free

108
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,329
harvest spreading resistance and good

109
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,009
enough from all quality the craft

110
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:28,529
maltsters and brewers actually want to

111
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:30,959
use this stuff so most of our germ plasm

112
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:31,399
is actually from this area because this

113
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:33,709
is where the

114
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:35,750
reading programs are and also Western

115
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:38,180
Canada they produce a very large amount

116
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,550
of our barley up there but also European

117
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,810
varieties from France and Germany

118
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:46,189
Germany girls a lot of barley if they

119
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:47,418
can grow malting barley ok so the method

120
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:50,120
that we're using to actually go about

121
00:04:47,418 --> 00:04:52,969
achieving this goal is multi parental

122
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,910
genomic selection in a reduced method

123
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:57,590
Association mapping panel design so I'll

124
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,570
talk about the next couple slides kind

125
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:01,849
of mouthful so there have been a lot of

126
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:03,949
genomic prediction studies within by

127
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,539
parental families and you can get pretty

128
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:07,819
good prediction accuracy within by

129
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:10,219
parental families for most part however

130
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:13,459
there are not that many and connected by

131
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,380
parental families these are two examples

132
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:18,379
from algorithm Elkin Gers group in

133
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:20,029
Germany these are both maize so

134
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:23,329
basically from these publications there

135
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:25,728
is some promise that combining acid

136
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:27,680
families can give you better prediction

137
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:30,288
accuracies than just single by parental

138
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,030
families this is also useful breeding

139
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:34,430
model for us because there's one variety

140
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:37,129
called AEC synergy that we really like

141
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,019
it's from Western Canada but its biggest

142
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:41,029
problem is that it sprouts like crazy

143
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:42,079
because it doesn't rain in Canada up

144
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:44,149
there and they don't need smart

145
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,159
resistance so we really just want to

146
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:49,638
modify want to improve one trait

147
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,460
maybe with two traits and this crossing

148
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:54,530
the single parent to six other seven

149
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:56,810
other parents excuse me gives us a

150
00:05:54,529 --> 00:06:01,448
reasonable breeding strategy as well as

151
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:01,449
academically interesting job prediction

152
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,260
so the last year and a half to two years

153
00:06:04,728 --> 00:06:08,959
I've been developing this training

154
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:11,509
population I have about fourteen hundred

155
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,339
two rows spring barley lines from seven

156
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:15,740
full subfamilies like I said are

157
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:19,369
connected by a single common female

158
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:21,769
parent I have two locations this year

159
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,780
and since I didn't have that much seed I

160
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:24,408
had to grow it and head rows and augment

161
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:26,359
the design

162
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:28,788
head rows are okay here because I'm not

163
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,650
interested in yield right now or

164
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:32,329
interested in quality traits and disease

165
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:34,759
which I could you know type and head

166
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:36,259
rows just fine I did a lot of phenotype

167
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,500
in the summer I'm actually still doing

168
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:41,449
some lab and we harvested a subset of

169
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:45,199
this to send for his scent in New

170
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:46,879
Zealand or winter nursery seed increase

171
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,009
we can grow some of these and replicate

172
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,250
to heal Charles next year don't know if

173
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:53,990
all get to go there but maybe next year

174
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,339
okay um I actually don't have a jeep to

175
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,019
pick today yet that's taken a little

176
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:59,239
longer than I expected actually just got

177
00:06:57,019 --> 00:07:00,560
the last two files back this morning so

178
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,689
if I were presenting in two weeks I

179
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,189
would have had some interesting genomic

180
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,839
things talked about but you're stuck

181
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:11,240
with phenotypic information which is so

182
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:14,899
kind of interesting too so because this

183
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:17,689
is not meant to design sorry the entries

184
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:21,799
are random so I can calculate bupps and

185
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:23,149
then nested within check the

186
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,660
heritability ZAR kind of interesting

187
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:28,429
here so all that means I did all of the

188
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,320
families at once this is all thirteen

189
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,090
hundred and forty two lines and these

190
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,310
are heritability thing each of my seven

191
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:36,679
families so you see there's quite a

192
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,019
range across each of the traits height

193
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:42,980
heading date leaf rust spot watch

194
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:45,199
harvest sprouting most notably and then

195
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:48,470
the genetic variance over here there's

196
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:51,889
quite a range so super height and that's

197
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:53,210
and their traits - one of the more

198
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:55,310
interesting things you might know is

199
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:58,370
that this SN family here tends to have

200
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:01,280
lower heritability x' and lower genetic

201
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:04,850
variance compared to the other families

202
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,649
this is actually a back cross this

203
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,150
parents called new Dale and it's one of

204
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:10,129
the parents synergy

205
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:12,500
we didn't realize in this until after

206
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:14,350
the fact but I was a happy accident

207
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,689
should make for some interesting

208
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:18,980
experimental things hi this will not be

209
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:21,949
being advanced in the breeding lines

210
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:24,230
though okay oh and then I fit these with

211
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:26,990
air one air one row column for their

212
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:29,360
instructors in a stroller and the

213
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,680
spatial effects did improve the models

214
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,129
so I kept them in even though there

215
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,680
wasn't noticeable spatial variation okay

216
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:37,330
so again I haven't actually

217
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,359
any prediction yet but I have a lot of

218
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:43,538
interesting look at I'll just start with

219
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,980
our bluff and probably base models since

220
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:46,360
I'm expecting for some of these trades

221
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,720
there to be some major key TL

222
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:52,419
segregating major effect QTL so the most

223
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,278
obvious I can start leper well within

224
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:58,419
family predictions across family

225
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:59,649
predictions whole set two whole set we

226
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:01,719
also have a population from the

227
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:04,179
University of Minnesota to row spring

228
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,430
barley is genotypes and phenotypes so

229
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:08,500
that's unrelated then I can do various

230
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:10,539
combinations of all these so I have a

231
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,889
lot of work ahead of me again I was

232
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:15,370
hoping to present on some of this today

233
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:18,730
but come back next year and there'll be

234
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:20,679
some good stuff I also have kind of a

235
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:23,980
mini experiment within the genomic

236
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:25,989
selection experiment going and a really

237
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,399
selection versus random interesting

238
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:30,789
looking at spatial correction versus

239
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:33,070
just raw data because of the population

240
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:34,809
structure design I should be able to run

241
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,589
G Oster this will see if I have any

242
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:40,599
major qto like in fit as fixed effects

243
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:44,589
and because of the size here I can

244
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:48,730
empirically look at optimal size for the

245
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:51,190
training set okay I had a speed through

246
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:53,980
this so I'm actually gonna be doing

247
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:56,640
selection - so I'll be removing two

248
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,830
families crossing between all the others

249
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,929
phenotypic and genomic selection

250
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:03,100
advancing simultaneously there's not a

251
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:06,299
lot out there and actually using

252
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:08,860
selection indices for genomic selection

253
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:10,838
there's an Elliott Hoefler paper from

254
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,820
back in the day they just looked at it

255
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:14,920
but from a prediction standpoint they

256
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,110
didn't actually do any selections with

257
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:18,219
the selection index but because we're

258
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,528
actually trying to do some breeding here

259
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,990
and I blog you know types I would like

260
00:10:20,528 --> 00:10:25,958
to look at that quickly I want to talk

261
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:28,750
about another project - it's related to

262
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:31,169
malting so multi is a super important

263
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:34,169
phenotype it's made up of eight to ten

264
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:36,819
quantitative traits so it's loads of fun

265
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:39,278
but it's really expensive takes a lot of

266
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,680
grain usually in later generations like

267
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:43,600
any quality trait there are micro Multi

268
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,419
machines but they're also expensive so I

269
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,960
decided to make my own this is a kind of

270
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:52,709
crappy cartoon showing a hydroponic Evan

271
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:56,320
so water moves up into this top tray

272
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:58,360
barley grain is suspended in mesh bags I

273
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,180
have 10 grams so I'm calling it nano

274
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:04,240
melting so I can fit a whole lot in this

275
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:06,159
3x3 table the steeping takes place in

276
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,990
here the germination takes place in here

277
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:09,879
and this is all in a growth chamber to

278
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:13,480
keep relative humidity and temperature

279
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:15,580
constant I'm so done a couple test runs

280
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,159
this is my so these are my mesh bags

281
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:22,210
here and this grain you can see the size

282
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:25,179
here I'm killing these in a food

283
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:27,100
dehydrator the phenotypes of interest

284
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:30,549
looking at a green protein mulberry

285
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:32,500
glucan and extract and we have some nice

286
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:34,240
regional trial

287
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,850
grain samples from the past three years

288
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,250
winter and spring barley multiple

289
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,800
locations so do a little g'bye emote

290
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:43,840
study which will be fun okay quick

291
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:45,969
acknowledgments thank my committee mark

299
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:05,319
particularly the by Polaris which is a

300
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,870
big amount of work so very grateful to

301
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,090
her in the friction lab for that

302
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:12,009
Elizabeth says for ecology questions

303

letting me use his Evan flow table which

306
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:23,169
I will get back to at some point is

307
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:24,879
alone and then air McLeod from heartwood

308
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:26,979
College who runs the Kraft food and

309
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:30,189
beverage center and as a multi science

310
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:32,170
wizard and has helped us out a lot yeah

311
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:34,650
I think NY I drink NY and I'll be happy

312
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,649
to take any questions

313
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:39,899
[Applause]

314
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:56,678
here yeah so we've tested some UK spring

315
00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:58,028
wines I I think they might actually grow

316
00:12:56,678 --> 00:12:59,619
a little bit more winter grain because

317
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:01,600
their winters are not nearly as harsh as

318
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:03,730
they are here but the UK material

319
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,149
somewhat surprising is not done well

320
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:09,129
here we have by far of the best luck in

321
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:11,948
European germplasm with French and

322
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:13,959
German varieties and there are many

323
00:13:11,948 --> 00:13:15,938
French and German private companies that

324
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:19,928
are actively involved in spring barley

325
00:13:15,938 --> 00:13:21,068
breeding and finish - but that's a

326
00:13:19,928 --> 00:13:24,899
pretty different environment from New

327
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:29,849
York so we're mostly focusing like kws

328
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,850
psycho bruh Syngenta bryan material

329
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:38,499
yeah

330
00:13:38,808 --> 00:13:42,379
so there are hybrid there is hybrid

331
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:44,240
barley in Europe but is primarily for

332
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:46,209
feed I don't know the name is looked at

333
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,230
hybrid barley for moulting quality I

334
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:50,958
think that you'd probably run in the

335
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:53,389
same problem the hybrid rice has that it

336
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:55,998
might yield like crazy but people don't

337
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:59,120
like the quality and malting barley is

338
00:13:55,999 --> 00:14:01,100
the breeding programs are fully dictated

339
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,528
by what the Brewers want and because of

340
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,990
that the North American hero barley germ

341
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:08,448
plasm base is extremely narrow because

342
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:11,089
selection for the malting quality

343
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:13,099
parameters for industrial brewing is so

344
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:14,660
precise there's no one over there may be

345
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,180
something at rest to look into but I'm

346
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:27,078
not aware of any hybrid malting

347
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:28,878
varieties that are being researched yeah

348
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:32,028
so I should be able to compare it to

349
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:34,308
micro malts we so the benefit of using

350
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:37,909
those regional trials is that we send

351
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:40,578
one rep of one location to the USDA

352
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:43,278
small grains quality lab in Madison

353
00:14:40,578 --> 00:14:45,019
Wisconsin so I have a comparison there I

354
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,870
can also send some samples to Erin

355
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:49,698
McLeod he has a micro Malter so and I

356
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,528
need to do that because I'm not going to

357
00:14:49,698 --> 00:14:54,509
be confident that I'm doing it right

358
00:14:51,528 --> 00:15:15,039
unless I absolutely compare it to

359
00:14:54,509 --> 00:15:16,419
Michael yes yes yeah so yeah yeah well

360
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,120
so that one bad cross that I talked

361
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:20,559
about that's also they're both adapted

362
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,870
to what they call the Canadian quality

363
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:25,569
so Canadian quality means that it yields

364
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:28,690
well and it sprouts when you spit on it

365
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:32,260
because the big Canadian maltsters want

366
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:34,420
to be fast and efficient there's also

367
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:36,250
disease I guess I was a little too

368
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:38,979
simplistic and saying there's one trait

369
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:43,059
we want to improve upon we could improve

370
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:45,670
some disease resistance as well I think

371
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:47,229
so it appears that the pre-harvest

372
00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:50,349
sprouting from the past QTL mapping

373
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:53,560
papers and barley is all ago genic it's

374
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:56,519
not quite quantitative and based on the

375
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:59,500
heritability x' i'm seeing and my

376
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:03,009
distribution i think that it's probably

377
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,740
all ago genic so i'm hoping to have some

378
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:07,629
success and getting good prediction

379
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,980
accuracies and actually selecting for

380
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:23,740
free harvest sprouting because we want

381
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:24,820
it as low as possible yes that's a good

382
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:28,149
question

383
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:29,589
so there is a skill level difference you

384
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:31,240
have guys that have been brewing in

385
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:33,400
their basement for the last five years

386
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,720
and decided to start selling it and you

387
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:36,129
have people that are professionally

388
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,660
trained and they doing this for 30 years

389
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:40,929
so there's there's a skill level

390
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:43,719
difference I would say that raw

391
00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:46,389
materials are probably pretty similar at

392
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,879
this point they all have access to the

393
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:50,740
same malt they could be buying New York

394
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:53,289
malts if they wanted to or they could be

395
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:57,789
buying it from a large scale maltster in

396
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:59,649
Oregon or Washington or Minnesota water

397
00:16:57,789 --> 00:17:01,629
can actually make a big difference in

398
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:03,519
the taste of the beer and the quality of

399
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:05,259
the beer so if there are water

400
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,088
differences across the state that could

401
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:08,199
potentially be part of it but a lot of

402
00:17:07,088 --> 00:17:10,388
it's actually skill

403
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:12,308
and the way you market it and there are

404
00:17:10,388 --> 00:17:13,928
a lot of different beer styles that I

405
00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:18,038
could give a whole nother 30 minute

406
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:19,389
seminar on so maybe I could do that for

407
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:22,148
a grass group sometime people want to

408
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:27,838
know about beer I could one last

409
00:17:22,148 --> 00:17:30,538
question if not let's thank Dan
