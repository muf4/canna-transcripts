1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,919
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:05,918
university

3
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:10,960
thank you very much mark and i hope you

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,919
can

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,679
all hear me and also see this

6
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:20,480
presentation uh

7
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,198
thank you for the introduction and uh

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,320
also for

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,320
inviting me to speak here today it's

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,879
only too bad i couldn't be

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,480
in cornell in person but that's how it

12
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:33,920
is right now

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,119
so i'm sitting at home right now

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,320
in a dark november evening in sweden

15
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,320
in the south of sweden

16
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,000
so the title of this talk might seem a

17
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:48,479
bit

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,359
obscure but the story i want to tell

19
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,359
is about genomic selection basically

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,000
and i suppose that

21
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,800
many or most of you maybe are familiar

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,039
uh

23
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,039
to some extent with the genomic

24
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,719
selection

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,520
but even if you're never heard about

26
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,359
this before i think that

27
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,959
that won't be a problem because this is

28
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:16,879
not a talk that will be

29
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,879
very heavy on technical details

30
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:25,519
it's more about what genomic selection

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,599
means for practical plant breeding

32
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,679
and also it's a little bit of my

33
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,319
personal reflections

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,920
on how genomic selection has been

35
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,158
received and implemented in the

36
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,000
plant-breeding community

37
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:45,118
and i will show you some examples from

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,438
our spring oat breeding program that i

39
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:51,920
until one month ago was responsible for

40
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,438
now i had another position which is

41
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,079
called group manager population

42
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:55,919
improvement

43
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:57,279
and mark described a little bit about

44
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,920
what that was

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,599
and i think it will become maybe a

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:10,159
little bit more clear

47
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:10,159
in this at the end of my talk as well so

48
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,400
i like just mark introduce london a

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,760
little bit

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,760
uh and i will just

51
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,719
say a few words about the company i work

52
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,700
for it's

53
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,639
it's a pretty big company for swedish

54
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:29,039
[Music]

55
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:31,199
in sweden it's an agricultural

56
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,959
cooperative

57
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:36,000
that is owned by practically all swedish

58
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,000
farmers and 20

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,120
000 farmers in sweden all have a share

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,800
in this

61
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,439
cooperative we employ about 10 000

62
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,640
people and

63
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,479
work in a number of countries around the

64
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,839
world

65
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:54,479
and we are as we usually say

66
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,840
uh involved in the entire value chain

67
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,840
meaning

68
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,400
uh from uh the farmer from the seed

69
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,200
up until the consumer products uh the

70
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,680
bread the nutrients the pasta

71
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:12,399
things like that so we supply the farmer

72
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,640
with what whatever he or she needs in

73
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,879
terms of feed fertilizers

74
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:21,919
machinery other types of equipment

75
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:24,158
and consumables and we then buy the

76
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,798
harvest and produce from the farmer and

77
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:28,639
turn that

78
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,640
into consumer products

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,719
and one part of this

80
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,719
company this operation

81
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,560
is plant breeding we have a plant

82
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,280
breeding unit

83
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,519
which is located in here is your map of

84
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,799
sweden and europe

85
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:52,959
and we are located at the southernmost

86
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:56,080
part of sweden you can see on the

87
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,080
on the map to the right uh

88
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,840
it's out of the countryside in a little

89
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,840
village called florida

90
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:09,519
it's a it's an area of

91
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:13,438
large farms agricultural landscape

92
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:17,040
glass fields while the rest of sweden is

93
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:19,439
mostly forested as you might know

94
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,639
so this park looks more like denmark or

95
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,680
continental europe

96
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,000
than the rest of sweden and this is

97
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,519
where

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,399
most agricultural activities and

99
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,680
products are

100
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:34,799
produced and this is also where

101
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,160
most of the well we don't have a lot of

102
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,280
plant-breeding companies actually in

103
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,400
sweden it's we

104
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:41,918
uh it's us love salmon and a company

105
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:44,638
called malibu helicopter

106
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:44,639
eating sugar beets

107
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,719
uh plant breeding in sweden has a long

108
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,240
history actually and

109
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:58,000
this is a sort of well a phytogenic

110
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,759
decree you could say of

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,560
150 years of swedish plant breeding

112
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,759
it started in solid in this little

113
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,879
village

114
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,479
in the 1870s or 1880s

115
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:15,120
where uh some large farmers um

116
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,159
got together and thought that we need

117
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,600
better seeds let's

118
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,680
start some kind of sandwiching

119
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,120
activities here

120
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,879
so they established uh something called

121
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,918
a swedish student association

122
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:31,038
and they had a company and then

123
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:34,079
swallows quickly became

124
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:36,839
quite an active and important center in

125
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:39,839
early plant breeding and genetics

126
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,839
research

127
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,560
and we have do we've been doing plant

128
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:48,079
reading since

129
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,560
then under different names and with

130
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,839
different

131
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:56,079
owners for a while the company was known

132
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:58,638
as foreign as mentioned

133
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,959
now we are part of this big landscaping

134
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,960
group

135
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:07,918
a small unit in a big company it has its

136
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:10,639
advantages and it's just advantageous

137
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:14,478
that's the way it is

138
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,720
but we have this long long tradition

139
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,879
of plant breeding which we can grow up

140
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,880
on

141
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,360
today uh we have been breeding over the

142
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,240
years

143
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,080
about 50 or 60 or so different crops

144
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,759
today

145
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:33,599
we do cereals wheat barley oats and

146
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,600
critical

147
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,680
we do spring oyster grape or canola

148
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,240
we have a number of orange grasses and

149
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,240
legumes

150
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,639
and also flava beans and we have

151
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,560
potatoes

152
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:53,598
and we have willow's song bioenergy

153
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:58,240
tree that we breed and we will

154
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:58,240
soon start also repeat reading program

155
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:04,159
and you see as you can see here these

156
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,839
are all crops that have

157
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,080
different modes of reproduction and

158
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:12,159
different genetics some are ingrid lines

159
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:15,839
some are hybrids some as different

160
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,599
are not pure lines but history genius

161
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:20,159
populations

162
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:22,159
and some are clonally propagated and

163
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,000
usually highly heterozygous

164
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,960
by this like potatoes for example for

165
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,038
these in terms of genomic selection

166
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,318
and the development of prediction models

167
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,719
they all have

168
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,680
their own challenges so it can be quite

169
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,360
demanding to

170
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,639
to sort of apply genomic selection in

171
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,080
this

172
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:45,360
rather diverse set of crops

173
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:47,680
but this is what we try to do

174
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,680
sorry

175
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:56,000
now if you would ask someone

176
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:57,758
to mention or name the most important

177
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,439
milestones in the history of plant

178
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,960
breeding

179
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:04,240
you would probably come up with

180
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:08,959
something like this this is from

181
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:12,560
the west side of euro seed european seed

182
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,878
association and this starts all the way

183
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,879
from

184
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,639
you know the domestication and then you

185
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,080
have different crops were domesticated

186
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,439
you have an ambulance you have hybrid

187
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,199
bleeding and you have

188
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,478
mutation breathing and genetic network

189
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,759
selection and gmos

190
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:27,839
and gene transfer and all that this is

191
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,879
all very well and important

192
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:35,759
steps in the history of plant breeding

193
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:38,879
but i if you ask me i would argue that

194
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:42,158
there are only three

195
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:45,360
really important uh

196
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:47,838
milestones in the history in the modern

197
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,879
or recent history of plant breeding

198
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:54,640
since the discovery of mendel's

199
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:56,639
walls and this is my own personal view

200
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,919
of the history of plant breeding since

201
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,919
the 1880s or so

202
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,879
the first event

203
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:11,200
was what i call fans reading 1.0

204
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,439
and that was the idea of the concept of

205
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,720
concept of individual plant selections

206
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,720
as opposed to

207
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,720
mass selection in land races

208
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,839
there was a breeder in swallow actually

209
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:27,200
called the albanian

210
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,440
who in 1896

211
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,040
thought that it would be better too

212
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,360
instead of

213
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,799
doing mass selections in very diverse

214
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,159
populations

215
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:40,639
isolate individual plants and

216
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,199
propagate offspring from individual

217
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,639
plants

218
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:49,680
and in this way to develop inward

219
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:52,480
pure lines he worked with cereals

220
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:54,319
this was sort of in anticipation you

221
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,440
could say of johansson's theory

222
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,800
of inward lines and concepts of the gene

223
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,200
type and the phenotype

224
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:06,719
which came from years later and this

225
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:11,278
turned out to be really successful

226
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,600
they developed many new varieties

227
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:16,399
very good varieties using individual

228
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,399
plant selection

229
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:25,439
the next milestone was not long

230
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:25,439
after that when a guy called the armani

231
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,759
well invented or thought that

232
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,919
it would be a good idea to do

233
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:36,720
cross-breeding to cross

234
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,000
plants in order to obtain

235
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,920
[Music]

236
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,958
superior recombinant genotype

237
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:48,000
and of course he grew upon the theory

238
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:51,119
of mendel that was had just

239
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,679
been discovered some years earlier

240
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,839
and he was strongly influenced by you

241
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,439
know eric chermax and cole korens and

242
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,680
those who discovered

243
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,480
mendel's works they actually visited him

244
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,479
in scholars

245
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,399
and he got to learn from them and he

246
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,959
became one of the

247
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,919
most prominent genetic researchers in

248
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,559
the early

249
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,039
20th century and was also ahead of the

250
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,319
breeding

251
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:18,639
in florida and he

252
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,040
was one of the first who could show that

253
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:23,919
continuous traits

254
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:26,319
or quantitative traits have a mendelian

255
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:28,159
basis

256
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,600
so he introduced cross-breeding and that

257
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:30,399
was very controversial at that time

258
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,560
because people thought

259
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,839
that oh you just create chaos if you try

260
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,359
to cross plants and you

261
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,360
god knows what you will find in our

262
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,919
screen but of course that turned out to

263
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,240
be

264
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:44,799
really successful as well

265
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,000
and it's now of course an established

266
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:51,359
mode of work in plant breeding

267
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,360
uh and then

268
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,278
not what happened actually in implant

269
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,440
breeding

270
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:03,120
until around 2010

271
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,959
when genomic selection was introduced

272
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,799
and of course it's hard to put a year on

273
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:10,239
that because it's a process

274
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:13,439
but i would say around 2010 it was has

275
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,480
had become sort of accepted

276
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,040
in a sense in the cloud breeding

277
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,959
community

278
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,838
and that sort of ushers in the era of

279
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:28,479
plant breeding

280
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:32,160
that i call trans plant reading 3.0

281
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:35,839
and to my mind this is the first

282
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:38,958
really transformative

283
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,959
change in how

284
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:43,679
we do plant breeding since the

285
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:45,599
introduction of cross breeding

286
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,838
i would say it's more important than for

287
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,480
example in synaptic transformation

288
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:55,440
or mutation breathing or hybrid breeding

289
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,560
because it changes fundamentally the way

290
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,320
that we approach

291
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:01,759
or think of sound breathing i will try

292
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,760
to explain what i mean by that

293
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:11,200
um

294
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,200
and i think uh

295
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:20,559
yeah and in 2014 i don't see this myself

296
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:23,919
in 2014 we we established an oath

297
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,719
3.0 that's when we started to do genomic

298
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:28,000
selection as a

299
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:34,399
routine routine method in

300
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:38,480
in our spring of reading program

301
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:41,519
and if you actually look at uh

302
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,879
what i call plant prison 2.0

303
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,278
uh on the right hand side you see a

304
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,958
dramatic illustration of a pedigree

305
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:52,958
breeding

306
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,599
setup for sales and crop from a 2015

307
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,479
book

308
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,360
and on the left-hand side you see

309
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,839
something

310
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,839
that looks pretty much the same it's

311
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,839
from

312
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:07,279
swish uh drawing from this guy

313
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,120
from als from 19 or 12. you can see that

314
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:13,439
in many respects not what have happened

315
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:17,839
since since plant reading 2.0 started

316
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,839
in the early 20th century

317
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,480
if you look at how breeding of stalking

318
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:30,799
crops

319
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:33,920
looks today or up until today at least

320
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:37,519
this is how plant green 2.0

321
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:40,559
typically looks in a in a cereal crop

322
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:44,078
self-imperial crop

323
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:48,559
to the left you see a picture an image

324
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:51,198
of some small plots in a field

325
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,919
these are the early generations in this

326
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:55,838
case

327
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:57,278
s4 generation and perhaps you can see

328
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,279
that there are

329
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:04,799
five rows in that little cloth

330
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:08,879
and each of those rows is one

331
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:09,599
uh inbred it's on cell plane ranges and

332
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,838
f4 but

333
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,839
still on its way to be in red line

334
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,719
we treat them as separate lines and you

335
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,759
have about

336
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,079
some 20 or 30 000 of these lines in the

337
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:24,078
field

338
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,480
and typically in the early generations

339
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,000
of a breeding program we have about ten

340
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,839
to the fourth ten to the five different

341
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,278
lines of the unit types

342
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,839
and you have usually have very little

343
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,360
fee of each so you plant them

344
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,240
you have them you keep them at single

345
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:43,519
plants or in rows like this

346
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,680
and then what happens is that

347
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,519
as you go through the generations you

348
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,159
discard about 99

349
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,600
of your line until you come to the

350
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:56,480
advanced generation

351
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,480
which they maybe is or so

352
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,039
when you're down to 10 to the second

353
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,720
genesis or about 100

354
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:05,039
or so maybe a few thousand different

355
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,720
genotypes that you can plant

356
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:11,439
big plots in

357
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,920
several sites with replications over

358
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,360
several years

359
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:21,120
and that allows you of course to

360
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,759
estimate phenotypic values

361
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,320
with the greater precision than is

362
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,159
possible

363
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,000
in the earlier generations however

364
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,159
it is in the early generations that you

365
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,519
have to do most of your selections

366
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:38,958
you have to throw away 99 of your line

367
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:41,759
and usually uh that is made

368
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:43,518
the selection decision is also made

369
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,199
purely on a

370
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:49,120
by this visual inspection so i would

371
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:51,359
in this case this is oats you can see

372
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,360
here so i would walk up and down these

373
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,519
these rows in the field and just look at

374
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,278
the plants or the rows and say that

375
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,879
this row i want to keep in this row and

376
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:02,240
throw it away and this everything

377
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:04,318
looks good and for the more or less hope

378
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,838
for the best but this is the way that

379
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,480
i would say the majority of planned

380
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:11,838
parenthood work today

381
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:15,279
uh basing

382
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:16,000
early selection on uh some kind of

383
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,279
visual

384
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,838
evaluation of a small step

385
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:23,038
of plants or a small number of plants

386
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,078
which is something

387
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:26,078
particularly genotype

388
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,480
now a couple of years ago then or it's

389
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,640
now six years ago we

390
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,558
we asked ourselves how efficient is this

391
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,400
really how how good is this early

392
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:41,678
selection that we use

393
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,280
so we decided to do a little experiment

394
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,960
we sent out the breeder in the field and

395
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:48,639
that was me to

396
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,160
pick out the best lines the best rows

397
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,919
and then we just selected the same

398
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,759
number of rows by

399
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:58,160
randomly and then we

400
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:00,079
eventually they ended up in these field

401
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,600
trials like the ones you can see on the

402
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,199
right

403
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,199
and we could evaluate my selection

404
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,519
versus a random selection and

405
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,440
surprise surprise there was absolutely

406
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:12,879
no difference

407
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,200
between reader selected lines

408
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,240
and randomly selected lines for a number

409
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,480
of

410
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,400
important traits economically important

411
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,200
traits our main breeding goals

412
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:28,240
grain yield volume weight of the grain

413
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,759
the grain weight uh

414
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,679
and grain size there was no

415
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:35,919
significant difference at all at all

416
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,679
between the breeder and the random

417
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,440
purely random selection in some cases

418
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,960
the random selection was actually better

419
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:46,480
than a green installation

420
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:50,558
so this was well i mean

421
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,558
i had expected this to happen

422
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,160
but it was sort of scary

423
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,720
and encouraging at the same time to see

424
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:03,679
this i was afraid i would

425
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,679
be fired of course after this

426
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,119
but when you see this and you conclude

427
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,880
that

428
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:14,879
the breeder has no ability at all

429
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,799
to to be sorry

430
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,880
to do a better selection than a few

431
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,839
random selections you have two options

432
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,679
basically either you carry on with

433
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,918
random selection you just generate

434
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,038
random numbers in an excel sheet and

435
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,720
that's very cheap

436
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:30,640
and straightforward and you don't have

437
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,600
to have any particular confidence to do

438
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,400
that

439
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:36,079
or you can try to improve your selection

440
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,840
methods

441
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:39,279
and we tried to improve our selection

442
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:42,399
methods uh

443
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:44,558
of course and this is how we uh started

444
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,280
to implement genomic selection enough

445
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:50,079
to to increase the selection accuracy in

446
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,079
early generation

447
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,880
and this is also where the plant's

448
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,199
reader's equation

449
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,360
again comes in and if you need to be

450
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,640
reminded of this of that

451
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:06,240
the previous equation describes how

452
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,720
the mean of a trait changes

453
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,759
as a result of selection so you will

454
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,519
have

455
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:14,879
a starting population with some

456
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:16,798
distribution

457
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,000
or some trait value a value for some

458
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:21,119
traits

459
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,720
and then you select the best ones or you

460
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,359
can also select the worst ones

461
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,079
for the lowest one that you select the

462
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:29,519
top ones

463
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:31,199
or the green portion here and you

464
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,200
intermediate all those individuals in

465
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,240
that green portion

466
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,279
and if you measure then the offspring

467
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,319
uh the collective offspring from that

468
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:45,119
those intermitting you will find that if

469
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:46,558
the trait is heritable it will have

470
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,678
shifted

471
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:52,960
the mean will have increased uh

472
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,880
and the the

473
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,319
magnitude of that increase in relation

474
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,240
to the magnitude of the selection

475
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:02,240
differential

476
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,759
is defined as the heritability

477
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,839
and you can also

478
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:11,200
[Music]

479
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:14,240
define it in terms of as i've done here

480
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,480
selection intensity which is related to

481
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,120
the proportion of the population that

482
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,200
you select

483
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:21,199
if you select a very small proportion of

484
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,400
your starting population

485
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,919
you have a strong selection intensity

486
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,519
and you have the additive standard

487
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,280
deviation

488
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,359
the additive genetic standard deviation

489
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:33,678
that is and you have the selection

490
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,439
accuracy

491
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,840
so these are the parameters that you can

492
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,679
work with in your breeding program

493
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:45,119
to improve your response to selection

494
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:48,159
and as you just saw the

495
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:51,519
selection and cures that we had in our

496
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:54,640
spring out breeding program are steroids

497
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:57,519
we couldn't really expect any response

498
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,679
to selection at all

499
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:01,119
and of course this is another way to

500
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:05,038
view it

501
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:08,319
it's just a simple randomly generated

502
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:12,480
uh distribution of let's say of a trait

503
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:16,558
in an f4 population the white bars here

504
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,240
ten thousand lines now if you select

505
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,399
out of those ten thousand one hundred

506
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,640
lines randomly

507
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,720
and you produce an f7 the population

508
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,200
eventually for example

509
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,200
then the distribution in that f7

510
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,279
population will look as a small red

511
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,080
distribution at the bottom here

512
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,879
the mean will not be different from the

513
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:39,439
mean of the

514
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:42,240
big white s4 population but i will be

515
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,200
by chance of course some lines that are

516
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,919
slightly better

517
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,798
and some lines that are slightly worse

518
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,919
and if

519
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:52,150
then you select the lines that are

520
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,520
slightly better

521
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,600
[Music]

522
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:56,879
and use those as parents for your next

523
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:00,000
reading cycle then

524
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,280
you will have a small uh selection

525
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,319
differential

526
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:06,000
uh and you will have a small response in

527
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:08,079
the next generation

528
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,480
even if though you have selected at

529
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:10,480
random

530
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:16,079
you can have the response to selection

531
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:19,440
since

532
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:21,279
there will be some by chance some f7

533
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,159
lines that are better in some that are

534
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:25,440
worse and if you do good yield trials

535
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,720
with good preposition you

536
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,720
will be able to find those

537
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:34,959
however if you can select your in your

538
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,038
f4 lines you can select with an accuracy

539
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,159
of 0.5

540
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:44,480
you will have s7 lines with a much

541
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,480
larger with a

542
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:49,119
much higher mean than your original

543
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,799
population and

544
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:53,519
of course if you select the best of

545
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:54,240
those to be parents for your next green

546
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,319
cycle

547
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,440
then you will have a larger selection

548
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:02,240
differential and a larger response

549
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,640
so that is why it's so important to have

550
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,919
uh

551
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,880
you know good selection accuracy in

552
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,880
early generations

553
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,400
and of course

554
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:18,639
[Music]

555
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,360
we who work in commercial plant reading

556
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,360
we also

557
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,360
of course focus quite a lot on the

558
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:29,679
duration of the breeding cycle and the

559
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:29,678
gain

560
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,038
the selection response per unit time of

561
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:37,519
its genetic gain per unit time

562
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,440
and that depends on as we have seen

563
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:42,798
before the selection intensity

564
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,519
the selection accuracy the additive

565
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:48,720
genetic variation for examination

566
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:50,000
case and the duration of the breeding

567
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,200
cycle

568
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,798
which is in the denominator here

569
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,440
and if you do some simulations or you

570
00:24:54,798 --> 00:25:00,798
can also look at this analytically

571
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,360
you see that the parameters with the

572
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:03,759
largest

573
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:04,879
effect on gain that you can play around

574
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:07,440
with

575
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,200
is for are the selection or the

576
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,840
generation interval or the

577
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,440
duration of the breeding cycle and the

578
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:16,639
accuracy of

579
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,440
selection intensity

580
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,159
and the amount of variance you have has

581
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,798
a

582
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,440
comparatively smaller effect on the gain

583
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:28,720
per unit time so we decided to work with

584
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,759
generation intervals or duration of the

585
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,679
breeding cycle

586
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:34,079
and the accuracy of collection to

587
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,080
improve

588
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,960
to get the most out of our challenge

589
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,960
improvement basically

590
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,360
and of course you know that in uh

591
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:46,640
in most breeding programs today the

592
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:50,639
breeding cycle are far

593
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:53,759
too long they can be up to

594
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:56,880
seven eight nine years

595
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:59,119
uh and the reason for that is of course

596
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,200
that if you select

597
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:02,319
the parents for your next cycle you must

598
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,440
be able to

599
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,158
base that selection on something and

600
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,840
normally

601
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,120
you base that selection on the

602
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:14,399
performance in yield trials

603
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:16,479
and you cannot do yield trials until you

604
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,120
are in the advanced generations it

605
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,240
usually takes

606
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:23,439
seven five six seven eight years for

607
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,798
that reason

608
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:31,278
you get very long breeding cycle cycles

609
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:34,558
if you have been able to select your

610
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:37,359
parents already in the early generation

611
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,000
then you would have a much shorter

612
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:40,959
reading cycle

613
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,278
and a much larger game per time but of

614
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,278
course

615
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,038
there is not much data to base your

616
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,240
selection of parents

617
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:52,480
on in most cases

618
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,960
unless of course you can use genetic

619
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,960
markers

620
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,720
and so

621
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,199
the question is can we use genetic

622
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,519
markers and there is certainly no

623
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,360
shortage of markers around i mean this

624
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:10,000
is a this is the timeline of

625
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,798
photogenic market development implants

626
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
and

627
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:17,038
breeding and started already now 30

628
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,038
years ago with with rfps

629
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:22,398
and now the same person would do work

630
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:26,079
with rfps today

631
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:26,479
in plant breeding it was not really

632
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:29,599
until

633
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,839
the pcr technology allowed us to to

634
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:33,519
generate thousands of markers hundreds

635
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:36,879
of markers and thousands

636
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:37,359
you have the rapid market eventually got

637
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,200
the

638
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:42,000
micro satellites markers we had afop

639
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,200
markers

640
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,960
and then we had dark markers which is

641
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,319
some kind of the

642
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:53,360
array-based paperbase more or less

643
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:55,519
and you could do qtl maps there were

644
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:57,359
association mapping you started a lot of

645
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:00,480
that was done

646
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:01,359
and now they you have clipper race you

647
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,079
also have

648
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:04,959
the frequency on our entire genome which

649
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:08,558
has

650
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:12,640
become cheaper and

651
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:14,639
practically feasible nowadays

652
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,320
and right now we have you know most of

653
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,278
the major crops have been

654
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,839
have been sequenced the wheat the barley

655
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,599
rye

656
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:26,798
oats has been done rapeseed is done

657
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:31,519
many other crops

658
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:34,319
we also have genomic frequencies of the

659
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,200
of the more or less good resolution

660
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:38,000
quality

661
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,000
but they are there

662
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:46,240
and of course uh there's

663
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,919
as i said there's no lack of markers to

664
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,880
be used in terms reading what was

665
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,000
missing

666
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,960
was some kind of theoretical

667
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,240
or conceptual or methodological

668
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,519
framework

669
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,919
to use markers in a good way in plant

670
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:01,918
breeding

671
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:09,038
and that's happened you could say with

672
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:09,038
the advent of genomic selection

673
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:12,879
and usually you take this public the

674
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:16,319
publication of this

675
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,679
paper into year 2000 as a starting point

676
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:21,678
of genomic selection

677
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,880
or in 2001 it was not an entirely new

678
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,880
idea at the time

679
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,480
there had been similar ideas around for

680
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,399
a while

681
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,640
but this was the first time that someone

682
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:32,719
really sort of formulated

683
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,679
a coherent idea of genomic collection

684
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,680
and this was

685
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,120
of course looking at

686
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,919
[Music]

687

00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,960
say

689
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,799
that here that it was concluded that

690
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,960
selection and genetic values predicted

691
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:48,558
for markets could substantially increase

692
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,440
the rate of genetic gain

693
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:53,599
in animals and plants especially if

694
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,960
combined with reproductive

695
00:29:53,599 --> 00:30:00,000
the generation interval so they

696
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,079
realized that selection accuracy

697
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,038
and with green cycle time were the

698
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:05,918
important

699
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:05,919
parameters here

700
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,159
now if you're not familiar with genomic

701
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,200
selection

702
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:16,000
this is a very short sort of

703
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,519
course in genomic selection at the heart

704
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,720
of genomic selection is a prediction

705
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:20,480
model

706
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,399
which is a statistical device that

707
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,558
allows you to predict

708
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:28,158
phenotypes basically or breeding values

709
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:28,158
from genetic marketing

710
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:35,119
and what you need to

711
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,960
to build a prediction model is some kind

712
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,719
of data and you get that data from a

713
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,960
trading population

714
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,000
that from which you collect phenotypes

715
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,679
and you collect genotypes

716
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,359
then you take that and you build your

717
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,840
prediction model

718
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:51,839
and then you go to your breeding

719
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:51,839
population

720
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,599
then you genotype your brain population

721
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,798
and you

722
00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:00,319
plug those genotypic data into your

723
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:05,599
prediction model

724
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:08,079
and you can predict phenotype

725
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:09,359
it's a very simple concept really even

726
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:12,158
though the statistics

727
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,839
behind it uh can be extremely

728
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,960
complicated and also

729
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:18,158
the question of how to apply genomic

730
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,740
selection in a practical

731
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,440
breeding program can be challenging

732
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:25,519
[Music]

733
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,640
so genomic selection is different from

734
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,240
from what we

735
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,840
usually call a marker assistant

736
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,798
selection that is

737
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:35,119
to use small supermarkets maybe just one

738
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:38,720
mark or a few markers to

739
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:40,319
do tagged trades in a breeding program

740
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,839
and that idea has been around

741
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:46,158
around since the markets were invented

742
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:48,879
since the isofine era really in the

743
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,880
1980s

744
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,519
and the reason one of the main reasons

745
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,200
why market assistance selection really

746
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,720
hasn't taken off that much in plant

747
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,558
breeding is that

748
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,558
it's really not useful for highly

749
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:03,430
polygenic traits traits that are

750
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:04,639
controlled by hundreds of genes

751
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:06,640
[Music]

752
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,159
that can't be handled by markers system

753
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,080
selection whereas they are

754
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,840
sort of made for genomic selection more

755
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,759
or less

756
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:15,359
a marker assisted selection furthermore

757
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:17,200
you have to detect first

758
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:18,558
your market rate associations you have

759
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,360
to develop some kind of

760
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:22,158
mapping population either by current

761
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:24,959
population

762
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,278
or a association mapping panel or

763
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,880
something like that

764
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,519
whereas in genomic selection you just

765
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,840
don't it's just implicit in the model

766
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,558
but

767
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:35,359
somewhere in your data there is an

768
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:37,839
association

769
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,798
there is a linkage between some of your

770
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:42,240
markers at least

771
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:45,839
and on the tree

772
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,240
uh usually miss the minor qgl's when you

773
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:51,278
do

774
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:54,240
uh market trade association studies um

775
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:54,480
in uh selection units well that's maybe

776
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,599
a

777
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,919
more philosophical way of looking at it

778
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:59,678
but

779
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,120
usually you select you build the

780
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,278
genotype

781
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:04,398
basically in genomic collection but you

782
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:06,880
build

783
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:08,959
you collect the good genes in a line or

784
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,200
a variety

785
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,319
and what is most important i think is

786
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,558
that really

787
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:16,000
genomic selection allows you to make

788
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:19,440
significant reductions

789
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:24,720
in reading cycle time and that has large

790
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,399
effect as we have seen on genetic change

791
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,360
of course if you read magazines like

792
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:32,479
this you will have seen that

793
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:36,639
genomics has been very very

794
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,640
valuable in animal breeding

795
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,038
the value of cows have increased a lot

796
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:45,200
you can see here on the top right that

797
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:47,440
the average well that's the average gain

798
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,440
and it's not genetic gain it's it's a

799
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,519
monetary gain per year has increased a

800
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,200
lot since

801
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,038
the introduction of genomic selection in

802
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,798
encounter breeding

803
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:59,679
and also that the generation interval

804
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:03,918
has gone down particularly for both

805
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:06,880
since uh you can't really

806
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,639
phenotype both many traits such as milk

807
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,960
production for example you have to

808
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,399
be in fact the offspring the daughters

809
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,760
and that takes a long time and if you

810
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:15,679
can do it with

811
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,520
with a genomic prediction instead you

812
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,559
save a lot of time you can have a

813
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:23,599
much shorter generation

814
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:26,320
so it has had a significant effect in

815
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,000
animal breeding

816
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,679
but the concreting has been slower to

817
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,838
take up

818
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:38,960
genomic selection and

819
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:42,000
impractical plant-breeding programs

820
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,838
and uh they've been being questioned if

821
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,358
genomic selection has a future at all

822
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:48,639
when plant breeding these are two

823
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:48,960
animal breeding researchers in sweden

824
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,159
that

825
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,639
wrote this paper a couple of years ago

826
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,960
uh and the reasons i asked that question

827
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,838
is that

828
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,400
animal and plant breeding are quite

829
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:02,320
different

830
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,960
in their how they are structured and

831
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,960
built up

832
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:10,480
uh this is

833
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:13,039
from a publication by from john hickey a

834
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,240
couple of years ago animal breeding

835
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:19,279
animal breeding you focus quite a lot on

836
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:23,039
uh population improvement rapid

837
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:25,359
recurrent selection cycles

838
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:27,358
and from which it's illustrated by this

839
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:31,519
the wheel on top of the pyramid there

840
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:32,319
to to the to your left so rapid cycles

841
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:34,400
of the

842
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,160
mating selection mating selection

843
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,599
amazing selection and then

844
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:42,000
from that cycle you sort of extract

845
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,760
uh the producers the animal that's

846
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,280
actually going to produce the milk of

847
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,280
the meat or whatever it is

848
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,960
whereas whereas plant breeding has

849
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:54,480
focused quite a lot

850
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:57,599
particularly for cereals in breadcrumbs

851
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:01,280
online development the slow

852
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:06,480
process of inbreeding and development of

853
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,480
inbred lines extensive field testing

854
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,800
and very slow

855
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:14,079
[Music]

856
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:18,320
breathing cycles really

857
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:21,119
and for this reason uh

858
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,838
animal breeders have been more focused

859
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,200
on

860
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:28,960
quantitative genetics quantitative

861
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:31,919
genetic approaches to their work

862
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,159
uh things like project testing

863
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:38,079
estimation of breeding values

864
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:40,960
uh mixed model analysis all that stuff

865
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:42,480
i've seen sort of the routine work for

866
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,519
animal breeders

867
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,760
whereas plant breeding has sort of

868
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:49,759
drifted more and more into the hands of

869
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,880
agronomy

870
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,320
uh particularly you know as i said the

871
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,039
extensive field testing

872
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,039
things like that

873
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,838
or at least in in europe that has become

874
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,000
uh

875
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:05,440
so the plant breeding has become a job

876
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,639
for agronomists

877
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:11,440
to a large extent and many agronomists

878
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:13,838
do not have solid statistical training

879
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,710
it's not in europe

880
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:16,880
so

881
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:23,838
[Music]

882
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:23,838
genetic knowledge has

883
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:29,389
[Music]

884
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:39,040
which i think is one reason why

885
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:39,039
suddenly when this genomic selection

886
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,559
bomb explodes in the case of plant

887
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:46,480
breeders i don't

888
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:48,799
really know what to do with it um

889
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,079
because they're not really trained to

890
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,079
think in those terms

891
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,838
and it's also at least from my

892
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:59,199
experience

893
00:37:55,838 --> 00:38:02,320
working now almost 15 years in practical

894
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:06,239
bank reading there are other reasons

895
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:08,480
which are more emotional than rational

896
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,479
uh when it comes to accepting things

897
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,159
like genomic selection and that's

898
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,400
something i call the cultural psychology

899
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:17,039
of something

900
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,720
because if you for example if you google

901
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:20,320
plant reader

902
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:22,078
and you look at your image results you

903
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,400
typically find something like this

904
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,920
this is a typical plant breeder you know

905
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,358
someone looking

906
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,519
in the field or in the greenhouse

907
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:32,880
looking intensely at the crop

908
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:32,880
in this case if

909
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,838
that image is exactly or

910
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:43,760
not very far removed from the image you

911
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:43,759
can see in 1912 100 years ago

912
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,320
even though at that time it was mostly

913
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:50,160
men who looked intensely at

914
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,920
something in this case i think about

915
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:54,799
here

916
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,240
and this is how many people at least in

917
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,599
europe tend to think about plant

918
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:00,879
breeders

919
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:03,760
and nowadays i think this

920
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,720
is a modern day plant breeder and we

921
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:09,760
just

922
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:09,759
last week hired a person a plant breeder

923
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,119
to sit in front of the computer

924
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:17,118
most of the time and develop prediction

925
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,880
models i think it's the first fan

926
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,720
breeder in our company that

927
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,720
will not have to wear boots

928
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,280
so there's a cultural shift here and

929
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:33,359
at least in my experience the our plan

930
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,359
predecess has a hard time accepting this

931
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:37,920
now let me just finish by giving you

932
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:40,319
some quick examples from

933
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,639
how we built up genomic selection how we

934
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:46,000
built up the old training program

935
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:49,679
uh using genomic collection i

936
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,559
can't go into uh the most secret details

937
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,078
here but i will

938
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:54,880
try to give you an idea at least of how

939
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:57,519
we were thinking

940
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,640
so we had this oats 2.0 the the

941
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:01,199
old-school breeding

942
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:02,719
traditional breeding setup where we had

943
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,358
earlier generations in the field and

944
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:05,039
then

945
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:06,960
i walked up and down here and selected

946
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:07,599
the best ones and what i thought were

947
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,079
the best ones

948
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:13,280
turned out they were not for this one

949
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:17,599
and then we did the yield trials

950
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:19,200
it was slow it was evidently inefficient

951
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,039
and it had what i call the low

952
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:23,118
information content

953
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:24,480
by which i mean that we didn't really

954
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,800
learn very much

955
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,639
by walking up and down this field every

956
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,800
from year to year

957
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:34,000
[Music]

958
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:38,000
so we replaced those early generations

959
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,719
with greenhouse grown single siege uh

960
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,719
propagated

961
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:49,039
light material and

962
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:52,480
we genotyped every single one of them

963
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:56,159
and we based our selection on

964
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,159
uh predicted phenotypes

965
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:02,559
we were able to do to go from cross

966
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:03,838
to field trials to to what you see on

967
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:07,519
the right

968
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:09,279
in three years so in year

969
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:10,559
one we did the cross in year three we

970
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,760
had the field

971
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:15,119
trials and we still do the field trials

972
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,560
because

973
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:21,680
one we have to validate our

974
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:23,279
our predictions and to

975
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:25,440
the final test will always be a

976
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,800
phenotypic test

977
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,519
uh and also we use the information from

978
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,440
the field

979
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:34,000
trials to update our prediction model so

980
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,720
it's a it's a continuous updating our

981
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,440
our models

982
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:38,480
are used in the sales trial which means

983
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,200
that we also put

984
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,039
bad stuff in the in the things lines we

985
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,559
know will never become a variety

986
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:49,039
we put in the yield class because we

987
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:52,259
need the data

988
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:54,159
and so this is uh

989
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:57,520
[Music]

990
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:57,519
one example it's now

991
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:05,680
one or two years old the accuracy of

992
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:08,239
uh predicted yield so on the

993
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:09,838
y-axis the vertical axis you have

994
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:13,358
predicted grain yield

995
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:15,599
in the f4 and on the image to the left

996
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:16,719
you will see the f4 generation that is

997
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,800
where

998
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:20,799
that material we did the prediction

999
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,319
and then then two years later we had the

1000
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:29,039
f8 population in the field

1001
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:31,519
and we could compare the predicted

1002
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:34,719
phenotypes or the predicted yield

1003
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:38,239
with the observed deals we have what we

1004
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:38,239
think a pretty good correlation here

1005
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:45,599
the cost per line of genotyping was at

1006
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:48,399
that time 25 dollars

1007
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,280
and it's interesting to compare to this

1008
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,039
graph

1009
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,960
on your left hand side now

1010
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:56,079
again in that graph you have the

1011
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,119
observed grade

1012
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:02,160
yield in the f8 of the x-axis

1013
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,760
and on the y-axis you have instead the

1014
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:08,719
observed grain yield

1015
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,720
the year before in the very same lines

1016
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,480
and the accuracy of what we can call a

1017
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:18,399
phenotypic prediction

1018
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,719
and the accuracy of a genomic prediction

1019
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,200
are well they're they're the same

1020
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:26,959
they're equally good

1021
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:27,919
just that the phenotypic prediction

1022
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,960
costs

1023
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:35,519
six times as much and you cannot do it

1024
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:40,639
you have you cannot do it too much later

1025
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:42,000
in the process

1026
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:45,358
and of course the breeder's prediction

1027
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,199
was zero so that's pretty useless

1028
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:49,039
what else can we predict we can predict

1029
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:51,519
the number of traits here

1030
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:52,960
all those traits that i couldn't predict

1031
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:55,838
and we can now predict

1032
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,838
with markers instead

1033
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,839
now of course you see a variation in in

1034
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,559
the prediction accuracy between

1035
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:02,318
different traits

1036
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:04,650
and that probably has to do with with

1037
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:06,559
the genetics of those traits

1038
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:09,920
[Music]

1039
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:10,719
some traits we get very uh good strong

1040
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,639
uh

1041
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:14,078
accurate predictions that's concept for

1042
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:16,000
example which is

1043
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,318
more or less impossible to see in the

1044
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,920
field with the eye

1045
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:23,039
we can predict with a with a high

1046
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,720
probability or a higher accuracy

1047
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:26,318
and also these are some examples from

1048
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:29,838
spring wheat

1049
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:33,119
which is bread a crop that we breed

1050
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:35,519
for baking quality and baking quality

1051
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,039
is something that's built up of many

1052
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:40,079
different

1053
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:41,599
sub traits because they down yield a

1054
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,760
bread volume and glucose and index and

1055
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,960
falling number and sedimentation and

1056
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:49,280
all those stuff that are

1057
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,960
absolutely impossible to observe in the

1058
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,200
field but with an eye

1059
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,480
which we can now predict using markers

1060
00:44:53,199 --> 00:45:00,078
and steps

1061
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:00,079
with a good enough accuracy we think

1062
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,318
and of course this is not i mean

1063
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:08,000
everything we did was very home-cooked

1064
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:09,279
but we made it up ourselves more or less

1065
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,960
but i mean this has been

1066
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,480
corroborated in many studies it's just

1067
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,920
one example of a big study

1068
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,280
in wheat more or less a global study

1069
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,440
week

1070
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,440
that has shown that you can predict a

1071
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,519
large number of trades with

1072
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,079
with very good accuracies i mean around

1073
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:28,920
0.5.6 for for many

1074
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:30,318
even complex trades so

1075
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,838
[Music]

1076
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:34,000
it's not what we see in our breaking

1077
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:37,119
program it's not an artifact it's it's

1078
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,639
for real and we need this uh sort of

1079
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,200
evidence to be able to

1080
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:43,118
convince our readers the more

1081
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:45,039
traditionally minded ones that

1082
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,838
economic selection is actually very very

1083
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:47,838
promising

1084
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,838
way of doing reading finally i just want

1085
00:45:54,318 --> 00:46:00,318
to mention that we can also

1086
00:45:55,838 --> 00:46:02,960
work on predicting crosses of course

1087
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:04,159
in the old school plant reading in that

1088
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,199
region 2.0

1089
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:10,639
uh cross prediction which means which

1090
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:13,039
parent shall i combine which mom should

1091
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:16,719
i cross with which dad

1092
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:19,920
was pretty much up to breeder guesswork

1093
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:22,399
you could have two high yielding parents

1094
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,440
for example but you wouldn't know if

1095
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,920
they had complementary yield alleles or

1096
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,039
genes or if they had the same ones and

1097
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,480
the same ones

1098
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:32,480
there would be no points in crossing

1099
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,000
them if they had complimentary ones

1100
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,639
there would be a point across them of

1101
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,159
course you could have recommend

1102
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:40,480
transgressive segregation in the

1103
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:43,118
offspring

1104
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,639
and so it's the reason why you do uh

1105
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,838
hundreds and hundred different classes

1106
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:47,598
each year is that you

1107
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:49,039
simply don't really know which ones to

1108
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:52,318
cost

1109
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:56,480
uh uh and it has

1110
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:56,480
even become a bit of a status along

1111
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,480
each year how many do you do and if you

1112
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,480
then only do 300 classes each year

1113
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:10,559
say that uh

1114
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,240
but if you think about it we we release

1115
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:15,440
maybe one or two

1116
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:18,479
new oat varieties each year

1117
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:23,200
and if the merit of those varieties

1118
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:26,719
is is due to genetics

1119
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:28,879
then it is in principles predictable

1120
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,480
knowable which crosses we should make so

1121
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,200
it should it could be

1122
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:36,400
sufficient sufficient for doing just one

1123
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:36,399
or two crosses each year

1124
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,880
and we try to increase sort of

1125
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,480
the knowability or the prediction the

1126
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,000
predictability of crosses

1127
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:50,079
that we use by the stimulating classes

1128
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
so nowadays or up to now we could do

1129
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,839
about a couple of hundred lines

1130
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,960
a couple of hundred combinations and a

1131
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:55,599
couple of hundred progeny per

1132
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,079
combination

1133
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:59,599
and we would have some maybe ten

1134
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,839
thousand or fifty thousand

1135
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,838
offspring like the ones in the roast in

1136
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:06,400
the field i showed you before

1137
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:08,318
that would be uh evaluated by visual

1138
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,079
inspection

1139
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:15,679
nowadays we can simulate to do the

1140
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:17,440
crossing in silicon this graph is an

1141
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:20,558
example

1142
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,559
we have here 3500 something like that

1143
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:25,440
lined with snip data

1144
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:27,440
that gives you about six million

1145
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:31,039
pairwise combinations

1146
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:34,400
that you can do in silicon not in

1147
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:36,480
reality we have simulated 500 offspring

1148
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,400
per combination so each dot you see is

1149
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,599
mean value of 500

1150
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:44,639
offspring 6 million crosses so we have

1151
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:47,519
evaluated around 3 billion offspring

1152
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:48,879
for a number of trades here all the

1153
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:49,519
trades that we have prediction models

1154
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,880
for

1155
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:53,358
basically and on in the graph you have

1156
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,240
on the x

1157
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:57,838
axis here the yield and on the y axis

1158
00:48:56,239 --> 00:48:59,279
you have the volume weight for example

1159
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:00,558
two important trades and then you can

1160
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,079
select which crosses

1161
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:03,920
you want to make and then here in this

1162
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:06,880
particular example you have to do some

1163
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:09,440
cradles between yield and volume weights

1164
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,440
and it's just up to you know

1165
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,000
your priorities which classes you want

1166
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,000
to make here

1167
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,839
but it does give you the possibility of

1168
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,480
doing

1169
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:22,639
uh billions of classes in in the

1170
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:26,559
computer before you actually do them in

1171
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:31,039
reality and so

1172
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:32,800
the consequence of this

1173
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:35,279
development from the implementation of

1174
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:39,599
dynamic prediction models in breeding

1175
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:42,559
has led us to structuring our

1176
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:45,359
plant breeding in a way that is more

1177
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:47,920
animal breathing like

1178
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:47,920
sorry sorry

1179
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:54,800
so now we have divided

1180
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:58,639
[Music]

1181
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:00,720
before i should say twin 2.0 is

1182
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:01,920
what you see on the right hand side here

1183
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:03,439
there's the

1184
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,838
typical pedigree reading program

1185
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:08,960
structure

1186
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:11,920
now you are building up a

1187
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,639
process to do what the animal breeders

1188
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,440
do

1189
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:16,558
the population improvement part which is

1190
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:20,639
a rapid

1191
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:20,640
cycling and prediction

1192
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:26,559
selection cycles

1193
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:28,399
so you cross you predict you select

1194
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,720
across your predicted select

1195
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,720
very quickly and you should if you

1196
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:33,679
combine that with speed breathing

1197
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:37,118
techniques

1198
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:39,039
uh uh growing in your plan

1199
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:42,240
growth chambers under very controlled

1200
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:45,279
circumstances you can have

1201
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:48,399
four up to six generations a year

1202
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:51,920
which means that you can reduce your

1203
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:55,280
green cycle even to below a year

1204
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:59,119
and from that cycle from that wheel

1205
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:02,800
we extract their lines to go into the

1206
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:04,960
ordinary traditional yield trials

1207
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,000
for the final selection of varieties but

1208
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,440
also to provide

1209
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,039
data for the prediction models and so

1210
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,079
now atlanta we have

1211
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:15,599
actually organized ourselves in two

1212
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,640
groups

1213
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:21,280
that we call variety development groups

1214
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:22,799
that are populated mostly by agronomists

1215
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,640
and they work with

1216
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,000
all our different crops and they do the

1217
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:28,078
field trials and they do

1218
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,358
the final you know selection of the

1219
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:32,640
varieties

1220
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:34,639
and all that and we have one group

1221
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:36,078
which is we call the population

1222
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:39,358
improvement groups

1223
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:39,359
group which is now

1224
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:46,318
where statistical geneticists work

1225
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:49,200
and they spend their time doing

1226
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:53,119
prediction models basically

1227
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:56,480
and uh i am sort of heading

1228
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:59,358
uh that group right now and uh we are

1229
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:01,838
so many people but we are we were hiring

1230
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:04,960
more people over the years because

1231
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:08,639
as more and more of our crops fit

1232
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:10,400
into this scheme we will work more and

1233
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:14,480
more on population improvement

1234
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:18,960
for the two-part queening program

1235
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:20,800
and to be a bit from

1236
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,639
take some big words in my mouth i can

1237
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,240
see that i think the genomic prediction

1238
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:26,318
is really the grand union card theory of

1239
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:30,399
genetic improvement

1240
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:32,960
it's something that cuts across crops

1241
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,318
you're not sort of in your cross silo

1242
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:37,199
any longer you're not

1243
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:39,279
expert or weak expert or bond expert you

1244
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:40,439
can work across crops you can even

1245
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,559
work across

1246
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:46,400
[Music]

1247
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:48,880
the plant animal divide

1248
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,000
so we need a lot more of a lot more

1249
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,200
people

1250
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,239
statistical geneticists

1251
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:57,358
bioinformaticians people like that

1252
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:58,838
i think have a bright future in both

1253
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:02,639
animal and plant breeding

1254
00:52:58,838 --> 00:53:04,000
and to me that's very exciting it's very

1255
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:07,199
promising

1256
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,599
for the future and

1257
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:12,239
that's without it i want to stay today

1258
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,240
thank you very much

1259
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:18,800
thank you elf very interesting um

1260
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,079
i can open up the floor for questions

1261
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:24,160
now

1262
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:26,318
um if you wish you can put your

1263
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:28,318
questions in the chat box

1264
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:30,800
or you can just raise your hand and

1265
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:33,920
speak up

1266
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:37,440
alpha i had a question about

1267
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:40,639
um la manan

1268
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,318
um i know you work on several crops but

1269
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:44,480
do you typically have just one breeder

1270
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:47,838
per crop or do you often have

1271
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:51,440
more than one breeder per crop

1272
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:55,119
well we have mostly one wheel

1273
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:56,318
crop we have so in wheat for example we

1274
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:57,760
have one

1275
00:53:56,318 --> 00:53:59,279
green wheat and one winter wheat flour

1276
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,920
so that's two weeks two week readers

1277
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,920
basically

1278
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:07,358
then we have two barley burritos as well

1279
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:09,358
other than that are typically one

1280
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:11,199
breeder

1281
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:12,639
and how many testing stations do you

1282
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:16,159
have in sweden

1283
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:20,400
and in in europe

1284
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:23,279
in sweden we have well

1285
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,280
first of all we have our own stations 3d

1286
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:28,800
stations

1287
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,800
and we have uh

1288
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:32,719
sweden it's not a very big country so we

1289
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,800
have three

1290
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:37,199
you know three breeding stations that we

1291
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,599
own in sweden

1292
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:41,439
and one breeding station that we own in

1293
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:43,440
the netherlands

1294
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:46,559
and then we sort of use service

1295
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,559
providers for other

1296
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:54,880
for the other locations so we have

1297
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:54,880
in oats for example we have i think

1298
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:01,358
some 15 to 20 location across europe and

1299
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:06,960
we have

1300
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:09,358
five or six locations in canada and uh

1301
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,240
i'm not sure exactly the other crops how

1302
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:13,279
many they have but

1303
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:13,279
something similar i guess

1304
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:19,119
so we try not to own too much land but

1305
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:22,318
we try to buy

1306
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:26,640
services from

1307
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:28,318
uh well trial service providers

1308
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:31,039
every university in general to be a

1309
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:31,039
private company

1310
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:39,838
i i had a question about uh about

1311
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,599
seed increasing when you're using this

1312
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:43,599
rapid uh

1313
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:45,760
when you're growing a bunch of cycles by

1314
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:49,039
single seed descent in the greenhouse

1315
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:51,520
how then do you move quickly from

1316
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:52,480
the single seed or the spike or the

1317
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:54,719
panicle if you're

1318
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,639
doing oats how do you move from that to

1319
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:58,879
an fc to plant out a yield plot

1320
00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:00,480
is that done in the greenhouse or is

1321
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,400
that done with a summer season or a

1322
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,358
counter season nursery

1323
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,720
the combination actually so when we

1324
00:56:05,358 --> 00:56:10,078
harvest the final

1325
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:14,239
single seed generation we

1326
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:17,599
uh plant that in the greenhouse in

1327
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:19,199
in the soil in the greenhouse so we get

1328
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:21,680
we do some kind of hill clocks in the

1329
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:21,679
greenhouse

1330
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,798
and uh so

1331
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:30,159
the final thing you'll see the sun

1332
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:33,759
generation is harvested in

1333
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:37,358
february march the plant is

1334
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:39,839
called greenhouse hill club in april

1335
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:41,358
we harvest them in in august we send

1336
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:44,558
them to new zealand

1337
00:56:41,358 --> 00:56:45,598
and the year after we can get enough

1338
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:50,880
feedback to

1339
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:50,880
plan year trials at six locations

1340
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:56,159
thank you we've had we've had good

1341
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:58,558
experience with new zealand seed

1342
00:56:56,159 --> 00:57:01,199
increases as well

1343
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:02,400
we've got yeah we get we've we've gotten

1344
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:05,679
up to 100 to 1

1345
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,680
seed increase in new zealand

1346
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:09,919
do you have any problems do you ever

1347
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,119
have any problems with seed dormancy

1348
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:15,200
when you're trying to

1349
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:19,039
turn over generations in your greenhouse

1350
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:22,000
no well um well i don't know

1351
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:22,000
it works very well

1352
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:26,798
mark there are a couple questions now in

1353
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:28,239
the chat oh sorry oh yeah thanks

1354
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:30,719
uh yes there are a couple of questions

1355
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:33,279
in the chat box um

1356
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:34,959
from nick morales it says thanks for the

1357
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,200
talk is the genotyping done

1358
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:40,400
in-house and how many snips do you

1359
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:42,480
generally work with

1360
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,720
right now the genotyping is a certain

1361
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,318
person we buy

1362
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:50,798
[Music]

1363
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:53,920
we work you know with a chip

1364
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:55,599
that has about we typically get much

1365
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,838
5000 or so polymorphic

1366
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,838
nets

1367
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:02,239
even though there are more on the jet

1368
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:06,000
we are building up now our capacity to

1369
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:08,639
work

1370
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,358
in-house with genotyping so we would

1371
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:12,558
move to inaudible

1372
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:16,078
which would probably be some kind of

1373
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:16,079
sequence in the fight

1374
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:23,039
another question um from john luke

1375
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:25,359
yannick thank you for this talk are you

1376
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:27,199
still in a phase where you are rapidly

1377
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:28,798
evolving your breeding schemes in

1378
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:30,159
response to the new prediction

1379
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:32,559
opportunities

1380
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:36,159
or do you feel that you are reaching a

1381
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:39,340
new equilibrium

1382
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:42,428
hmm that's a very good question

1383
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:42,429
[Music]

1384
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:49,919
i well we're

1385
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:51,358
getting to an equilibrium i think when

1386
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:54,480
we started

1387
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:58,719
in 2014 with genomic selection

1388
00:58:54,480 --> 00:59:00,798
it was as a way of

1389
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:03,039
doing early generation selection as i

1390
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:05,039
tried to show

1391
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:07,119
since then we have moved more and more

1392
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:09,519
to cross stations

1393
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:11,200
and trying very hard to reduce the

1394
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:13,599
breeding cycle

1395
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:14,318
and we can accept i mean if you have a

1396
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:16,160
very

1397
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:19,838
fast breeding cycle you can accept the

1398
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:19,838
lower prediction occurrences

1399
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,519
so uh but i think

1400
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:27,199
the actually the old treaty program is

1401
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:29,838
beginning to mature at this now

1402
00:59:27,199 --> 00:59:31,118
because we still have we have other

1403
00:59:29,838 --> 00:59:33,920
crops that are more challenging

1404
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:35,440
and the forage crops and you know

1405
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,760
hybrids and the

1406
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,039
cloning crops and stuff like that we

1407
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,880
have not come

1408
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:47,039
as far with the uh

1409
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:50,160
the oats and the streams

1410
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:51,759
so and we don't know how they will help

1411
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:53,920
those breeding programs we look in the

1412
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,920
end

1413
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:59,679
john luke also asked if are you worried

1414
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,639
about loss of genetic diversity with

1415
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:04,318
rapid

1416
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:06,078
cycles yes we are

1417
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:08,000
concerned with that we have to keep an

1418
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:12,000
eye

1419
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,000
on that of course and

1420
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:17,519
i mean one time

1421
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:19,440
if you don't lose in adequate variation

1422
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:20,719
you should be worried

1423
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,440
because then your selection is not

1424
01:00:20,719 --> 01:00:23,439
sufficient enough

1425
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,400
uh but of course you will

1426
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,000
if you have a very efficient selection

1427
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,838
you will lose an expiration you have to

1428
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:36,159
replenish that somehow

1429
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:39,279
and i don't think we have really settled

1430
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:42,719
our mind exactly on how

1431
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:44,240
that should be done have to carry out

1432
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:46,318
simulations and

1433
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:49,679
trials and things like that we're

1434
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:49,679
experimenting quite a lot here

1435
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,319
all the time

1436
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:58,559
you know that's uh how we learn also

1437
01:01:00,798 --> 01:01:07,759
okay we are getting short on time

1438
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:10,959
um so i think

1439
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:12,559
we'll wrap it up there alf and just want

1440
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,159
to

1441
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:16,559
thank you very much for your

1442
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:19,838
presentation and please give my re

1443
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:22,559
regards to pernilla vollendock

1444
01:01:19,838 --> 01:01:25,519
for those in the audience pernillo uh

1445
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:28,640
vollenbach was is a as a

1446
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:31,358
acquaintance uh that uh that

1447
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:32,558
uh she and i thought that it would be

1448
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:34,719
good idea to

1449
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:36,798
to learn more about the landmannan

1450
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:40,000
breeding program and so

1451
01:01:36,798 --> 01:01:41,599
uh alf graciously agreed to give this

1452
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,639
presentation

1453
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:44,880
um pernilla is is one of the breeders at

1454
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:49,039
la

1455
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:51,280
manum so with that i'm gonna

1456
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:52,880
say thank you again and we'll wrap up

1457
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:55,839
this presentation

1458
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:57,358
uh thanks again elf and so long

1459
01:01:55,838 --> 01:02:00,159
