1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,360
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,359
university

3
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:10,879
yeah thank you tony that's a thank you

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:14,558
for that introduction i appreciate

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,320
it um and as as tony said i have uh

6
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,480
been working for the last uh four four

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,960
and a half years on a variety of

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,679
projects uh all sort of within this

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,800
um theme of developing perennial grain

10
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:26,960
cropping systems

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,519
and and even the market opportunities

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,760
that that tony briefly mentioned

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,280
so a good mix of agronomy and

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,320
environmental science

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,840
and even economics but we'll get into

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,878
that a little bit more

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,160
throughout the presentation um so just

18
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:42,558
to give you a brief outline of what

19
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,359
we'll

20
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,718
discuss today i want to provide a brief

21
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,799
overview of

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,079
ecological solutions to agricultural

23
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,878
challenges

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,878
to set the stage then introduce you to

25
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,960
the opportunities and challenges of

26
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,599
perennial grain crops which are new

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,320
but have a lot of promising aspects in

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,800
terms of

29
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,159
sustainability i'll then discuss two of

30
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,560
my research projects

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,400
um one where we were looking at

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,719
intercropping perennials and annuals

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,520
with

34
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,879
medium red clover and another where we

35
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,759
were trying to

36
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,280
mitigate a known yield decline in one of

37
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,319
these perennial crops using strip

38
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,920
tillage

39
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:24,239
in a more mature stand then i'll just

40
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,759
touch on some conclusions and ways that

41
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,118
we might move forward with perennial

42
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,200
grains research

43
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,640
before opening it up for questions at

44
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,000
the end

45
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,159
so everyone here is is likely pretty

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,200
familiar with some of the major

47
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,079
challenges to agricultural

48
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,759
sustainability

49
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,158
particularly from an environmental

50
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,519
perspective which is what we'll largely

51
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,520
focus on here today although my

52
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,599
interests do span into the areas of

53
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,399
social and and economic sustainability

54
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,280
as well

55
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,799
so here on the right we have a figure

56
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,000
that might be familiar to some

57
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,560
um sort of portraying the

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,359
uh planetary boundaries in certain areas

59
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,478
so these are

60
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,920
areas where as scientists um there's

61
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,560
some agreement that we are

62
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,840
exceeding the the carrying capacity of

63
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,280
our planet

64
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,640
and some of those areas might be

65
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,719
nutrient pollution usage of fresh water

66
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,759
land system change and all the effects

67
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,000
that has on

68
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,519
biodiversity and ecosystem function

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,439
climate change of course

70
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,360
and then some areas that were really not

71
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,199
quite as clear on at this point

72
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,239
um and and what i'll point out here is

73
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,679
anywhere where you're seeing it going

74
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,599
into the red we're

75
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,879
anticipating that we've already exceeded

76
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,119
some of these boundaries and

77
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,079
we need to do something uh immediately

78
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,878
to try to

79
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,840
mitigate um and and find solutions to

80
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:39,439
these issues

81
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,439
and then i would also note with this uh

82
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,878
diagram in particular anywhere that has

83
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,120
this sort of speckling

84
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,159
is um sort of the estimate of how much

85
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,319
agriculture

86
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,919
contributes to these problems so you can

87
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,159
see especially in the areas that are

88
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,238
outside in the in the red zone

89
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,519
um agriculture is having quite a large

90
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,080
effect on

91
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,280
uh ecosystems and and the sustainability

92
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,879
of our planet

93
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,360
and so to just discuss a few of those uh

94
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,280
our current industrialized agriculture

95
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,200
um has many issues of soil loss and

96
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,000
degradation over time

97
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,560
water and air pollution due to nutrient

98
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,360
runoff

99
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,840
and greenhouse gas emissions uh as i

100
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,360
mentioned land use change so

101
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,920
deforestation and

102
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,400
the the shifting agriculture when we do

103
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:27,439
run into issues of soil degradation

104
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,280
for example a high reliance on

105
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,039
synthetic fertilizers pesticides and

106
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,400
fossil fuels which

107
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,000
over the long term will not be

108
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,480
sustainable as those resources become

109
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,759
more

110
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:41,199
limited and as things like

111
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:43,039
pesticide resistance develop further

112
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,280
fresh water availability in some areas

113
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,318
of the world is becoming a challenge to

114
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,959
agriculture

115
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,878
and then uh sort of that overall

116
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,039
encompassing threat of climate change

117
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,239
and how we might adapt our systems to

118
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,400
still be productive

119
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,360
um but also resilient uh in the face of

120
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,519
climate change

121
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,640
and then uh sort of i've put in this bar

122
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,560
to sort of separate

123
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,479
uh some of the areas that we think that

124
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,560
perennial grains might contribute

125
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,679
versus some other things like food

126
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,598
security and

127
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,159
other social and economic issues which

128
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:15,119
are heavily entwined in these issues but

129
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,639
might not be solved by simply uh growing

130
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,959
a crop that has some

131
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,560
uh different characteristics

132
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,918
and so uh in particular with food

133
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,120
security i'll highlight that there

134
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:26,959
because

135
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,639
as i'll mention in the future in a few

136
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,079
slides perennial grains currently do

137
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,439
yield less

138
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:35,120
food grain than uh comparable annuals

139
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,719
and so that is one of the drawbacks

140
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,720
currently and it's something that

141
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,919
um is informing a lot of the research

142
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,360
that we're trying to do to both

143
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,839
increase those yields but also think

144
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,280
about how we might balance the

145
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:50,799
the contributions of food

146
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:54,959
versus other services environmental or

147
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:58,400
other ways we can use the crop so

148
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:00,719
broadly um has been suggested that to

149
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,478
counteract some of these threats to

150
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,720
agricultural sustainability

151
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,319
uh we might be able to restore ecosystem

152
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,240
services to cropland so the

153
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,159
uh the concept of ecosystem services

154
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,120
which really became popular after the

155
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:17,199
millennium ecosystem

156
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,439
assessment uh back in 2005 um

157
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,360
really focuses on the the things other

158
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,199
than material goods

159
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,560
that we can well including material

160
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,319
goods but other

161
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,160
materials and other services we can get

162
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,079
from our ecosystems

163
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,600
the the many ways that that human

164
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,478
society is supported by the natural

165
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,400
world

166
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,240
so uh in this in these panels we can

167
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:39,038
sort of think about a couple different

168
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,319
systems so in a natural ecosystem

169
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:46,000
which is maybe modified by humans but is

170
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:48,879
not designed for agricultural production

171
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,519
there may be some amount of food and

172
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,639
other

173
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,399
crop available um so you can think about

174
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,439
foraging in these contexts or

175
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,519
or fisheries or things like that um but

176
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,918
uh there's many other services that are

177
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,079
widely available so forest production

178
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,198
uh natural habitat and biodiversity

179
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,478
water uh

180
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:11,199
air quality but

181
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:13,839
when we when we change those ecosystems

182
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,600
into an intensively managed crop gland

183
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,839
we can really increase the amount of

184
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,280
food or fiber that we produce from those

185
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,519
systems

186
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,399
but we're losing a lot of those other

187
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,719
services

188
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,719
by simplifying the system by going down

189
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,400
to monocultures heavily managed

190
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,759
relying on external inputs as i

191
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,519
mentioned earlier

192
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,800
and in some cases uh you can see these

193
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,240
bubbles are small so

194
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,439
suggesting that there might be services

195
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,560
somewhere some areas there's actually

196
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,959
disservices

197
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,918
so for example water quality might be

198
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:41,918
impaired

199
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:44,399
by an intensive cropland if there's a

200
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:47,439
lot of runoff for nutrient pollution

201
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,959
so really in thinking about

202
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,560
perennial grains they sort of fit into

203
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,638
this area of crop land with restored

204
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,319
ecosystem services where

205
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,400
we're trying to balance that we're still

206
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,360
trying to have a highly productive

207
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,239
agro ecosystem but balance out some of

208
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,280
those

209
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,280
services by diversifying and and

210
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,719
thinking about new ways of managing our

211
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,519
cropland so

212
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,039
we might not get the same uh magnitude

213
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,439
of crop production but where we were

214
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,159
re-um restoring a lot of these other

215
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,519
services

216
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,000
that we can get and uh focusing on

217
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,318
perennial grains um there's a lot of

218
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,240
opportunity at this moment in time

219
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,360
so one thing to think about is that

220
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,400
annual grain crops

221
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,800
are take up about 70 of total global

222
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,560
crop land and account for about 70 of

223
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,038
human food calories if you account for

224
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,439
both

225
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:37,598
direct consumption and animal feed um

226
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,199
and that's that's costly if we think

227
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:40,399
from an environmental perspective if we

228
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,919
think about all those

229
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:47,038
um detriments of intensive cropland

230
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:48,959
environmentally on the previous slide

231
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,399
but with recent advances in breeding and

232
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,318
biotechnology

233
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,839
perennial grains are really reaching the

234
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,800
point where they could be commercially

235
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,119
viable

236
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,120
and there is a mounting support both

237
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,240
amongst the agricultural community and

238
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,478
consumers

239
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,160
to have a more multi-functional

240
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,719
agriculture that can

241
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,080
provide things other than just uh food

242
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,960
and

243
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:12,560
calories and then and then finally there

244
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,959
has been some research done

245
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,038
showing evidence for perennial crops as

246
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,839
part of an integrated cropping system

247
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:22,560
um being more resilient and adaptive to

248
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,560
climate change

249
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,759
and then on top of all of that there's

250
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:30,799
been a big push both from the

251
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,280
food industry and from research funders

252
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,120
to

253
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,478
to support some of these projects seeing

254
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,679
that these uh

255
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,800
certain perennial grains are right on

256
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:41,199
the cusp of breaking into the market

257
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,639
um one in particular that i i've worked

258
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,519
with and you'll hear about a lot is

259
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:45,679
kurza

260
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,200
or a type of intermediate wheatgrass

261
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:48,799
that has been

262
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,399
put into the first commercial food

263
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,479
product available

264
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,919
uh this long route l from patagonia

265
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,399
provisions

266
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:58,399
also cascadian farms which is an organic

267
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,480
branch of general mills

268
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:05,039
has really jumped on to kernsa and is

269
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,519
in r d with breakfast cereals they did a

270
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:10,079
kickstarter campaign with one of those

271
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,959
cereal bars other products the one of

272
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,278
their goals

273
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,479
like ultimately that they've stated is

274
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:16,399
to have kurnza

275
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,480
in your your cheerios in your breakfast

276
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,159
cereal at some point in the future so

277
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,080
they they really do see the value of

278
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:25,120
this um both

279
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,080
to diversify what what they're using in

280
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,519
their

281
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,879
supply chain but also to satisfy certain

282
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,879
commitments they've made

283
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,879
for corporate sustainability

284
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,919
from a from a research funding

285
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,519
perspective you might have seen things

286
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,159
like this cornell chronicle article

287
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,200
about

288
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:45,199
um a grant that uh that matt

289
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,399
and and other collaborators received

290
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,399
recently um we have here a picture of

291
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,839
uh kerns of bread from wide awake bakery

292
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,278
from one of our research

293
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:57,200
projects we also recently in the last

294
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:01,039
couple months

295
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,440
learned of a 10 million usda cap grant

296
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:05,919
going towards the development of a

297
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,560
current kerns of consortium across many

298
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:10,319
institutions and so there's a lot of

299
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,958
momentum in this area and so it really

300
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,240
does

301
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,838
um provide an opportunity to make a

302
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,159
difference

303
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,519
uh and just to iterate these are all of

304
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,838
the institutions uh

305
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,000
in that in at least in 2018 we're

306
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:28,959
working on perennial grain development

307
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,958
um and so here we are in in cornell

308
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,040
so to get in to a little bit more detail

309
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,800
about why perennial grains have all

310
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:38,399
these environmental benefits um

311
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:39,439
one thing to to note is the having crops

312
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,039
in the ground year round

313
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,519
and and many of these perennials have

314
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,919
more extensive root systems than annuals

315
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,320
to aid in their persistence can really

316
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:52,000
contribute to soil health so

317
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,920
here in this diagram thinking about a

318
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,839
potential crop rotation of perennials

319
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,639
with annuals

320
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,160
after several rotations of annual crops

321
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,799
where the soil may have been somewhat

322
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,838
depleted

323
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:06,240
of organic matter

324
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,600
planting a perennial that over its uh

325
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,320
three maybe five to ten year lifespan

326
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,200
can can contribute to restored soil

327
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,440
health there's

328
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,200
not less tillage during that period

329
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,040
there's more opportunity for

330
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,320
for crop biomass to go back into the

331
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:23,439
soil

332
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,800
can restore that soil health and lead to

333
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:30,320
an overall cycling of soil health

334
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:33,759
throughout time in this in this rotation

335
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,000
another potential uh use is uh in areas

336
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,120
that are particularly prone to erosion

337
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,839
um or areas where um infiltration can be

338
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,639
important so

339
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,720
here you see an annual crop which is

340
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,039
like most of the the water especially in

341
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,079
the

342
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:50,639
the off season so after the crops been

343
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:51,278
um harvested and there's just stubble

344
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,639
remaining

345
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:55,039
there's a lot of potential for soil

346
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,720
detachment and erosion and less

347
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:58,719
potential for that water to actually

348
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,959
infiltrate back into the ground water

349
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,560
versus a perennial which throughout the

350
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:06,399
year has a has green biomass growing and

351
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,319
roots deep into the soil there'll be

352
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,879
much less runoff and also the potential

353
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,160
for

354
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,759
higher infiltration and then you can

355
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,639
think a little bit further than just the

356
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:16,559
perennial crop

357
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,320
on its own here on the left there might

358
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,559
be potential for things like

359
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,000
uh grazing and dual purpose use which

360
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,879
i'll mention

361
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,480
but also the possibility of perennial

362
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,838
polycultures and how

363
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,839
uh diversifying within the field can add

364
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:36,160
to things like like pollinator

365
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:38,560
um or even uh other uh wildlife habitat

366
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,559
and so you could see this as a continuum

367
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:44,159
from the monoculture perennial

368
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:46,638
uh to maybe a dual crop of a perennial

369
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,278
cereal and a perennial legume

370
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,240
to a completely integrated system that

371
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,639
might have

372
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,159
a variety of different uh plants with

373
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,959
different functionalities

374
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,240
um that gets a little bit more complex

375
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:01,039
in terms of management

376
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,799
uh so for the focus of where i am at

377
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:05,599
right now with my research

378
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,799
um we are sort of focusing on this area

379
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,000
here where we can

380
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:12,479
think about inter-cropping and how

381
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,120
you might have complementarity between a

382
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,680
grass

383
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,679
a grain crop and a nitrogen-fixing

384
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,639
legume and in general

385
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,559
like i said at the beginning things like

386
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,079
low grain yield are a challenge for

387
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:27,759
perennial systems these

388
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:30,078
these are new these are new crops and

389
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,958
they don't have the the decade centuries

390
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,599
of uh development of the cropping system

391
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,838
the

392
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,639
investment in infrastructure for the

393
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,920
market

394
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:43,198
the uh understanding of uh things

395
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:45,759
like how to establish and uh harvest

396
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:47,198
the stand so there's there's a lot of

397
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,439
agronomic challenges there's there's

398
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:51,439
some logistic challenges

399
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,880
there's things like fewer pest

400
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,279
management options without being

401
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,360
able to rotate crops as frequently or

402
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,120
use tillage as a as a tool for weed

403
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,399
management for example

404
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,759
but there are opportunities as i

405
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,600
mentioned having a year ground

406
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,679
year-round ground cover

407
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,079
and those deep root systems can really

408
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:10,159
help protect the water in the soil

409
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:11,120
the dual purpose use for grain and

410
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,639
forage production

411
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,000
in the same year utilizing some areas

412
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,079
that might not be suitable for

413
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
annual row crafting areas that might be

414
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:22,799
more sloped or close to

415
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,198
bodies of water and then there's likely

416
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:25,439
some

417
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,559
some advantages in terms of fewer field

418
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,240
operations so

419
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,679
by planting once and then harvesting

420
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,399
from the same stand for

421
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,719
many years uh you can avoid having that

422
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,278
annual cycle of tillage and replanting

423
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,680
which

424
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:38,480
for farmers can become a bit of a crunch

425
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:40,799
during the

426
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,079
that high demand period for for

427
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:43,599
management on the farm so

428
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:48,399
there might be some labor there might be

429
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,399
some um energy savings as well

430
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,039
and so if you uh recall back to the the

431
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,159
title of this we're thinking about

432
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:58,159
perennial grains

433
00:14:54,159 --> 00:15:01,278
through a systems ecology perspective so

434
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:03,120
i created this uh systems diagram

435
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:06,559
very early on in my time at cornell just

436
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,078
to help me conceptualize the system and

437
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,198
you could if you took a very close look

438
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:10,559
there's probably a lot of things that

439
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:12,559
are missing here

440
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,759
you add too many linkages between things

441
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:14,479
it starts to look like a pile of

442
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,278
spaghetti

443
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,680
but uh basically the point is that um

444
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:20,399
with

445
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:22,319
within the system there's there's the

446
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,278
the crop field itself there's plants

447
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,399
there's soil

448
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:28,399
there's other organisms there's all of

449
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,919
the assets owned by the farmer that go

450
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,039
into planting harvesting

451
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,319
processing um the the crop but then

452
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,559
there's all these external

453
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,079
inputs some of which are purchased and

454
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,239
some of which are natural

455
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:41,278
and so the balance between what's

456
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,320
natural

457
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:47,360
and renewable uh input uh

458
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,278
can uh be a trade-off with some of these

459
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,360
other purchased inputs and

460
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:52,958
uh the system can be supported by

461
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,159
interactions within the system

462
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,838
to make some of these external things

463
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,360
more or less important in the overall

464
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:03,120
production system so

465
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,120
you could think of things like

466
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:09,360
external soil amendments being added to

467
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,639
improve the fertility of the soil but if

468
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,519
the the soil

469
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,440
um ecosystem is healthy enough then

470
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,360
there might be less need for those so

471
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,680
there's a lot going on here but it's

472
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,720
it's really thinking about how the

473
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,399
system as a whole

474
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,600
all the pieces interact to make

475
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,278
something that's that's greater than

476
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,360
each of those individual parts

477
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:28,958
and so we don't really want to focus in

478
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,440
just on the the crop

479
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,879
plants and and how we can get the most

480
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,040
productivity out of them

481
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,480
we also need to think about all these

482
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,000
other aspects and so here i've

483
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,720
highlighted some areas that

484
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,360
i've really focused on with my phd

485
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,600
research

486
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,560
thinking about soil health and how

487
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,720
perennials

488
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:47,919
might be different than annuals in that

489
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,519
respect how

490
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:54,319
the non-crop plants weeds might

491
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,560
interact with the the crop plants or you

492
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,278
could even think of non-crop plants as

493
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:00,319
things like a forage legume which may

494
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:02,559
not be providing

495
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,640
a grain yield but is is also

496
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,318
contributing to the overall system

497
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,160
obviously we are looking at the

498
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,318
productivity of the crop

499
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,798
and then the economic side of things and

500
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,759
how a perennial at this point in its

501
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,558
development

502
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:19,439
might uh be economically viable for for

503
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:22,959
a farmer

504
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:25,439
and so i've conducted uh

505
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,160
probably too many research projects i i

506
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,640
sort of

507
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,440
commit to a lot of things but here i

508
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,200
just highlight

509
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,960
some of the things we've been looking at

510
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,640
to try to address some of these

511
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,880
challenges try to provide answers and

512
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,160
just to better understand the system so

513
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,160
these first two are the ones that i'll

514
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,160
focus on here today intercropping with

515
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,600
medium red clover and strip tillage

516
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,360
renovation we've also tried

517
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,199
intercropping with field peas

518
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,119
thinking about weed management after

519
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,080
harvest during that regrowth period in

520
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:53,519
the fall

521
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:55,599
trying to figure out which herbicides

522
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:59,119
might be

523
00:17:55,599 --> 00:18:00,319
good for use in weed management for

524
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,519
perennial grains

525
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,960
also pathogens and some some more

526
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:07,440
physiological work some

527
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,319
some more soil work and even as as tonya

528
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,919
mentioned

529
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:13,119
the work with miguel gomez and others in

530
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,559
the dyson school as well as

531
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,959
collaborations with

532
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:18,960
folks at wide awake bakery to understand

533
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,360
what consumers would be willing to pay

534
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,319
for

535
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,798
a perennial grain product and whether

536
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:24,639
they

537
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:25,918
would be willing to perhaps pay more for

538
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,840
something that has

539
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,520
all these environmental benefits and so

540
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:31,599
i just highlight here all of our some of

541
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,759
our external collaborators

542
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,678
while everything up here has been really

543
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:38,558
uh within cornell but really

544
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,240
also supported by so many members of the

545
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:42,879
the tommaso and ryan labs that i'll

546
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,558
acknowledge at the end as well

547
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,640
and so as i said we'll be focusing on

548
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:47,599
these two for the purposes of getting

549
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,960
through the next

550
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:53,359
30 minutes um and so

551
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,120
here i'll introduce you to the two

552
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,079
perennial grain crops that we've we

553
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:58,479
focused on

554
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:00,558
on the left is kurza intermediate wheat

555
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,480
grass or thino pyramin intermedium which

556
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:03,839
is a wild perennial grass that for the

557
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,480
last 40 years

558
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,079
has been under domestication for grain

559
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,079
production so

560
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,279
that started it the rhode island student

561
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:12,639
in pennsylvania

562
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:14,720
eventually moved to the land institute

563
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,240
in salina kansas and really over the

564
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,480
last five years or so

565
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,400
has been one of the main perennial crops

566
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,599
that people are interested in for

567
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,440
the reasons i pointed out earlier

568
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:25,918
interest from the food industry there's

569
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,679
been

570
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,280
a lot of momentum built up behind this

571
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,480
crop it does seem to be one of the more

572
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,359
developed

573
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,558
from a cultivar perspective and then on

574
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,678
the right we have ace one

575
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,000
perennial cereal rye which i contrast

576
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,400
with

577
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,038
kunza as an annual grain crop that has

578
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,440
been perennialized via hybridization so

579
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:46,319
by crossing your cereal rice cayley

580
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,720
cereal with

581
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:51,200
mountain rye they are hoping to

582
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,759
introduce some of those perennial genes

583
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,038
but maintain many of the characteristics

584
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,480
of an annual grain crop

585
00:19:55,038 --> 00:20:02,640
so things like free threshability

586
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,720
synchronous maturity large seed size

587
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,159
some of those actually are are really

588
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,880
what the breeders are focusing on in

589
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,679
kernsis so

590
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,880
as the domestication process goes along

591
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,679
you're trying to

592
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,360
make the um the small seed of a wild

593
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,559
grass into something that

594
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:20,879
looks like a rye or a wheat

595
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,480
and so i'll i'll contrast these in how

596
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,000
they've been developed uh from a

597
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,679
cultivar perspective but

598
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,839
that all that contrast also does play

599
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,880
out in how they perform in the field

600
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:33,199
uh which we'll see in a few slides

601
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,720
and so for the first research experiment

602
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,319
that i conducted

603
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,919
intercropping perennials with annuals

604
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:40,158
with clover

605
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,159
we started this one really thinking from

606
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,919
that system's perspective with five

607
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,159
broad research objectives

608
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,559
uh we did want to understand uh how much

609
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,679
grain and crop biomass would be produced

610
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:52,240
by the perennials

611
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,480
in comparison with annuals uh we wanted

612
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,079
to understand the weed community better

613
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,079
and identify weeds that might be

614
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,119
problematic in these perennial systems

615
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,558
so we could

616
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:04,319
later target our management we wanted to

617
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:05,918
look at soil health as i said

618
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,839
and then two that are grayed out here

619
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,038
are are the economic piece which i won't

620
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:12,399
talk about today

621
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:14,319
um and and trying to see what would uh a

622
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,440
consumer need to pay for a perennial

623
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:19,678
grain in order for it to break even

624
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,360
from an economic perspective with

625
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,200
something like a wheat

626
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:24,558
and then the evaluating certain

627
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,759
indicators of overwhelm

628
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:29,599
overall system sustainability so

629
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,200
not necessarily life cycle analysis but

630
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,119
if you're familiar with that concept

631
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,319
things of that nature and seeing how

632
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:38,000
they might compare

633
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:39,359
um broadly so

634
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,119
as i said all of those things we're

635
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:42,558
really looking at with this single field

636
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,519
experiment

637
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:47,279
the experimental design uh was a

638
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,119
randomized complete block design with

639
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,319
four main plot treatments and those were

640
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:53,439
the four

641
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,558
grain crops that we grew so kernsa the

642
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,600
intermediate wheatgrass

643
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:58,000
taste one rye a hard red winter wheat

644
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,119
and then

645
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
two varieties of malting barley um which

646
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,439
in our colder new york climate actually

647
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,798
didn't do too well so

648
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,120
eventually we're dropped from the

649
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:10,480
experiment but i do want to mention them

650
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,959
here especially since they're in

651
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,960
the diagram um and each of these was

652
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,880
grown uh in split plots both

653
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,000
with and without medium red clover so

654
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,480
each of these

655
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,240
um plots in the field had had half of it

656
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,558
grown as a monoculture

657
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,240
uh and then half of it with the medium

658
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:28,240
red clover frost seeded

659
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,000
in march of each year for for the

660
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,519
annuals and then and cross-feeded

661
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,519
in the first year for the perennials

662
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:40,399
um so after growing the plants we

663
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:42,879
sampled crop and weed biomass in uh

664
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,679
at grain maturity for each of the the

665
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,080
species

666
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,840
uh each summer so for wheat and barley

667
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,079
that's earlier in july for

668
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:50,959
perennial rye that's later in july and

669
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,839
kerns it's actually

670
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,240
the middle of august so that does also

671
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,439
by

672
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,919
adding these to the cropping system

673
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,840
might diversify even the harvest window

674
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,080
um and like i mentioned earlier it takes

675
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,439
some of the burden off of growers that

676
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:06,000
often are really trying to get

677
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,919
everything in at the same time

678
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,839
but by clipping the biomass and uh

679
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,120
the weeds and and the weeds were sorted

680
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,599
by species we

681
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,879
uh threshed and and behold if necessary

682
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:20,000
the the

683
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,600
uh the grain crops so dehulling uh

684
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,200
particularly for kurenza which like i

685
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:24,959
said those characteristics of

686
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,440
domestication it has an adherent hall

687
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,480
which

688
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,759
is a little bit harder to process

689
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,440
and then all of the grain yield

690
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:34,319
estimates are based on a correction to

691
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,558
13 and a half percent moisture

692
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,918
and i'll just show a few uh photos just

693
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:40,158
to give you an idea of what these

694
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,919
look like in the field so uh here on the

695
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,520
left uh kerns of intermediate wheatgrass

696
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,720
about two months after planting

697
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,679
and an h1ri which is pretty good i'll

698
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,278
say actually when

699
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,840
i put this into powerpoint and it gives

700
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:52,880
you those little suggestions for like an

701
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:55,278
alternative text

702
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,720
uh powerpoint thought this was a train

703
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:58,720
going down some tracks

704
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,400
so uh basically picking up on the fact

705
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,440
there's not much green material here

706
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,759
early on

707
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,919
and with kernzo that's something we've

708
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:07,599
learned it's it's slower to establish

709
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,200
but once it gets going it can produce a

710
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,599
lot of biomass but particularly in that

711
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,558
first

712
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:13,439
fall um it doesn't look like much and

713
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:15,599
then the next

714
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,519
spring about april when you actually

715
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,759
start to see it fill out

716
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:22,480
and that poses some challenges for weed

717
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:24,960
management during that period

718
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,240
and that did play out a little bit going

719
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,480
into the next

720
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,159
spring so you can see the karnza is now

721
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,079
growing pretty tall but

722
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,080
weeds did manage to get in there in the

723
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:36,639
meantime and and might be uh

724
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,839
competing with the crop uh but while rye

725
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,520
looks uh

726
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:42,158
really good and and there's very little

727
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:44,720
weed biomass under there it was able to

728
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,278
to get up uh grow tall quickly and and

729
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,480
really

730
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:50,240
exclude weeds from the system um but

731
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,240
after harvest in that first years when

732
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,038
we noticed the the real first contrast

733
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,480
between

734
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:55,759
or this i guess the second contrast

735
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,798
other than establishment between these

736
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:59,359
two species

737
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:01,200
uh so kern's up quickly regrew after

738
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:04,479
harvest and you can see it here

739
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:08,240
above the clover um

740
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,240
but ace one struggled so it uh after

741
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,319
after harvest the the clover really took

742
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,440
over and seemed to out compete

743
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:18,000
the the rye in that system and so the

744
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,640
uh story after three years is that with

745
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,119
clover

746
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,720
uh in the kerns of we we might be seeing

747
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,158
a visual difference maybe that it's a

748
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,038
little bit greener maybe some extra

749
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,278
nitrogen there

750
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:28,480
but both systems are looking pretty

751
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:30,480
healthy

752
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,079
um in contrast with ace one rye both

753
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,480
with and without clover

754
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:36,480
where with clover the the ace one rye

755
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,000
was out competed and there's some rye

756
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,360
plants still there but

757
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,119
quite few um and without the clover

758
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:44,719
all the rye got out competed by other

759
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:46,639
weeds that came in and there might be

760
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,919
even fewer plants without the clover

761
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,840
so really what happened with ace one

762
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,520
is that it wasn't competitive in that

763
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:56,319
post-harvest period and that

764
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,918
sort of accumulated over time and so we

765
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:58,720
we didn't do any weed management in

766
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,480
these systems we're

767
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,400
trying to understand some of these

768
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,200
factors being the first time we've grown

769
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,200
them

770
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,960
but that does seem to be a critical

771
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,720
period for weed control and something

772
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,159
that in other experiments has been shown

773
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,360
to help with the persistence

774
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:16,960
and productivity of the ace one going

775
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:19,599
into a second or third year

776
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,360
and so for these these first two

777
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:22,399
objectives of looking at grain yields

778
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:24,719
and

779
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,000
weed communities i'll just go into some

780
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,400
of the data

781
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
with our data analysis uh we only i'm

782
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,798
only reporting kurza and we

783
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,319
here um for the reasons we just saw with

784
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:34,960
the ace one there really wasn't much to

785
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:37,119
speak of

786
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,880
uh into the third year and actually not

787
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:40,719
not that much in the second year either

788
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,919
and with the winter kill of the malting

789
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,519
barley we had dropped that from the

790
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,159
experiment

791
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:48,079
but we did look at crop and forage

792
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,559
yields and we biomass for the kerns

793
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:51,759
and wheat analyzed it with mixed effects

794
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:54,480
anova

795
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:55,278
we had to log transform the data due to

796
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,919
skewness

797
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:59,278
and had crop species intercropping and

798
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,919
near as fixed effects so you'll be

799
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:02,400
seeing

800
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,440
similar models for all of these

801
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,440
treatments

802
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,600
throughout the the following slides um

803
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,880
and uh we'll get to weed communities

804
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:12,959
eventually where we have

805
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,120
an ordination uh to visualize it and

806
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,558
then permanova and indicator species

807
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:20,158
analysis to look at what's

808
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:22,798
going on in more detail in those systems

809
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,640
so for grain yield uh the main takeaways

810
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:26,079
here there was a significant crop

811
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,919
difference between crops

812
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:30,480
and there was a significant effect by

813
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,480
year with an interaction between the two

814
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,000
there was no effect of the clover

815
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,640
intercrop on

816
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,440
grain yield however and so really the

817
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,880
story is

818
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,278
with kernsa it was lower than the wheat

819
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,720
in that first year but then declined

820
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:47,038
into the second year and rebounded

821
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,319
slightly into the third year

822
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:52,000
whereas wheat had statistically similar

823
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:53,200
yields throughout all three years there

824
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,519
might be a slight

825
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,960
decline over time but nothing

826
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:00,398
significant there

827
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,399
and so um really this this

828
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:04,479
this deep the the initially lower grain

829
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,678
yields followed by a decline is a major

830
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,839
issue for kurza

831
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,880
um and and something that we'll even

832
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:11,839
talk about a little bit in the second

833
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,600
experiment to address that

834
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,119
uh with forage yields they were

835
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:18,480
initially similar but

836
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,119
kernsa biomass tended to increase over

837
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,599
time

838
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:23,678
while wheat biomass decreased and so

839
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,439
that is one area of opportunity for the

840
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,399
perennial grains and used as a dual

841
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,120
purpose

842
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:31,199
dual purpose grain and forage crop where

843
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:33,119
a grower might be able to balance out

844
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,720
the low grain yields with high forage

845
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,398
production if they're able to

846
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,399
use that in the system and i will say as

847
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:39,599
the perennials stay greener for longer

848
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:41,439
into the year

849
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,439
through the year they they do make a

850
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,679
much higher quality forage than

851
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,558
something like wheat straw which you

852
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,720
could also

853
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:51,278
harvest from a wheat field but not as

854
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,278
valuable

855
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,960
oh and i will say here there was a

856
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,960
significant effect of inner crop and so

857
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,558
adding clover to the system increased

858
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,798
total forage production

859
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,240
and uh we didn't analyze a forage

860
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:05,519
quality but you could

861
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,599
the the higher protein of the forage

862
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,398
of a clover forage might have increased

863
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:13,439
quality as well

864
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:16,558
and then when we look at weeds um really

865
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,240
the um story is that the there was a

866
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:20,079
difference by species as we saw with the

867
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,319
slow establishment of kernsa

868
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,119
um there were weeds early on and those

869
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:25,278
tended to

870
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,558
stay in the system throughout the three

871
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:29,759
years

872
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:30,158
there was again a significant effect by

873
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:33,119
year

874
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,520
and an interaction there i will also say

875
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:35,759
that

876
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:37,519
the clover did have a significant weed

877
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:40,480
suppressive effect

878
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:41,038
so you can see that there's quite a lot

879
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,880
lower

880
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:44,640
weeds in the clover plots across all the

881
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,520
systems

882
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,200
but a wheat the weeds increased over

883
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,038
time so a difference between

884
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,399
the perennial and the annual system

885
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:53,599
there's actually been other studies with

886
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:55,599
kern zone where maybe they got

887
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:58,398
established a little bit better where

888
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,918
weeds are suppressed by the currency

889
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:01,199
itself over time so that's not something

890
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,159
we saw here but it is

891
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,840
another potential benefit of a perennial

892
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:09,278
system that's highly competitive and

893
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:11,278
persistent

894
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:12,798
and then we when we took a closer look

895
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:15,440
at the the weed communities

896
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:16,558
um by species here we we have an

897
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,840
ordination so

898
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:21,519
the axes are not that meaningful really

899
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:23,439
what we're looking at these centroids

900
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,398
are sort of the central tendency of

901
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,798
different treatments

902
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,879
where the closer together points are on

903
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:30,398
the on the plot the more similar they

904
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,480
are in their weed communities

905
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:34,558
and so all of the green is the kurza

906
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,599
both with and without clover

907
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:39,759
and then the the brown or tan is

908
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:41,278
the wheat and so even here on this

909
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:44,000
initial plot you can sort of

910
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:44,880
see some clustering in certain areas but

911
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,798
when we look at this

912
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,080
by year we see um a definite shift in

913
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:53,679
the weed communities over

914
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:55,759
time so from 2017 uh capernaum with and

915
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,880
without clover both shifted along this

916
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:02,480
x-axis to the right maybe in

917
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:05,278
in slightly different directions

918
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,079
and then we also see with with wheat um

919
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:08,159
a shift

920
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:09,199
initially to the right but then sort of

921
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,240
back again

922
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,600
towards the left so um this is this is

923
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,480
telling us that there

924
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,839
are there is divergence between the

925
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,960
communities of weeds we're seeing in

926
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:22,000
these systems

927
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,440
and to confirm that with the permanova

928
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
which is really the statistical test

929
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,240
here

930
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,919
we saw significant species and inner

931
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,000
crop effects

932
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,960
and year effects with again this this

933
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,960
strong

934
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,120
interaction between year and crop

935
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,919
basically the the perennial changing

936
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:40,558
over time while the annual sort of

937
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,480
stayed the same maybe changed and back

938
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:44,240
and and so looking at each year

939
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,839
individually we see that the clover in a

940
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,038
crop had the strongest effect in that

941
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,278
second year

942
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,640
and i believe that's because that's when

943
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:54,079
um

944
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,600
the the kernzo was really um coming into

945
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:57,278
its own and then by the third year that

946
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:59,439
kerns it was starting to outcompete the

947
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:01,440
clover even

948
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,038
when we look at indicator species so so

949
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,440
what this indicates is that

950
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:07,599
uh each time there's a significant uh

951
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,159
p-value for a species it means that that

952
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:13,439
species is particularly prevalent

953
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:15,039
um on plots of that type and so we can

954
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,759
interpret this by looking uh

955
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:20,158
in 2017 with kurza and no clover a

956
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:22,480
winter annual shepherd's purse was

957
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,519
really indicative of that cropping

958
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,880
system

959
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,880
while um wood sorrel was particularly

960
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,000
indicative of the wheat no clover

961
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,760
cropping system

962
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,319
and so we didn't have any significant

963
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:37,919
indicators in 2018 with this data

964
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:39,278
um but uh by 2019 we are

965
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,360
starting to again see that clear

966
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:44,319
separation in in the systems

967
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:46,798
so uh with the kearns and no clover we

968
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:49,038
are seeing a lot of perennials some uh

969
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,639
timothy and uh rough stock bluegrass

970
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:53,278
perennial grasses and then

971
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,960
uh canada goldenrod and dandelion

972
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:57,200
broadly perennials

973
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,440
with wheat and clover we were seeing a

974
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,360
um a perennial sedge

975
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,200
yellow nuts edge that was able to

976
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:04,240
compete through that clover and come up

977
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,679
in that system

978
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,679
and wasn't really seen in any of the

979
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,360
other systems and then wheat no clover

980
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,440
we're seeing start to see a broad

981
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:12,879
variety of annuals very common animals

982
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,720
yellow foxtail

983
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:19,200
ragweed and a couple of polygams

984
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,360
and so here one thing you'll notice is

985
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,880
that with with clover there weren't any

986
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:24,558
significant indicators because the

987
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,799
clover was suppressing a lot of the weed

988
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:28,879
species and sort of evening things out

989
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:30,398
broadly but without clover we're

990
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,399
starting to really see that divergence

991
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:35,199
between a perennial and an annual

992
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:35,199
weed community

993
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,319
moving on to soil health um sampling

994
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:42,558
here was

995
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:43,439
done each year including a baseline

996
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:46,079
collection

997
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,519
soon after planting in 2016. after that

998
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:49,599
we always sampled

999
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,720
after harvest before replanting so

1000
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:54,558
before the annual plots were re-tilled

1001
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,278
we collected samples with golf whole

1002
00:33:54,558 --> 00:34:00,319
course the relatively large diameter

1003
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:03,119
and to a relatively shallow depth

1004
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:04,240
and then we analyzed uh bulk density in

1005
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:06,558
the lab and then sent

1006
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,039
to the soil health lab for wet aggregate

1007
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:12,559
stability soil respiration and active

1008
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:14,239
carbon and really

1009
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:16,559
i'll just say this up front there there

1010
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:17,439
wasn't a lot of variation between the

1011
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:20,078
systems

1012
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,918
over time i'm here with bulk density

1013
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,039
we're seeing a slight effect

1014
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:26,000
uh by year and an interaction by year in

1015
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:28,398
species so

1016
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,599
so with wheat in uh one year it might

1017
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:31,039
have been a little bit of higher than

1018
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,838
wheat in a different year

1019
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,759
but nothing too dramatic with wet

1020
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:36,320
aggregate stability it was only a year

1021
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,720
effect

1022
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,519
where we sort of saw a bump up and then

1023
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,118
down

1024
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:42,878
and again with soil respiration there

1025
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,079
was simply a year effect

1026
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:45,440
this might be due to different

1027
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,960
environmental conditions and year and

1028
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:52,159
2018 in particular was very dry

1029
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,918
so not a lot to read into these with

1030
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,440
active carbon we did

1031
00:34:53,918 --> 00:35:01,440
see a very close significant

1032
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:04,240
crop species effect and so here

1033
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,679
there was slightly higher active carbon

1034
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:07,358
in wheat than kernsa

1035
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:09,440
across the three years when everything

1036
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:10,880
was pooled and so that's a little bit

1037
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,159
perplexing

1038
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,599
i haven't really thought about it too

1039
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:14,879
much if anyone has any thoughts on why

1040
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,079
that might be occurring

1041
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,000
my initial thoughts may be just because

1042
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,359
we were sampling so shallowly

1043
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,599
while the kerns of roots are going

1044
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:25,119
deeper there could be something

1045
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,559
going on there but not not what we

1046
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,720
expected to see really with the soil

1047
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:30,480
health at all not much of an effect

1048
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:32,159
and so the takeaways from this first

1049
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,079
experiment are that

1050
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:36,078
uh the kernzo was persistent and

1051
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,079
produced more total biomass than annual

1052
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,800
crops but lower grain yields over time

1053
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,640
ace one struggled overall and failed

1054
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,240
completely by the third year

1055
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:46,400
we did see that divergence in the weed

1056
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:48,719
communities and clover had a strong

1057
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,119
effect on suppressing weeds

1058
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:53,439
um perennial grass weeds like rough

1059
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,039
stock bluegrass and timothy probably

1060
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,480
are have the highest likelihood of

1061
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:57,119
becoming weed management challenges in

1062
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,358
kenza

1063
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,519
particularly because of uh there might

1064
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:04,159
be few selective herbicides that are

1065
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:06,880
able to control those especially after

1066
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:07,440
a uh kerns of stand has been established

1067
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,358
so

1068
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,559
that once you get that stand going and

1069
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:12,480
you don't really want to till it up and

1070
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:14,000
replant it

1071
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,599
there there might be some challenges in

1072
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,358
getting some weeds out of there if they

1073
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,920
if they do establish a foothold

1074
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:21,838
and finally soil health was had stronger

1075
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,760
effects by year than by crop species or

1076
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:26,480
intercropping treatments

1077
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,040
so i would focus in here on this first

1078
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,960
point

1079
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:30,400
about lower grain yields that decline

1080
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,358
over time because that really informed

1081
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,760
this second

1082
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:35,679
experiment uh using strip tillage to

1083
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,400
renovate mature kernel stands

1084
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:39,358
um this decline is not unique to our

1085
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,559
experiment

1086
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:43,920
it's been documented across basically

1087
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:46,400
every research project

1088
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,680
that's looked at kerns over time and

1089
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,519
this is not associated with plant

1090
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:51,440
mortality as tiller counts

1091
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:53,280
and total biomass productivity are

1092
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,960
stable or increase over time which is

1093
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,079
something we have also observed

1094
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,599
so with that in mind we thought about

1095
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,440
uh what might be causing that and it

1096
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,240
seems like maybe the kernel itself was

1097
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,838
competing

1098
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:07,118
uh too strongly with itself and so

1099
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:08,960
we thought that maybe using some

1100
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,160
disturbance in that system

1101
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,320
might give it a chance to regrow

1102
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:16,319
and and produce more seed rather than

1103
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,599
vegetative biomass

1104
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,440
so we tried two timings fall and spring

1105
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,200
and wanted to look at closely at

1106
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,280
components of yield to see

1107
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,399
what the response to this disturbance

1108
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,040
might be

1109
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,519
so really this was just a deep ripping

1110
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:34,639
with a with a deep shank on the

1111
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:36,639
no-till planter disturbing in pretty

1112
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:39,920
narrow strips and a

1113
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:41,519
relatively low intensity disturbance

1114
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,119
all things considered compared to other

1115
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:44,480
things that people have tried with kerns

1116
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,880
at least

1117
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,800
this was a simpler experiment with just

1118
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,160
three treatments per block

1119
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,480
of the fall the spring and then the

1120
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:56,319
control treatments

1121
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,079
and um this was done in a fourth year

1122
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,838
kern's a stand so it had been it had

1123
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,560
been in the ground had harvested three

1124
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:03,838
times

1125
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:06,559
um it had been uh planted in 2014

1126
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:08,159
fertilized every year only one

1127
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:11,279
application of herbicide due to

1128
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:14,319
growing canada thistle issue

1129
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:17,760
and then with the zone builder

1130
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,640
went in after that third harvest both in

1131
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,880
october and then the next april

1132
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:24,559
uh that that following august at the

1133
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,000
fourth grain harvest we did similar

1134
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:28,000
quadrat sampling as to the first

1135
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,719
experiment but here we also sampled

1136
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,639
20 spikes from each sample that were

1137
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:34,480
fresh by hand to count spikeless florics

1138
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:36,400
and seeds per spike

1139
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,320
everything else was also threshed to you

1140
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,240
to estimate total grain yield

1141
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,838
and we used a similar mixed effect model

1142
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:46,799
with only tillage as a fixed effect here

1143
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:48,239
so here this photo i like it's hard to

1144
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,320
see anything which is actually

1145
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:51,519
uh we almost didn't harvest this

1146
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,880
experiment at all because it didn't seem

1147
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:53,679
like anything different was going on in

1148
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,519
the treatment

1149
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:57,118
but but chris took this photo on top of

1150
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:58,960
the combine because

1151
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,720
um it seemed like there might have been

1152
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,599
something going on here in this fall

1153
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:05,838
treatment uh maybe a slightly uh higher

1154
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,000
density of seed heads

1155
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:09,358
while not much visually different

1156
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,559
between spring control but

1157
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:12,639
you couldn't really see that until you

1158
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:15,759
got up high on the combine

1159
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:17,519
but it really did um play out to be an

1160
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,920
interesting effect in the end so

1161
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:21,199
um first when we looked at the the

1162
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,920
components of yield

1163
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:25,199
there was really strong consistency for

1164
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,800
spikelet count

1165
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:30,799
for floret count for seed count

1166
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,400
and even for a thousand kernel weights

1167
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:36,400
so those uh within spike

1168
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,880
components of yield we're not changing

1169
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,680
amongst any of these treatments

1170
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,039
but when we look at the the total

1171
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,239
biomass

1172
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:46,880
that was produced so that all of the

1173
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:48,959
vegetative and above ground biomass

1174
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,240
in these plots there was no difference

1175
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,480
between the control and the fall

1176
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:53,519
treatment there was a decrease from that

1177
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,960
spring treatment so maybe the

1178
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:56,000
disturbance there is a little too strong

1179
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,199
or too soon close

1180
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,280
to tillering

1181
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:03,279
total tiller density was lower in both

1182
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,960
the fall and the spring treatment so

1183
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,319
these are these are all stems in the

1184
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,000
plots

1185
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:09,519
but when we look at reproductive tiller

1186
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,960
density so those tillers that produce

1187
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:13,358
seed heads

1188
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,880
we see a significant increase in the

1189
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:16,639
number of fertile tillers in a fall

1190
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,358
tilled plot

1191
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:21,440
and this leads to about a 60 increase in

1192
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:23,279
overall grain yield which is really

1193
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:27,039
outstanding is really what we're looking

1194
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:30,160
for in using this management practice

1195
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:33,358
and also in harvest index so we had a

1196
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:35,598
an increase in grain and a decrease in

1197
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:37,119
or a slight decrease in total biomass

1198
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,160
and and so that harvest index is

1199
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,358
something we're

1200
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:43,199
really interested in at that point so

1201
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:44,880
uh that was quick but really the

1202
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:47,199
takeaway here is that

1203
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,838
this fall tillage disturbance did

1204
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:51,598
increase grain yield by a large amount

1205
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:52,880
at that following harvest this was done

1206
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,519
in the fourth year

1207
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,119
um so by then the yield had declined

1208
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:00,159
substantially and so the

1209
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,599
the total grain uh production was still

1210
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:03,519
much lower than you would get from an

1211
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,800
annual um but it does

1212
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:09,119
provide insight into what might be going

1213
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,318
on in the field

1214
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,160
basically that our assumptions of

1215
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:16,960
intra-specific competition

1216
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:20,078
uh is likely what's causing this this

1217
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,480
change in in the plant's reproductive

1218
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,640
output over time with spring tillage it

1219
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,480
did reduce stand density and biomass but

1220
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:28,480
if you i i didn't mention this on this

1221
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,318
the data slide but it did not impact

1222
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,280
granules so the spring tillage

1223
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:34,960
um didn't actually decrease yield in

1224
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,720
that year and so you could think maybe

1225
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,039
in the future year that that would have

1226
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:40,639
a similar increase in effect giving it

1227
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:42,480
time to regrow

1228
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:43,759
and then really for the future we would

1229
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,440
want to examine even close

1230
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,960
more closely the timing the intensity

1231
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,679
and even the type of disturbance so here

1232
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,119
we use

1233
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:50,480
strip tillage and i know some of our

1234
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,838
collaborators in the midwest have done

1235
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,039
things like grazing

1236
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:56,719
or using strip applied herbicides but

1237
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:58,559
there could be even broader things to

1238
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:00,159
think about so like crop residue burning

1239
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:01,519
and whether that stimulates

1240
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:03,838
tiller development anything of that

1241
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,838
nature

1242
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,160
and so really to wrap it up with

1243
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,358
hopefully a few minutes for questions

1244
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:13,039
um there's a lot of things uh

1245
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:14,799
going on in these perennial systems and

1246
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:17,358
the complexity is

1247
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,079
is higher for both us as researchers

1248
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:20,078
there's a lot more

1249
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,519
things we are trying to figure out and

1250
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,519
manage um here

1251
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:26,159
especially with the the novelty of these

1252
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:28,159
systems like managing weed crop

1253
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:29,838
at different periods during

1254
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:30,719
establishment during the post-harvest

1255
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:33,440
period during

1256
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:34,959
subsequent years and that crop crop

1257
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,880
competition with the perennial

1258
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,639
that's vigorous in growing vegetative

1259
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,599
biomass but might need to be stimulated

1260
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,078
in some way

1261
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,519
to maintain its seed production over

1262
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:46,240
time

1263
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:47,759
but the complexity of managing something

1264
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:48,959
for production of both grain and forage

1265
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,200
as well so

1266
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,559
how do you balance that are there ways

1267
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:54,318
that managing

1268
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:55,440
maybe mowing at different points during

1269
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:56,559
the year which is something we've looked

1270
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,559
at a little bit

1271
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:00,400
might increase your forage productivity

1272
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:01,920
but might decrease your grain yield is

1273
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,559
there a trade-off there

1274
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,440
and how does that work out economically

1275
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:07,199
and then um

1276
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,559
to the point we saw that over a

1277
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:12,000
three-year period

1278
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:15,358
um there wasn't a strong effect on soil

1279
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,599
health and there might even be um

1280
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:19,199
wheat outperforming uh kerns and maybe

1281
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,160
just because of wheat uh growing more

1282
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:23,519
vigorously

1283
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:25,039
over that that period um but

1284
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,800
uh restore basically the takeaway there

1285
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:28,960
is restoring ecosystem service is not as

1286
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,519
simple as just growing a new crop

1287
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,039
that these crops may have a lot of

1288
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:34,800
benefits but they also need to be

1289
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:37,599
integrated into a system

1290
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,000
across many spatial and temporal scales

1291
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,760
with

1292
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,679
interacting with many other components

1293
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,079
and and how you manage that is all

1294
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:45,759
tied up into what we actually um can

1295
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,240
obtain from those systems both in terms

1296
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,520
of

1297
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:49,919
uh material goods and other services um

1298
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:51,119
and

1299
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,559
there's there's a lot of room for

1300
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,280
improvement of these parental cropping

1301
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:55,679
systems

1302
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,040
um i don't breed but the breeders are

1303
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:58,399
still working on them and so

1304
00:43:57,039 --> 00:44:00,639
we'll be seeing improvement in their

1305
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,240
performance over time um and

1306
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:04,000
like these projects that that i've been

1307
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,598
working on the agronomic management will

1308
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,079
also have a significant impact on that

1309
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,160
so

1310
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,119
well i would say that these might not be

1311
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:10,719
ready to

1312
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,640
to put in the ground everywhere right

1313
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:14,879
now uh this is the promising

1314
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:16,639
uh area of research and uh hopefully

1315
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,160
within the next couple decades we'll be

1316
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:22,400
we'll be seeing currency in our cheerios

1317
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:23,199
and lastly just acknowledging everyone

1318
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,358
um i have

1319
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:26,239
pictures of all of the the technicians

1320
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:28,639
and uh

1321
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:30,000
and field uh undergrad assistants that

1322
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:32,639
have helped over time

1323
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,280
uh in particular uh tessandra chris and

1324
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:35,440
scott

1325
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,119
uh who have done just so much you know

1326
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,400
that long list of projects i've worked

1327
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,358
on wouldn't be possible without all the

1328
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,200
contributions all these folks

1329
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:44,960
my committee of course and and all the

1330
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:46,318
the lab mates and fellow grad

1331
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,240
students that i've worked with over the

1332
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:50,159
years and then

1333
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:52,159
all my external collaborators starting

1334
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:53,519
with the farmers we've got a great board

1335
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:56,399
of advisors

1336
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:57,838
the the folks at uh wide awake bakery

1337
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,358
and farmer ground flour on some of the

1338
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:01,039
economic side of things

1339
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:02,719
and then uh external collaborators other

1340
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:03,440
institutions working also on perennial

1341
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:05,519
brains

1342
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,200
and then uh finally just these uh

1343
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:10,079
funders that have have so

1344
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:10,879
graciously allowed me to do this work

1345
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,000
and

1346
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,519
took a little bit longer than i thought

1347
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,800
but hopefully we have a cup time for low

1348
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:15,599
questions i'm willing to stick around a

1349
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,519
little while

1350
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,519
if people want to ask me some stuff as

1351
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:21,679
well

1352
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:23,199
great thanks eugene that was that's

1353
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:24,879
really a nice overview of

1354
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:26,960
of the various projects you've been

1355
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,079
working on related to perennial grain so

1356
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,679
let's open it up for

1357
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,359
for questions i know we have you know a

1358
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:34,639
little bit of time but

1359
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:37,920
go ahead unmute yourself or

1360
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:39,920
yeah go ahead david yeah

1361
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,119
very interesting eugene i really learned

1362
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,318
a lot

1363
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:46,079
what is kind of the uh upper limit of

1364
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:48,960
where these yields could be

1365
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,880
due to people think i mean if you take a

1366
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,559
a typical wheat yield

1367
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,318
let's say six tons or you know you

1368
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:55,358
you're up in that four or five six tons

1369
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:57,199
or whatever

1370
00:45:55,358 --> 00:46:00,799
where do people think these could

1371
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:03,679
possibly get to if everything was right

1372
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,318
yeah well so it's a bit of a tricky

1373
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:07,358
question

1374
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:09,279
due to just the time um

1375
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:11,039
aspect of it or like do you account that

1376
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,359
accumulatively over time and how does

1377
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:14,559
that

1378
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:17,119
that trade off um but um

1379
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:18,719
currently i mean i don't want to put

1380
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,119
hard numbers on it but you might expect

1381
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:21,279
like

1382
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,039
in the first year maybe 25 of a

1383
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,160
comparable wheat like we saw in that one

1384
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:25,679
experiment

1385
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:27,440
and after that we did see that sharp

1386
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:29,358
decline

1387
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,039
there was a actually there was a session

1388
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:32,159
at tri-societies last week on this where

1389
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:33,519
there's sort of a bit of a debate

1390
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:35,199
between one of the main breeders of

1391
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:36,480
kurnsah and then someone who's done a

1392
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:39,679
lot more

1393
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,800
work in more like perennial forages and

1394
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:42,719
you know there are life history

1395
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,880
trade-offs so

1396
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:46,799
in order for a perennial to to survive

1397
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,000
over winter produce new stems the

1398
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,760
following year

1399
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,519
it needs to dedicate energy to that and

1400
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,680
an annual is really putting all of its

1401
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:57,519
energy into creating that seed then

1402
00:46:53,679 --> 00:47:00,399
dies we harvest it and we move on so

1403
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:01,838
there there might be a substantial trade

1404
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,680
off there we don't know

1405
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:05,119
uh how close we could get to an annual

1406
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:07,759
just based on that but

1407
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:10,079
there's also the the balance of

1408
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,839
photosynthetic

1409
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,800
production over the the full course of

1410
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:17,199
the year so with a perennial like kernsa

1411
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,000
once it's established the following year

1412
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:19,598
it's going to be

1413
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,239
starting growing much sooner than a

1414
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:23,920
spring wheat because

1415
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:25,279
it's there as soon as the weather gets

1416
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,079
warm enough whereas the farmer might

1417
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,640
have to wait for

1418
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,280
things to dry down and and get the seed

1419
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:30,799
in

1420
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,920
um and it's there throughout the the

1421
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,559
fall as well so the the total amount of

1422
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,119
photo

1423
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:38,800
uh photosynthetic photosynthetic

1424
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,000
radiation that's hitting that plant over

1425
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,039
the the course of the year will be

1426
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,440
higher than the annual

1427
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:44,719
yeah and so that might balance out some

1428
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,800
of these these trade-offs and

1429
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:48,799
um i think there's been studies done for

1430
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,839
for um perennial bio

1431
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,800
um biomass feedstocks like miss campus

1432
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:55,199
that show that

1433
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,079
their total net primary productivity is

1434
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:58,399
going to be much higher

1435
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,680
due to the the higher amount of sunlight

1436
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,559
they can take in over the course of the

1437
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:02,318
year

1438
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:04,079
whether we can get the plants to to put

1439
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:06,400
more of that towards seed production

1440
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,760
is the challenge and how how that

1441
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,720
balances out with the management of the

1442
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,760
system as a whole

1443
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:13,439
is where we would we would need to

1444
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,359
to that's where we are moving forward i

1445
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,960
guess i was just kind of curious

1446
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:18,558
i know all those other benefits you you

1447
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,559
laid that out very nicely yeah

1448
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:22,640
of the complexity and how it might use

1449
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:25,040
in a system i understand all that

1450
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:27,039
it's just kind of wondering you know if

1451
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:28,480
you were aiming for grain yield how high

1452
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:30,558
did the breeders think

1453
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,480
could it end up being 50 of what we

1454
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,880
would otherwise would expect or would it

1455
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,719
be

1456
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,559
because you had very low yields um you

1457
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:38,239
know 250

1458
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,760
kilograms rectangle seed and you know

1459
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:40,639
i'm not criticizing i'm just kind of

1460
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,520
curious

1461
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:45,279
where the community thinks this is could

1462
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,838
end up going so that was my question

1463
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,720
about the

1464
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:49,039
seed yeah yeah it's hard to speculate i

1465
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:50,558
guess

1466
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:52,558
i will say i mean one thing i didn't

1467
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,040
mention is that i i've been working with

1468
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,720
with these

1469
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:55,920
like kerza for example for five years

1470
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:57,838
and when we planted that first

1471
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,400
experiment in 2016

1472
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:01,519
it was cycle three uh breeding from the

1473
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,680
land institute

1474
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:05,679
they're not on cycle eight and i can say

1475
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:07,118
just by going out to kansas for

1476
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:08,639
conferences and stuff that the

1477
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,680
the difference in the plants in cycle

1478
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:10,480
eight versus cycle three is just

1479
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:12,558
tremendous

1480
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,519
in both the size of the inflorescences

1481
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,160
the number of

1482
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:17,440
um spikelets and and like all those

1483
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:18,318
components yields which i didn't find

1484
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,318
any difference in

1485
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:21,920
in my experiment those over breeding

1486
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:23,920
cycles are increasing

1487
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,760
so um there's there's going to be a lot

1488
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,599
of advancement in that area but

1489
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,280
yeah and in terms of what those those

1490
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,240
newer cycles would produce in a you know

1491
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,319
like um

1492
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:33,279
actual farm field at this point i'm not

1493
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:36,000
sure

1494
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,000
thanks very clear

1495
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,319
hi thanks eugene

1496
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:46,639
very nice clear presentation i'm

1497
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,599
wondering sort of from the systems

1498
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:50,960
perspective

1499
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:54,559
whether you have thought about

1500
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:59,838
comparing um

1501
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:59,839
with maybe sort of an optimized

1502
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:06,879
spatially optimized system using current

1503
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,358
more commercial cultivars so i'm

1504
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,559
thinking

1505
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:12,799
maybe strip cropping with corn grain and

1506
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,519
alfalfa right so you'd be getting forage

1507
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,599
production

1508
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:16,960
you're getting grain production you're

1509
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:20,000
getting perennials on

1510
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:22,480
half the land all the time

1511
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,318
and i guess what i'm getting at here is

1512
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,880
it seems to me that by

1513
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:28,079
by doing some of that kind of practical

1514
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,480
optimization

1515
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:33,119
spatially you might get many of the

1516
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,070
benefits that you're aiming to get

1517
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,800
uh by combining

1518
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:38,480
[Music]

1519
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,960
you know trying to combine all the

1520
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:44,000
functions in into one

1521
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,000
one patch of land

1522
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,640
yeah though i think that's a great idea

1523
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:50,639
i know there's there's a lot of folks

1524
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:53,039
that have done that type of work and

1525
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:55,199
have looked at different cropping

1526
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:58,480
systems um

1527
00:50:55,199 --> 00:51:01,039
sort of layouts and and i mean even in

1528
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,838
um even in like matt's lab with with

1529
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:05,039
looking at

1530
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:06,480
different um ways of using cover crops

1531
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:07,440
right there's there's different ways to

1532
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,639
try to

1533
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,720
to put different functions back into the

1534
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:13,279
agro ecosystem and and i'm not saying

1535
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:14,719
here that

1536
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,839
perennial grains are the only way to do

1537
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:21,118
that i just um i think that it's a

1538
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:22,719
it's it's promising because it of like

1539
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,119
at that that one point at the beginning

1540
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:26,239
annual grains make up so much of the

1541
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,480
cropland

1542
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:29,759
uh that we have and and if we're ever

1543
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,358
gonna we

1544
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,599
basically we need to do something there

1545
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:35,679
right and um

1546
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,800
if we could somehow get perennial grains

1547
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:39,759
to the point where they're just

1548
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,680
as to go to sort of david's point um

1549
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,960
they're just as productive

1550
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:46,480
in grain as as the annual and um

1551
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,920
also producing forage and providing

1552
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,519
these other environmental services it

1553
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,240
seems like that has

1554
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:53,920
um that that's sort of like um a

1555
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:56,639
paradigm shift and

1556
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,720
um yeah i i completely agree there's

1557
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:00,639
lots of

1558
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:02,159
lots of ways to think about this like

1559
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:05,598
the cropping systems we use and how we

1560
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:08,719
might innovate on them um

1561
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:11,599
i'm sorry does that sort of like address

1562
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:11,598
that point i guess

1563
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:17,199
yeah that's fine i mean i i appreciate

1564
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,400
all the information it's it's i guess i

1565
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:20,558
would

1566
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,760
maybe clarify what i was just trying to

1567
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:24,720
get at is

1568
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:26,240
is you know when we're comparing kind of

1569
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:28,399
alternative or

1570
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:29,759
what we hope are improved practices i

1571
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,800
guess i would just encourage

1572
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,079
comparing that to you know kind of the

1573
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,160
top of the line

1574
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:37,519
management practice for current

1575
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:41,279
production systems

1576
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:44,880
which might involve in some places

1577
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:46,160
you know strips of perennials and

1578
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,760
annuals for instance if there's an

1579
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:48,799
erosion issue that kind of thing so it's

1580
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,319
more just

1581
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,839
sort of thinking about what the baseline

1582
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:55,119
is that we compare

1583
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:57,119
you know uh compared to

1584
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:58,318
yeah that's not no okay that does help

1585
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:03,358
clarify things a little bit

1586
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:03,358
yeah i appreciate that and i i would say

1587
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,559
that that moving forward i think that

1588
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:09,119
that's an excellent

1589
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,559
place to to think um at the start of

1590
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,680
this we we really didn't know what we

1591
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:14,400
were working with

1592
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:15,279
um and i think we just to explain our

1593
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,960
thought process

1594
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:21,119
is to try to keep things simple and um

1595
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,480
maybe maybe not be thinking so far down

1596
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,400
the road of like what is the most

1597
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,000
productive way to grow these because we

1598
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:29,440
didn't really know but also

1599
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,440
just trying to to think of of

1600
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,119
as our first baseline it's like well if

1601
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,800
we have an annual or perennial like what

1602
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:36,240
are what are the differences what are

1603
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,519
what's still or what's different and

1604
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:39,838
from moving from there

1605
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:41,119
to our next steps of trying to optimize

1606
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:42,000
that and tweak it further and what's

1607
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:44,400
your next question

1608
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,039
that's revealed by some of those those

1609
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,960
early

1610
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:51,119
results i guess um but

1611
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,559
yeah that and i mean i could probably

1612
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:54,838
talk for a long time about what i think

1613
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:58,160
we could do going forward

1614
00:53:54,838 --> 00:54:00,078
um but yeah

1615
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:02,000
eugene this is andy i wonder if maybe

1616
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:04,000
there's a follow-up to that

1617
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
you could talk a little bit about the

1618
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,679
ecosystem services gains that you

1619
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,719
anticipate to be associated with the

1620
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:10,719
perennial system

1621
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:11,759
you did a lot of work on soil health

1622
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:13,519
assessment

1623
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,280
and there may be some reasons why you

1624
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:16,159
didn't see the difference based on the

1625
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,480
soil

1626
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:19,199
sampling depth but i'm curious if you

1627
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,519
think about

1628
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:23,679
quantifying ecosystem services gains

1629
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:25,599
moving forward from these systems

1630
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:26,960
what would you look at and what kind of

1631
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:30,079
benefits do you think you

1632
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,199
you'd um see if you expanded the kind of

1633
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:34,559
quantification that you

1634
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:38,159
that you do yeah well

1635
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:39,599
so well what i'll say is is

1636
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:41,358
is just based on what some of my

1637
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:44,318
collaborators have done

1638
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:45,838
um they're they're seeing a lot of

1639
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:47,039
benefits in area where there might be

1640
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:49,119
nitrate leashing

1641
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:50,159
so kern's a with those deep roots is

1642
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,400
able to

1643
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:54,879
like really prevent nitrate from getting

1644
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:58,160
down on the water table

1645
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:59,920
there have been um really good

1646
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:01,759
projects that have shown soil health

1647
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,519
benefits um

1648
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,200
over time maybe we didn't have the

1649
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:07,358
length of time necessary or maybe like

1650
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:10,719
you said sampling depth is an issue

1651
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:12,639
um i

1652
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:14,159
didn't know about stratified send about

1653
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:15,358
centimeters and still processing some of

1654
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:19,039
that data to see if there

1655
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:20,798
anything going on at depth there um

1656
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,719
i know that there's folks in kansas

1657
00:55:20,798 --> 00:55:26,000
doing things um

1658
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:29,358
with like uh gas exchange and trying to

1659
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,039
better understand uh like air uh quality

1660
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:32,318
and and greenhouse gas emissions and

1661
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:33,440
things from the system doing like sort

1662
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:37,358
of the net

1663
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:40,240
balance of stuff in and out um

1664
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:40,719
so i and then i mean i guess wildlife

1665
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:43,199
and

1666
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:44,399
uh some some work with uh ducks

1667
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:48,078
unlimited

1668
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:50,240
that um and the nrcs the um

1669
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:51,280
in sort of like conservation uh

1670
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:54,159
easements

1671
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,280
and the possibility of even like having

1672
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:57,279
a conservationist

1673
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,559
that you could harvest for a grain um if

1674
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:01,119
it's um

1675
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:02,079
providing so i guess this is a policy

1676
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,920
question and i'm not

1677
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:06,160
i don't want to go too far down that

1678
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:09,838
road but like thinking about it like

1679
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:10,318
if if the the plan itself is providing

1680
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:11,838
the

1681
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:14,000
the benefits to the system that you want

1682
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:16,000
from a conservation easement in terms of

1683
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,358
providing wildlife habitat protecting

1684
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,760
water um

1685
00:56:17,358 --> 00:56:21,039
then why not harvest it if that's not

1686
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:24,079
gonna do any damage

1687
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:25,838
right so um that's that's just another

1688
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:28,480
way of thinking about integrating it

1689
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:29,599
into a system and thinking beyond like

1690
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,880
current boundaries

1691
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:34,400
to how that might um might fit in

1692
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,680
somewhere else

1693
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:39,280
so i i would say if my personal next

1694
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:40,558
steps forward one thing that i've really

1695
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,319
started to focus on more

1696
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,920
is just weed management obviously i'm in

1697
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:44,960
tony's lab so that's something we focus

1698
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,960
on a lot but

1699
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,000
um really like we saw from that first

1700
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,880
experiment like

1701
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,559
what if we had um been able to manage

1702
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,760
weeds and kerns in that first year and

1703
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:55,359
prevented them from getting that

1704
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,720
foothold that might have persisted

1705
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:58,719
throughout the whole experiment

1706
00:56:56,719 --> 00:57:00,399
and the same thing with the rye if he

1707
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:02,000
had been able to maintain those those

1708
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,880
decent rye yields from the first year

1709
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,280
through three years

1710
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,079
then that's a really promising outcome

1711
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,680
um so

1712
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:10,079
over the past two years or so we've been

1713
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:12,159
doing some um

1714
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:14,318
some competition studies and also like i

1715
00:57:12,159 --> 00:57:17,759
i mentioned herbicide screenings

1716
00:57:14,318 --> 00:57:19,519
to try to so i think in order to get any

1717
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,799
services out of the system no matter

1718
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:22,719
what they end up being

1719
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:25,039
we need to have a productive and

1720
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:27,598
effective system in general so that

1721
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:28,719
includes all of these aspects and so

1722
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:30,880
that's actually one of the reasons why

1723
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:32,318
it's so great to have such a great team

1724
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,400
of collaborators both here at cornell

1725
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:35,358
and at other places is that

1726
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,440
different people are looking at

1727
00:57:35,358 --> 00:57:39,598
different aspects of it and

1728
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:42,079
and we come together and and try to

1729
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:45,359
figure out um

1730
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:45,359
how to handle it all together

1731
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:51,599
i know we're getting past time so if

1732
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:54,079
some people need need to leave eugene if

1733
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:55,760
folks have other questions anybody a

1734
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:58,170
burning question

1735
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,160
that you'd like to ask eugene

1736
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:03,599
[Music]

1737
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:06,318
eugene one quick question from me was uh

1738
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:08,000
what do we know from the consumer side

1739
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:08,960
of things are folks willing to pay a

1740
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,880
little more

1741
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,798
uh what are you kind of getting from

1742
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:16,000
from those results

1743
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:16,960
yeah we're working on that paper um with

1744
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,960
miguel

1745
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:22,720
gomez and dyson and um

1746
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,280
so that we did we did so what we did

1747
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:28,000
last fall uh fall 2019

1748
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,839
was a consumer preference testing so

1749
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,960
basically brought in a bunch of

1750
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:35,759
uh people into a computer lab

1751
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,559
gave them kerns of bread and then other

1752
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,640
breads

1753
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:40,079
um also very nice breads made by wide

1754
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:43,279
awake bakery

1755
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:43,839
and asked them what how what they liked

1756
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,000
about the

1757
00:58:43,838 --> 00:58:47,838
sort of like the taste and other

1758
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,440
culinary qualities of the breads

1759
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:51,519
and also what they would be willing to

1760
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:55,039
pay both

1761
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:56,239
with only the taste and once we provided

1762
00:58:55,039 --> 00:58:56,960
them with information about the

1763
00:58:56,239 --> 00:58:58,479
environmental

1764
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,559
potential environmental benefits of the

1765
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,599
crops of the crops that were used to

1766
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:05,359
create the bread so

1767
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:08,000
we had um kurnza at different variety

1768
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:08,798
levels of flower incorporation and then

1769
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,280
we had

1770
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:12,400
spelt as a as a comparison of sort of an

1771
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:16,480
interesting but

1772
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:17,519
um maybe not as ecologically beneficial

1773
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,559
grain

1774
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:22,400
um and so the re the real me the

1775
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:24,400
the high level takeaways there that

1776
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,240
people did not like the taste of turns

1777
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,318
of bread as much

1778
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:29,279
and this is in a general consumer pool

1779
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:31,440
and um

1780
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,280
it's it's more brandy it might have a

1781
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:36,400
bit more of a grassy flavor

1782
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:38,000
or sort of like um nutty flavor

1783
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,079
so some people like i love it i think

1784
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,400
it's great i've eaten a lot of kurenza

1785
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,240
but um for the general consumer market

1786
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,400
maybe not their taste but when you do

1787
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:48,159
give them that environmental information

1788
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,160
they were willing to pay more

1789
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:51,358
for for the kurza and that's both with

1790
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:56,078
and without um

1791
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:58,239
tasting and so that's that's promising

1792
00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:00,160
how much more i think was maybe like

1793
00:59:58,239 --> 01:00:02,239
five percent so with the yields

1794
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:04,399
how low they are you would still need to

1795
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:05,679
um the prop production cost

1796
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,119
uh trade-off that's something i'm

1797
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:07,838
working on in terms of the break-even

1798
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:09,440
analysis

1799
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:10,798
would need to be fairly high if you're

1800
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,760
only getting a five percent price

1801
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:14,880
premium

1802
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:18,319
um at the market but um

1803
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:23,519
it is showing that there is some um

1804
01:00:18,318 --> 01:00:23,519
potential for for um

1805
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:28,000
almost thinking of it like a payment for

1806
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:30,798
services if it's marketed right to

1807
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,679
maybe the right audience um it could it

1808
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:36,000
could have that

1809
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:38,078
benefit as well okay

1810
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,318
michael i see you have a chat question

1811
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:41,760
do you want to unmute and just ask it or

1812
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:43,279
would you like me to read it off maybe

1813
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:46,319
you could just ask

1814
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:48,798
sure hi thank you very much um um

1815
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:50,400
maybe this is a little apropos uh peter

1816
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:54,000
woodbury's question

1817
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:56,240
um i think of this as being part of a

1818
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,239
a step towards these more complex

1819
01:00:56,239 --> 01:00:59,759
polycultures and i'm curious i mean

1820
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:00,399
that's sort of the original attention

1821
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,599
behind the

1822
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,480
programs at the land institute etc i'm

1823
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:07,599
curious what are

1824
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:10,798
some of the more critical bottlenecks

1825
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:12,559
that resolving the

1826
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:15,679
resolving those would get us closer to

1827
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,680
the polyculture idea

1828
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:19,680
so i i think that there's a couple of

1829
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,119
things

1830
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:26,318
um from from an ecological perspective

1831
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:27,760
we just need to do more work on on

1832
01:01:26,318 --> 01:01:30,480
finding the right mixes

1833
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,359
and and the right sort of um both

1834
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,559
spatial

1835
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:37,119
and temporal um

1836
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:38,160
distributions like how you combine that

1837
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:41,119
so you can think of a

1838
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:42,000
polyculture in the field all at the same

1839
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:44,720
time

1840
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,519
or over time uh well that's more of a

1841
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:48,399
rotation but

1842
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:50,639
but in in thinking about like the large

1843
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:53,200
scale effect

1844
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:54,879
yeah so basically figuring out which

1845
01:01:53,199 --> 01:01:58,399
plants work well together and

1846
01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:01,358
and how they work together and then the

1847
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,599
the big challenge after that is is how

1848
01:02:01,358 --> 01:02:03,920
do

1849
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:05,519
like i think harvesting is particularly

1850
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,318
challenging especially if you're trying

1851
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:09,838
to get

1852
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:11,679
um like multiple um like if you're

1853
01:02:09,838 --> 01:02:13,038
like we did one experiment with harvest

1854
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:14,639
with putting perennial grains and then

1855
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:15,920
field peas together and tried to harvest

1856
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:18,159
both of them together

1857
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,440
and it was just really difficult just

1858
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:20,078
the differences in sort of like the

1859
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,720
maturity

1860
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:24,000
timing and the the height of the things

1861
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:26,480
you're trying to harvest

1862
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,280
and and having the right machinery to do

1863
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,719
that

1864
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:33,039
um so i i think even just that step

1865
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:35,679
of once you have a polyculture that

1866
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:39,680
where the plants actually get along

1867
01:02:35,679 --> 01:02:41,519
is is having a a system that supports

1868
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:44,879
that in terms of the

1869
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:47,038
like having machinery i mean

1870
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,079
even even with kernels by itself we've

1871
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,960
struggled so much

1872
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:52,160
with just getting it combined and then

1873
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,559
processed

1874
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:55,519
um and and we're using stuff that's

1875
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:58,160
designed for wheat

1876
01:02:55,519 --> 01:03:00,400
right and kerns is not wheat but but

1877
01:02:58,159 --> 01:03:02,159
that's what's available

1878
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,559
to growers and and even to us as

1879
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:06,000
researchers so so i think that's a big

1880
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:08,480
barrier

1881
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,880
i think um i think on one of my takeaway

1882
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:13,679
slides the complexity is a big barrier

1883
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,960
and so that's more of on an adoption

1884
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:19,199
side of things

1885
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:22,559
that um i think part of the reason that

1886
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:23,199
that growers do things well that they do

1887
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:26,640
is because

1888
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:29,038
it it it fits within their their job

1889
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:31,118
as a farmer and like they have

1890
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:34,160
limitations in terms of

1891
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:36,318
um their their labor their

1892
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:37,598
machinery their their land and their

1893
01:03:36,318 --> 01:03:40,558
time

1894
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:42,079
and get the more complex the system is

1895
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:42,880
the more management it's going to take

1896
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,119
and and that

1897
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,240
would require more people doing it or

1898
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:49,200
more time

1899
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:50,879
uh in general and and again with like

1900
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:52,879
the machinery aspect if you do need

1901
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,240
specialized machinery to harvest from

1902
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:57,039
one of these systems in

1903
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:58,959
an efficient manner then you're asking

1904
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:00,240
the farmer to go buy another piece of

1905
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:04,480
equipment which is

1906
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:07,279
can be incredibly costly so um

1907
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:09,119
like the simplification of agricultural

1908
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:13,680
systems is really

1909
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:18,318
at multiple levels to um

1910
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:20,879
to i mean it enables us to grow a lot on

1911
01:04:18,318 --> 01:04:21,519
a lot of acres in using a lot of the

1912
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,318
same

1913
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:26,159
machinery and a lot of the same methods

1914
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:29,759
and once you step outside of that

1915
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:31,199
it just be like it's the extra effort to

1916
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:35,599
step outside of that is

1917
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:35,598
is a little bit much for a lot of folks

1918
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:40,798
yeah thank you great i know we're way

1919
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:43,039
past time

1920
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:44,798
so um i would encourage anybody who's

1921
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:45,599
got some additional questions maybe to

1922
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:48,318
reach out to

1923
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:50,079
to eugene directly otherwise eugene

1924
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:51,358
thanks for those really nice talk

1925
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:52,880
covering a lot of

1926
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:55,199
and there's a lot more behind all of

1927
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,920
that obviously so thanks again to all of

1928
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:58,239
you who hung

1929
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,240
in there

1930
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:04,159
this has been a production of cornell
