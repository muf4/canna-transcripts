1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,439
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,439
university

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,320
so welcome everybody hello my name is

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:16,719
tony barracco and i currently assist

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,118
zachary stancil who is our hemp curator

6
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,239
at the usda ars

7
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:21,519
and

8
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,079
we help

9
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:26,879
run this hemp germplasm repository which

10
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:29,678
you can think of as a seed bank

11
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:33,920
and so our goal is to

12
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:34,799
collect a diverse genetic

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,200
hemp

14
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:40,238
and our second goal is to make this

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,559
diverse population of hemp available

16
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:44,399
and so

17
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:47,119
we all of this information that we

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,200
gather will be available on grin global

19
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,759
and that will be a tool that

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,000
researchers and educators can use

21
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,799
to replicate findings

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,520
and

23
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,640
have better reliable information

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,879
and so

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,159
today i would like to introduce our

26
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:06,118
speaker uh ethan russo he's a board

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,040
certified neurologist

28
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:12,159
psychopharmacology researcher and author

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,280
he is the founder and ceo of cradu

30
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,880
science

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,400
previously he was the director of

32
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,399
research and development of the

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,920
international cannabis and cannabinoids

34
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,478
institute based in prague czech republic

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,799
and he was a medical director of phytex

36
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,118
a biotechnology company researching and

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,960
developing innovative approaches to

38
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:34,799
targeting the human endocannabinoid

39
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,798
system and from 2003 to 2014 he served

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,118
as senior medical advisor medical

41
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,680
monitor and study physician to gw

42
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:44,000
pharmaceuticals in the united kingdom

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,040
for numerous phase one to three clinical

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,078
trials of sativex for alleviation of

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,759
cancer pain unresponsive to optimized

46
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,000
opioid treatment

47
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,200
and initial studies of epiduralx for

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,159
interactable

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,040
in intractable epilepsy so without

50
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,880
further ado i'll give ethan the room and

51
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,880
take us away ethan thank you thank you

52
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,718
so much it's a pleasure to be with you i

53
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:11,199
should mention that

54
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:14,639
my late father was an alumnus of cornell

55
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:17,119
uh starting back i believe in 1938

56
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,000
um anyway so it's a pleasure to be with

57
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,280
you

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,199
so i have a

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,280
difficult task today to sort of

60
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,359
summarize the endocannabinoid system and

61
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,680
the pharmacology of hemp but i tried to

62
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,599
make this complementary to other

63
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,239
lectures in the series

64
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,839
my email is listed here and i'd be happy

65
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,480
to hear from you with questions

66
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,719
subsequently

67
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,878
uh this is my disclaimer i'm not going

68
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,878
to spend a lot of time on this i deal

69
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:45,598
with a lot of different companies in one

70
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:48,159
capacity or another most of these have

71
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:51,039
not been remunerative and they would

72
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:54,079
have no bearing on the particular

73
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,079
content today

74
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,959
the material that i'm going to discuss

75
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,959
is mostly not

76
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,239
approved by the u.s food and drug

77
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,959
administration if people were to use any

78
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,800
of these materials the results might

79
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,439
vary

80
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,519
so we're talking of course about

81
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:17,759
cannabis sativa cultivated cannabis

82
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,480
this is how we came to learn of the

83
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:23,280
thing called the endocannabinoid system

84
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,598
so this makes cannabinoids in glandular

85
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,120
trichomes on unfertilized female

86
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:29,839
flowering tops

87
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,519
that give us tetrahydrocannabinol

88
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,400
and it was through research of this

89
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,000
molecule

90
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,959
that it was discovered that there were

91
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,919
endogenous cannabinoids uh particularly

92
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,479
anandamide and two arachidonyl glycerol

93
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,639
that actually lodge on cannabinoid

94
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:48,318
receptors

95
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,839
and so these are called endocannabinoids

96
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:50,679
um

97
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,200
the

98
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,760
endocannabinoid system is an internal

99
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:58,318
homeostatic regulatory system in

100
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:01,199
chordates and there are three components

101
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:04,639
the endogenous cannabinoids as mentioned

102
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:07,119
the cb1 cb2 and what's called the trip

103
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,919
v1 receptor probably other receptors

104
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,438
such as serotonin

105
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,039
1a receptor also includes the regulatory

106
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,040
enzymes

107
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,199
in the nervous system

108
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,439
the endocannabinoids are produced on

109
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,639
demand and travel in a retrograde

110
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:26,240
fashion to the cb1 receptor where they

111
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,000
then inhibit the release of

112
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,680
neurotransmitters

113
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,399
in this instance glutamate is a

114
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,360
stimulatory neurotransmitter so if if

115
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,560
this is inhibited there's a net loss of

116
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,960
function

117
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,639
if however

118
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,879
there are

119
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,040
is gaba here which is an inhibitory

120
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,120
neurotransmitter the net effect is a

121
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,600
stimulation

122
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,478
in the endocannabinoid system there are

123
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,840
probably 98 other molecules that

124
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:58,478
resemble anandamide and

125
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,478
on these active and inactive components

126
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:03,680
work together in what's been called an

127
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,680
entourage effect

128
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,240
the cb1 expression brain is extensive

129
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,439
there actually are more cb1 receptors

130
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,840
than there are for all the

131
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:16,319
neurotransmitters combined

132
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:19,918
cb1 is highly expressed in areas of the

133
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:21,120
brain that pertain to pain responses

134
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:22,319
balance

135
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,399
emotion

136
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,399
and reward pathways

137
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,279
and although uh it also is in the

138
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,839
brainstem they're barely any cannabinoid

139
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:34,319
receptors in the medullary areas that

140
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,159
subserve respiratory drive

141
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,360
and so there is no

142
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,400
dose of thc or related cannabinoids that

143
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,120
can cause apnea or stopping breathing

144
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:47,359
like the opiates do

145
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,038
the endocannabinoid system is also

146
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,919
throughout the other areas of the

147
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:54,478
nervous system including the spinal cord

148
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:57,038
the periphery and the gut the enteric

149
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:59,279
nervous system

150
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:02,719
the role of the endocannabinoid system

151
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:05,198
has been summarized as relaxed eat sleep

152
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,520
forget and protect but we could provide

153
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,439
about 30 other adjectives

154
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:12,399
that would also apply

155
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:16,160
and so it is the thing that modulates

156
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:18,318
pain memory movement emotion appetite

157
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,360
uh whether someone will vomit or not

158
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,759
have a seizure or not

159
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:27,038
gastrointestinal movement and secretion

160
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,600
and just about any other function

161
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,800
there are also cb2 receptors these are

162
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,680
mainly peripheral this is a

163
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:39,520
non-psychoactive receptor that modulates

164
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:43,840
immune responses and inflammation

165
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:45,918
it also has an anti-fibrotic effect

166
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:46,799
so there are many conditions

167
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:48,719
where

168
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,199
stimulation of this system can be

169
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,199
helpful

170
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,240
the cb2

171
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,879
has been

172
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,280
typified as a protective system for all

173
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,199
these different organs and we'd single

174
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,279
out the liver where

175
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,560
stimulation of this would seem to have a

176
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:11,758
role in preventing cirrhosis and other

177
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,759
problems in the liver

178
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,240
it's also in the skin both cb1 and cb2

179
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,560
the familiar cannabidiol

180
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,000
in addition to being anti-inflammatory

181
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,319
and bacteriostatic it works in another

182
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,079
receptor called trip v4

183
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,639
and actually inhibits the release of

184
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,399
sebum which is the oily stuff on the

185
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,598
skin that

186
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,918
is the

187
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,959
place where the bacteria that produce

188
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:40,959
acne feed

189
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,199
and again throughout the body although

190
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:48,318
this looks like a heartless and

191
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,478
spineless individual

192
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,720
all those functions are also subserved

193
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:55,680
and modulated by the endocannabinoid

194
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,160
system in fact cannabidiol was recently

195
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,160
shown to stimulate bone fracture healing

196
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,879
and may actually be indicated for

197
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,879
athletes in the future if the laws

198
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,879
change

199
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,560
now let's turn to the plant which i

200
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,240
think is going to be of more interest to

201
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,720
this audience

202
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,598
so again cultivated cannabis

203
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,800
uh probably the most useful single plant

204
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,038
on earth

205
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,520
in that it provides food from the seed

206
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:24,000
fuel from the seed oil fiber from the

207
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,719
stocks and pharmacy mainly from the

208
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,639
unfertilized female flowering tops

209
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,879
and this is a diacious annual that's

210
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:35,200
been assigned to the cannabisi family

211
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:37,599
along with hops and a few others

212
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,599
whoops

213
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:43,278
there is a chemical typology of cannabis

214
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,240
that was developed by ernest small going

215
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:46,240
back

216
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,278
clear into the 70s

217
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,680
type 1 is the more familiar high thc

218
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:54,399
quinovar's chemical varieties

219
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:57,199
there are no strains in cannabis strains

220
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,639
are for bacteria and viruses

221
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:04,240
type 2 is mixed generally with thc and

222
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:07,039
cbd of equal proportions

223
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,320
type 3 of the cbd predominant chemovars

224
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:09,599
that have come into the fore

225
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,000
particularly

226
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,200
since the farm bill

227
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,039
um this is from an article a few years

228
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,200
back and it shows the different parts of

229
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,799
the plants and the heterogeneous

230
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,680
production

231
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,919
of chemicals in the different parts

232
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,599
again the greatest concentration of

233
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,079
cannabinoids and

234
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,120
monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids is

235
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,440
in the

236
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,440
glandular trichomes of the unfertilized

237
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,279
female flowering tops

238
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,519
but they're totally different chemicals

239
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:43,360
in the roots tri-terpenoids and

240
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,519
alkaloids and in the seeds we have

241
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,560
essential fatty acids

242
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,560
high quality a dust and protein on their

243
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:53,919
various

244
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:53,919
anti-inflammatory compounds throughout

245
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,120
um in terms of the distribution of thc

246
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:04,240
and other cannabinoids this again is

247
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,560
greatest in the ganjar sensamiya

248
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,519
unfertilized female flowering tops much

249
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:11,838
greater than those that are fertilized

250
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:16,278
and very much higher than the leaves and

251
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,279
there's almost none elsewhere

252
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,759
uh close up of the capital glandular

253
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,519
trichomes these are of the highest

254
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:30,159
volume uh these are found on the brats

255
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:33,600
around the unfertilized female flowers

256
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:35,838
as opposed to sessile trichomes found in

257
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,560
the leaves of a much

258
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,880
smaller volume also qualitatively

259
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:44,078
different these tend to be higher in

260
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:47,838
bitter sesquiterpenoids that discourage

261
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:50,879
discourage grazing such as by beer and

262
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,880
other ungulates

263
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,200
um these are the 12 best typified

264
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:58,319
phytocannabinoids cannabinoids from

265
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,519
plants

266
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,560
we see the familiar thc in cannabidiol

267
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,600
um

268
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:07,518
and we've also got the uh cannabinoid

269
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,959
acids that are the precursors in the

270
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,759
fresh state

271
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:16,239
um each of these has unique pharmacology

272
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,240
and we'll get into that in a little bit

273
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,958
this is the biosynthetic pathway of the

274
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,399
cannabinoids generally starting with

275
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:27,759
these two precursors all of a tolic acid

276
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:30,159
with a five carbon pentyl side chain and

277
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,399
geranile pyrophosphate

278
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,078
so these start out

279
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,639
being the parent compounds for

280
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:40,039
cannabidiolic acid

281
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:42,519
and subsequently that goes down to

282
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:44,639
tetrahydrocannabinolic acid thca and

283
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:47,039
cannabidiolic acid

284
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,199
any of these under heat or light will

285
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,958
get decarboxylated to the neutral

286
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,759
cannabinoids

287
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,319
now

288
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:57,519
journal pyrophosphate can also react

289
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,278
with diverinic acid which is has got a

290
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,440
propyl side chain

291
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:04,559
and this produces the propyl

292
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,040
cannabinoids that we see on this side

293
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,479
additionally journal pyrophosphate is

294
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:12,799
also the parent compound to the

295
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,000
monoterpenoids and the sesquiterpenoids

296
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,879
um so

297
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,120
the

298
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,120
terpenoids and

299
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,919
the cannabinoids are both produced in

300
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:26,399
glandular trichomes and they're half

301
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,399
siblings based on a common parent

302
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:32,319
why does the plant make these well i can

303
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,560
tell you i was not put on god's green

304
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,360
earth to get people high

305
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,518
um

306
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,800
humans are per perhaps several hundred

307
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,399
thousand years old this plant is 30

308
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:45,039
million years old

309
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,919
but the endocannabinoid system has been

310
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:49,599
present in the animals for uh 600

311
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:52,399
million years

312
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,240
so just uh get an idea of the ontogeny

313
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,679
of this all

314
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,519
but thc

315
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,319
is production is greatest in bright

316
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,879
light and it may be

317
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,800
there to reduce ultraviolet light damage

318
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,838
to the genome

319
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:09,599
cbg and cbd are both anti-fungal

320
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,240
uh the trichomes

321
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,519
form a mechanical insect trap

322
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,560
and uh some of the acid cannabinoids are

323
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,440
actually insecticidal they also produce

324
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,838
necrosis and plant cells

325
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,240
a bushy plant at the beginning will

326
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,959
prune itself towards the end to look

327
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,560
more like this very lanky and this is

328
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:33,518
its final efforts at gaining

329
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:35,359
fertilization which we humans

330
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:39,519
prevent

331
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,519
to increase the amount of cannabinoids

332
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:46,239
so talking about thc

333
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,720
so this obviously is the major

334
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,600
psychoactive component of cannabis

335
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,440
uh not isolated and identified until

336
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,720
1964 by professor micholim in israel is

337
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,199
still still active at age 91.

338
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,160
it is a weak partial agonist that both

339
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:05,039
the cb1 and cb2 receptor

340
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,319
uh

341
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,360
is pain killing analgesic prevents uh

342
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,800
itching

343
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,159
also bronchodilatory in the 19th century

344
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:15,919
uh

345
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,639
cannabis cigarettes were used to treat

346
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:21,559
asthma it's also a neuroprotective

347
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,600
antioxidant it has 20 times the

348
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:25,679
anti-inflammatory power of aspirin and

349
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,879
twice that of hydrocortisone

350
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:31,278
so muscle relaxant that's the basis for

351
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:33,759
the approval of satellites in 30

352
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:37,039
countries to treat spasticity might

353
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:39,120
muscle tightness associated with with

354
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:41,599
multiple sclerosis

355
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,278
it's well known as an antiemetic helping

356
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,519
prevent nausea and vomiting and

357
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:48,000
chemotherapy patients

358
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:51,198
on it is neither a cox-1 or cox-2

359
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,440
inhibitor like the non-steroidals a very

360
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:54,479
interesting property is it seems to

361
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,199
prevent

362
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,199
a buildup of beta-amyloid and

363
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:01,198
alzheimer's disease

364
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,399
cannabidiol

365
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,639
is

366
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,759
not intoxicating it is psychoactive

367
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,480
however

368
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,720
on its pharmacology is actually broader

369
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,800
although this is much less potent

370
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,199
molecule per molecule

371
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:18,479
it was isolated in 1940 but only

372
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:20,799
identified positively in 1963.

373
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,959
it does not bind directly to the cb1

374
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:25,439
receptors but rather is what's called a

375
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:28,159
negative allosteric modulator

376
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,000
it binds to another receptor and affects

377
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,879
the binding in a way

378
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,480
that reduces the psychoactive effects of

379
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,679
thc

380
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,399
again a neuroprotective antioxidant

381
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,078
it's stronger than vitamin c or vitamin

382
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,198
e in this regard

383
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:47,278
like capsaicin it is an agonist at the

384
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:49,838
trip v1 receptor

385
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:52,240
with about equal potency

386
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,040
it may desensitize the receptor which is

387
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,600
helpful in in pain responses

388
00:15:55,039 --> 00:16:00,719
it also increases the gain of the

389
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,320
endocannabinoid system by inhibiting the

390
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,000
uptake of anandamide and inhibiting its

391
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,480
breakdown

392
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,919
contrary to popular belief

393
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,399
this is a stimulatory compound

394
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:17,278
uh it's an anti-convulsant this is the

395
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:20,000
basis for its fda approval

396
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:23,360
as epi dialects in treating gervais and

397
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,759
lennox gastow syndromes in high doses it

398
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,360
is an anti-anxiety agent

399
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,600
cannabidiol

400
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,879
like the other cannabinoids has a

401
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,480
cytotoxic effect against multiple

402
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,078
cancer cells

403
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,320
while at the same time being

404
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:41,838
preservative for normal cells so this is

405
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,800
quite different to conventional

406
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,800
pharmacology

407
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,839
agents used in chemotherapy that tend to

408
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,839
be generally toxic

409
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,919
um

410
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:58,159
it also acts on a thing called tumor

411
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:00,719
necrosis factor alpha which is uh

412
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:04,798
important in rheumatoid arthritis

413
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,679
inflammatory bowel diseases and other

414
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:10,318
autoimmune diseases again not a coccyx1

415
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,759
or cox2 inhibitor

416
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:16,159
our group identified this as an agonist

417
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:19,038
at the serotonin 1a receptor and that's

418
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,919
the basis for its effect on anxiety

419
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,798
also to reduce damage due to strokes

420
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,439
and

421
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:28,000
problems in thinking related to

422
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,400
liver failure

423
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,319
it also works on the adenosine receptor

424
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,559
a2a

425
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:37,359
may have a role in preventing slow virus

426
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:40,160
infection and as mentioned previously

427
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:42,079
stimulates bone fracture healing

428
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,000
now there are a lot of misconceptions

429
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:46,079
about cannabidiol

430
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,400
a lot of companies sell products where

431
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,879
there's a tiny amount five milligrams

432
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,759
here 10 milligrams there

433
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,160
generally when cannabidiol is used as an

434
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:58,839
isolate very high doses are needed to

435
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,759
have the desirable effects

436
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:04,159
again uh it's commonly reported to be a

437
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:07,200
sedative uh but it's not

438
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,000
uh the early chemovars in available in

439
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,679
the u.s with cannabidiol in them tended

440
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,798
to be very high in mercy of sedating

441
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,679
terpene

442
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:19,519
on this produce the misconception

443
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,679
that it's sedative

444
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,798
uh you will hear that this is legal in

445
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,720
all 50 states but this is still a matter

446
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:29,279
of debate yes

447
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:33,919
certain commerce in canada was allowed

448
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:36,720
under the agriculture farm bill in 2018

449
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:39,679
but it remains a schedule one product

450
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:44,480
outside of its use as epidiolex

451
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,440
um so uh according to the fda uh it's

452
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,798
still

453
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,679
illegal

454
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:49,440
um

455
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,960
there's also a misconception that it

456
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,919
turns to thc in the body uh last year a

457
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,519
group in brazil had um a

458
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,960
very interesting trial they used

459
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:00,480
hundreds of milligrams of pure

460
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,640
cannabidiol

461
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,640
in a great number of patients and

462
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,038
recovered no thc

463
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,120
as a metabolite

464
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:11,038
this is a schematic of the natural

465
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:15,199
history of

466
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:18,558
cbd from a hemp field in kentucky

467
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:22,279
showing the glandular trichomes

468
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:24,678
then again the biosynthetic pathway to

469
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:27,200
cannabidiolic acid which is

470
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:28,960
decarboxylated by heat lighter aging to

471
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,759
produce cannabidiol

472
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,640
this is what the pure crystals look like

473
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,759
and

474
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,559
um again

475
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:41,119
in normal hepatic metabolism

476
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,720
we get seven hydroxycannabidiol

477
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,359
we don't get

478
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,360
thc

479
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,558
now we're going to turn to some

480
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,120
applications

481
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:56,720
um first epilepsy is mentioned uh cbd as

482
00:19:53,119 --> 00:20:00,959
epidiolex has been approved

483
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:03,200
to treat a couple of rare but important

484
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,880
seizure syndromes called gervain lennox

485
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,960
gusto syndromes

486
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,159
but at very high doses

487
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,240
thcs all can be pro convulsion produce

488
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:15,679
seizures and rodents at extreme doses

489
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,480
but this is not substantiated in humans

490
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,679
um

491
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,798
there are other anti-convulsants in

492
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:26,840
cannabis including tetrahydrocannabin

493
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:29,918
lenol which is a terpenoid on likely

494
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:33,199
tetrodocannabinolic acid

495
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:36,080
interestingly although

496
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,200
in full spectrum products

497
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,519
um

498
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,000
reportedly there have been results in

499
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:46,798
treating seizures that are as good

500
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,558
as cbd at about five times the dose

501
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:51,279
now to be fair

502
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:53,918
um epidialex went through

503
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:55,759
randomized controlled trials whereas

504
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,280
these other preparations these are

505
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:02,240
observations um that were not controlled

506
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,399
with placebos

507
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,200
cbd is also

508
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,519
been used in on

509
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,159
treating schizophrenia

510
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:15,359
thc as cannabis is widely used by

511
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,200
psychotic patients perhaps trying to

512
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,199
cover some symptoms

513
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:23,120
we know that early use in the

514
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,798
susceptible patient may precipitate

515
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,599
earlier expression

516
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:30,240
of schizophrenia but only in those with

517
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:32,480
a seeming predisposition in other words

518
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,279
there's no evidence that you make

519
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:39,279
someone schizophrenic if they did not

520
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:42,000
have a predisposition before that

521
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:45,279
there have been two phase two randomized

522
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,798
controlled trials of cbd at high doses

523
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:50,240
in the 800 to 1000 milligram day range

524
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:52,558
uh both

525
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,720
uh effective on positive and negative

526
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:57,960
symptoms of schizophrenia

527
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,400
equivalent to the results with atypical

528
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,400
antipsychotics but with fewer side

529
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,440
effects so this is something that

530
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:09,360
definitely should be pursued

531
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,840
um the biosynthetic pathway here

532
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,279
is that for

533
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:15,038
cannabidirol which is the next one i'd

534
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:17,440
like to discuss and it's particularly

535
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:20,319
pertinent because there are now

536
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,360
chemovars of cannabis available that are

537
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:26,399
predominantly or solely can have a juror

538
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:29,678
with no thc and these can qualify

539
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,640
as hemp quote unquote under the farm

540
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,640
bill

541
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,480
so much as before

542
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,280
um we've got

543
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:41,919
olivetolic acid journal pyrophosphate to

544
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:45,038
cannabis uralic acid under heat or light

545
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:48,159
there's decarboxylation to cannabinoid

546
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:49,919
and this is a picture of a cannabidirl

547
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,720
only chemovar

548
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,720
from gw pharmaceuticals

549
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:01,679
uh the science of cbg has been less

550
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:04,720
investigated but is very uh compelling

551
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,840
uh this is first isolated in 1964 from

552
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,360
lebanese hashish again by professor

553
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:11,599
michilan and they call this the missing

554
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:14,399
link in the plant synthesis cannabinoid

555
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:16,158
constituents it is the precursor to the

556
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,720
others

557
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,520
initial studies really didn't show much

558
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,839
in

559
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:25,519
the animal

560
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:27,519
studies um it was synthesized in 1971

561
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,960
this was shown to be a gaba uptake

562
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:30,000
inhibitor

563
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,038
that could

564
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,400
explain some of the roles as a muscle

565
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:39,359
relaxant and an anti-anxiety agent

566
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,919
it has antifungal properties it has

567
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:44,959
analgesic painkilling properties

568
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,038
like tcm may lower pressure in the eye

569
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,840
on glaucoma although

570
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:53,200
these are greasy molecules and nobody's

571
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:56,000
figured out how to apply it directly

572
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,240
effectively

573
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,240
and um there were pain killing

574
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,599
properties that were noted in this

575
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,278
experiment

576
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:05,439
light cbd

577
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:08,240
this is cytotoxic for a variety of

578
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:12,558
cancer cells

579
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,640
in 2005 cbg only plant was developed it

580
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:16,839
just doesn't have the enzymatic

581
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,799
equipment to go beyond

582
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:20,480
cbga

583
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:24,400
this has been effective in various

584
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,400
cancer cell lines and breast cancer

585
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,679
it showed antidepressant effects in the

586
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,360
animals

587
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,840
lowers blood pressure

588
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:35,199
it may reduce the production production

589
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:38,399
of keratinocytes in psoriasis

590
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:41,360
um it has only a weak partial agonist

591
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,320
activity at the cannabinoid receptors a

592
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:46,959
tenth of that of thc and even in high

593
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:49,200
doses doesn't seem to be intoxicating

594
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,519
the way thc is

595
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,000
fascinating study from 2008 show

596
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:57,038
powerful antibiotic activity against

597
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:01,640
gram positives especially methicillin

598
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,640
resistant staphylococcus aureus

599
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:04,079
um

600
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,000
it also stimulates several trip channels

601
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:11,038
especially trip and mate which suggests

602
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,839
benefit

603
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:14,798
in bladder cancer

604
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:17,359
um and

605
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:19,599
like cbd it also inhibits a nandomite

606
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:20,959
uptake and may increase the gain of the

607
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:21,918
system

608
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,679
um

609
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,440
it

610
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,798
also affects uh

611
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,840
p part gamma nuclear receptor and down

612
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:32,798
regulated tumor necrosis factor alpha

613
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:35,519
um

614
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:37,119
and there was a recent study that showed

615
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:38,519
um

616
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:41,278
that it worked on

617
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:44,879
glioblastoma multiforme the worst form

618
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:44,880
of brain tumor

619
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,400
uh interestingly this

620
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:51,918
molecule both cannabidiolic acid and

621
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,038
cannabidiol

622
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,440
have been found in a south african daisy

623
00:25:55,038 --> 00:26:00,798
called helichrysum on broccoli gerum but

624
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,798
only in trace amounts

625
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,200
last year

626
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:11,080
our group studied cannabidirl the first

627
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,080
human subject study

628
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,720
we

629
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,000
put this through an institutional review

630
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,400
board

631
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
worked online

632
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:25,278
and required that people be adults and

633
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,640
that they had used the cbg predominant

634
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:31,038
product at least 50 cbg in the past six

635
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,038
months

636
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:39,278
and uh this just shows the demographics

637
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:41,120
uh we had 127 completers of the survey

638
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:43,359
predominantly female

639
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:45,839
women are better at following directions

640
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:48,879
on surveys

641
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:51,439
and unlike most studies of patient

642
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,880
groups using cannabis the majority were

643
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,640
working

644
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,360
so unless these people

645
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,840
were high functioning

646
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:00,959
the average duration of use was nine

647
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:01,839
months

648
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,000
and

649
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:07,599
people had an average of about three and

650
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,400
a half grams of cbg flour a week or a

651
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:11,519
gram of concentrate a week

652
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,320
that's

653
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,158
lower than what we usually

654
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:20,359
attribute to

655
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,360
thc predominant chemoverse

656
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:26,399
a variety of conditions that you see

657
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:29,278
lifted on the left uh were treated uh by

658
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:31,839
these patients with cannabidiol

659
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:34,159
over half used it medically

660
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:37,439
with only a small percentage

661
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:41,760
they feel it was recreational and uh it

662
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:44,000
was a mix for of 36.2

663
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:47,119
the most common conditions cited were

664
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,359
anxiety chronic pain depression and

665
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,759
insomnia which are

666
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:54,158
quite similar to the demographics that

667
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:57,158
we see for other forms of cannabis used

668
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,159
therapeutically

669
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:03,278
in terms of the efficacy of the cbg

670
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,120
treatment the majority of conditions

671
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:07,278
reportedly were much or very much

672
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:09,839
improved

673
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:12,000
although the numbers were small on each

674
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:14,158
two thirds of the people who used

675
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,599
different endometriosis found it

676
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,600
beneficial

677
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,678
and three-quarters of those with

678
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:22,158
inflammatory bowel disease

679
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,320
um and for a greater number for

680
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,200
irritable bowel syndrome

681
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:28,000
um

682
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,759
interestingly in no instance that people

683
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,558
think the conventional medicine that

684
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:34,640
they had taken previously was superior

685
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:37,759
to cbg for

686
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,759
any of the conditions

687
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,480
um we're always concerned about whether

688
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,480
the withdrawal effects

689
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:50,880
but a number of people actually were

690
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:54,079
able to discontinue antidepressants

691
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,960
um non-opioid painkillers and protein

692
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:58,960
pump

693
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:01,200
inhibitors after taking cbg

694
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,319
in terms of side effects

695
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,759
44

696
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:04,879
reported none

697
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,278
none

698
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,278
um when there were side effects the most

699
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:12,640
common were dry mild sleepiness

700
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:14,960
increased appetite dry eyes which all

701
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,520
really are likely related to some amount

702
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,159
of thc in those preparations

703
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,879
because with cbg preparations we don't

704
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:27,039
see these complaints

705
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:29,440
10 percent reported side benefits

706
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:31,919
on terms of withdrawal from the medicine

707
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,919
itself

708
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:37,278
84.3 percent reported no withdrawal

709
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:38,079
symptoms

710
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:40,880
and

711
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:44,079
compared to non-cbg cannabis the more

712
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,919
typical thc type cannabis

713
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,918
there were many fewer issues

714
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,640
so conclusions of the survey study

715
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:58,720
we know that usage of this is increasing

716
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,240
particularly in the pacific northwest

717
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,480
where i live

718
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,880
this was the first study of potential

719
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,278
therapeutic effects in humans

720
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,520
anxiety pain depression insomnia were

721
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:10,720
the most commonly reported target

722
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,038
symptoms

723
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,319
the perceived efficacy was quite high

724
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:19,519
with few adverse events

725
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:22,398
um the efficacy that was reported in

726
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:26,158
inflammatory bowel diseases

727
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:30,319
also goes along with reports of cbg

728
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,320
being beneficial in animal models

729
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:35,918
we believe that the survey supports the

730
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:39,278
idea that cbg would be safe for future

731
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:43,440
randomized controlled trials

732
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:45,919
um how does cbg compare to cbd

733
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,519
well both can treat pain anxiety and

734
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,559
need sleep

735
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:53,278
both affect the trp channels have

736
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:55,398
antibiotic properties and are cytotoxic

737
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:57,759
for cancers and may increase

738
00:30:55,398 --> 00:31:00,719
endocannabinoid tone

739
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:02,480
however cannabigirl is a lot more potent

740
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,720
than cbd

741
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,120
basically that means fewer milligrams

742
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,038
are necessary to be effective

743
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:11,918
for example

744
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:16,319
um anti-anxiety effects

745
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:20,000
of cbd may require 100 to 400 milligrams

746
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:22,158
whereas 10 to 20 milligrams of cbg

747
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,960
seem to be effective

748
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:28,159
um again cbg only chemovars are

749
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,360
available in some jurisdictions

750
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,600
whereas

751
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:36,639
it's very hard to eliminate thc

752
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:36,639
completely from type 3 cbd chemovars

753
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,880
compared to thc

754
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:45,918
cannabidiro likely would be a useful

755
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,640
adjunct to many thc chemovars by

756
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,000
providing synergistic benefits on pain

757
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,278
sleep and mood

758
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,720
uh because

759
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:56,720
cbg has a strong anti-anxiety effect it

760
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:01,038
may increase the therapeutic index of

761
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:03,440
thc giving you more leeway in dosing

762
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:05,839
and what do we expect from this

763
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,720
well what one of the things the world

764
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:11,278
needs now is a safe non-sedating

765
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:14,079
non-addictive agent to treat anxiety and

766
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:15,839
cbg may be the best candidate i've ever

767
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:18,960
seen

768
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:21,278
it seems to be quite safe and versatile

769
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,399
so its addition to various cannabis

770
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:27,038
based preparations makes sense

771
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:29,199
i could be an impressive agent for

772
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:32,000
primary cancer treatment

773
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,640
again because it kills cancer cells but

774
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,720
it doesn't kill normal cells

775
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,880
and is not intoxicating like thc

776
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,919
and this could be an antibiotic of the

777
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:47,200
future especially from mrsa and another

778
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:50,880
resistant bug of vancomycin resistant

779
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:53,840
enterococcus via re

780
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,640
on another agent in cannabis uh hard to

781
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:59,199
come by is cannabi chromine this is

782
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,200
produced by a recessive gene usually

783
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,278
there are only trace amounts if any in

784
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,159
most types of cannabis

785
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:08,640
it's also antibiotic and antifungal

786
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,960
cytotoxic

787
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,440
and extract produced antidepressant

788
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,480
effects and rodents again working on

789
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,278
various trip channels and inhibiting the

790
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:22,159
breakdown of anandamide

791
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:25,119
um but again selective breeding may make

792
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:28,000
this more available now turning to the

793
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:31,518
cannabinoid acids cannabidiolic acid is

794
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,640
what the plant makes before cbd

795
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,960
so this is the predominant

796
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,919
phytocannabinoid and fresh hemp

797
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,399
it is a natural herbicide

798
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,640
this one can produce cox inhibition but

799
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:44,959
only at extreme doses which should never

800
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:49,200
be necessary

801
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,880
is a powerful agent as an antimatter

802
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,880
preventing vomiting

803
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,519
this is mediated through the serotonin

804
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:59,039
receptor and it's about between 100 and

805
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:00,880
a thousand times more effective than cbd

806
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:03,599
itself

807
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,480
based on historical data of how hemp was

808
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:10,559
used by the renaissance herbalist

809
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,559
and maybe he's full on treating tumors

810
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,398
i think we skipped something here okay

811
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,000
no that's fine

812
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:20,078
um

813
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,679
in relation to the entourage effect we

814
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,760
mentioned this before

815
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,358
uh with the entourage of

816
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,440
endocannabinoids

817
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:29,358
but the same may apply to

818
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,079
phytocannabinoids

819
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:34,159
um quote from 1999 this type of

820
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:37,440
synergism may play a role in the widely

821
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,280
held but not experimentally based view

822
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,440
that in some cases plants are better

823
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,480
drugs than the natural products isolated

824
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,280
from them

825
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:49,039
well that was 1999 actually we have a

826
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:51,760
lot of ammunition to support the idea of

827
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:53,279
synergy of the entourage effect in

828
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,679
cannabis

829
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,119
and we see this clinically in

830
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,519
combinations

831
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:02,160
of full spectrum products

832
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:04,400
but again cannabis doesn't just make

833
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:06,679
cannabinoids it also makes the

834
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,440
terpenoids which may be painkillers

835
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:12,159
anti-inflammatory have mood modulating

836
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,320
effects and reduce the side effects of

837
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:15,598
thc

838
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,119
we see here

839
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,680
some of the main

840
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,280
terpenoids found in cannabis also other

841
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:25,679
plants

842
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:28,160
that are common to produce the same ones

843
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:31,598
going through these very quick quickly

844
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:34,159
um the most prevalent terpene in

845
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,680
cannabis is beta mercy and also found in

846
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:38,000
celery leaf

847
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:40,319
uh i call this the primary couch lock

848
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,039
factor in cannabis because it is

849
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,880
extremely sedating when combined with

850
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:47,039
thc

851
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,960
and the sedation is a

852
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:51,759
narcotic like effect

853
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,079
uh it is a painkiller but it can be

854
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,720
antagonized by naloxone the thing that

855
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,720
they give as an antidote to opioid

856
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:00,480
overdoses

857
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:02,719
so it's working through a different

858
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,559
mechanism

859
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:06,639
there tends to be a great deal of this

860
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:08,639
in most kinds of cannabis and we usually

861
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:11,920
want to see less

862
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:14,559
so that the results are less sedating

863
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,800
for the chronic pain patient

864
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:19,119
interesting but less

865
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,320
seen in cannabis these days is alpha

866
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,640
pinene

867
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,599
this is the most common terpene in

868
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:27,199
nature

869
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,480
from pine needles and other conifers

870
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:31,439
it's

871
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,000
bioavailable via inhalation it is a

872
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:38,800
bronchodilator like thc

873
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:41,639
it has wide spectrum antibiotic activity

874
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,519
its greatest effect though is as an

875
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:46,159
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor

876
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:48,480
acetylcholine is the memory molecule

877
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:50,319
neurotransmitter in the brain

878
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,159
and because uh

879
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:56,720
alpha pinene reduces its breakdown

880
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:58,879
its presence in cannabis may reduce or

881
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:00,719
eliminate short-term memory impairment

882
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,720
by thc

883
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,719
it also may have a neuroprotective

884
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:07,039
effect as we see here

885
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:09,118
um all this is supported by the fact

886
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:11,440
that uh

887
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,760
walking in a pine forest or what the

888
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,079
japanese call shinrin yoku or forest

889
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,320
bathing is very good for clearing the

890
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,320
head

891
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,760
another agent we'd like to see more of

892
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,000
in cannabis is d limonene the scent is

893
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,079
going to be familiar to anyone who's

894
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,559
been near citrus

895
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:34,400
whether it be lemons limes oranges etc

896
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:36,799
in humans this has had a potent

897
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,760
antidepressant and immune stimulating

898
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,720
effect

899
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,400
that was shown in hospitalized depressed

900
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:44,559
patients in japan

901
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,358
lowering hamilton depression scores and

902
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:50,239
allowing discontinuation of standard

903
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:53,920
antidepressants

904
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:57,679
this also may be useful as a dietary aid

905
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:00,079
it increases mitochondrial biogenesis

906
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:03,039
and may turn white fat the storage fat

907
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:06,480
of obesity into brown fat which is more

908
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:06,480
metabolically active

909
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:11,920
linoleul is a

910
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:14,480
terpenoid common to lavender well known

911
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,880
as an anti-anxiety agent this again has

912
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,960
been shown in humans particularly

913
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,480
demented patients with alzheimer's

914
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:25,119
disease that get um ornery at night

915
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,280
also prominent local anesthetic effects

916
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:32,000
and anti-convulsant effects and again

917
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:34,560
this has been demonstrated clinically

918
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,039
uh caryophyllene is a very interesting

919
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:39,358
compound it's a sesquiterpenoid

920
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:42,559
um 15 carbons

921
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:44,480
um it has strong anti-inflammatory

922
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:46,719
properties uh comparable to

923
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,519
phenylbutazone that's used as a

924
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:52,078
non-steroidal in horses but not people

925
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:54,559
but unlike the non-steroidal drugs it

926
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,599
protects the stomach

927
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:57,199
from

928
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,160
from ulcers

929
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:04,480
this actually is also a cannabinoid it's

930
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:07,279
a selective cb2 agonist so it's not

931
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,079
intoxicating like thc but

932
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,760
can produce those anti-inflammatory

933
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,839
benefits without

934
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,640
producing

935
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:19,599
psychoactive effects

936
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:22,319
and um this is what's called a phytofax

937
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,160
demonstration of cannabinoids and

938
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,720
terpenoids

939
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:29,838
in this particular chemovar

940
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:31,118
are the most prevalent uh cannabinoids

941
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:32,400
this is um

942
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,880
cbd

943
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,079
and cbg

944
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,760
very lower

945
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:42,480
much lower amounts of thca

946
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,119
what patients report in terms of the

947
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,760
aroma and flavor have been healed

948
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,240
and the effects that they report this

949
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,400
one's high in comfort and calm

950
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:54,399
and we see the predominant

951
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,960
um

952
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,079
terpenoids here is limonene and

953
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,639
caryophyllene with very low mercy

954
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,318
so this is a type 3 because it's

955
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:06,719
predominantly

956
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:10,239
cbd

957
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:13,759
this should be a non-sedating agent

958
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:17,118
very low in thc and mercy but high in

959
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,119
caryophyllene lyman unit humulin

960
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,800
patients report comfort

961
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:23,280
and likely this would be helpful in

962
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,760
treating pain inflammation

963
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,000
and both cbd and caryophyllene can be

964
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,839
helpful in treating addiction

965
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,039
also may be good for anxiety and

966
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:33,279
depression

967
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:36,480
so this is how we analyze what's in

968
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:39,839
cannabis to see what it might be

969
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,679
good for in terms of treatment

970
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:45,039
and um

971
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:47,118
i would refer you to ethanrusso.org

972
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:49,679
there is a library of

973
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:52,240
all my publications in pdf form which

974
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:54,960
you can download there because it's my

975
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:57,279
personal website uh you shouldn't be

976
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,199
breaking any copyright laws is my

977
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,359
understanding

978
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:03,279
and i'll thank you for your attention

979
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:06,519
and hope that i've left plenty of time

980
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,519
for questions

981
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:12,000
so

982
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,599
thank you so much doctor so that was uh

983
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,480
absolutely

984
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:18,160
gripping and fascinating talk uh i

985
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,079
think i can speak for everyone that we

986
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:22,239
fully enjoyed it

987
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,839
i also want to just give a quick thanks

988
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:26,479
to our

989
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:27,920
uh interpreters that was probably tough

990
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,358
um

991
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,599
and then as well as tony george

992
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:37,199
gemma and kim as well for making this

993
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:39,920
happen so we're so so proud at the usca

994
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:41,838
plant genetics resources unit to

995
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,079
host this kind of knowledge and

996
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:46,639
information sharing and again we just

997
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,880
want to thank you dr so i believe

998
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:49,759
tony and george have

999
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,640
some

1000
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,079
questions from the q a

1001
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:55,519
looks like there's a lot

1002
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:58,079
yup we got a lot of questions so we'll

1003
00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:00,318
try to get through as many as possible

1004
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,318
um first question

1005
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:05,519
are there phenotypes of cannabis

1006
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:08,400
described by small published in 1975

1007
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:10,559
still relevant for modern varieties is

1008
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,760
there any research planned or currently

1009
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:16,239
working on reevaluating the 0.3

1010
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,480
threshold on thc

1011
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:20,879
uh the 0.3

1012
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,880
threshold is a political act and has

1013
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,318
nothing to do with science

1014
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,720
um what i would mean team to you is

1015
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:30,880
uh the concentration is much less

1016
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:33,358
important than the total dose

1017
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,599
so let's say that we had material that

1018
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:35,598
was

1019
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,358
0.25

1020
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:43,598
percent thc

1021
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:46,400
well if you take too much of it

1022
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,800
you could become intoxicated by the same

1023
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,200
token you could have five percent thc

1024
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,079
material but if only a small amount is

1025
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:55,118
taken

1026
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,480
it would not necessarily be intoxicating

1027
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:00,000
so

1028
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,679
to be fair this was an effort to allow

1029
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,960
commerce and

1030
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:07,679
material that the government hoped would

1031
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,240
uh not create other problems but what's

1032
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:13,118
happened is

1033
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:15,959
people have taken the abundant biomass

1034
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:19,200
of cbd predominant material and

1035
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,880
transmogrified it into delta a thc and

1036
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:23,598
other items

1037
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:26,240
which clearly are intoxicating

1038
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:28,720
so we obviously need to do better and my

1039
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:31,519
suggestion would be that uh

1040
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:35,358
the politicians speak more to scientists

1041
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:35,358
that are experienced in this area

1042
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:42,240
awesome um another question comes in uh

1043
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,159
do you do other plant groups produce

1044
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:46,959
cannabinoids at all

1045
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:49,039
yeah i've got a an article that's on the

1046
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,039
website etheremuso.org

1047
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:53,440
called beyond cannabis plants in the

1048
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:55,039
endocannabinoid system

1049
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,760
in terms of things that might be

1050
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:59,838
cannabis like there is a component of

1051
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,319
kavakava

1052
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:05,199
piper methysticum called yangan that

1053
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:07,920
seems to be an agonist at cb1

1054
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:11,439
there's also the new zealand uh

1055
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:14,480
liverwort radula marginata that has

1056
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,639
thc like molecules but

1057
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,960
the problem there is this is a rare

1058
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:20,159
plant it grows a millimeter or two a

1059
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,240
year

1060
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:23,598
so the prospect that this is ever going

1061
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:26,959
to be um

1062
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:28,160
an agricultural crop is probably minimal

1063
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,559
um

1064
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:31,440
uh and there are lots of other examples

1065
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:34,719
um

1066
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,838
there are things that um

1067
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:39,239
that work on uh various receptors of the

1068
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:41,279
broad endo

1069
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:42,318
endocannabinoid dome

1070
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,760
um

1071
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:48,079
and even uh prebiotics and probiotics

1072
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,800
affect endocannabinoid

1073
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:54,318
the endocannabinoid system so

1074
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,359
um yeah that article would point um to

1075
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:58,159
other

1076
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:59,119
plants foods and crops um

1077
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:02,039
that

1078
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:05,200
could be leveraged to benefit uh

1079
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:06,559
endocannabinoid system

1080
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:09,118
okay awesome

1081
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:12,239
um a question from ernie siebert from

1082
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:16,079
alabama a m asks is the american medical

1083
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:18,399
association and the nai and the nih on

1084
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,720
board with full-scale clinical trials

1085
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,079
research and prescribing cannabinoids to

1086
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:24,399
patients

1087
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,400
um

1088
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:29,279
i i i'm afraid he's asking the wrong

1089
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:32,239
person

1090
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:35,359
i've been doing this for 26 years um i

1091
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:38,318
tried to do clinical trials of cannabis

1092
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:41,519
and migraine back in the 90s

1093
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:44,159
and really got stonewalled i got the fda

1094
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:47,280
cleared it but the national institute on

1095
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:49,759
drug abuse had then and pretty much

1096
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,359
still has a monopoly on the supply and

1097
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,720
would not provide

1098
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:55,519
the material

1099
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:58,159
for those clinical trials

1100
00:45:55,519 --> 00:46:00,719
although the situation has improved

1101
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:02,960
um it's testament to the fact that it's

1102
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:05,838
still hard to do this kind of work i've

1103
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:08,400
spent most of the last 26 years working

1104
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:11,440
for foreign companies um there's a

1105
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,760
reason for that um so yeah there's a lot

1106
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,760
of room for improvement in

1107
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,400
the capability to do this kind of

1108
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:22,000
research which should not be seated to

1109
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,000
other countries around the world

1110
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,240
awesome

1111
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:28,719
question comes in

1112
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:29,919
would you elaborate a little further on

1113
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,598
why

1114
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,960
cannabis is

1115
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:36,079
not referred to as a strain

1116
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,838
um

1117
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:40,960
i'm going with

1118
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:43,519
i investigated this and um the

1119
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:46,240
article by lewis at all in which i was

1120
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:47,358
co-author uh we go into some detail on

1121
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:48,639
this

1122
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:52,719
um

1123
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:55,679
strains is a useful term for uh

1124
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:56,639
for viruses and bacteria

1125
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:58,719
a

1126
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:01,279
better term

1127
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:04,318
for cannabis would be chemical varieties

1128
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:07,200
chemo bars or even cultivars

1129
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:10,559
and this also should be used instead of

1130
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:13,358
the terminology sativa and indica which

1131
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:14,719
have nothing to do with the taxonomic

1132
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:17,440
descriptions

1133
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:19,838
of the plant in the 18th century

1134
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,679
by linnaeus and la merc

1135
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:24,719
so what's called indica today doesn't

1136
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:26,239
look at all like what lamarck described

1137
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:28,799
um you know he

1138
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:32,159
he had precedence uh

1139
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:36,240
as best we can ascertain there's one

1140
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:38,399
very uh promiscuous species of cannabis

1141
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:40,639
um you can interbreed any

1142
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,800
type of cannabis with another

1143
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:45,039
but what differentiates them

1144
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,280
is their effects and this is mediated by

1145
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:50,880
their chemical contents and that's why i

1146
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,880
prefer the term chemor

1147
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,358
awesome

1148
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:57,920
uh tyler gordon asks can cbg be

1149
00:47:55,358 --> 00:48:00,239
manufactured in a lab or is it easier to

1150
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:03,358
extract from plants

1151
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:06,399
uh yes it can be made biosynthetically

1152
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:10,519
um they're various groups working with

1153
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:13,119
yeast and e coli to uh biosen

1154
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:14,639
biosynthetically produce

1155
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,480
cannabinoids

1156
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:19,118
however

1157
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,599
this hasn't been scaled up to be

1158
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:25,119
uh practical yet

1159
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:26,160
can it be done likely however this is a

1160
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,640
weed

1161
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:30,239
it's relatively easy to grow if you know

1162
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,598
how and um

1163
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:34,959
additionally

1164
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:37,359
um i i think i'm no luddite i think the

1165
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,599
science of the biosynthetic approaches

1166
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:42,159
is fascinating however

1167
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,119
to me it will never equal what the plant

1168
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:45,679
can do

1169
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:48,720
this is a plant that from its flowering

1170
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:50,239
tops can produce upwards of 30 percent

1171
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:52,959
cannabinoids

1172
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:55,039
which is phenomenal for any secondary

1173
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:58,920
metabolite of a plant

1174
00:48:55,039 --> 00:49:01,759
i i'm not sure of a parallel to equal it

1175
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:03,838
additionally it doesn't produce one

1176
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:07,280
thing generally it produces this

1177
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:10,279
entourage of compounds that are

1178
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:14,319
synergistic to one another and no

1179
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:17,040
bacterium or yeast is going to do that

1180
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:21,279
it will never happen so i'm a strong

1181
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:24,480
proponent of of the plant i'd also add

1182
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,160
the genome of the cannabis plant is so

1183
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,039
plastic

1184
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:29,039
that

1185
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:31,519
you can make it do anything you want

1186
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:33,920
through good selective breeding with

1187
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:37,759
conventional methods

1188
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:39,599
i'm not a fan of genetic modification

1189
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,599
and particularly for cannabis this

1190
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:45,838
should never be necessary because you

1191
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,838
can make it do almost anything you want

1192
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:52,399
awesome uh another question from dr

1193
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:54,800
sarah eichler asks is research on

1194
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:57,519
potential agricultural pest control

1195
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,039
applications using various cannabinoids

1196
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:02,079
available

1197
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:04,400
uh yeah it's a very interesting question

1198
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:08,400
on the credo science website you'll see

1199
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:11,358
that one of our projects relates to

1200
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,240
development of cannabis-based treatment

1201
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:14,239
for head lice

1202
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:17,679
obviously

1203
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:20,400
through the question it was understood

1204
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:22,960
that their insecticidal properties

1205
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,519
of the acid cannabinoids in particular

1206
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:28,400
so yes this could be leveraged to

1207
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:30,639
produce agricultural products that would

1208
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,599
be safer

1209
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:33,838
as

1210
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:36,000
not just insecticides but possibly as

1211
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:38,078
herbicides as well

1212
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,679
so we're really interested in this so

1213
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,640
far

1214
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:43,679
this

1215
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:45,519
hasn't taken off in the industry

1216
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:47,519
probably

1217
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:49,759
because of remaining

1218
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:51,838
constraints on

1219
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,079
with legalization i think

1220
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:56,239
this would be an avenue of greater

1221
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:59,920
interest

1222
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:01,199
we certainly are interested in it

1223
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,599
awesome uh

1224
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:07,519
someone asks are any of the compounds

1225
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:09,680
full agonists at cb1 or cb2

1226
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:10,559
uh no fortunately and that's a good

1227
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:14,799
thing

1228
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:17,519
um even thc alone is really too strong

1229
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:20,079
um thc is a synthetic it's been

1230
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:23,519
available as an fda approved drug called

1231
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:26,559
marinol since 1985. however it's had

1232
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:29,119
very poor uptake and the reason is

1233
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:32,319
most people can't tolerate it

1234
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:34,240
tends to produce dysphoria unhappiness

1235
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:38,318
rather than euphoria

1236
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:40,479
and even experienced cannabis uh users

1237
00:51:38,318 --> 00:51:41,358
don't tend to like it

1238
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,240
um

1239
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:46,960
we do see full agonists

1240
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:49,118
among the synthetic cannabinoids k2

1241
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,440
spice and the like

1242
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,440
that are very prevalent as alternatives

1243
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,079
to cannabis again

1244
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,639
this is a byproduct of prohibition for

1245
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:01,039
the most part those aren't identified on

1246
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:04,400
urine drug screens and so people turn to

1247
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:06,480
them but those are overtly dangerous

1248
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,079
the endocannabinoid system is very

1249
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,800
subtle system

1250
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:14,079
it needs gentle nudges not huge pushes

1251
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:16,880
pharmacologically as would be provided

1252
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:18,800
by pure thc or a full agonist that the

1253
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,920
cbm1 receptor

1254
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,280
um

1255
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,720
there may be

1256
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:26,760
a natural

1257
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:29,519
full agonist in the form of thcp

1258
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:32,880
tetrahydrocannabifural which is like thc

1259
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:35,759
but with the seven carbon side chain um

1260
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:38,559
however this has only been found so far

1261
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:41,680
trace amounts and that's just as well

1262
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:45,640
because it's 23 times more potent

1263
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:45,639
than thc itself

1264
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:49,759
awesome uh

1265
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:52,879
one question i think is directed towards

1266
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:55,599
your cbg study and they're asking uh

1267
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:58,559
what were the doses used um with the

1268
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:00,640
many promising results and

1269
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:03,359
at those doses what were the negative

1270
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:06,799
side effects found and how complete are

1271
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:09,440
the risk assessment um yeah the exact

1272
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:12,000
dosing again would depend on how often

1273
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,720
the person used it a day so we couldn't

1274
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,760
stratify the data that way however we

1275
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:19,199
know

1276
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,319
from speaking to people and observations

1277
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:21,199
that

1278
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:23,838
um

1279
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:25,598
10 to 20 milligrams at a time seems to

1280
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:27,358
be quite effective

1281
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:30,400
for most people for most things

1282
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:34,078
particularly in treating anxiety

1283
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:36,960
i know of people inhaling 40 milligrams

1284
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:39,680
of pure cbg at once

1285
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,760
with no adverse events

1286
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:44,399
so i don't know what the upper limit is

1287
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,599
it probably is very high because it's

1288
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,680
just not

1289
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:50,480
intoxicating

1290
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:52,078
and there's no withdrawal

1291
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,760
effect so

1292
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:56,640
um you know

1293
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:59,359
less is more if a person is getting the

1294
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:01,279
desired effect at a lower dose that's

1295
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:02,400
what we recommend there's no point in

1296
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,880
wasting

1297
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,599
material even if it doesn't have obvious

1298
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,599
side effects

1299
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:14,240
um another question asked do you know of

1300
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:17,039
any early production of since amelia

1301
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:18,799
cannabis prior to the 1970s it would

1302
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:21,358
seem that it would have happened earlier

1303
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:23,599
given human plant understanding yeah um

1304
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:25,679
there's a place called india where ganja

1305
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:27,359
has been grown for thousands of years so

1306
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:30,799
this is a technique

1307
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:30,799
that was known to the ancients

1308
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,760
awesome

1309
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,318
um

1310
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:38,480
someone asks dr russo would you say that

1311
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:41,679
the misconception of sedation can be

1312
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,440
related to the actual receptor behaviors

1313
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:45,919
while connecting and inner working

1314
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,480
within the anatomy

1315
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:50,720
i think this relation of cbd

1316
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:54,240
yeah in this instance again

1317
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:57,039
at extreme doses like 1500 milligrams a

1318
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:59,838
day cbd has been observed to produce

1319
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:02,400
sedation but this is in the context

1320
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:05,679
of patients on polypharmacy generally

1321
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:08,960
these are patients with severe epilepsy

1322
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:12,000
that are on scads of drugs at once

1323
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:14,639
and so there are drug drug interactions

1324
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,519
additive sedation etc

1325
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:21,199
but at low and moderate doses

1326
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:23,759
cbd is stimulating um i have friends in

1327
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:26,480
california that use a dose of cbd in the

1328
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,680
morning instead of caffeine these days

1329
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,920
so

1330
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:31,519
yeah and that's been tested by

1331
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,960
electroencephalography

1332
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:37,119
and sleep studies etc

1333
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,400
um great another question comes from

1334
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:40,798
phoenix saying thank you for your

1335
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,760
contributions to cannabis uh what is the

1336
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:45,440
status of the current research on chs

1337
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,839
which i believe he means cannabinoid

1338
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,639
hyperemus

1339
00:55:46,838 --> 00:55:50,880
syndrome i said that right

1340
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:52,639
um yeah there are two articles on our

1341
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,358
website on the

1342
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:56,879
uh

1343
00:55:54,358 --> 00:55:58,318
ethanrusso.org the library and beyond

1344
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,920
the first page

1345
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:04,639
um we did a survey um that's the largest

1346
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,720
database to date on cannabinoid

1347
00:56:04,639 --> 00:56:07,920
hyperemesis syndrome for those not

1348
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:10,078
familiar

1349
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:13,358
there is a small subset of people who

1350
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:16,318
use cannabis chronically in high amounts

1351
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:18,798
that develop a syndrome of abdominal

1352
00:56:16,318 --> 00:56:22,159
pain nausea vomiting

1353
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:24,960
and with a strange behavior of hot water

1354
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:27,039
bathing sometimes hours a day to allay

1355
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,720
symptoms

1356
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:31,119
this affects certain people and not

1357
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:32,798
others we hypothesized that there was a

1358
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:34,640
genetic cause

1359
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:36,798
and that turned out to be true we

1360
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:40,798
identified five

1361
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:43,759
statistically significant mutations

1362
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:46,400
in chs patients as compared to control

1363
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:49,119
patients who use cannabis at high rates

1364
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:51,200
but did not have the symptoms

1365
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:53,039
and so that's available there's also a

1366
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:54,879
commercial test

1367
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:58,719
that's available and

1368
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:01,200
that's accessible at what dash is dash

1369
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:02,318
chs.com

1370
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:05,519
um

1371
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:06,480
and again the paper is there off

1372
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:09,440
for

1373
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,440
you to download

1374
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:16,798
awesome um somebody's asking uh does cbd

1375
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:17,839
work better with a small amount of thc

1376
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:19,519
included

1377
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:21,199
absolutely

1378
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:23,280
now i'm fond of saying that there's

1379
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:25,598
nothing that cbd does

1380
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:28,640
that can't be enhanced by a tiny amount

1381
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:31,240
of thc i mean this is the way it in

1382
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:34,000
comes in nature invariably

1383
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:35,598
epidiolex um

1384
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,960
probably is the

1385
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:39,920
97

1386
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:43,199
pure because the fda

1387
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,400
was thc phobic they didn't like the idea

1388
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:48,558
of

1389
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:50,400
giving thc to kids even though

1390
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:51,680
the benefits would far outweigh the

1391
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,599
risks

1392
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:56,000
these children with

1393
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:58,640
lennox gastow and gervais syndrome are

1394
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,318
severely cognitively impaired

1395
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:02,558
in general and

1396
00:58:00,318 --> 00:58:03,838
have sometimes hundreds of seizures a

1397
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:07,599
day

1398
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:08,400
so any negative effect of thc is

1399
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,640
really

1400
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,079
pales in comparison to the benefits it

1401
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:14,960
might have

1402
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:14,960
therapeutically

1403
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:19,598
awesome um there's another question

1404
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,519
related to the cannabinoids and

1405
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:22,480
insecticides and this is basically

1406
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:23,440
asking

1407
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,838
um

1408
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:29,119
are there any terpenes like alpha pinene

1409
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:30,558
or limonene used as insecticides yeah

1410
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:33,280
absolutely

1411
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:34,960
so yeah i mean basically the cannabis

1412
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,519
flower

1413
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:40,798
is really designed to keep the insects

1414
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:43,119
at bay um so their insecticidal

1415
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:45,199
properties from the cannabinoids the

1416
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:48,640
turbinoids and also

1417
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:50,480
um if an insect touches the uh trichome

1418
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:53,118
it'll tend to burst

1419
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,280
and then polymerize and so there's a

1420
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:58,000
mechanical insect trap

1421
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:01,839
um so it's a really elegant system

1422
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,838
to try and control predation

1423
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:06,880
awesome um

1424
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:09,280
i think we have time for

1425
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,119
maybe one last question so uh have fungi

1426
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:14,240
or mycotoxins been looked at as a

1427
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:17,280
trigger or factor for hyper hyperemesis

1428
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:20,159
conditions yeah that ain't it

1429
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:22,240
that the symptoms don't match also

1430
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:25,519
implicated by some people

1431
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:27,118
have been pesticides and neem

1432
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:29,440
but the

1433
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:32,960
the toxicology of those substances

1434
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:36,880
doesn't match chs and we've identified

1435
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,880
uh the genetic cause

1436
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,159
unfortunately people are always looking

1437
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:45,199
for other explanations and find it hard

1438
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:48,719
to believe that thc is the culprit

1439
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:51,598
um so in this instance it's too much of

1440
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:52,318
what can be a good thing is a bad thing

1441
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:55,200
for

1442
00:59:52,318 --> 00:59:55,199
certain people

1443
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:59,280
so uh

1444
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:01,519
we've really bombarded dr russo with a

1445
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:04,640
lot of great questions today and i i

1446
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:07,599
just want to thank you again so much for

1447
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:09,920
your vast knowledge and insights i i

1448
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:12,400
know i've learned a lot i hope

1449
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:14,639
everyone else has as well so

1450
