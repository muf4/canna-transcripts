1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,370
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,370
University

3
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:10,000
thank you very much pleasure to be here

4
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:11,859
at Cornell I think this is my first time

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,138
I'm going to use an old-fashioned

6
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:15,698
pointer so that the folks in Geneva can

7
00:00:14,138 --> 00:00:18,910
see me can you see me in the pointer

8
00:00:15,698 --> 00:00:21,460
here guys and I can't hear them right

9
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:28,448
anyway I hope they can thick in here and

10
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:34,630
see they'll wave yeah yeah are they

11
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:38,760
waiting so so what I'm going to talk

12
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:41,350
about is is actually kind of a simple

13
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:43,149
study that we thought was going to be

14
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,090
simple when we started and it turned out

15
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:48,250
to uncover some very interesting aspects

16
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,560
that we had not anticipated about

17
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:53,950
something about Silas structure and

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:57,570
function now you may think that xylem

19
00:00:53,950 --> 00:01:01,690
that's been studied for a very long time

20
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:04,900
it's it's a fairly well known structure

21
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:07,469
of different kinds of cells right

22
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,030
there's vessel members there's tracheids

23
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:12,039
fibers I'm assuming I don't have to

24
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:15,099
introduce these concepts to all of you

25
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:17,259
plant science folks here at in cornell

26
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:18,699
and all of these are arranged in a

27
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:21,670
tissue and of course different species

28
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:24,520
and different groups of plants have have

29
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:28,810
different kinds okay but one thing that

30
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:31,179
was known from early on is that the

31
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:33,579
structure of xylem is fairly complex

32
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:36,399
these things are not just pipes that run

33
00:01:33,578 --> 00:01:40,178
straight their pipes that run crooked in

34
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:47,009
this case this is this is about a two

35
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:51,039
millimeter by two millimeter by 30

36
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:53,099
centimeters the 30 35 millimeters

37
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:56,228
section so it's sort of been compressed

38
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:58,178
vertically so that you can see that

39
00:01:56,228 --> 00:01:59,858
these things kind of wander around these

40
00:01:58,179 --> 00:02:02,888
are vessels you can see if they're

41
00:01:59,858 --> 00:02:05,169
interconnected and in fact this section

42
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:08,889
in this section this is all the way back

43
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:10,629
from sort of the 70s need to overlap one

44
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,429
another to actually they're from the

45
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:15,158
same section they're just separated so

46
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,379
that you can see that's just a whole lot

47
00:02:15,158 --> 00:02:24,329
of spaghetti in here

48
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:27,240
and we had some questions about about

49
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:32,010
xylem movement that we wanted to ask ask

50
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:34,980
and one of the things that a complex

51
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:36,840
series of interconnected pipes will do

52
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:39,899
which is something that I did not know

53
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,450
before I talk to an engineer in any

54
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,580
engineers in the in the audience is that

55
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:48,119
you can actually when you have if you

56
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:50,219
have three pipes and one goes straight

57
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,230
through one has a bit of a resistance

58
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:54,509
and another one has a bit more of a

59
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:56,969
resistance and they're interconnected in

60
00:02:54,509 --> 00:03:00,479
this fashion that even though water may

61
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:03,780
enter in to this side on all three going

62
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,879
that way and water may exit on all three

63
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,250
on the other side do a pressure

64
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:12,479
differential part of the system may be

65
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:15,000
flowing backwards is everybody okay with

66
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,619
that idea that you can actually have

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,110
backwards flow even though it's coming

68
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:23,879
in and going out the same three tubes so

69
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:26,310
this would be called I think an emergent

70
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:29,129
property of inner and interconnected set

71
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,020
you know the system of pipes and that's

72
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:35,460
a very interesting property because we

73
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:38,040
were wondering whether reverse flow in

74
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:41,040
this kind of system might explain how

75
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:43,349
vascular pathogens that is xylem

76
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,750
dwelling in our case do they know about

77
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:48,150
does I'll elaphus IDEO sahir the cause

78
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,219
of Pierce's disease in grapevine anybody

79
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,599
know about that it may was all the you

80
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:53,879
know made the big headlines in

81
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:59,219
California a number of years ago it's a

82
00:03:53,879 --> 00:04:02,039
xylem dwelling bacteria that is

83
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:05,459
transmitted by a xylem feeding insect

84
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,169
and usually the insect feeds in you know

85
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,080
shoots in the upper part of the canopy

86
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:12,419
but over years the infection can get

87
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,420
down into the roots and kill the plant

88
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:17,849
basically it's called Pierce's disease

89
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:20,159
and of course if it's in the xylem how

90
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:22,389
is it going backwards when the xylem is

91
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,270
always supposed to be flowing you know

92
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:27,610
to leave so that's somewhat up with

93
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:29,680
somewhat of a mystery how the how a

94
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,120
disease can spread downward but maybe if

95
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,800
there's some of these that are flowing

96
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,800
in reverse that could account for that

97
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,139
maybe these kind of interconnections

98
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,329
whether its downward or a crossword if

99
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:43,810
we understood the interconnections then

100
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:45,968
we could explain how embolism spread I'm

101
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,879
assuming everybody here understands a

102
00:04:45,968 --> 00:04:50,860
little bit that the xylem system is

103
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,889
under tension water under tension can

104
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:56,710
cavitate or embolize and sort of suck

105
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:58,750
air let's say cause an air bubble to

106
00:04:56,709 --> 00:05:01,959
occur in there and that that can spread

107
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:05,620
and obviously wreak havoc with the with

108
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:07,239
the system of transporting water so we

109
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,098
had a couple of these questions and then

110
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,778
we asked well do we know about how this

111
00:05:09,098 --> 00:05:13,449
system is interconnected in order to

112
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:16,028
answer these questions and we thought

113
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:20,499
well maybe we don't know so we were able

114
00:05:16,028 --> 00:05:24,639
to get a grant and harvest a very good

115
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:29,919
post doc Craig brodersen who has now got

116
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:31,918
another post doc at UC Santa Cruz and we

117
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:35,109
sent him to our friendly neighborhood

118
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:37,180
advance synchrotron night light source

119
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:39,370
in Berkeley this is what Berkeley looks

120
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:43,209
like all the time just kidding nice

121
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,620
picture of the San Francisco Bay you

122
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:46,060
know where all the men are strong all

123
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,098
the women are beautiful and all the

124
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:51,218
scientists are above average but it's

125
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:52,899
it's a big place inside there that went

126
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:57,490
over much better when I was talking in

127
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:59,829
Minneapolis the other day but you can

128
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:03,338
put up you can put a plant inside here

129
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:07,508
with this x-ray source and you can get a

130
00:06:03,338 --> 00:06:10,629
very high-resolution x-ray tomographic

131
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:14,949
view a three-dimensional view of the

132
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:17,468
stem now this is a live plant and we

133
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:19,930
didn't start with live plants partly

134
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:22,689
because this is an air stage and it has

135
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:25,269
to rotate in a very precise manner in

136
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:27,819
order to get a 3d image and it's a lot

137
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:29,620
easier to do that if all you have is a

138
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:31,778
stick of wood and we were only

139
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,750
interested in the xylem structure so we

140
00:06:31,778 --> 00:06:35,149
began by

141
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,560
putting sticks of wood here and rotating

142
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:39,500
them around and getting this information

143
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,399
and i'll get back to the to the living

144
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:45,709
plant in a in a little while but so what

145
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:47,000
we get with that so I guess Neil I

146
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:48,859
forgot to tell you should have brought

147
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,550
some popcorn but chips are probably just

148
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:56,750
as well so here's an example that I'm

149
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:59,900
going to let just let play of what the

150
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:03,199
raw data looks like if you scan through

151
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:06,079
this section as we're scanning down this

152
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,000
is across five millimeters this is the

153
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:09,859
pith and you can see that the pith is

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,589
sort of changing this is a dry piece of

155
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:17,840
wood these are all the xylem vessels

156
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:23,299
okay I'm going to stop this and rewind

157
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:26,509
it so lots of interesting things that

158
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:28,129
piff goes from being full of tissue to

159
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:30,560
being empty but that's not what's

160
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:32,540
important what's important is what's

161
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,360
going on in and all these xylem vessels

162
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:38,090
and what you see is the big ones and

163
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,460
they don't change much but next time I

164
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:42,769
play this now just take a look at some

165
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:45,949
of these places where there are small

166
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:47,810
cells just pick a spot I mean anywhere

167
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:49,189
you pick and I'm going to play and what

168
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:53,030
you're going to find out is that these

169
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:56,870
small cells kind of dance around we had

170
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:58,849
a lot of fun doing this when we were and

171
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,829
you see they appear and disappear and

172
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,780
sometimes connect over and sometimes

173
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:05,870
move over and there's a couple over here

174
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:09,019
that just sort of shift entirely okay

175
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:13,069
but anyway so so the idea there is that

176
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:16,399
is that we get raw data that is just

177
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:18,589
basically a stack of of images they used

178
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:22,519
to make movies out of this and it took a

179
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:25,399
long time this doesn't take so long and

180
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:28,129
you get a very high resolution and you

181
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:31,459
can start to see then how these these

182
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:33,408
these the the sort of pie shaped pieces

183
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:37,158
between raised because that's what you

184
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:40,490
have here these are aligned up you know

185
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:42,110
radially in files and that

186
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,879
sometimes there are vessels that go from

187
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,860
one way and connect over to another

188
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:47,450
array a lot of times there are small

189
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,330
vessels that interconnect these big

190
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:53,060
vessels and there's a whole lot of

191
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:54,860
complexity in the way these vessels are

192
00:08:53,059 --> 00:09:00,139
interconnected and that's what we wanted

193
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:04,070
to try to model mathematically okay now

194
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:06,379
so so this is just an example of one

195
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:10,040
cross section with a pit labeled here

196
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:13,338
now the grapevine bears leaves on either

197
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:15,579
side of the of the stem of the shoe and

198
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:18,170
those are called the lateral sides and

199
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:20,480
because these are called lateral sides

200
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:22,129
something has to be dorsal and something

201
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,629
has to be ventral I guess even though

202
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:25,730
those are terms we don't normally use

203
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:27,799
for plants but that's what this is

204
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:29,810
called dorsal ventral and then lateral

205
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:31,669
and the lateral sides you may be able to

206
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:33,559
see a little bit here look like they're

207
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:36,949
a little squished in compared to the

208
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:38,449
dorsal ventral side maybe the vessels

209
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,890
are a little bit smaller than here and

210
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:42,459
we'll see a little bit more detail about

211
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:44,720
some of those properties that they have

212
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:49,369
but as I said there are sort of in

213
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:52,190
radial files separated by rays and this

214
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:54,200
just explains that in fact every pixel

215
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,750
of this is about four and a half microns

216
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,450
and so we have four and a half micron

217
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:02,480
pixels this way and also four and a half

218
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:04,550
micron pixels this way vertically so

219
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:09,759
that they're called voxels since they're

220
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:14,179
a volume and in order to analyze this

221
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:16,278
you can't just do it on image J you have

222
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:18,439
to do it on some kind of software and

223
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:21,350
then a VSO software is kind of like

224
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,940
image J on the steroids you can do all

225
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,860
kinds of interesting things with this

226
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:28,450
software so I'm just going to sort of

227
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:30,800
take you through a little quickly the

228
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:33,470
process that we would go through to

229
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:37,039
analyze a section so we start with one

230
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:41,240
slice somewhere in the in the in the

231
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:43,429
field and then as as I click down you'll

232
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,379
see things change here and this is just

233
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:47,019
keeping track of all the processes that

234
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:48,639
you've done and the image

235
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:50,860
will change depending on what that

236
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,649
process was now the first thing you do

237
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:56,230
is you kind of blur out the in-between

238
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:57,909
parts and that you see something showed

239
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,019
up here you see almost no difference

240
00:10:57,909 --> 00:11:00,669
there I don't know if you notice that

241
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:02,740
but I'll just go up and down a couple of

242
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:06,339
times it just kind of gets a lot

243
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:08,590
smoother in between the cells you just

244
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:12,070
kind of smooth things out now i have

245
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:14,080
actually no idea of all the image

246
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:16,810
analysis stuff that's being done but I

247
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,900
can explain what the results of it are

248
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:21,849
once you've done that step you can try

249
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:23,590
to sort of segment this into black

250
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,720
versus white and you can play around

251
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:30,759
with settings to make it a little bit

252
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:33,160
more white and then the nice thing about

253
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:36,429
this software is that when you take a

254
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:38,529
spot here for instance if you just click

255
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:41,259
on this you know the magic wand idea i

256
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:45,009
click here then it will sort of connect

257
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:46,600
all of that same color basically which

258
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:49,090
is black and white so all of the white

259
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,220
that's not found it and it will connect

260
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:56,670
it up and down from wherever you clicked

261
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:59,350
it in and also show a vertical sections

262
00:11:56,669 --> 00:12:02,679
that through this thing if you want to

263
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:07,480
so what it's sort of a volume oriented

264
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:09,069
3d reconstruction software anyway so we

265
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,139
have to have somebody go through and

266
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:13,570
click on these things and say yeah okay

267
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:16,840
that's that that's a vessel that's the

268
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:19,000
one that I want and what happens is you

269
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,889
can take two of these things or one of

270
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,450
them and you can identify it and give it

271
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:27,879
a name I think and then turn it into

272
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:31,330
just that you can tell the software okay

273
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:33,850
only show me what I named here and once

274
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:35,950
they've been named by this guy Jacob

275
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,909
that's his name he's the undergraduate

276
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:43,210
who was doing all of the driving of this

277
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:45,039
software then you can generate of volume

278
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:46,810
rendering so this is just a quick movie

279
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,819
to sort of show and you'll see right

280
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:52,359
here a lot of dancing around the vessels

281
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:56,050
as it scans through and then basically

282
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,519
once you've identified them you can get

283
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:59,529
sort of 3d render

284
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,939
that you can rotate around and it's a

285
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:07,240
lot of fun to watch but because it's

286
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:10,330
done mathematically you can do virtual

287
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,039
cross-sections this way and because of

288
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:14,350
the volume filling you can actually

289
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:16,870
identify these and then have it tell you

290
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:18,460
where is that volume and in addition to

291
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:21,039
the volume it can tell you where the

292
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:24,790
midpoint of it is where the edges of it

293
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:27,360
are and how close it is to its nearest

294
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:30,399
neighbor so this was all preliminary

295
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,550
because what we wanted to do was we

296
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,350
wanted to find out how these things are

297
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:38,349
interconnected and make a model out of

298
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:40,360
it so for instance but this is a

299
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:43,389
software was very helpful in being able

300
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,830
to show when for instance you had a

301
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,750
connection because they were close

302
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,700
together and when there was space in

303
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,620
between them when they diverged when

304
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,050
you're looking through a cross-section

305
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,450
you may see it in this this way when

306
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:57,609
it's at one part of the stem and then

307
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,320
farther apart when it's another part of

308
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:02,080
the stem and you can volume render that

309
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,629
and see what it's trying to tell you but

310
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:07,540
now we had the question well how close

311
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:09,460
is close enough okay or if they're this

312
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:13,539
close then are we going to consider them

313
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:15,220
connected or not okay and another

314
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:17,230
question is when you have a connection

315
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,330
then what's the hydraulic resistance but

316
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,220
for water flow through that connection

317
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,420
well that actually can come from the

318
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,519
literature because some people have

319
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:25,839
already looked at that but what we had

320
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:30,939
to do is we had to go back to the

321
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:37,990
drawing board a bit and make a and make

322
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:40,330
a measurement on a cross-section here we

323
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,279
have introduced into one vessel at the

324
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:48,280
end of the stem what we called a

325
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:51,250
fiduciary marker and the marker is just

326
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:53,889
some silicon resin so that when we made

327
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:56,080
a cross-section of that and put that in

328
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:58,960
the sem we could find out where that

329
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:02,050
was then we could identify from that

330
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:04,150
which vessels were close to it then we

331
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:07,479
could look under the SEM a detail and

332
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:08,889
when you see a pit between two vessels

333
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,110
then you know that they're connected

334
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:13,629
okay so these are typically you know the

335
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:17,680
typical pit fields between vessels they

336
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:19,899
have a pit membrane our middle imela

337
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:22,899
across them and those have been pretty

338
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:24,579
well studied so this is just showing the

339
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:27,159
vessel vessel fits over here and the

340
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:30,310
vessel to / income it fits over there so

341
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:34,870
then what we could do is we we could

342
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:40,349
look at all of the cells how far they

343
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:44,470
would be measured apart in the end the

344
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:48,250
x-ray image and whether that are not

345
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:51,070
they had a pits with adjacent vessels

346
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:56,080
and this is a graph showing anywhere

347
00:15:51,070 --> 00:16:00,190
down to about eight or 10 12 14 by about

348
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:03,190
14 microns between there's the amount of

349
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:04,660
cells with with pits between them the

350
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:07,420
mount vessels with fits between and

351
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:09,549
dropped off sort of precipitously so we

352
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:11,379
figured if it's 40 microns or less

353
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:13,509
between we're going to say that's a

354
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:16,120
connection if it's greater than 14

355
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:18,700
microns that's not a connection so

356
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,799
that's how we kind of calibrated the the

357
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,490
distance that the information we could

358
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:25,719
get from the x-ray from the anatomical

359
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:28,539
information about whether to call it a

360
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:34,600
connection or not any questions about

361
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:37,449
that so far so some week one of the

362
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,820
things that we discovered was that we we

363
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:42,220
saw some of those vessels that sort of

364
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,570
dance between big vessels the little

365
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,000
ones that dance between big ones

366
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:48,820
actually we look at those and those are

367
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,960
actually open so I don't know whether

368
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:54,370
they be called a pit or not anyway but

369
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,889
that was something we sort of discovered

370
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:59,110
late that even that that it may not be

371
00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:01,539
the typical vessel to vessel get that

372
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:04,360
has a pit membrane and has a resistance

373
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:07,240
across it but rather an open pit those

374
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:07,798
might turn out to be those will turn out

375
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,669
to be in

376
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:14,408
later but so once you've decided how

377
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:17,230
close they need to be to be connected

378
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:19,659
then you can let the software go through

379
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:21,459
and not only trace the center of the

380
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:23,530
vessel but also trace where there were

381
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:25,568
connections and this is all kind of

382
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:28,538
off-the-shelf automatic after you've

383
00:17:25,568 --> 00:17:31,450
gone through that process I described

384
00:17:28,538 --> 00:17:34,210
but you can see sometimes it thinks that

385
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:36,519
there's connections right in you know in

386
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:38,079
the middle of nowhere basically and a

387
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:40,980
lot of these connections look really

388
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:44,649
crazy so we ended up having to hire a

389
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:48,069
mother postdoc Eric Lee who is an

390
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:50,350
engineer type guy and he was able to

391
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:54,158
develop the algorithms that we needed to

392
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:56,019
take what these old software told us and

393
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:58,659
actually turn into something that we

394
00:17:56,019 --> 00:18:00,759
thought was more realistic and that he

395
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:03,940
could actually model as far as flow was

396
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:08,349
concerned and then we went ahead and

397
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:10,840
checked weather checked what the data

398
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:15,308
look like in terms of where the

399
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:18,069
connections were and so on so one thing

400
00:18:15,308 --> 00:18:20,558
for instance was if you if you consider

401
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:22,839
a vessel where zero degrees is in the

402
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:25,480
radial direction and 90 degrees is 90

403
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:28,359
degrees from that the connections are

404
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:36,490
mostly at zero degrees with some at 90

405
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:40,509
degrees and in the in the dorsal ventral

406
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:43,058
zone same thing in the in the lateral

407
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:47,440
zones but this made a lot of sense

408
00:18:43,058 --> 00:18:49,808
because generally vessels are in radial

409
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,840
files so this would be a zero degree

410
00:18:49,808 --> 00:18:54,460
connection and they're also usually next

411
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:56,139
to if they're going to be connected

412
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:59,860
they'd be connected at right angles to

413
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:02,409
that rather than at sort of just any old

414
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:03,849
name but that was so that's just one

415
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:06,460
description we had a bunch of

416
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:09,069
descriptions you know that the dorsal

417
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,090
ventral vessels are generally bigger

418
00:19:09,069 --> 00:19:15,609
than the lateral

419
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:17,528
nestles there closer to the pit and more

420
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:20,589
interconnected but all of this is just

421
00:19:17,528 --> 00:19:22,839
descriptive what we really wanted was we

422
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:24,579
really wanted to make take all of this

423
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:27,069
interconnected stuff on a particular

424
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:29,769
stem or a particular section of stem and

425
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:32,048
make a mathematical model a flow model

426
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:33,579
an engineering model about how water

427
00:19:32,048 --> 00:19:34,929
would flow through this system because

428
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:39,639
that's what we were really interested in

429
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:43,149
so this is what Eric did we took we took

430
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:47,350
a bunch of information from the

431
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:50,769
literature about for instance what the

432
00:19:47,349 --> 00:19:52,898
force the pore size distribution would

433
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:54,609
be in a typical pit what the pit

434
00:19:52,898 --> 00:19:57,719
conductivity would be in a bunch of

435
00:19:54,609 --> 00:20:00,398
other stuff and came up with a flow

436
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,220
basically from one pressure at one side

437
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:04,959
to another pressure at the other side

438
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:08,640
just to see how this would behave and

439
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:11,829
this is the first ever run that we did

440
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,890
and what this shows is in the red color

441
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:16,389
its flow going in one direction it

442
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,130
actually doesn't matter which one but

443
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:21,490
let's say from the bottom to the top and

444
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:24,039
the blue direction and its intensity is

445
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:28,538
flow going in the opposite direction so

446
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:31,390
already in this particular section that

447
00:20:28,538 --> 00:20:33,640
we that we analyze we've already got

448
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:35,140
enough complex interconnections and

449
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,509
enough differences in resistant

450
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:41,100
resistance and so on that you can get

451
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:45,398
flow in the wrong direction in a

452
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:48,250
reasonable model of what the you know

453
00:20:45,398 --> 00:20:53,319
what the xylem would be like in a in a

454
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:55,269
grapevine so that was one of the things

455
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:57,908
we wanted to ask the question about

456
00:20:55,269 --> 00:21:00,579
whether you can have reverse flow and

457
00:20:57,909 --> 00:21:02,200
you can another thing was has to do with

458
00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:04,808
embolism spread I'll get the embolism

459
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,759
prepare a little bit later but is there

460
00:21:04,808 --> 00:21:09,158
any pattern that you can see that

461
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:11,470
relates to the structure of the xylem or

462
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:15,070
do things just embolize let's say

463
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:18,669
randomly well here's an example of a

464
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:19,769
living stem now and notice that you

465
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:21,630
don't see many

466
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:23,250
the vessels and that's because there are

467
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:26,370
a whole bunch of other vessels that you

468
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:27,930
can actually pick out by I but they are

469
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:29,759
almost the same color as the background

470
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:32,460
because they're filled with water and

471
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:33,930
x-rays are basically telling you with

472
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:37,890
the density of the tissue and that's

473
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:39,990
mostly the density of water so basically

474
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:43,650
all of these vessels that you see here

475
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:46,500
are embolized vessels and this was on a

476
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:49,290
stem of a plant that we dried out on

477
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:54,589
purpose then took it to Berkeley then

478
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:58,649
set it up in this in this x-ray and then

479
00:21:54,589 --> 00:22:03,659
x-rayed it for a number of hours and got

480
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:07,890
sequential images along this five

481
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:11,790
millimeter section and what the images

482
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:13,170
showed was all the ones in blue here

483
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:16,019
were the ones that were already

484
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:18,779
capitated already analyzed when we

485
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:20,789
started so at x 0 and through the rest

486
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:24,750
of the eight and a half hours you can

487
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:27,329
see how it spread as the colors go I

488
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:29,759
can't see colors very well but you can

489
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:32,129
see a couple of Emma lysing here and so

490
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,289
on and and one thing that you could see

491
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:37,740
very clearly was that they tended to

492
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:40,409
embolize in groups corresponding to that

493
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,359
radio file which makes sort of sense

494
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:45,720
because those are the ones that are

495
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:51,000
typically interconnected but we had some

496
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:54,870
cases where so if you look down at this

497
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,730
this lower half for instance this groove

498
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:58,679
which i think is red I'm red-green

499
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:02,130
colorblind so is this a red color here

500
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:04,350
okay this group in red embolized at the

501
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:08,310
same time that this group in blues at

502
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:10,500
blue this group in blue and this is

503
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:13,379
yellow or green from joke yo thank you

504
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,690
so we got a red file in blue file and

505
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,630
this yellow guy and if you scan through

506
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:19,360
you find that that yellow guys switched

507
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:21,460
allegiance here

508
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:23,169
right to the blue somewhere in that

509
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,029
section you can see in the 3d

510
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,950
reconstruction it's going from being

511
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:28,899
connected to a red guy to being

512
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:31,029
connected to a glue guy here so that

513
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,130
explains why they would why all of these

514
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:35,558
things would embolize at the same time

515
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:41,740
is because they were connected by one of

516
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:44,109
these by the yellow guy so I think in

517
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:47,170
terms of sort of conclusions for this

518
00:23:44,109 --> 00:23:50,709
part of the work we think that we can

519
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:53,350
use hi res cat scanning to construct

520
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:55,539
accurate 3d models of how the xylem is

521
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:57,939
interconnected and it's a lot of work

522
00:23:55,539 --> 00:23:59,710
it's a lot less work than doing

523
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,200
everything by hand but it's still a lot

524
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:05,798
of work and we're still working on that

525
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:08,230
I think the 3d software to rotate these

526
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:10,750
images and makes virtual sections

527
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:12,429
through them is very valuable we can see

528
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:15,849
a lot of interesting things like those

529
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:19,450
bridging cells that we didn't we didn't

530
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:24,609
even know about and I think the idea

531
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:26,679
back flow and perhaps spread of xylem

532
00:24:24,609 --> 00:24:28,808
dwelling bacteria may may be an

533
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:32,530
important that the complexity of

534
00:24:28,808 --> 00:24:34,298
interconnections and the idea that you

535
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:38,769
can have that flow may be important for

536
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:41,139
that and also that those 3d

537
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:44,679
interconnections may be very important

538
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:47,110
for the pattern of embolism script any

539
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:48,580
questions about that so far I'm used to

540
00:24:47,109 --> 00:24:51,009
kind of interacting a little bit more

541
00:24:48,579 --> 00:24:53,619
with the class so I really encourage you

542
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:56,859
to ask questions nobody I know

543
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:59,048
everybody's embarrassed sure yes every

544
00:24:56,859 --> 00:25:03,240
good one bush with the gas the

545
00:24:59,048 --> 00:25:03,240
interconnections what's the space there

546
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:12,069
that's that's a really good question so

547
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:19,009
let me see now so if your if you were

548
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,769
thinking about this gap that that gap is

549
00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:24,440
that gap is the is them I don't know is

550
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:26,210
the bay bridge for xylo exile Allah can

551
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:30,740
get through there no problem that is

552
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:34,579
essentially open the pores in the in the

553
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:36,740
pit membranes of a typical vessel to

554
00:25:34,579 --> 00:25:39,079
vessel connection those are too small

555
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:42,670
for as I thought I Lola and the thinking

556
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:46,189
is it desired lower extreme excrete

557
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:48,460
enzymes that degrade carbohydrates and

558
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:51,289
they digest their way through those

559
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:53,690
probably causing a cavitation when that

560
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:56,299
happens I mean but but that's where

561
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:58,430
that's where the spread of the bacteria

562
00:25:56,299 --> 00:26:00,710
and the anatomy of the xylem and it's

563
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:04,279
you know 3d interconnections that's kind

564
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:06,350
of where these things converge to the

565
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:08,569
same kind of question that's why we

566
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:10,490
wanted to model modeled it actually the

567
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:12,319
model that I showed that it included

568
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:14,480
these kind of connections yet because we

569
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:17,000
sort of discovered those after we had

570
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:21,970
figured out the model good question

571
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,970
anybody else yes sir

572
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:33,779
that's that's a very good question so

573
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:37,549
and I don't know no well what yes you'll

574
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:42,139
hire a postdoc who knows and that solved

575
00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:48,480
so so Eric Eric is actually a postdoc in

576
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:53,009
engineering and so the the the values

577
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:56,279
that you can get that from the

578
00:26:53,009 --> 00:26:58,950
literature about well one value for

579
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:00,869
instance is just a pessoa equation for a

580
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:03,569
given diameter a vessel and the flow

581
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:07,289
through them that's easy right okay the

582
00:27:03,569 --> 00:27:09,569
hard one is is how hard is it for water

583
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:12,299
to go from here and go across when

584
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:17,009
there's a pic connection and as it turns

585
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:21,740
out there are there are ways so you can

586
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:25,799
take a piece of stem and you can glue

587
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:27,809
using superglue of course glue a glass

588
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:30,319
capillary that's been pulled down pretty

589
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:34,169
fine glue a capillary into one vessel

590
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:36,359
then you can send water with some dye

591
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:38,519
through there and look at the other end

592
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:41,189
and see where that's coming out now

593
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:44,700
usually what we try to do then then then

594
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:48,360
you can glue up that side and if it

595
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:50,370
comes out of an adjacent vessel and the

596
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:53,039
vessels are fairly close then you can be

597
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:56,759
pretty confident that they are connected

598
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:59,129
in between there and that then you can

599
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:01,470
measure the flow coming in and going out

600
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:04,080
and the pressure differential and then

601
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:07,319
you can calculate a sort of a hydraulic

602
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:08,639
conductivity of that junction so so

603
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:10,470
we've done a little bit of that in our

604
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,320
lab but other folks have done a lot of

605
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:15,120
that in their labs so so that pic

606
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:17,460
conductivity is something that we just

607
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,699
put into this this hydraulic equation

608
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:22,548
along with all the other typical is

609
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:25,819
shins of a you know hydraulic equation

610
00:28:22,548 --> 00:28:27,888
it's are you an engineer pad guy it's a

611
00:28:25,819 --> 00:28:29,388
very complex set of equations right

612
00:28:27,888 --> 00:28:31,668
because you got all these vessels in all

613
00:28:29,388 --> 00:28:35,719
these interconnections that's why we had

614
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:38,630
to hire Eric to do it is that okay yeah

615
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,490
yeah that's we have no idea how this

616
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:42,980
would work out we just said let's just

617
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:49,159
model this based on you know physical

618
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:53,089
principles good question anybody else am

619
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:56,539
i doing time was okay yes sir it's not

620
00:28:53,089 --> 00:29:00,259
obviously why they're perfect rating why

621
00:28:56,538 --> 00:29:01,908
there is back okay so you should have

622
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:06,558
stopped me way back when I was talking

623
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:13,909
about this but you didn't say well okay

624
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:17,359
okay that'd be basically if the pressure

625
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:19,370
here at this connection let's let's just

626
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:21,678
say for a moment that this connection is

627
00:29:19,369 --> 00:29:24,648
has very little resistance if the

628
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,330
president here is lower as higher than

629
00:29:24,648 --> 00:29:30,949
the pressure here then water's going to

630
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:33,408
go back that way so so and you can just

631
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:35,450
make up a scenario these are all equal

632
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:37,940
sized pipes with slightly different

633
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:41,330
resistance so if this one has a lot of

634
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:43,429
some resistance then then bend the

635
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:45,769
pressure downstream of this resistance

636
00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:48,620
is going to be you know a lower than

637
00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:50,690
this pressure and if this one has a lot

638
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:52,038
more of resistance then the pressure

639
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:55,250
here is going to be a lot lower than

640
00:29:52,038 --> 00:29:57,230
that pressure and and they both may be

641
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:59,720
lower than this pressure here with no

642
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:01,339
resistance so basically it's this is

643
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,808
really from here to here is just a

644
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:04,418
connection and whether it's oriented

645
00:30:02,808 --> 00:30:06,730
backwards or whether

646
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:08,619
into the sign and some extent doesn't

647
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:10,298
really make any difference so the water

648
00:30:08,618 --> 00:30:13,118
doesn't know that it's going backwards

649
00:30:10,298 --> 00:30:16,028
is just flowing down downhill is that

650
00:30:13,118 --> 00:30:18,009
now that's just hand wave but when I

651
00:30:16,028 --> 00:30:21,159
asked the question that works yeah okay

652
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:22,839
so so apparently the engineer guys have

653
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:24,609
known this and if you are a young

654
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:26,618
engineer and you design a system of

655
00:30:24,608 --> 00:30:28,358
pipes and this does it you get fired or

656
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:29,829
something like that you know that

657
00:30:28,358 --> 00:30:32,499
usually you don't want things to work

658
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:33,999
that way but I think that's why they

659
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:35,710
always use pipes are the same diameter

660
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:38,980
because then then you don't have that

661
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:44,379
big of a problem this is great anybody

662
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:47,558
else so the let's say we talked about

663
00:30:44,378 --> 00:30:49,928
embolism loops bread so I'm going to

664
00:30:47,558 --> 00:30:52,538
quickly now talk just about this repair

665
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:58,570
because at first we were just putting

666
00:30:52,538 --> 00:31:00,730
sticks in the in the HR CT and we

667
00:30:58,569 --> 00:31:03,788
decided and I don't remember who was the

668
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:06,069
weather Craig wanted to do this or mark

669
00:31:03,788 --> 00:31:07,749
Matthews my colleague said you know

670
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:11,019
let's put a live plant in there and see

671
00:31:07,749 --> 00:31:13,239
if we can see embolisms or something now

672
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:15,788
the guys at Berkeley said you guys are

673
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:16,960
nuts you know you don't go anywhere near

674
00:31:15,788 --> 00:31:18,730
that thing you don't have anything

675
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,200
living in that thing you know there's

676
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,759
all the shielding and stuff and they

677
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,940
just thought the plant was just going to

678
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:26,679
die well it didn't die in fact in fact

679
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:30,389
the plants we brought him back out to

680
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:33,580
the greenhouse and they were fine and so

681
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:38,349
just as background though other people

682
00:31:33,579 --> 00:31:40,118
have used NMR or MRI nuclear magnetic

683
00:31:38,349 --> 00:31:43,209
resonance or magnetic resonance imaging

684
00:31:40,118 --> 00:31:45,189
to want to say that there's been vessels

685
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:48,999
that are embolized so here's a corn root

686
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:50,830
and you see these three black dots and

687
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:53,019
now there's only one black dot because

688
00:31:50,829 --> 00:31:55,239
the other two are full and that means

689
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:57,399
that you know that water has filled

690
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:59,499
these these vessels that were that we're

691
00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:03,339
embolized so this has been around for a

692
00:31:59,499 --> 00:32:05,528
little while but as you can see the

693
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:06,789
resolutions not great if you have a

694
00:32:05,528 --> 00:32:09,829
foreign route with really

695
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:11,629
vessels that you can see them we

696
00:32:09,829 --> 00:32:14,659
actually got a little better resolution

697
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:17,390
on grapevines and we're also able to

698
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:20,390
show so this is a living plant and you

699
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:24,710
know you can see them light up here and

700
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:27,710
when they where there was two to dark

701
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:29,930
ones here okay but again the resolutions

702
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:36,890
not great and we put a living plant in

703
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:40,340
there and it survived and for instance

704
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:43,940
we would make we would make a CT scan of

705
00:32:40,339 --> 00:32:45,679
this plant that show some dark vessels

706
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,990
that means capitated vessels and then

707
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,340
you can look and see on the image that

708
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:51,859
there were vessels that work

709
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:54,049
water-filled no problem and you can kind

710
00:32:51,859 --> 00:32:57,349
of line that up with a hand section of

711
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:59,240
the same thing so so for instance this

712
00:32:57,349 --> 00:33:01,909
is pointing to number one's pointing to

713
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:04,120
two adjacent vessels here that we would

714
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:07,180
say are connected and the big one is

715
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:10,879
embolize the little one is full of water

716
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:15,350
okay but as soon as we start looking at

717
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:17,660
these we saw these little blobs these

718
00:33:15,349 --> 00:33:19,909
little like warts and we thought what

719
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:22,759
the heck are those things I mean most of

720
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:24,920
the vessels you know our round but we

721
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:30,529
saw one that are like moon shaped and

722
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:34,039
what are those blogs well the thought

723
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:36,619
was hmm maybe those blobs are little

724
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:40,309
water droplets that are starting to

725
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:44,179
refill these vessels and and mark canny

726
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:47,599
had already come up with this idea so so

727
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:50,330
as background I should I probably should

728
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:53,599
have said this already you know that we

729
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:55,639
get embolism that's a bad thing and

730
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:58,639
there's lots been been lots of of

731
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:02,300
evidence that embolism can be somehow

732
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,580
reversed so you can have a loss of

733
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:06,319
hydraulic conductivity in the day and

734
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:08,940
then a gain of hydraulic conductivity

735
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:11,489
than during the night or maybe sometime

736
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:14,480
later in the day and so so the search

737
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:17,039
was on for finding out how the heck

738
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,690
Asylum vessel can be empty at one time

739
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,719
of the day and the whole system is under

740
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:23,789
tension and yet and somehow refill you

741
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:26,549
know later that day or maybe overnight

742
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:30,148
when the system is under tension so so

743
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:34,079
Martin canny hasn't used cryo sem and

744
00:34:30,148 --> 00:34:36,299
found little drops and said hey maybe

745
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,000
it's water being sort of pushed in there

746
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:41,068
by the adjacent cells but the problem

747
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,989
with cryo of course is that you're never

748
00:34:41,068 --> 00:34:45,509
sure if it's an artifact or not because

749
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:47,759
you freeze it and water can distill and

750
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:49,950
condense and so on so that kind of got

751
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,560
left alone for for a while while

752
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:56,519
everybody was chasing after this and

753
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:59,400
also these droplets now you can see that

754
00:34:56,519 --> 00:35:01,289
they in this virtual long section that

755
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,838
they look a little bit more like drops

756
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:06,599
they kind of look a little bit like tile

757
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:09,000
Oh Sees but obviously kylo seas are a

758
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:12,450
permanent thing they are not a drop it's

759
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:16,318
a outgrowth of an adjacent brinkema cell

760
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:20,098
and and we basically just kept looking

761
00:35:16,318 --> 00:35:23,759
at these and finally once we got the 3d

762
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:27,000
sort of reconstruction figured out we

763
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,040
were we you know to our to our amazement

764
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,389
realize that what we were seeing was

765
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:35,699
drops and they may be drops that you

766
00:35:33,389 --> 00:35:38,250
could see clearly as individual drops or

767
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:42,868
they may be things that were sort of

768
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:48,000
more big blobs which may have been drops

769
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:49,890
that just coalesced and so what we could

770
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,250
do is we could look at the same section

771
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:55,279
over time so this would be an example of

772
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:59,670
an experiment where we took a grapevine

773
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:03,060
dried it out real good came in at0 time

774
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:04,858
and this is just one long section for

775
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:11,009
from from one section where you can see

776
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:13,170
three pretty clear vessels and then we

777
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:14,790
would maybe ree water the point or in

778
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:17,099
one case in the first plant we did we

779
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:18,670
actually just put it in there and at

780
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:20,980
time 0 we saw

781
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:23,019
you can see that there was drops or

782
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:26,199
something so he just left the vinyl um

783
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:28,719
didn't rewire it at all and over time it

784
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:30,579
refilled itself so sometimes if the vine

785
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:32,019
is very supplants very stressed you have

786
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:34,090
to water it and then it will refill

787
00:36:32,019 --> 00:36:36,460
sometimes it just does it maybe it was

788
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:39,670
ready to do it on its own but you can

789
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:42,099
see over time and up finally at about

790
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:44,139
four hours everything had been refilled

791
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:46,420
now you know we don't have a minute by

792
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:49,150
minute we it's more like every 30

793
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:52,150
minutes or so that we can scan this but

794
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:54,250
clearly things were getting refilled and

795
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:55,960
and you can see a lot of interesting

796
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:58,510
detail about you know one of the last

797
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,949
things to go might be a bubble in the

798
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:06,010
middle of the vessel or on the side of

799
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:10,750
the best episode it's that's a very good

800
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:16,930
question this is for hours in the in the

801
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:18,849
dark but but also because of the shaking

802
00:37:16,929 --> 00:37:21,309
that it because of the way you have to

803
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:23,559
you know pulled the plant I think I

804
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:25,750
showed what the yeah because of the way

805
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:29,619
you have to hold this plan everything is

806
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:32,679
sort of enclosed anyway this one has got

807
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:34,719
a Ted sticking up above it so yeah so

808
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:37,059
you would expect though that it's low

809
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:43,419
transpiration conditions for sure for

810
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:49,000
sure so here's an example for instance

811
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:51,700
if since the sense the software will

812
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,429
allow you to say okay I'm then identify

813
00:37:51,699 --> 00:37:56,649
this vessel or this vessel or this

814
00:37:54,429 --> 00:37:58,329
vessel then you can and then it will

815
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:01,240
also say I'm going to identify these

816
00:37:58,329 --> 00:38:02,650
things as drops tell me everywhere that

817
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:04,599
they're connected to and then it will

818
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:06,400
sort of show you all those drops then

819
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:07,779
you can actually calculate the volume of

820
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,670
the vessel and the volume of the drops

821
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:13,000
and the volume by difference of the air

822
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:15,849
so this shows for instance some of four

823
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:20,670
vessels and how that how they ultimately

824
00:38:15,849 --> 00:38:23,409
all have no air at six hours and and

825
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:25,329
because we were able to track individual

826
00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:28,149
drops at least in the early part of this

827
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:29,090
process we could say how big is the

828
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:33,019
volume of that

829
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:35,360
now compared to how big it is two hours

830
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:37,969
from now or four hours from and we could

831
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:41,450
actually calculate a droplet growth rate

832
00:38:37,969 --> 00:38:43,609
and we could take all the drops in all

833
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:45,739
the surface area of that vessel and

834
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:50,200
calculate how fast it should take a

835
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:54,019
vessel to fill and basically the white

836
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:56,689
circles are our calculation based on a

837
00:38:54,019 --> 00:39:00,679
drop growth rate that's not crop growth

838
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:03,289
rate drop on an independent sample then

839
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:06,949
from what we actually observe for these

840
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:09,050
things as to how quick the vessel could

841
00:39:06,949 --> 00:39:11,119
be you know filled up with water and you

842
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:15,050
can see really good agreement little

843
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:17,000
disagreement here but basically the

844
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:19,220
vessels seem to be filling in a

845
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,489
consistent manner with what we calculate

846
00:39:19,219 --> 00:39:25,819
for a drop to grow and in this case

847
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:28,129
there are some vessels that start

848
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:29,930
filling that is lower air volume and

849
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:32,000
then the air volume comes up and they

850
00:39:29,929 --> 00:39:35,869
wander around and that may never go to

851
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:40,550
zero okay I'll show some some details

852
00:39:35,869 --> 00:39:43,400
about that so that's what we would call

853
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:46,400
is refilling failure okay so if we zoom

854
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:49,880
in on this thing here we see it here

855
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:53,119
okay so we see some drops here some

856
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:55,039
drops here some big globs drop here

857
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,559
where's that water coming from adjacent

858
00:39:55,039 --> 00:40:00,409
Frank well I'll get to better that's a

859
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:03,489
very good question so from you know I

860
00:40:00,409 --> 00:40:03,489
don't know Frank's magic

861
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:11,320
so in this case for instance we've got

862
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:16,710
zero up to six hours at six hours this

863
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:20,280
one lonely vessel here which is this guy

864
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:23,679
has not filled but all the other ones

865
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:25,900
next to it have filled here's here's a

866
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:28,809
whole bunch of little ones and a lot of

867
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:33,940
drops and this whole group is is here

868
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:36,880
and it's full so and it's not for lack

869
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:38,740
of trying because by zooming in on that

870
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,110
one vessel you can see that there are

871
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:43,809
drops growing I mean I'm assuming that

872
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:46,300
that now by this point that these things

873
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:50,409
are growing over time and that they are

874
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:53,410
so the idea is well so so this oh so

875
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:56,920
this would be an example of where this

876
00:40:53,409 --> 00:41:00,339
filming attempt somehow fails it ends up

877
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:03,039
being completely embolized but it makes

878
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:06,850
sense if these things are filling and

879
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:09,130
then after being full they come under

880
00:41:06,849 --> 00:41:11,739
tension as the normal part of the xylem

881
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:14,650
is under tension then maybe this one

882
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:17,079
just cannot keep up with that and it's

883
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:18,700
empty because of because of the tension

884
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:24,309
in the rest of the xylem or at least

885
00:41:18,699 --> 00:41:26,379
that's the model the we just as sort of

886
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:28,659
a sideline you can get lots of very cool

887
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:30,369
pictures of this sort of 3d and you

888
00:41:28,659 --> 00:41:34,119
could zoom through there and get get

889
00:41:30,369 --> 00:41:37,539
seasick doing that the the droplets

890
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:41,920
appeared to be forming forever Anjali on

891
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:49,150
the sides that are next to the radio

892
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:51,610
parenchymal cells and and this is not a

893
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:53,590
new idea other people have speculated

894
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:55,930
that this was going on but I think now

895
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:59,590
we have sort of the first evidence that

896
00:41:55,929 --> 00:42:01,899
it does go on in vivo and that is that

897
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:06,100
you've got the radio parenchymal cells

898
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:08,889
here that it's probably carbohydrates

899
00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:09,960
because if you girdle you can slow this

900
00:42:08,889 --> 00:42:13,440
process down

901
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:17,119
our work with other folks if the only

902
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:19,740
way we can explain it is that the cells

903
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:22,490
somehow get well you know transport

904
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:25,649
sugars or whatever into the adjacent

905
00:42:22,489 --> 00:42:27,809
xylem that those sugars then osmotically

906
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:30,210
from all the rest of this tissue draw

907
00:42:27,809 --> 00:42:32,730
water in and that's what causes that the

908
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:37,079
water drop to grow that you can get

909
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:41,699
growth over time that the growth if it

910
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:43,980
happens to connect to the adjacent

911
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:46,618
vessel that's under tension then that's

912
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:50,309
probably not fast enough to keep that

913
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:52,349
water from flowing out but if it is fast

914
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:55,320
enough which means that this is where

915
00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:57,150
things get interesting is that we don't

916
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:00,359
think this system when they're refilling

917
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:02,369
is all under tension it may be that

918
00:43:00,358 --> 00:43:04,079
there's others island in other places

919
00:43:02,369 --> 00:43:06,390
that are under tension and we certainly

920
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,088
when we measure the bulk of the tissue

921
00:43:06,389 --> 00:43:12,269
we get a low water potential value so we

922
00:43:09,088 --> 00:43:14,779
presume that it's under tension but it

923
00:43:12,269 --> 00:43:17,460
may be that this is a very local

924
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:19,800
phenomenon and that when you've got a

925
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:22,679
bunch of cells they tend to do this in

926
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,570
groups all sort of trying to refill

927
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:27,149
that's very key illogical don't get me

928
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:29,550
wrong I'm not a feely ologist but I

929
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:34,349
think it's pretty much what we think is

930
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:36,660
going on that that that maybe that maybe

931
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:40,289
even in the ones that we think are full

932
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:43,618
maybe they're also getting carbon from

933
00:43:40,289 --> 00:43:45,869
their adjacent parenchymal cells and and

934
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:49,140
maybe that they're kind of relieving the

935
00:43:45,869 --> 00:43:51,210
tension by adding some pumping into it

936
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:53,429
and while they're being relieved of

937
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:56,280
tension all the recipes guys can refill

938
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:58,079
and that after their Dunn's been filling

939
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,269
then the whole system can come back

940
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,779
under tension least this is our this is

941
00:44:00,269 --> 00:44:05,909
this is our hypothesis we have evidence

942
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:08,369
anyway that the drop growth rate can

943
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:11,039
explain the refilling we have evidence

944
00:44:08,369 --> 00:44:12,838
that drops congeal and get the space

945
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:15,480
gets less and less we have evidence that

946
00:44:12,838 --> 00:44:17,219
that bubbles can be right in the middle

947
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,869
of the vessel and then the next

948
00:44:17,219 --> 00:44:21,329
time we see them they're gone so

949
00:44:18,869 --> 00:44:24,900
presumably they've gotten compressed and

950
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:27,059
you need a little bit of it can't be

951
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,858
under tension for that to happen we also

952
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:31,409
have evidence that the bubbles can be

953
00:44:28,858 --> 00:44:33,569
near the edge and disappear which could

954
00:44:31,409 --> 00:44:35,519
mean that the air is sort of going out

955
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:38,460
into the applicant lab somehow but

956
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:40,530
bottom line i think the weight of the

957
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:43,320
evidence is is strongly favoring the

958
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:45,690
idea of a sugar or some kind of

959
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:50,039
carbohydrate transport followed by

960
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:59,309
osmosis and you know just water water

961
00:44:50,039 --> 00:45:02,369
movement yes might not be under tension

962
00:44:59,309 --> 00:45:03,980
is there any evidence to suggest that

963
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:09,369
the end

964
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:17,809
pours in this island and embolize

965
00:45:09,369 --> 00:45:26,050
section of xylem close that's a very

966
00:45:17,809 --> 00:45:30,099
good question Missy holbrook at Harvard

967
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:36,320
came up with the idea some time ago that

968
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:38,299
the the pits so actually it's not it's

969
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,920
not just the ends that are a concern

970
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:42,019
it's the ends and the sides and

971
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:45,380
everywhere right if the whole tissue is

972
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:47,960
under tension then how is it that that

973
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:50,720
you can get water under maybe slight

974
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:53,840
pressure or let's say no tension anyway

975
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:57,049
filling these things and as soon as it

976
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:59,119
touches it touches a side that's in

977
00:45:57,050 --> 00:46:02,359
continuity with anything under tension

978
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:05,570
it should just get sucked right away so

979
00:46:02,358 --> 00:46:07,429
she came up with the idea that that the

980
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:09,050
reason why pits are designed the way

981
00:46:07,429 --> 00:46:11,629
they are is that there might be a little

982
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:15,470
bit of a hydrophobic pocket right around

983
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:19,130
the pit so that when water is filling

984
00:46:15,469 --> 00:46:21,319
this it actually doesn't wet the part of

985
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:23,960
the pit that connects it to the adjacent

986
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:26,390
cell and that it might be just at the

987
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:28,039
last moment when all the when the

988
00:46:26,389 --> 00:46:32,509
pressure is enough to cause all of those

989
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:34,400
things to make a connection so so in a

990
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:36,650
way you could say that that's like you

991
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:40,720
know closing off the connections until

992
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:40,720
they're ready to to be connected
