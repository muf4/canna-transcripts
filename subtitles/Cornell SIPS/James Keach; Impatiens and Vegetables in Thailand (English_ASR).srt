1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,799
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,719
University thank you all for coming out

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,240
uh as Nina said this I'm going to just

4
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:15,359
talk a little bit about my drewer

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,800
experience I said impatience and

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,919
vegetables as the title but it ended up

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,278
being a whole lot of other stuff as well

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,800
so I'll see how much I can kind of cram

9
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:27,160
into 40 minutes and still hopefully have

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,960
more room for other things to talk about

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,920
uh before I get started though this was

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,039
one of the coolest dis phenotypes I've

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,719
ever seen this is tomato necrotic

14
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:38,920
ringspot virus on uh chili pepper and

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,920
they had a whole population of them most

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,359
of them look like most diseased plants

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,000
but there was one genotype that had this

18
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:48,558
just really unusual uh phenotype from

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,480
the disease and I thought I have to you

20
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:54,198
know preserve this for posterity so I

21
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:55,878
just wanted to share that um I'll be

22
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:58,039
taking you through my three main

23
00:00:55,878 --> 00:01:00,159
internships I wrote the drewer for uh

24
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:03,960
the tropical vegetable Research Center

25
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:06,478
in uh kind of central Thailand uh Chaya

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,478
company in Western Thailand and then

27
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,640
Prince of saclaw University in southern

28
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,039
Thailand just north of the border with

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,159
Malaysia uh I'll get a little bit into

30
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,799
some of the side trips I did as well I

31
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,799
had to cut some of them because there

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,079
was a lot of traveling but just to kind

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,200
of give you an idea of some of the

34
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:23,879
horiculture that I kind of experienced

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,118
while I was over

36
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:28,478
there uh so for a lot of people ask me

37
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,799
where Thailand was so I thought this

38
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:33,000
would be a good kind of primer

39
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,439
uh it's right there it's not Taiwan that

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,640
was another kind of source of confusion

41
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:40,679
um and a people also asked me why I was

42
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,319
interested in Thailand uh one of the big

43
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,960
things is Thailand has a really strong

44
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,879
agricultural sector they get a lot of

45
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:47,599
government support for it the royal

46
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:50,078
family has poured a lot of personal

47
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,679
money into it they've set up kind of uh

48
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,319
what they call the Royal projects which

49
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,200
are kind of specific projects to kind of

50
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,279
push the boundaries of Agriculture

51
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,359
within Thailand they like to say that

52
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,159
they're self-sufficient for all crops

53
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,280
except wheat I've never actually seen

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,880
any figures to support this but it's

55
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,840
something they like to say um and it's

56
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,598
mostly because of the range of climates

57
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,439
within Thailand in the northern part you

58
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:14,839
have temperate areas where you can grow

59
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:16,239
things like cherries and apples and then

60
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,080
the rest of the country is pretty

61
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,640
tropical you can grow things like rice

62
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,160
and pretty much any other sort of

63
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:24,399
tropical food uh they did try growing

64
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,840
wheat and I met with a wheat breeder a

65
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,400
few years back there and she said they

66
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,400
could grow it during the middle of their

67
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,280
winter in the coolest part of the

68
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,080
country but otherwise it was a complete

69
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,840
flop they do grow barley though they

70
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:41,319
have a huge uh Brewing uh uh industry

71
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,598
there uh it's also a really uh a big hot

72
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:45,878
spot for biodiversity there's over a 100

73
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,878
native impatient species uh most of you

74
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:50,518
all I think know I did my PhD on

75
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:52,518
impatients and it's a genus of 1300 so

76
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,360
that's a pretty good chunk of them uh

77
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:57,158
there's also tons of other families it's

78
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,120
inji AC I mean lots of towns have two or

79
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:00,598
three native species that they use in

80
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,599
their cooking that adds kind of

81
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:03,919
different flavors and spices so it was

82
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:06,039
just kind of fun to be like walking

83
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:07,839
around and seeing all these species that

84
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:11,079
might be really really local to that

85
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,598
area uh nice climate good food you know

86
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,680
those weren't my primary reasons but

87
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:17,280
they certainly didn't hurt and also have

88
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,080
some personal history with Thailand uh

89
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,959
my ex of five years was Thai I speak a

90
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,840
little bit of Thai from uh being with

91
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,640
him and I've been to Thailand twice

92
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,959
before which kind of fed into a lot of

93
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:31,039
the internships that I have

94
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,920
here uh the first first internship I did

95
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,840
was with the tropical vegetable Research

96
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:38,559
Center but it was at kazet University in

97
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,799
at their cing sand campus and I tried to

98
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,199
put little red dots on the different

99
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,799
areas that I went to in Thailand uh so

100
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:48,919
this is about two hours West of bangok

101
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,159
uh casseta University is the Premier

102
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:54,280
Agriculture University in Thailand their

103
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:56,719
main campus is in downtown Bangkok but

104
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,799
their camp sand campus is huge they

105
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:01,400
refer to it as resort-like which I think

106
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,519
is kind of nice um they have lots of

107
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,438
bodies of water they you know even the

108
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,000
drainage canals are populated with water

109
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,919
lies and lotuses you know and canas so

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,239
it's a really beautiful campus just to

111
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:16,719
be wandering around um I happen to be

112
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,879
there during the loyo Town Festival

113
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,919
which is their kind of they build these

114
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,959
little altars out of biodegradable

115
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:25,879
material and put them on the water to

116
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,359
worship one of the water goddesses so uh

117
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:29,839
it's a really neat way to kind of see

118
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,560
Flor culture in action there this was

119
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,439
one of my favorite ones this is a banana

120
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,639
flow that they peel back and pinned to

121
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,160
itself and then they use banana stem in

122
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,160
the middle and put a Gina or globe

123
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,199
amaran in there and then you light

124
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,360
incense and candles uh iera the tropical

125
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:49,038
honeysuckle who's a really nice one I

126
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,439
mean I saw all sorts of different things

127
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,918
in the past they'd made them out of

128
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:55,478
different materials but now there's kind

129
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:57,839
of a eco-friendly um twist to it so that

130
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:59,959
the fish can finish them off and they

131
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,519
don't end up clogging up the waterways

132
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:03,399
but you can see it gets pretty crowded

133
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,120
this was towards the end of the festival

134
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:06,799
and this is again you know just one

135
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,720
University if you go into downtown

136
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,600
Bangkok I mean the entire uh canals and

137
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,440
rivers are clogged with uh these

138
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,520
different uh kind of floating

139
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,279
altars oh and there was a rhinoceros

140
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,839
beedle crossing the road I forgot to

141
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:22,399
mention um so the tropical vegetable

142
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:24,679
Research Center is a national uh

143
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,839
organization I got a lot of confusion

144
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,120
with the avdc or the world vegetable

145
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:30,679
Center and there's even more confusion

146
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,639
CU they're right next to each other at

147
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,840
the camp sand campus uh but it's a

148
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:37,918
distinct organization they have a few

149
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,478
different mandates uh germ plasm is one

150
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,279
of the big ones but they also do

151
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:43,918
breeding and they do a lot of Outreach

152
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:46,119
work it was a real eye opener for me I

153
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:48,758
mean I've lived in the tropics before

154
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,759
but just a huge incredible diversity of

155
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,520
species that they work with and work on

156
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,800
maintaining and improving uh things like

157
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,879
this is a relative of black pepper that

158
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,918
was a popular spice before Chili Peppers

159
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:01,639
were discovered uh gak fruit fruit it's

160
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:04,120
a relative bitter melon that you eat the

161
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:06,240
arrows they're high in carotenoids and

162
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,959
then lots of plants just growing

163
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,759
spontaneously around there this is a

164
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:13,359
wild clomi that's used as a vegetable in

165
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,280
parts of Thailand uh you use it with a

166
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,960
chili paste and eat it like that or you

167
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,279
can use a poot herb but it was

168
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,399
incredible you know I think of this as

169
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:22,159
an ornamental that you see them outside

170
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,279
the Cornell store but to see them

171
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,160
growing here as wild plants are really

172
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,758
mind-boggling uh as I mentioned they do

173
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,479
a lot of Outreach uh we LED several

174
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,720
tours for classes this was one Professor

175
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:36,918
or one teacher from a high school group

176
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,400
climbing one of the trees to uh bring

177
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:40,279
down fruits to distribute to the

178
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,159
students a lot of students you know

179
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:44,638
especially as urbanization kind of goes

180
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,039
on are getting less and less in touch

181
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,160
with the kind of like uh rural roots and

182
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,120
some of the indigenous knowledge so they

183
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,919
do a really great job in their

184
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,240
indigenous vegetable garden which I'll

185
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:56,680
touch on in the next slide uh trying to

186
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,478
educate people about some of the

187
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,879
different herbs and vegetables that you

188
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,719
can use it was really popular you know

189
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,919
everyone wanted to try it this the fruit

190
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,919
was terrible it's a Bimi I don't know if

191
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:10,079
any of you know it which is incredibly

192
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:11,959
sour from oxalic Acid I never eat it

193
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,639
fresh but everyone was excited just for

194
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:16,198
the new experience of it I think more

195
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,439
than anything else uh as I mentioned

196
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,319
they had the indigenous vegetable garden

197
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:23,439
and this is actually what had originally

198
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,439
attracted me to the tbrc this is um a

199
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:28,279
pretty nice Garden kind of on the edge

200
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,038
of their research facility and when I

201
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:32,359
was there before it had kind kind of

202
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:33,959
been just in the planning stages but now

203
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,759
they've really set it up into distinct

204
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:38,239
areas based on the different regions of

205
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,800
Thailand uh Thailand has the Northeast

206
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,478
area the North Area Central area and

207
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,879
South and they have kind of theme

208
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,399
Gardens based on those regions now each

209
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,960
with their own kind of herbs and their

210
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:52,198
own vegetables uh tassanai chipet was a

211
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:54,239
master student when I was there about

212
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,759
seven years ago he's now the head of

213
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,840
germ plasm and he has an encyclopedic

214
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,840
knowledge of every single plant within

215
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:02,198
that Garden you know he'd go and we'd

216
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,198
pass it and he could tell me the tie

217
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:06,598
name and the local dialect name and how

218
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,280
you could use it for food and what you

219
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:11,000
used it for medicine and scientific

220
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:13,478
studies it was just incredible uh in

221
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,879
this case he's eating the uh pedal of

222
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:19,399
one of the uh tarot relatives uh but

223
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,280
just lots of unusual plants and unusual

224
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:23,799
uses for plants that I've been familiar

225
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:26,318
with this is a torch Ginger I'd seen it

226
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,759
in Hawaii it's used as a cut flower it's

227
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,879
really nice cuz it lasts a long time but

228
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:33,278
in Thailand it's also used in soups uh

229
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,080
it has kind of a gingery Tangy flavor to

230
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,759
it you can also eat it fresh it's a

231
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,038
little fibrous I think to eat fresh but

232
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:40,360
in soup I think it's pretty tasty and so

233
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,240
you could have it as kind of a dual

234
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,000
purpose that

235
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,480
way uh their main claim to fame is their

236
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,240
pepper germ plasm they have over 200

237
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,879
varieties of Chili Peppers that they've

238
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,080
collected

239
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:56,439
[Music]

240
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:59,079
within since peppers are new world but

241
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,720
uh kind of naturalized varieties they've

242
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:02,679
them into different Market classes

243
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,720
they've done lots of breeding work and

244
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:07,759
lots of characterization as

245
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,920
well uh the two big issues for pepper

246
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:12,879
production are uh diseases and then

247
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:14,838
insects and they've developed one

248
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:17,639
variety that's pretty much immune to

249
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:19,519
insect uh prediction for the insects

250
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:21,559
that are a problem in Thailand so now

251
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,480
they're breeding for uh anthros

252
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:26,119
resistance is the other big problems uh

253
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,159
we did a lot of sorting of different

254
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,919
varieties into these are insect damage

255
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:32,199
those are disease these are the Edible

256
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,120
Ones and then taking data like that but

257
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,399
you can see a lot of variation they have

258
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,240
three or four different species uh that

259
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,879
have been distributed within Thailand

260
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:45,000
and they also have a duplication of the

261
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:47,320
uh AVR DC's uh Chili Pepper germ plasm

262
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,839
which is 3,000 accessions they didn't

263
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,320
grow all of those out but they do grow

264
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,000
out the taii ones and they also do um

265
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,160
some seed production this is a ghost

266
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,399
pepper breeding project that they're

267
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:58,879
working on

268
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,958
there uh the other one I mean they have

269
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,200
a lot of reading work but this was one

270
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,719
of the things that I thought was really

271
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,640
interesting since it's not a crop that

272
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,600
we see in the US that much this is Rosel

273
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,278
it's a hibiscus uh relative and

274
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,200
depending on the taxonomist you ask it

275
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:16,639
might even still be a hibiscus um but

276
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,519
it's if you have tea and the tea turns

277
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,278
red typically it's because they say it

278
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:22,200
as dried hibiscus and this is what

279
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:26,000
they're talking about in Thailand it's

280
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:28,079
used fresh instead uh it's a a crop that

281
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,360
hasn't received a lot of breeding work

282
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:33,599
but the breeder ma did a cross between

283
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,639
these two varieties and got a huge range

284
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,480
of variation whites pinks peaches uh

285
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,360
short tall all sorts of other things uh

286
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,200
it's really interesting at the top also

287
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,200
because it inhibits asparagus growth and

288
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,440
so people are trying to use uh kind of

289
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,839
capture that uh it's not as good with

290
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,680
the red one because it dies everything

291
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:54,440
red but there's some interest in using

292
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:56,199
one of the white varieties for things

293
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,720
like that and then they also put it out

294
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,240
and dry it to see what it's like uh for

295
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,800
creating briges so it was really neat

296
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,159
kind of seeing the kind of scope of

297
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,599
variation they've

298
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:08,719
created uh while I was there they also

299
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,440
had their annual cassette Fair cassette

300
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,200
means agriculture in Thai and this is a

301
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,839
huge event I can't believe they put it

302
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,320
on every year but they do uh in the

303
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,399
course of one week they had half a

304
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:23,440
million people come to the campus and uh

305
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,320
kind of visit around they just they grew

306
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,000
up this entire Garden within the course

307
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,839
of two or three months all sorts of

308
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,679
hanging vegetables and different herbs

309
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,399
trying to kind of use things that we

310
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,319
think of as Edibles in a more ornamental

311
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,159
uh application which was really great

312
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,639
people were taking selfies all over the

313
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,919
place and you know wandering around I

314
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,000
mean it was but it was a great

315
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:44,319
experience you know for people who

316
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,519
wouldn't get to grow the plants

317
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,240
otherwise uh they also sold seeds of

318
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,360
some of the varieties they developed and

319
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,919
they also have a pure seed initiative to

320
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,480
try to kind of make sure the farmers

321
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:56,958
have access to good quality seeds uh

322
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,039
while I was there I my big thing was

323
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:01,879
brewing tea they wanted to introduce

324
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:05,240
people people to um kind of native Thai

325
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:08,919
herbal mixtures I prepared one from

326
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:13,120
thundia Laura Folia which is used as an

327
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:14,958
ornamental but it also is um used as a

328
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,039
detox not in the kind of way that we

329
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:20,239
talk about detoxing here in the US this

330
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:23,439
is actually like a detox it uh can be

331
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,680
used analogously with activated charcoal

332
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,199
like they say if you're drinking it

333
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:28,559
don't take medicine because it'll absorb

334
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:30,838
the medicine um but there's also been

335
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,638
some really good scientific studies on

336
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:35,880
uh delaying of diabetes symptoms and

337
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:37,959
improving liver function which diabetes

338
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:40,120
is a huge problem in Thailand so it was

339
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:42,719
interesting chatting with folks about it

340
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,919
uh we also uh sweetened it with stevia

341
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,240
Stevia is not a native Thai herb so

342
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:48,039
there was a lot of interest in that we

343
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,198
sold out of our seia plants within the

344
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:51,838
first day or two because of it you know

345
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:55,078
but it was a really kind of interesting

346
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,360
way of interacting with people um and I

347
00:12:55,078 --> 00:13:02,000
also run into several Cornell lungs this

348
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:05,039
is a prid and r Tang uh who uh pres did

349
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,519
his uh Masters in entomology here Rua

350
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:10,278
did her PhD in horiculture a few years

351
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,799
back and then that's T habanada who I

352
00:13:10,278 --> 00:13:13,439
never actually met when he was at

353
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:17,319
Cornell but he was apparently in plant

354
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,240
freeding um so uh he's a professor at

355
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:23,160
casseta camping and so that was fun

356
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,759
chatting with him too uh the I mean the

357
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:26,399
fair takes over the entire campus I

358
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:28,600
could give a whole presentation just on

359
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,039
it but I tried to encapsulate some of

360
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,879
the more interesting things uh they have

361
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:35,958
a huge Orchid show as part of it and you

362
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,360
know I'm used to Orchid shows in the US

363
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:39,119
but when you can grow them in the

364
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,519
tropics and you have the ideal weather

365
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,240
for it I mean the scale just becomes

366
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,360
amazing you know an idium tunnel mokara

367
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,959
tunnel you know and then all of these

368
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,480
incredible installations this was about

369
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:54,599
maybe a fifth of the whole uh setup that

370
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,360
they had there and then they also have

371
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,440
some more traditional judging things and

372
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,320
they had orchids for sale uh that was

373
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,320
the other thing price-wise you can buy

374
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,160
what would be a $40 vand Orchid for

375
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,959
about six bucks there or a collector

376
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:10,759
nepenthes these are some of the rarer

377
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:12,879
ones they had a rare species was $6 um

378
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:16,480
compared to what you'd pay in the US of

379
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:19,439
like $60 $70 they had airplants for 30

380
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,759
cents uh lest you think it's all plants

381
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,800
they also had animals this was uh from

382
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,800
their uh cattle breeding program they're

383
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:29,278
doing a lot of work trying to integress

384
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:31,559
uh good genetics into the uh landas VAR

385
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,439
in Thailand and they also did some work

386
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:35,159
with chickens which I don't know a lot

387
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,680
about but I know my adviser is a big

388
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:40,958
chicken fan so I thought I'd throw the

389
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:44,239
slide in um after I finished there I

390
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:47,278
moved on to chaii Chai is a Thai owned

391
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,240
and run company uh based that has kind

392
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,879
of expanded to have a market throughout

393
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,839
most of uh Southeast and South Asia they

394
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:56,039
have huge Market penetration within

395
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,320
India and in Bangladesh and they work on

396
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:00,240
a really wide range of crops looking at

397
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,399
this I'm realizing I left off two or

398
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,079
three in addition to these they do

399
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,480
research but they also do production

400
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:08,399
they do seed and they've also started

401
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,839
branching out into agrochemicals because

402
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,440
you know it's the way that most

403
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,000
companies seem to go uh I'm not going to

404
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,120
go into too much detail because it's a

405
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,440
seed company and you know proprietary

406
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,320
and all of that uh but I did take a few

407
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,600
photos while I was there and uh this was

408
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,920
actually the Cucumber one of three

409
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,240
cucumber breeders there uh we went out

410
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,159
and met with some Farmers who'd been

411
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,759
growing bitter melon varieties and were

412
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:33,600
interested in trying some other

413
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:35,079
varieties from the company uh so we kind

414
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,839
of gave them seeds talked with them

415
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:38,599
about their growing conditions it was

416
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:40,839
really neat you know they they're a

417
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,240
household name within most of Thailand

418
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,120
but they're not really well known

419
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,440
outside of Thailand yet and that's

420
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,560
partially a branding thing so it's been

421
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,560
it was a really interesting

422
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,920
experience they have an alliance with

423
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:56,559
takai but I don't I don't know the

424
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:58,399
details of it so you know I got little

425
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:01,799
hints and bits here and there but you

426
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,318
know very hashash and all that so uh

427
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:06,359
they have two main stations within

428
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:08,278
Thailand this is gapu where I was for

429
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,759
most of the time this is Western

430
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:12,360
Thailand and I think most people from

431
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:14,720
the US may have heard of bridge over the

432
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,318
river Quay or qu I forget how we

433
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,120
pronounce it here um but that's kind of

434
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:21,759
what the area is known for it's one of

435
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,360
the hottest driest areas in Thailand and

436
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,159
I was there during the hottest and drest

437
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,480
time um but it's it's a nice area very

438
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,439
picturesque lots of you know buts and

439
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,039
platea and all of that which is really

440
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,319
pretty uh it's also a tourist area

441
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,919
there's not much there besides tourism

442
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:39,519
and large expanses of kind of

443
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:41,599
unpopulated areas uh but they've managed

444
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,639
to make melons into a kind of major crop

445
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,920
within the area everyone I talked to in

446
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:46,799
Thailand before I started this

447
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:48,719
internship said you have to try the

448
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:50,359
melons in Gin operi they're so good

449
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,440
they're really famous and they're really

450
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,000
delicious but they've sort of created

451
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,199
the market for them within the company

452
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,240
uh this was they have a small sales area

453
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:01,318
at the research station to kind of you

454
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,198
know build on that and they have things

455
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:04,959
like you know melon chairs to kind of

456
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:06,038
keep people interested they're really

457
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,959
uncomfortable because they're made of

458
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:12,078
concrete but you know people love taking

459
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:14,439
photos with them um and the if you drive

460
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:16,519
back from gantu to Bangkok you'll see

461
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:18,839
melon stalls all along the road the

462
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:20,720
entire way back because you know it's

463
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:22,438
become such a huge part of the

464
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,838
reputation of the

465
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:27,319
area uh their other research station is

466
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:31,319
up in changmai changmai is much cooler

467
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:33,159
than gurri or most of Thailand um it's

468
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:35,200
used to be a separate Kingdom so it also

469
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,440
has a different culture and slightly

470
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,880
different dialect because of that uh you

471
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,840
can grow a lot of crops up there that

472
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,000
you can't grow in most of uh Thailand uh

473
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,399
things like strawberries uh this is I

474
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,558
took a photo of this because instead of

475
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,320
using black plastic mulch they use Leaf

476
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:51,639
debris and put it down individually so

477
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,960
it's kind of a you know more

478
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,840
eco-friendly form uh I got to explore

479
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,640
the town it's becoming a huge tourist

480
00:17:56,839 --> 00:18:00,240
trap there's been a lot of movies coming

481
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,200
out about it and so people are kind of

482
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,120
flocking there by the dozens but it's uh

483
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,679
still has an incredible flower market

484
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,879
where I got to see kind of what's hot

485
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:12,200
and what's not and then this was also uh

486
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,799
these are the native are the kind of

487
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,080
traditional thae arrangements of flowers

488
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:19,158
kind of garlands that are placed on

489
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:22,319
altars or hung from your rear windshield

490
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:23,720
uh uh mirror if you're more modern uh

491
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,399
but you know seeing different kind of

492
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,919
combinations of flowers which is really

493
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:32,080
fun I did oh um and I was also visited

494
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:35,038
by some folks from Cornell but I'll skip

495
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:38,079
about that uh after I finished with chai

496
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:40,119
I moved down to Southern Thailand To Hai

497
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:43,599
which is in sanla so it's like right

498
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:46,000
above Malaysia it's like yeah um Hai has

499
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:48,279
sort of a bad reputation unfortunately

500
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,279
with most of the world there was a

501
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:52,158
bombing there a few years ago and most

502
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:53,918
of the Thai people I told I was going

503
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:55,600
there had never been there and joked

504
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,120
about you know dodging bullets and

505
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:00,279
things like that I didn't see a single

506
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:01,959
gun you entire time I was there and you

507
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:05,720
know which is very different from the US

508
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:07,240
in some ways um and I also thought felt

509
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,839
incredibly safe it's a really

510
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,519
interesting area because it's near what

511
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:12,759
used to be a port town and so it has a

512
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:15,440
lot of cultural exchange a lot of ethnic

513
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:18,319
Chinese that came in about 100 years ago

514
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,558
so and also it was also a separate

515
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:22,079
Kingdom and so there's a lot of

516
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:24,000
interface with a local uh Muslim

517
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,359
Community that had been part of that

518
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,359
Kingdom as well so it's really well

519
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:30,439
known for uh good food culture and other

520
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:33,079
things uh this is the professor I worked

521
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:36,519
with aan

522
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:39,319
p uh he's a really wellknown within phac

523
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:41,639
cognacy pharmacognosy is the study of

524
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:43,439
making medicine from plants which I'd

525
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,240
never heard of before I came there but

526
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,840
it's a huge field uh he had grad

527
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,679
students from all over the world uh and

528
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,439
ongoing exchanges with even more

529
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,600
countries he spent a month in Hawaii

530
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,200
while I was there uh doing some other

531
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:56,719
research and so it was a really

532
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,279
interesting insight into kind of

533
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,919
academic culture uh

534
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,599
they do a lot of extractions of

535
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:05,080
marigolds and ginger and other things

536
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,319
trying to isolate out different

537
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:09,839
compounds and then testing on sometimes

538
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:12,558
animal models sometimes cell models so

539
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:14,678
you know it was just a really different

540
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:17,639
experience than what I'm used to I also

541
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:21,120
ran into adir Rong who did his uh PhD

542
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:24,200
here a few years back uh and graduated

543
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:27,199
uh in horiculture as well he's now a

544
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,440
professor uh doing a lot of the farm

545
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,519
program there all of the undergrads Who

546
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,440
start in agriculture or anything related

547
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:35,440
to that are required to spend their

548
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,080
first semester working on the student

549
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,000
run Farm uh and they grow uh all of

550
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:42,199
these different vegetables and it's

551
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,839
really fun you know some of them have no

552
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,440
background in it so you see them taking

553
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,678
selfies you know as the Cabbage gets

554
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,960
larger and larger and then they take it

555
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,200
you know to Market and they sitting

556
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,919
there trying to sell you on their

557
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,440
cabbage it's a it was a really cool

558
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,600
experience you know getting to see them

559
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,480
and he was kind of intrinsically

560
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:03,519
involved in that

561
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:05,480
uh oh the area is really nice as I

562
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:07,480
mentioned it's sort of near the sea so

563
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,960
there's a lot of like uh beaches and

564
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,798
other things this is one of the

565
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,120
emblematic things it's a mermaid kind of

566
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:15,440
like the one in Copenhagen uh and then a

567
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:18,158
Naga statue which is uh one of the

568
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,679
mythical creatures in Thailand uh I also

569
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,520
got to explore some of the wetlands

570
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,400
nearby which was really neat I didn't

571
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:26,839
know Thailand had Wetlands uh but I went

572
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,000
to one of the bio preserves and they one

573
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:31,000
of the things they had in uh kind of

574
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,440
payment for us getting a tour was they

575
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,119
asked us to replant a field of palm

576
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,000
trees the oldfashioned way using a stick

577
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:39,558
so all of the students you know these

578
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,880
were Pharmacy students with no

579
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:42,319
background in agriculture at all so

580
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,960
everyone was really excited to sit there

581
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,558
and pound the stick into the ground put

582
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,840
in the palm trees you know which was

583
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:51,720
really great uh I went there with a few

584
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:55,759
uh this is a postto from India Ahmad and

585
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:58,278
fan uh grad student from Pakistan and we

586
00:21:55,759 --> 00:22:00,480
also got to try uh pure Palm juice while

587
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:02,720
we were there where they cut off the tip

588
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,960
of the male and fluoresence of the Palm

589
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,919
collect the sap and then you drink it uh

590
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,720
they also had Palm moonshine which they

591
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:11,080
were Muslims so they didn't try and I

592
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,839
took their share instead it was

593
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:15,439
incredibly potent but very interesting

594
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:18,439
you know I could see it catching on here

595
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,840
um my research work there was doing Leaf

596
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,240
resin extraction uh the idea that I'd

597
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:27,720
pitched to aan park was looking at

598
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,720
impatients uh for different compounds

599
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,159
specifically nether Quinones in patients

600
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,159
produce chemicals very similar to the

601
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:35,480
ones in Henna so they can be used for

602
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:37,919
dying but they also have methylated

603
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,640
forms and other forms that aren't found

604
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,120
uh within loone which is the uh plant

605
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,679
that hna is extracted from so we were

606
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:47,359
looking at them and trying to see what

607
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:49,360
we could kind of do with that uh this is

608
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:51,399
the dried leaves this is of the henna

609
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:53,519
tree they had one growing there ground

610
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,440
up and then extracting in methanol

611
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,519
evaporating it and then running thin

612
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,360
layer chromatography it was a whole new

613
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:01,158
experience for me you know as many of

614
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,479
you know I'm much more of a whole plant

615
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:06,240
person so this was kind of a fun

616
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:09,720
addition we had a hard time with the

617
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,798
process we ran both hlc and TLC and we

618
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,919
would get conflicting results about you

619
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:16,000
know we would find henna compounds and

620
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,080
impatients but not in the henna so you

621
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,400
know it was like there's still some

622
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:20,839
stuff that we're kind of sorting out but

623
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,880
we're talking about maybe doing that

624
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:24,278
down the road uh we did find a whole

625
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,278
bunch of compounds that hadn't been

626
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:27,919
described though so it's some really

627
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:29,759
interesting work for the future and it

628
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,480
could also be addressed for conservation

629
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:37,798
work for some of the Native invent

630
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:39,720
species um ah uh I took quite a few side

631
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:42,240
trips while I was there as I mentioned

632
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,640
uh these were mostly around Bangkok one

633
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,200
of the things you know since this is

634
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,200
mostly a plant crowd that I wanted to

635
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,319
point out is Bangkok You know despite

636
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,759
being pretty Metropolitan and developed

637
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:53,278
has really made an effort to create

638
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:57,000
green spaces this is outside one of the

639
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:59,278
bougier malls uh in Bangkok and it has a

640
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,880
really nice planting of ground covers

641
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:04,200
grasses there's a green wall nearby and

642
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,440
this is the second floor of a metro stop

643
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,200
you know so they've really like tried

644
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,400
made an effort for that this is the

645
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,240
eighth floor of another Mall uh they've

646
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,679
built an entire outdoor garden with

647
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,200
waterfalls and all sorts of other plants

648
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:17,880
so it was really kind of neat seeing how

649
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,480
they kind of push the green into an

650
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,600
urban landscape uh I took some

651
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,240
obligatory Temple shots I'm not really a

652
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:26,719
religious person but I mean they're

653
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,558
pretty great ornate uh this was a

654
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,759
Chinese temple that was in the middle of

655
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:34,480
one of the Thai temples huge Buddhas you

656
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,519
know like two or three stories tall

657
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,038
again you know I don't I have other

658
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:40,639
photos of them but it was a really

659
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:42,079
interesting cultural experience for that

660
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,360
uh one of the side trips I took in

661
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:46,240
changma was to the queen syit botanic

662
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:48,879
garden if you have a chance it's an

663
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:52,480
incredible Garden to visit uh I met went

664
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,399
there mostly because exan is the uh one

665
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,038
of the world Authorities on impatience

666
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:59,359
he's done a ton of research work he's

667
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,000
named countless species

668
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,119
um and he runs a lot of their research

669
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,480
program uh the garden itself is really

670
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,038
interesting they have a canopy walk and

671
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,640
like I said changa is a slightly

672
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:10,679
different climate so you get to see kind

673
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,440
of a whole different range of plants

674
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:14,360
they had a Rose Garden which is not what

675
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,038
I expected to see in Thailand but they

676
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:18,558
have cultivars that are really well

677
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:20,839
adapted to the climate there and tons of

678
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:23,480
people taking selfies with them and then

679
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:25,720
a lot of other plants as well uh bermad

680
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,399
house and a terrestrial Orchid breeding

681
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,000
program which I thought was really neat

682
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:30,639
you hear a lot of work

683
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,640
going on in Thailand about dendrobium

684
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,120
orchids and band orchids but they've

685
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,000
done a lot of work with this is kthy and

686
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:40,119
also FAS so it's something that you know

687
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,558
I think is kind of on the cusp EK was

688
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:43,359
sort of complaining though that he wants

689
00:25:41,558 --> 00:25:45,200
to push impatience but he said orchids

690
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:47,079
are always considered so much sexier so

691
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,919
they get all the funding money you know

692
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:51,960
so hopefully that'll change in the

693
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:54,320
future uh I did find a ton of different

694
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,159
impatient species this was everything

695
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,599
that was well a small selection of what

696
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,240
was in flower at the time they have just

697
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:03,359
an incredible variety of them that e and

698
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,599
other researchers have collected from

699
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,199
different parts of Thailand in the

700
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:10,158
surrounding area this is a kingdong w

701
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,960
from me Myanmar uh it's kogus the

702
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:15,240
flowers is never fully open uh other

703
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,240
species you know again all of these just

704
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:20,880
growing within the area uh ones that

705
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,480
form cxes so kind of Woody sort of bulul

706
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,919
type things at the base of the plant to

707
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,599
kind of hang on through drought regions

708
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:27,960
there was one that was neon blue that

709
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:30,519
unfortunately wasn't in flower but they

710
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,840
had photos of um and they said one of

711
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:32,918
the hard things from a conservation

712
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:34,798
point of view is they don't have the

713
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:36,640
funding to really keep the accessions

714
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:38,759
going so it's just kind of whatever

715
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,880
grows kind of keeps growing and they

716
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:43,599
keep hoping it'll you know persist uh

717
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,559
we're in talks right now with the New

718
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,319
York botanic garden and striving uh

719
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:48,879
banic Garden in San Francisco to see if

720
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:51,158
we can get some conservation work going

721
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,720
on with these maybe some breeding work

722
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:55,600
but uh we'll see so it was just an

723
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,679
incredible experience from that point of

724
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:03,199
view too I took a side trip to Taiwan on

725
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:05,840
because my Visa ran out um and uh met up

726
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,360
with a a jaria breeder who I knew from

727
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:11,038
the US uh wwang Linn he's now working at

728
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:13,038
Bayer out in Nebraska but he kind of

729
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:14,960
showed me around I'd never been to

730
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:16,798
Taiwan and so I was amazed again you

731
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,759
know a lot of use of Green Space there

732
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:21,158
this is a park that's I think two years

733
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:24,240
old they've completely turned over what

734
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:25,679
was a slum before uh they we took a bike

735
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,839
trip through the middle of town they've

736
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,399
really worked on kind of building up

737
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:31,158
green spaces we hi to the top of the

738
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:32,519
mountain uh unfortunately it was near

739
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:33,919
the beginning of Chinese New Year so

740
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:35,759
everyone was hiking to the top of the

741
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,200
mountain but it was a really great

742
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:40,640
experience you know and really again you

743
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,840
know it's an interesting intersection

744
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,159
between Chinese culture and tropical

745
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:48,519
climate so orchids being utilized in

746
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:51,080
different ways uh really like

747
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:53,038
neat uh I also went to Malaysia because

748
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:55,519
it was a really quick hop from Southern

749
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:58,240
Thailand to Malaysia and met up with two

750
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:01,159
Cornell lanss from food science Adi

751
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,240
sikin and tjuan uh they're both

752
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:05,960
professors in food science now uh I'll

753
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,359
get into some of the botanical gardens

754
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,038
there although again you know I could go

755
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:13,918
on and on and on about that uh but uh

756
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:15,519
tangu works at a uh University next to

757
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,159
the ocean so I went and visited him

758
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,558
there explored the plant life and some

759
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:21,880
of the beaches a little bit uh but also

760
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:23,440
went around downtown gual lumur and

761
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,320
again I was surprised at some of the use

762
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,919
of plants there these are irises and

763
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:30,158
ornamental grasses that they keep alive

764
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,519
through throughout the year inside uh

765
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,000
they weren't In Bloom at this time but

766
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,159
I'm told they're really spectacular when

767
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,880
they do Bloom and throughout the entire

768
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:39,760
inside of a

769
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,880
mall uh the as I mentioned there's two

770
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,798
main Botanic Gardens that I visited uh

771
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,720
one inside gual lumur and one about an

772
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:48,639
hour South near one of the research

773
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,880
stations uh orchids are becoming a

774
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,038
really big thing in Malaysia there's

775
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,519
been a push to compete with the

776
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:56,398
Singaporean Market uh and Arandas which

777
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:59,440
are descended from this one this is a

778
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:01,839
arachnus uh spe species have become kind

779
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,679
of the go-to unfortunately while I was

780
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:06,119
there there was some construction going

781
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,159
on but they kind of had a nice Twist on

782
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:10,199
it and paid artists to create these

783
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,399
murals on the areas that were under

784
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,000
construction kind of like when the

785
00:29:11,398 --> 00:29:16,000
commons was under construction they did

786
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,398
the same thing um but it was really nice

787
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,319
the things that were in flower were

788
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:21,518
really great and they had heliconia

789
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:23,678
species I'd never seen before at a

790
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:26,079
putraa uh both of them were more kind of

791
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,679
walking gardens than anything else one

792
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:29,798
thing I did see and I haven't seen this

793
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,440
as much in US Botanic Gardens is they

794
00:29:29,798 --> 00:29:34,119
had a whole chart on how to read a plant

795
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,320
label which I think is something that

796
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:38,759
gets overlooked a lot but was really

797
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:40,278
nice and it's in English and Malay so

798
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:41,759
you know I saw a lot of people stopping

799
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,319
and looking at this they had this at the

800
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:45,519
different entrances so it really kind of

801
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:46,759
enhanced the uh experience for people

802
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:49,278
who are

803
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:51,480
visiting um I'll finish up here with

804
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:53,159
Singapore um for those of you who don't

805
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,360
know Singapore is this Teensy Little

806
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:58,200
Island right off the end of Malaysia

807
00:29:55,359 --> 00:30:00,479
it's essentially a city state um and

808
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,880
it's one of the economic powerhouses of

809
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,000
Southeast Asia uh they've also managed

810
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:09,120
to maintain a pretty green presence

811
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,079
despite being a citystate this is one of

812
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:14,038
about five or six Gardens I saw in their

813
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:15,839
airport uh that they've uh they even

814
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:18,119
have a dendrobium orid that they've

815
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:21,319
named after the airport it's really you

816
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:23,398
know devotion um they have like uh

817
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:25,319
artist stations outside these to like

818
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:27,759
teach kids how to draw flowers things

819
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:30,480
like that really neat ways of engaging

820
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:32,200
uh with the public and Singapore is also

821
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,240
the only country in the world that has a

822
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:38,278
hybrid as their national flower which is

823
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,519
Papo Lan uh uh missim I think it used to

824
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:41,038
be called Vanda it's one of the

825
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:43,440
vandaceous

826
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:45,919
types uh I went to Singapore botanic

827
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,798
garden and it is spectacular it's been

828
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,440
around since the 1800s it's really well

829
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:52,679
established they have an orchid breeding

830
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,038
program that's I think at least 5050

831
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:56,720
years old if not older than that uh

832
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:59,158
they've registered thousands of orchid

833
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,679
hybrids uh maintain one of the few

834
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:04,880
chunks of native rainforest within

835
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:07,159
Singapore which was just spectacular and

836
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,679
have a lot of theme Gardens I I was

837
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:09,720
captivated by the evolution Garden

838
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:12,559
because I thought that would probably

839
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,360
lead to all sorts of outcry in the US uh

840
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:16,918
but it seemed to be a really well done

841
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:18,599
Garden there uh it's even this tree is

842
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:20,600
featured on the back of some Singaporean

843
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:22,480
currency so it's really integral to

844
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:24,398
Singaporean culture they also had a

845
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,960
banana and ginger Garden I'd never seen

846
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:27,599
a banana like this before and was just

847
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,919
so excited you know I think we should

848
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:32,879
have these all over the place and then

849
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,679
uh uh Orchid fountains as well one thing

850
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,799
that I did find really interesting but I

851
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:38,480
thought was kind of odd is they had

852
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:40,398
suggestions about oh this plant would be

853
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,038
great for home landscaping or oh this

854
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,558
plant you know could be used in this

855
00:31:42,038 --> 00:31:46,919
sort of arrangement but Singapore

856
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:49,079
there's almost no Garden space because

857
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:50,759
it's mostly in apartments so I thought

858
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:52,398
it was a great effort you know I think

859
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:54,919
that would be something maybe areas with

860
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:58,239
more uh of a kind of footprint for the

861
00:31:54,919 --> 00:32:00,600
housing would could really appreciate

862
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,359
uh I also went to Gardens by the bay

863
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:04,480
which is the other botanic garden there

864
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:07,079
uh full disclosure I just accepted a job

865
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,720
with them so I'll try not to like Wax

866
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:13,240
too like eloquent about it uh but they

867
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,960
are unique uh in that they're one of the

868
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,440
few Gardens that has a conservatory

869
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,200
that's cooled uh Singapore is right on

870
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,240
the Equator so they cool both of the

871
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,240
conservatories to grow temperate type

872
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:26,960
plants so that people in the tropics can

873
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,480
see them um they're they like to kind of

874
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,399
build themselves as kind of creating a

875
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,319
sort of Central Park Vibe they're in the

876
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:34,798
center of what will be the downtown

877
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:37,000
business district and they're expanding

878
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:38,038
they own several properties as well uh

879
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,919
there's a lot of really neat

880
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:41,558
architectural features like these are

881
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,600
they call the super trees which are

882
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:46,119
obviously not trees but they've put in a

883
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:47,959
lot of uh epiic plants to kind of create

884
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:49,798
that same sort of feeling and they have

885
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,200
a lot of uh crosswalks at different

886
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:54,558
levels to see different things too which

887
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,480
I thought was really neat uh one of the

888
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:58,638
conservatories is called the flower Dome

889
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,960
it has kind of seasonal changes

890
00:32:58,638 --> 00:33:03,959
exhibits the funding is amazing and so

891
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:07,240
they bring in you know huge amounts of

892
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:09,319
tulips uh huge amounts of dalas from all

893
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,278
over the world uh I was there the first

894
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:13,240
time I think was around the Chinese New

895
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:15,038
Year celebration and they had just a

896
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:18,000
huge field of doia in the middle of the

897
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:20,720
Dome the second time was tulip Mania and

898
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,038
they had tulips all over the place um

899
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,839
selfie stations Garden is geared more

900
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:26,599
towards people who don't have a

901
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:28,599
background in horiculture and they're

902
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:30,119
trying to kind of bring people in so you

903
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:31,519
know it wasn't like some of the other

904
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:33,558
banic Gardens I've been to where it's

905
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,399
very kind of much more about like oh

906
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:37,398
this is a Botanical gem it was there was

907
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:39,119
a lot more spectacle but kind of trying

908
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:40,959
to attract people with that and then

909
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:44,599
kind of teach them whether they liked it

910
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,558
or not kind of thing so um they also had

911
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:48,480
brought in five full-size palm trees

912
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:50,480
from Chile several Thousand-Year old

913
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,599
olive trees from Spain I mean it's a

914
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,480
really incredible undertaking and the

915
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:58,480
garden's only 3 years old uh last year I

916
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:01,839
think they said they had over 8 million

917
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,639
visitors uh so it's really taken off uh

918
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:05,918
the other Dome is a cloud forest that

919
00:34:03,638 --> 00:34:08,358
they've built inside uh it has sepal

920
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,480
waterfalls and then also walks going

921
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:14,159
around different parts of it it's I

922
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,320
think seven stories tall um and mostly

923
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,639
focuses on epiy and other things like

924
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,480
that but I found an impatient species

925
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,519
and was really excited in the middle of

926
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,960
one of the ponds though and so I kept

927
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:26,280
leaning over trying to get a better and

928
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,398
better photo and finally managed to get

929
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,800
pulled back before I fell in

930
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:31,598
uh but it was right in the middle of the

931
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,240
carnivorous plant area which I thought

932
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,240
was really neat too and they again they

933
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:36,678
try to get people engaged they have a

934
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,398
whole display of stalactites and

935
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:40,320
stalagmites that they've imported and

936
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:42,519
geodes to kind of you know add to kind

937
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,320
of the feel to it but people seem to

938
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:47,079
really appreciate it uh the outside

939
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,359
Gardens are really nice as well there's

940
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:52,280
a lot of water features because it is by

941
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:54,239
the bay um and it's it used to be

942
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,119
brackish water it's now mostly fresh

943
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,279
water uh and then it's also become a

944
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,640
very popular

945
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,880
spot for uh Sportsmen so a as I

946
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:04,920
mentioned they're kind of creating a

947
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,280
Central Park Vibe so a lot of joggers go

948
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,519
through and if you get there at around

949
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,480
6:00 in the evening when the work day

950
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:12,400
ends you'll get like almost a traffic

951
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,559
jam of joggers kind of jogging through

952
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,240
here uh it's gotten to the point they

953
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:19,559
now actually have host a marathon to

954
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:21,118
kind of Channel some of that I think uh

955
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:23,440
they have different restaurants around

956
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,880
the area as well to kind of accommodate

957
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,838
it but I think it's kind of a sneaky way

958
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,920
to introduce people to plants too you

959
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:29,838
know you get to see things they're

960
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,680
flowering at the same

961
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:36,078
time uh with that um I'll just finish up

962
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:38,399
a few people had asked me about tips for

963
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,880
uh applying for the Dreer and so I

964
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,559
thought I'd just mention a few things um

965
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,599
if any of you are interested in applying

966
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:47,599
uh one of the things I think that really

967
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,359
is important is having a focused theme

968
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,800
or plan for your proposal you know I've

969
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:52,440
heard several times and I think the

970
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,599
committee told me as well you know

971
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,358
making sure that you can really

972
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:57,880
definitively say something rather than I

973
00:35:56,358 --> 00:35:59,279
want to go to Thailand you know know

974
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:03,000
just kind of like saying okay this is

975
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,760
what you're focusing on uh I personally

976
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,199
I think outlining your internship with

977
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,960
the folks at the place would be really

978
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:10,159
good I speak from kind of my own

979
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,559
personal experience here where uh I

980
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:13,199
didn't outline some of the things and it

981
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:15,199
was like oh you want to do that well the

982
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,719
person who would do that is out of town

983
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:19,279
so kind of making sure that everything's

984
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:21,000
kind of planned out before you go uh

985
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,560
figure out your visas early on so you're

986
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,599
not leaving the country every month

987
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:28,039
trying to renew it like I did for the

988
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:30,599
last four months um but if not use as an

989
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:32,800
excuse to travel uh write your reports

990
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,880
well in advance that's just something I

991
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:38,800
struggle with uh and take lots of Sid

992
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,640
trips uh I kind of felt conflicted

993
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,359
sometimes about like oh I'm in here I

994
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:43,920
should be doing more of this and more of

995
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:45,598
that but I also would say you know it's

996
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,838
important to take some time off to you

997
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,160
know there were times where you just

998
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:49,920
kind of sit in a coffee shop and

999
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:51,480
appreciate the fact that you are where

1000
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,720

1001
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,358

1002
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:57,199
