1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,690
I'm really delighted to be here today

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,519
this first slide just shows a few go the

5
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:16,769
Garden staff that we have it's a very

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,509
small staff so I was explaining for this

7
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:20,399
morning that there's one gardener for

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,039
vegetables one for flowers one for

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:25,348
native plants and one for fruit so and

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,509
we have a few helpers that two people in

11
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:31,649
the center where helpers um until

12
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:34,950
recently so we try to make this go

13
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:36,210
forward okay so you might wonder what a

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,960
gardener thinks about when they're

15
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,030
gardening

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,250
every day eight hours a day and so I got

17
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,640
thinking about how Jefferson's plants

18
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:48,210
really kind of fuse three three or more

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,549
different climatic areas and he kind of

20
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,730
brings them to the kitchen and become

21
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:55,468
the origin of southern foodways more or

22
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:57,628
less is starting at Monticello as well

23
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:02,250
as other places so that's the topic of

24
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:05,308
my talk today haven't been to Monticello

25
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,560
the garden is a thousand feet long and

26
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:10,280
it's on its own Terrace the main house

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:15,450
you can see up is uphill and then

28
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:18,329
Jefferson in 1806 started having us

29
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,969
seven slaves to dig out the mountainside

30
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:24,438
to make this beautiful Terrace for the

31
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:27,030
garden it's about two acres long and

32
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:30,209
it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site the

33
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,978
whole place because of so many so many

34
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:34,438
activities that Jefferson was involved

35
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:36,959
in and it's a real hub for for new

36
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:38,969
thought and enlightenment era so here's

37
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,429
the the garden when you are descending

38
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:43,978
the steps you can see the terrace

39
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,380
this is a West this is when the Sun is

40
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:49,170
sinking in the West it's actually a very

41
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:52,379
south-facing garden and it has this bank

42
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:55,829
that is acts as a thermal mass the

43
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:58,530
design of the garden is in squares the

44
00:01:55,828 --> 00:02:01,379
squares have grass paths between so that

45
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,450
you can access the garden when it rains

46
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:06,030
because it's clay soil that gets really

47
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:10,439
compacted we have 98 percent compaction

48
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:12,030
after construction so and the dimensions

49
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,530
are exactly what Jefferson had and my

50
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,990
goal is to grow all the plans that

51
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,819
Jefferson had as well if I can determine

52
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,500
what they are so this is our putting

53
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,979
this because we did have archeology in

54
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,408
the garden

55
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:24,598
on the bank at one point and up in the

56
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:26,908
upper left you can see that image is

57
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:30,658
sketch that Jefferson made of the Garden

58
00:02:26,908 --> 00:02:33,149
Bank in steps so that you'd have these

59
00:02:30,658 --> 00:02:35,280
thorny bushes placed along the bank I

60
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,620
think maybe to stop erosion or animals

61
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,989
he calls it the auditory and that's a

62
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,569
fascinating word because all our ACA is

63
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:44,519
in are so many botanical names and it

64
00:02:42,568 --> 00:02:46,348
means it comes from the from the kitchen

65
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,150
garden from the veg it's a vegetable if

66
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:51,030
you ever see a fish analysis on the name

67
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:54,120
it's more or less a medicinal plant so

68
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,519
and that it comes from that Latin word

69
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,769
which means pot herb or vegetable so

70
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:02,039
Devon Floyd is standing there next to

71
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:03,629
this clay bank and you can see that he

72
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,120
actually when they go back to the

73
00:03:03,628 --> 00:03:07,590
original soil in the bank they can find

74
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,400
these steps that were designed by

75
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,900
Jefferson and that rock conglomeration

76
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,810
there that is actually at the base and

77
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,150
it seems like maybe in Jefferson's day

78
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,250
there really was erosion this is not a

79
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,230
faced stone wall this is just stacked in

80
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,780
there kind of like let's get this thing

81
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:27,090
from stopped from collapsing and if you

82
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:30,090
if I go back you can see it's a 45

83
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,590
degree angle today and we Jefferson's

84
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,409
day it would have had an extra six feet

85
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,810
of garden space and the the wall is

86
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:39,359
actually 70 degrees it's almost vertical

87
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:43,019
so I would love to have that but it's

88
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:44,459
impractical and they've only excavated

89
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,650
this certain little area where they

90
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,359
intended to put pipes through the garden

91
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,560
they haven't done the rest of the with

92
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:52,379
the wall I really wanted them to find

93
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,519
glass I really wanted a you know cold

94
00:03:52,379 --> 00:04:00,090
frame but you didn't happen for me so so

95
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:02,280
Jefferson's garden this huge area it's

96
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,439
two acres was always intended as an

97
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,120
experimental laboratory and he's trying

98
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:08,039
on all kinds of plants everything he can

99
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,689
find if he hears anything in a newspaper

100
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,310
he writes a letter said send me that

101
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:13,289
cucumber send me that gourd I want to

102
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,810
try it here he wants to try and find

103
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:20,129
which two are the best in to grow in

104
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:22,680
Virginia and so he also of course takes

105
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:26,189
these things to the kitchen there's a

106
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,720
picture of the garden this spring I grow

107
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:29,788
a lot of tomatoes this year because

108
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,080
we're making a tomato jam but we grow

109
00:04:29,788 --> 00:04:33,449
them all up on poles so here and there

110
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:36,359
you'll see a little method

111
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:38,400
um one example is this Texas bird pepper

112
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,129
someone sends it to him from Texas and

113
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,588
so that's the only reason he has it is

114
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:45,809
somebody sent it and at the hot weather

115
00:04:43,588 --> 00:04:47,430
plant it's from and he says right there

116
00:04:45,809 --> 00:04:50,069
if it's hardy enough for our climate

117
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:52,709
then it'll live so he's thinking about

118
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:55,278
climate all of his his whole life so

119
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:58,649
this is a kind of choke pins really tiny

120
00:04:55,278 --> 00:05:01,709
so in his life in his lifetime he has a

121
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:04,769
huge list of things you'd see 48 kinds

122
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:07,168
of beans 15 kinds of broccoli so not all

123
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:08,848
of these are specifically identified as

124
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:11,579
varieties like we have today because

125
00:05:08,848 --> 00:05:13,168
they didn't have the technical mom clay

126
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:15,688
Chur in this day it was developing and

127
00:05:13,168 --> 00:05:17,188
he has things from friends or he's

128
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:20,939
calling something forward which might

129
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:22,468
mean it grows earlier or faster so I try

130
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:25,110
my best to figure out what all these

131
00:05:22,468 --> 00:05:27,509
things mean and then so far well this

132
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:30,149
year I had 230 vegetables and herbs and

133
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:33,569
last year I had like 250 years I'm kind

134
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:34,918
of a short year so you can see there

135
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:36,899
have some unusual things and at the end

136
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:41,758
I'll show you some plants with a little

137
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:43,680
plant quiz so in 1774 Hebrews 7 kinds of

138
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,120
pumpkins and if you have a garden how

139
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,180
many of you have ever owned seven kinds

140
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,639
of pumpkins like so he did have space

141
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,228
along the river to try these out so I'm

142
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,088
always looking for that black pumpkin

143
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:56,310
what could that be what is a black

144
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:58,139
pumpkin so we do have the sweet potato

145
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,449
pumpkin we can grow marina Dukey oh yeah

146
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:03,120
that's the zookie de Pescatore if you

147
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:05,459
read Italian books then it's that knobby

148
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,829
that that green worded and they are

149
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:09,749
still growing it and it's so cool to

150
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:12,899
find to really nail something down I

151
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:16,919
grow the white bow or pumpkin as azúcar

152
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:18,329
Bianchi because it's from the 1600s and

153
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,758
the Boers had great gardens in South

154
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:25,258
Africa and possibly you know he had it

155
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:27,538
so I kind of have these leaps faith so

156
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:30,240
Jefferson was keeping weatherdata his

157
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:31,860
whole his whole life and he came climate

158
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,329
is one of the sources of great essential

159
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,709
enjoyment I don't know how many of you

160
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:40,258
would agree with that statement but he

161
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:42,478
wants everybody to take whether he has

162
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:46,050
this idea that we need to gather this

163
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:47,039
and make up a nationwide index of

164
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,530
climate and so

165
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,270
every morning he rises and he takes the

166
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:53,369
temperature at 4:00 p.m. a takes the

167
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:54,629
temperature and he gathers this data for

168
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,490
his whole life you can see in

169
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:58,290
Philadelphia he's gathering it if he

170
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,980
leaves Virginia he asks somebody to take

171
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:05,430
they take the data for him and so here's

172
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:07,230
surance insurance of data and so he he

173
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,240
also wants the appearance of birds of

174
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:11,310
frost the bleeping out of trees all of

175
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,129
this phenological data which is so

176
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:15,930
important and so valuable to us and then

177
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:17,639
when Lewis and Clark goes west he wants

178
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:20,400
all of these data there not only are

179
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,319
they taking a boat West but they have to

180
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,019
observe temperature frost wind chime of

181
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,849
flowering plants and then when he goes

182
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:29,969
to Europe he has the Virginians back

183
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:32,610
home to keep the data some of them do I

184
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,890
think Madison does and then he has this

185
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,870
really cool thing but I recommend to a

186
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:39,269
lot of people who have new Gardens he

187
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:41,100
says take a thimble every Monday and

188
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:43,079
plant a thimble full of lettuce in your

189
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:46,770
garden and he says from February to

190
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:48,659
September and seat down below that is

191
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:50,579
and you go through the summer and so now

192
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,920
today we know lettuce will not germinate

193
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:55,349
at over 85 degrees in the ground it's

194
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:58,350
gonna be dormant but in his day they

195
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,760
didn't take soil temperature but you can

196
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,800
see that he's going to establish

197
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,810
spring planting times and fall planting

198
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,740
times just because of the failures and

199
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,839
if you look in the book and it says

200
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,540
fails to mature fails to come up I think

201
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:11,549
those are actually opportunities to

202
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,990
figure out what is going on and so I

203
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,460
never have considered Jefferson ever

204
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,590
really thinking he's failing in anything

205
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:19,199
it's like this didn't work why didn't it

206
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:21,060
work this is this is a leap into what I

207
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,949
can figure out how it's been how to make

208
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,329
it work for me and so he has this

209
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:27,000
gardening calendar and he could see a

210
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:29,099
February 1st he's putting out oh that

211
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,259
was very good stuff with cover 15 so the

212
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,570
peas lettuce finishing celery when he

213
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:35,129
starts out as a young man a 1767

214
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,960
planting his garden he's planting

215
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:39,360
lettuce in May and as soon as I saw that

216
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,610
I thought no that's wrong and so it may

217
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,009
is way too hot for lettuce by the time

218
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:46,019
he gets to this calendar which is 1824

219
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:47,669
he's figured out that he has a really

220
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:49,199
early planning date for these things or

221
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:51,889
it's going to be too hot and Virginia to

222
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,600
do it because he's coming from maybe his

223
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:56,639
ancestry is Scottish and it's like cold

224
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,430
weather plants he's got to figure out

225
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,289
with a climate for Virginia to do

226
00:08:58,429 --> 00:09:01,639
so this is really cool we follow we

227
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:04,250
follow this schedule if we don't have

228
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:05,899
peas in Lincoln's birthday we won't have

229
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:09,100
we won't have seeds so plants will

230
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:11,750
perish without producing seeds for us so

231
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,870
so then he always has the phenology of

232
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,399
things so serious this is for this is a

233
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,570
Rocky Mountains calendar but you can

234
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,500
actually make this with your own

235
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:24,080
calendar but we know when flea beetles

236
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,730
are that when the red buds are blooming

237
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,310
will have flea beetles in the garden

238
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:30,889
it's just synchronous so this is a

239
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:32,329
calendar from because it was convenient

240
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:34,460
to put in it's not really from Virginia

241
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:36,860
but you can make one of these yourself

242
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:39,740
if you keep data in a little notebook

243
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:42,320
and so he almost has the growing degree

244
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,430
Denny thing I think because he's got all

245
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,230
the data he's got the high and low

246
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:46,909
temperatures each day and growing degree

247
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,550
days when he added together and and

248
00:09:46,909 --> 00:09:51,399
divide it by two and so if a pea comes

249
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:52,579
up you start your growing degree day

250
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:55,279
calculations

251
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:57,770
I think it's 338 days you'd have two

252
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,720
leaves on the pea so I'm hoping one day

253
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:01,819
to go back through all those charts and

254
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,320
figure out his growing tree today's

255
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,629
versus our growing degree days would not

256
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,320
be terrific but he's almost got it he's

257
00:10:05,629 --> 00:10:09,789
almost there

258
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:13,160
it's really fascinating so here he is um

259
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:17,449
he also gets these foods from different

260
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:19,189
climates and so he's got of course the

261
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,740
enslaved or bringing foods from Africa

262
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:24,410
and West Indies he's got his own salad

263
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:26,690
bowl you know culture and he's got the

264
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:29,959
Native American foods that arrived with

265
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:32,890
the Lewis and Clark expedition this is

266
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:35,470
one of the examples of a cold weather

267
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:38,120
northern European kind of crop that's

268
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:39,710
really technical to grow because this is

269
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,560
sea kale how many of you know the sea

270
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:44,720
kale or you do cool well so it grows on

271
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,699
the beach and the culture back then was

272
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,170
like the beach would cover it with with

273
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,000
the gravel and you dig it out and it

274
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:53,179
would be light-colored well we have sea

275
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,860
kale pots you can see a pot nearby you

276
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:56,599
cover the plant when it's merging and

277
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,460
you get this beautiful yellow stalks

278
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,230
Jefferson in his day they would have

279
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:02,960
potted them up bringing them inside and

280
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:05,149
forced them all winter this is a this is

281
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,070
not an easy thing to grow this is not a

282
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:11,759
you know just throw the seeds in and

283
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:13,260
have a beter carrot so today we have

284
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,639
centers of origin and I was really

285
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:17,700
pleased to see that you have that kind

286
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,779
of demonstration at the plantations so

287
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,460
you have certain plants came from

288
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:23,610
certain climates and if you can figure

289
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,900
out where they're from then you can grow

290
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,610
them at the right time of year

291
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:28,470
especially in Virginia we have a like a

292
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,940
10 month growing season you can just

293
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,190
plug things in at the right time and

294
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,410
then will flourish so that's a really

295
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,880
cool thing so I've got this picture with

296
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:38,759
the castor beans because you can see

297
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:41,820
that they're from I think over there on

298
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:43,559
the African center of origin and there's

299
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,410
payments and Cotton's from South America

300
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:48,389
and over here yes flex and so forth from

301
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:50,429
there Eastern so there's no flex in this

302
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:51,179
picture but you this is a picture taking

303
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:53,969
like two days ago

304
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:58,439
in the garden we haven't had any frost

305
00:11:53,970 --> 00:12:01,529
yet so and here's again here's some

306
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,880
peppers from South America and said it's

307
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:05,970
arrived so we have a lot of North

308
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:20,939
American crops not many Chinese crops

309
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:22,800
for us yeah that's a great question

310
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,960
because actually the food that was on

311
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,699
the ships to feed them were their native

312
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,980
foods and that's how a lot of these

313
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:32,990
things came to us and I'll show you a

314
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:36,840
couple of those and in a second so

315
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:39,389
Jefferson went to Paris to be he had

316
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,740
various civic civic duties there but I

317
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:43,769
wanted to show you what Paris looked

318
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:46,080
like and this is 1792 all of the green

319
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:47,159
areas if you brew into Paris lately they

320
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,350
notice that those green areas are

321
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:54,179
probably not any green any longer but in

322
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:59,580
the corner is his over there this is his

323
00:12:54,179 --> 00:13:01,620
house this is his vegetable garden and

324
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,000
when I saw when I saw that image I

325
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,700
thought what was he growing in that

326
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,350
garden dad is enormous all the rest is

327
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,240
like pleasure gardens with trees and he

328
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,889
has its tables over there and then

329
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,320
everything around him is Gardens

330
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:16,230
so he really I think has a lot of

331
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,629
influence from his Paris is Paris

332
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:21,240
experience so this little list in the

333
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:23,039
book it was a letter Frances Epps was

334
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,039
his uh his relative ease since these

335
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,110
seeds back to bridge

336
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,480
from all these different things there's

337
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:31,190
like I think four kinds of cauliflower

338
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,409
like five kinds of peas you can see the

339
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:35,930
whole list and so that's fascinating to

340
00:13:33,409 --> 00:13:37,549
me I wanted to grow the Paris garden so

341
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:39,319
then the things that he's missing when

342
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:41,629
he's in Paris are the things at the

343
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,910
bottom of sweet potatoes and corn and

344
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:45,740
watermelons those things aren't impacted

345
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:48,289
so I thought that was fascinating that's

346
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:52,100
the real Virginian over there wishing he

347
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:55,069
had you know some hominy so I we did

348
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,870
grow a garden Paris in the 17 of the

349
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:59,629
1786 era and you can see we have some

350
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:01,759
cauliflowers cabbages this pea it was

351
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:03,828
really proud that to actually find this

352
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,559
pea he calls the Dourif grapey of

353
00:14:03,828 --> 00:14:08,419
holland for frames and we actually

354
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,219
through some research and look through

355
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:11,629
all these old books and it's actually

356
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,459
the de grâce sugar pea that you can get

357
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:16,039
from Baker Creek seeds and it grows

358
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:17,659
beautifully and so to me if I grow

359
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:19,429
something that I think is what he's

360
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:21,409
talking about and it grows wonderfully

361
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:23,870
and maybe if he's grown at a couple

362
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:25,759
years that must be it most likely is

363
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,709
what he had I don't think he keep

364
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,470
growing something that doesn't grow well

365
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:35,448
so anyway that's that's really a good

366
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:38,540
thrill and so does he so um he meets and

367
00:14:35,448 --> 00:14:40,969
ra2 in and they had the same basically

368
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:43,639
the same lifespan which is very

369
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:46,370
interesting he - in two years before

370
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:46,818
Jefferson and he had the Jardin des

371
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,799
Plantes

372
00:14:46,818 --> 00:14:51,500
which is called the Jardin du Roi about

373
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:54,379
them so they exchanged have a seen

374
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,778
exchange and andrea is sending up to 700

375
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:59,240
different seeds for things every year

376
00:14:56,778 --> 00:15:00,350
big box would come finally one year when

377
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,269
that box didn't come he said what

378
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:05,060
happened to Henry's box and he had died

379
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:06,919
so there was said but they had a huge

380
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:10,518
exchange and Jefferson sends all kinds

381
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:13,039
of trees to him so I suppose you could

382
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:15,049
find out if we had any any descendants

383
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,539
over there or not but that was one place

384
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:19,609
where he got seeds another influence was

385
00:15:17,539 --> 00:15:22,939
Philip Metz I who was from Italy

386
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:25,190
Philip was an amazing guy who was here

387
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,990
to establish a wine company and some

388
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:30,500
agricultural interests and became

389
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:32,419
friends with Jefferson and mitts I

390
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,698
starts to establish the vineyards for

391
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:37,519
Jefferson and he brings over ten Italian

392
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:39,289
gardeners many of them remained in the

393
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:43,820
Charlottesville area and

394
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:45,949
today and in all of us of course in the

395
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,629
Paris era all of his journal references

396
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:49,759
are in French and now all of the journal

397
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:53,689
references are in Italian Philip is

398
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,279
there so we still we see we have these

399
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:58,850
vineyards today and you can notice the

400
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,769
sort of rough wooden structures that are

401
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:03,620
really difficult to take care of and

402
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:05,149
anyway we have 22 varieties that they

403
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,009
attempted to grow on the on the left

404
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:08,809
side and on the upper side is ascender

405
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:13,929
of a sea grapes that we can harvest for

406
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:17,689
wine so what was interesting about

407
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:19,279
filament zai is that if you look at the

408
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,900
the kind of a fuzzy picture but if you

409
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,579
look at the latitude between Virginia

410
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:24,740
which is sort of like in this little

411
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:27,259
dent here and you look over to where

412
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,379
Philip was from Italy they kind of match

413
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:33,200
so he's kind of on the same latitude and

414
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:37,399
we actually looked at the ethnobotany of

415
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:39,890
Philips area and found salad Burnet for

416
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:42,500
one thing he calls it Salvas Strela to

417
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:43,909
pisa and what is that and it's like it

418
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,460
sounds like burnett and we looked in

419
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:48,439
there and we found it and yes it's salad

420
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,570
Burnet so he's growing it really early

421
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,730
on and so some of these things we kind

422
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:56,000
of can nail down by looking at that if

423
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:57,740
you don't have brought it over so and

424
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,740
then Jefferson also travels in Italy

425
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,960
while he's in Paris and he finds olive

426
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,088
trees that are six feet diameter it's

427
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,039
amazing he sees wine growing Parmesan

428
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:09,740
cheese macaroni mold and it's not them

429
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,199
it's not molding it's a press that you

430
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:14,720
can make macaroni from and then rice and

431
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,370
silk and he tries to steal rice there's

432
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,000
a great famous story that you can look

433
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:23,599
online and read about how he's in upland

434
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,359
Italy with with his donkey driver and

435
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,219
they go to this rice patch and he really

436
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:30,229
wants a certain kind of upland rice and

437
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,850
he says to the farmer can I take a bag

438
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,990
of rice home I mean a 50-pound bag of

439
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:34,909
rice when I introduced it to South

440
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,829
Carolina and says no now we have this

441
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,779
regional they still have this a regional

442
00:17:36,829 --> 00:17:40,339
rule you can't take things away from

443
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:42,049
certain regions in Italy says no you

444
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:43,789
can't so Jefferson says okay can I have

445
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:44,240
a little bag of it I'll put it in my

446
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:46,250
pocket

447
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,079
okay you can have a bag of it tells a

448
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,059
donkey driver you take a bag of it too

449
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,879
and if you go across the border you can

450
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:54,109
get killed for having this rice but they

451
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,330
get it and then they brings it back to

452
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:58,129
South Carolina and they said you know

453
00:17:56,329 --> 00:17:59,839
people in South Carolina said you know

454
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:04,790
we have this rice that would really like

455
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:07,369
better there now I washed I'll tell you

456
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:09,529
another rice during a second so I want

457
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:12,079
to mention about food and how because

458
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:14,809
you don't understand how important the

459
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:16,750
food aspect of this is until you look

460
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:19,789
back and see that in the Middle Ages

461
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:22,549
food was mostly meat and it was spiced

462
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:24,829
up and if you put time on something

463
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:27,379
that's moldy you can destroy bacteria

464
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:29,750
you know time kills bacteria in 60

465
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:32,660
seconds or so so you have all these

466
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:35,180
strange foods that basically are heavily

467
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:38,269
spiced or you know being sanitized by

468
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:41,810
the herbs and then they even put I think

469
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:43,730
had guild fielded they had this meatloaf

470
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:46,159
of birds that they put feathers over the

471
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:49,940
top of so there's a whole lot of heavy

472
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:53,509
meat dishes and and we kind of exit that

473
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:57,080
kind of era of food when John Evelyn was

474
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:59,720
writing about food and he also read

475
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:02,720
about horticulture and if you read about

476
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,329
his quote about lettuces he was really

477
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,450
into introducing the salad into the diet

478
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:10,279
once again so his treatise of

479
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:12,980
horticulture he has asked to carry as a

480
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:14,599
part of that mrs. lettuce is a principal

481
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,269
foundation of the universe of try both

482
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:18,889
salads and it's it has beneficial

483
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:20,960
influences on morals temperance and

484
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:24,980
chastity I've never thought about that

485
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,450
one I had a salad but he's fascinating

486
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,730
guide he's got great books and he has

487
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:31,009
all the tools listed that they had in

488
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:33,980
that day and then actually in Europe

489
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:36,079
have started being influenced by North

490
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:39,559
American foods or South American foods

491
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:41,869
with the beans etc so this big trade and

492
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:45,889
a different change and diet to be more a

493
00:19:41,869 --> 00:19:49,519
vegetable so one dimension on this guy

494
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:51,650
lover in who has a cookbook and he's the

495
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:54,170
person who's starting French foods that

496
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:56,570
has the idea of vegetables tasting fresh

497
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:58,279
not vegetables stood up and cooked

498
00:19:56,569 --> 00:20:00,349
different of soups this is fresh

499
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:01,789
vegetables with a sauce and it's the

500
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:04,159
start of French cooking this is an

501
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:06,569
amazing book and you can get it in

502
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:09,269
translation

503
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:11,939
so Jefferson goes to Paris he brings

504
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:14,160
along Sally to take care of his two

505
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,730
daughters with in James Sally's brother

506
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,950
these were slaves comes over and he has

507
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:22,230
James apprentice to his caterer and then

508
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:24,809
he sends it to Chantilly which is a

509
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:27,779
picture down below to learn to cook in

510
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:29,609
that kitchen I was amazed their kitchen

511
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:33,420
is up there you can see the size of it

512
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:35,849
all of the exquisite pots and technique

513
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:38,490
this is really top-notch stuff they are

514
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:40,619
serving kings and queens at this english

515
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:44,160
castle so this is the kind of food that

516
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:46,139
Jefferson is going to have and when you

517
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,850
have another picture yeah so James for

518
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,040
instance he learns to make this

519
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:52,319
beautiful fritter and then he brings it

520
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:54,000
back to Monticello it continues as the

521
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,079
Belle fritters and it becomes like apple

522
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,039
fritters later it kind of gets a little

523
00:20:55,079 --> 00:21:00,809
rustic after a while but he's got this

524
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:03,629
this French influence this is really

525
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:05,099
top-notch beautiful cooking and so this

526
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:07,080
is the kitchen that Jefferson builds

527
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:08,730
when he gets back from France and you

528
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:09,689
can see on the left are two stoves you

529
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:13,289
got all the best

530
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:15,570
copper pops the hearth is back there

531
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:17,519
with a clock jack that's kind of law and

532
00:21:15,569 --> 00:21:19,799
odd little thing in the middle a big

533
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,019
oven on the right he's got this stone

534
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:24,930
mortar which is amazing and that's made

535
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:27,690
for making pesto this is a beautiful

536
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:30,420
kitchen don't to work in so I wanted to

537
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:31,799
show you this because you can see the

538
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,110
kitchen that we're familiar with the

539
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:36,119
stew soaps on the Left they allow you to

540
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:39,029
put charcoal under a pot and have like

541
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:42,119
low temperature cooking and you can

542
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:44,250
regulate with grids on top the little

543
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:47,759
out outlays here this is just to take

544
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:49,349
Asha way up in the upper left-hand

545
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:50,849
corner you can see that pavilion and

546
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:52,769
it's called a pavilion it's the first

547
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:54,480
structured Jefferson built at Monticello

548
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:57,629
and that was to live in and downstairs

549
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,670
was the kitchen and it has been kind of

550
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:02,120
a men's bathroom since the 1940s and

551
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:04,920
recently we have enough money to

552
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:07,739
excavate that and bring it back to be

553
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:10,230
what it what it used to be the

554
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:13,200
interesting thing is that that pavilion

555
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:15,150
doesn't match the level of Monticello

556
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,150
house this Monticello has the two

557
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:19,650
terraces so this is at the end of one

558
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,690
Terrace when he decides to build

559
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:23,149
Monticello it's

560
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:26,749
the hillside that he's building on

561
00:22:23,148 --> 00:22:28,248
doesn't doesn't match so he just has the

562
00:22:26,749 --> 00:22:30,379
workers filled the bottom of the

563
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:32,149
pavilion in with three feet of fill just

564
00:22:30,378 --> 00:22:35,898
fill it up and we'll go on from there

565
00:22:32,148 --> 00:22:37,398
and so the archaeologists then took out

566
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:40,579
the three feet of fill this winter and

567
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:43,878
they had 40,000 artifacts in it because

568
00:22:40,579 --> 00:22:46,189
the yards dirt is full of debris and so

569
00:22:43,878 --> 00:22:48,709
they got amazing material and at the

570
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:51,950
bottom of it they find the original stew

571
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:54,649
stove foundations and the charcoal from

572
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:56,840
1808 was in them and so they found other

573
00:22:54,648 --> 00:22:59,329
parts of the whole kitchen so it's very

574
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:01,608
exciting to know that they actually had

575
00:22:59,329 --> 00:23:03,259
these stew stoves and stuff really early

576
00:23:01,608 --> 00:23:06,949
on and then he builds this big kitchen

577
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:08,960
to follow and so the idea that this cook

578
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:10,369
this food is really exquisite and

579
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,700
Jefferson was known to given really

580
00:23:10,368 --> 00:23:15,558
great dinners and siddur so that's the

581
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,080
bouquet garni everybody knows about that

582
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:20,200
he put a bunch of herbs in soup but it

583
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:22,848
was a whole series of different kinds

584
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,009
invented by this guy loved bran

585
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:27,858
so in Jefferson ends up growing all of

586
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:29,479
these herbs that I mentioned by him so

587
00:23:27,858 --> 00:23:31,638
that's one reason for it here's a list

588
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:36,259
of herbs that he decides to grow in 1794

589
00:23:31,638 --> 00:23:41,269
so that's pretty inspired so we first

590
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:44,239
knew all those words and so the enslaved

591
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:45,919
people have on all of these plants that

592
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:48,229
they bring as well and Karen has has

593
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,929
done a lot of work on she's passed away

594
00:23:48,229 --> 00:23:53,179
now but she has done a lot of work with

595
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:55,460
finding these origins of Southern

596
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:57,048
cuisine so I'll show you Michael Twitty

597
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,629
as well he's just recently released a

598
00:23:57,048 --> 00:24:01,509
book about Southern cuisine he's kiddin

599
00:23:59,628 --> 00:24:04,459
see he's cooking in our kitchen and

600
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:07,308
David shields does a lot of work very

601
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:09,619
interesting work on finding sources for

602
00:24:07,308 --> 00:24:12,499
the original plant material and he

603
00:24:09,618 --> 00:24:14,829
actually went to Trinidad recently

604
00:24:12,499 --> 00:24:17,778
because Americans were a group of

605
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:20,269
enslaved people that had been freed and

606
00:24:17,778 --> 00:24:22,339
hired by the British to fight in the war

607
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:24,979
of 1812 and in return they got free land

608
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:27,499
in Trinidad and they brought their seeds

609
00:24:24,979 --> 00:24:28,909
with them and so the upland the red or

610
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:30,829
plain beard and rice that Jefferson had

611
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:32,869
has been grown in Trinidad ever since

612
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:34,519
and so now it's being it's in quarantine

613
00:24:32,868 --> 00:24:38,809
and we'll come back to

614
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:40,519
Monticello soon so here's some some of

615
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:43,789
the seeds from they enslave people like

616
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:45,980
this is um denne or sesame and he has a

617
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:50,059
nice white flower and then the pods make

618
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:52,160
these beautiful seeds and Jefferson was

619
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:53,809
hoping to make oil from this instead of

620
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,120
olive oil because olives didn't grow

621
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:58,309
very well at Monticello you were lots of

622
00:24:56,119 --> 00:25:00,289
this here's okra the okra plants grow

623
00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:02,990
really tall and huge and they're used to

624
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:05,690
make soups and he grew it around his

625
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:11,839
Tomatoes as a barricade here's an

626
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:13,070
eggplant and it was you know Jefferson

627
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:15,740
felt that when Martha

628
00:25:13,069 --> 00:25:17,539
cooked the eggplants it tasted like soft

629
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:22,490
crabs so I think he was pretty

630
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:25,129
landlocked the West India gherkin is an

631
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:26,990
amazing thing that came in for the

632
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:28,910
slaves of the the seeds are extremely

633
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:30,980
tiny but the plan is so prolific and

634
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:33,050
this is a really tasty little crunchy

635
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:36,410
cucumber that doesn't cross pollinate

636
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:39,139
with their average cucumber so and then

637
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,509
sorghum is a kind of millet and you can

638
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:44,030
pop it you can rind it you can certain

639
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:48,559
varieties have that sweets syrup in the

640
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:50,629
stalk so there's going to be we're gonna

641
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,399
go for that in in our garden because

642
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:56,240
Jefferson colored guinea corn at the

643
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,650
time and then the peanuts we have the

644
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,329
Carolina African runner peanut that

645
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:03,740
actually came off of slaves shipped in

646
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:05,449
1670 and this is profusely prolific with

647
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,730
peanuts I don't know if you know about

648
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:11,360
peanuts grew any of you seen peanuts

649
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:13,910
when they pollen are pollinated the the

650
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:16,219
flower sends a peg into the ground and

651
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:18,650
that forms the the peanut nut

652
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:21,140
underground and so when you lift up a

653
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:23,540
peanut plant it's full of these pegs and

654
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:26,120
this actually creates a big mat of

655
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:29,029
peanuts really tiny and they're used

656
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:30,649
mostly for cooking oil so and then the

657
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:35,049
Lewis and Clark expedition left

658
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:38,720
Monticello in 1803 and then went out to

659
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:40,789
try to find the Pacific and when they

660
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,279
went up this branch of the river they

661
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:48,200
got up to about here when they met snow

662
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:51,638
and they built a fort and lived

663
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:54,919
for until dan april of the next year on

664
00:26:51,638 --> 00:26:56,719
the with the products of the man day and

665
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:58,909
Arikara and Hidatsa tribes down at the

666
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,319
bottom is the boat that the man dan's

667
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:03,710
used and on the right is the boat that

668
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:05,869
Lewis and Clark expedition used so

669
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:08,509
there's their situation is cold this is

670
00:27:05,869 --> 00:27:10,939
North Dakota and I have a three-month

671
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:16,190
growing season and so we actually have a

672
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:19,340
seat exchange and with we got the beans

673
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:21,830
and corn and sunflowers etc from the

674
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:24,079
descendants of these tribes to grow at

675
00:27:21,829 --> 00:27:26,648
Monticello once again so this adult

676
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:30,109
Sabine is amazing it's got one seed

677
00:27:26,648 --> 00:27:32,839
makes like a hundred 20 pods sometimes

678
00:27:30,109 --> 00:27:34,879
on one plant it's it's really

679
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:36,619
significant they have a legend that one

680
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,110
seed will feed twelve people and it's

681
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:40,219
like it's really it really comes out

682
00:27:39,109 --> 00:27:43,129
that way when I first got this dad's

683
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:45,860
bean I had 15 seeds and a 42-foot you

684
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:47,450
know so I thought what it's going to

685
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:49,009
happen here but actually each plan was

686
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:51,620
so prolific you can see that production

687
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:54,470
so in this short rolling season they get

688
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:56,359
a lot of food that they can store so

689
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:59,240
here's the Mandan corn that we grow

690
00:27:56,359 --> 00:28:01,339
they'll on the left is the red clay corn

691
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,769
and then there's white flour corn in the

692
00:28:01,339 --> 00:28:05,750
middle and the red red flower corn in

693
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:07,849
the center this is interesting because

694
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:10,220
it's really early Cooper really

695
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:13,908
historically corn only goes up to 4 or 5

696
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:17,659
feet tall and the plant tillers out with

697
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:18,679
the cobs along the bottom of stalks I'm

698
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:22,899
thinking they don't have raccoons

699
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:27,380
because but we don't have that issue so

700
00:28:22,898 --> 00:28:29,359
for this corn because it's so tiny it's

701
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:31,370
right next to the Hidatsa being here I

702
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:32,928
hand pollinate all the called cobs of

703
00:28:31,369 --> 00:28:36,859
corn just make sure we can get a good

704
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:40,840
crop here's the Arikara sunflower this

705
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:43,308
um this grows in cold weather as well so

706
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:45,379
like they plant it when the ice breaks

707
00:28:43,308 --> 00:28:47,658
up on the Missouri River so for us it's

708
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:49,370
like March 25th we put the seeds in the

709
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:52,039
ground and needs 45 degrees soil

710
00:28:49,369 --> 00:28:53,928
temperature and so this sunflower

711
00:28:52,038 --> 00:28:56,778
picture was probably taken like June 1st

712
00:28:53,929 --> 00:28:59,509
or 2nd so they grow really fast in the

713
00:28:56,778 --> 00:29:02,470
cold weather and they're pizza huh sighs

714
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:02,470
heads your great

715
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:10,119
so here's the seed exchange this is when

716
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:12,220
we first started back in 2013 and that's

717
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:14,679
been it's been a really interesting to

718
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:18,600
grow these crops and we grew some in the

719
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:21,900
fall this year too so here's some

720
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:25,629
Jefferson grew all of these different

721
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:27,600
climatic region regional plants and so

722
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,860
in his day it was pretty amazing because

723
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,509
Jefferson and the colonists great

724
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:33,159
basically had spring gardens and fall

725
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:36,250
gardens they didn't grow summer summer

726
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:38,890
crops so I hope you visit us at the

727
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:42,430
garden someday soon and here's my

728
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:43,930
contact information and then I'll give

729
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:51,029
you a little plant quiz we had this idea

730
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:51,029
to show you some plants so okay great

731
00:29:55,529 --> 00:30:01,149
all right can you see ok so we I did

732
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:02,980
show you this plant it's the stalk is

733
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:08,380
really big I've got it folded up three

734
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:11,190
times so does anybody recognize this

735
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:14,830
it's got these really great pods that

736
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:16,299
when you open them up all of the seeds

737
00:30:14,829 --> 00:30:19,359
are kind of lined up like a little

738
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:24,159
bending machine that gorgeous and then

739
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:26,740
hopefully all these people all left the

740
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:28,150
Sesame right and that's a really nice

741
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,970
little flower you can see here's some

742
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:33,370
young pods we had a chef visit who

743
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:36,240
decided to try to cook the young pods

744
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:40,689
you can see some seeds here right there

745
00:30:36,240 --> 00:31:04,359
gorgeous okay so that grows really well

746
00:30:40,690 --> 00:31:07,809
for us corn this is the Mandan red

747
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:10,299
flower corn and the white flour corn

748
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:14,379
although this is what I got to plant

749
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:15,000
this is what I got from it interesting

750
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,910
that

751
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,119
didn't get any blue ones but maybe we

752
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:22,140
just had yellow pollen I don't know but

753
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:26,909
I wanted to show you that in

754
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:30,000
relationship to Damon Morgan's Kentucky

755
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:34,170
butcher corn take things away which is a

756
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:37,859
corn that we make into hominy and if I

757
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:40,950
open this one up you can see the

758
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:45,359
relative size of Europe corn versus what

759
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:54,539
the Indians were we're producing so this

760
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:57,569
uh from top to bottom and the Indians

761
00:31:54,539 --> 00:32:02,700
were doing the Mandan had eight hundred

762
00:31:57,569 --> 00:32:22,500
acres of their crop and the tools that

763
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:23,610
they used the garden with was so this is

764
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,049
a antler

765
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:26,819
they would tie an antler to a stick and

766
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:29,309
they also the other pole was made of a

767
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:30,659
scapula from the Buffalo eight hundred

768
00:32:29,309 --> 00:32:33,299
acres and then they figured out how to

769
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:37,290
cash the food and so then when visitors

770
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:40,230
and my explorers from from Canada from

771
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:44,420
the British the Spanish alright at that

772
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:50,519
place on the Missouri they had plenty to

773
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:52,920
to sell and they so these Indians had

774
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:55,889
all the latest in cooking pots calico

775
00:32:52,920 --> 00:33:00,600
pins and needles they were very sharp

776
00:32:55,890 --> 00:33:07,530
people I got here some recognize these

777
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:10,169
little fuzzies chestnuts this is this is

778
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:12,240
cotton so I did see this one out in your

779
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:15,750
garden here this is the red foliated

780
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:19,200
white cotton and you can see the seeds

781
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:21,390
are right here this is a her suitum

782
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,759
cotton which means you know the sticky

783
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:26,670
seed you know the hirsute name it means

784
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:29,009
it's got this fuzz to it this is the

785
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:32,730
green lint cotton did you know there was

786
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:35,759
Manhattan's and this is a also sticky

787
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:40,470
seed this is probably early ins green

788
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:42,569
and then we have this one here this is

789
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:44,549
man Keene cotton and it's written about

790
00:33:42,569 --> 00:33:46,679
in Jefferson's books as a yellow cotton

791
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:50,430
and made the cloth actually became

792
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:53,190
called nankeen from this and then I have

793
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:57,660
this cotton here you can see the seeds

794
00:33:53,190 --> 00:34:01,170
are slipping out easily so this is C

795
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:03,240
Island Brown cotton and this is I

796
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:06,269
believe a barbadensis a variety instead

797
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:09,860
of here sue them isn't that cool now the

798
00:34:06,269 --> 00:34:12,780
thing about this is that all of these

799
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:15,419
Cotton's with sticky seeds grow better

800
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:17,429
in Virginia and so Jefferson needs a gym

801
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:19,589
to take the seeds out because it takes

802
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:20,490
so much time to pull this apart so he

803
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:23,460
gets the cotton gin

804
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:25,019
he's Secretary of State when in also

805
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,668
running the Patent Office we Neal I

806
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:29,039
Whitney sins and plans for the cotton

807
00:34:26,668 --> 00:34:30,839
gin and he says is this really a dream

808
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:36,059
or is you really have this machine I

809
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:39,629
really need like two of these so the gym

810
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:42,590
is saw blades that will tear up the

811
00:34:39,628 --> 00:34:45,029
cotton off the seed if you showed

812
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:46,649
somebody a gin with this kind of cotton

813
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:48,419
they would they would die because

814
00:34:46,648 --> 00:34:49,710
they're cutting this the fibers up the

815
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:51,418
the whole thing is that you want the

816
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:52,918
longest fiber you can get and to be able

817
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:56,969
to straighten it out and then twist it

818
00:34:52,918 --> 00:35:00,420
into thread and sew the Ecuadorians have

819
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:03,269
a cotton that's very long fiber about

820
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:05,190
four inches long and they just remove

821
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:06,750
the seeds by hand and then straighten it

822
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:10,079
out why hacking it with a stick on a

823
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:11,610
pillow and that's really beautiful long

824
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,019
thread that they can make from there and

825
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:15,750
like Egyptian cotton is that barbed

826
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:18,619
identity as well seceded so that's

827
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,619
pretty fascinating

828
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:23,239
I'll show you this crazy little thing

829
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:30,960
recognize these these are quite mature

830
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:32,939
they remember this the gherkin yeah I'll

831
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:37,380
cut it in half you can see how big these

832
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:39,360
seeds are in here how many seeds really

833
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,640
prolific look at all those seeds each

834
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:44,059
seed is an entire plant cut this one

835
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,059
this way

836
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:48,750
fewer seeds when it's smaller but still

837
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:52,769
what you want to do is is get it when

838
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:54,239
it's tiny like like this big okay so I

839
00:35:52,769 --> 00:35:56,179
just wanted to show you the gherkins we

840
00:35:54,239 --> 00:36:01,559
just harvested them proceeded recently

841
00:35:56,179 --> 00:36:03,119
they're all gone yeah the whole thing is

842
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:05,730
edible and so we know it's fun with kids

843
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:09,150
because it's all prickly can you eat

844
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:12,960
that prickly thing so here's a couple of

845
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:14,430
pods from our friend the okra so I'll

846
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,679
show you what they look like inside when

847
00:36:14,429 --> 00:36:20,839
they're this size they are pretty

848
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:23,519
fibrous so you can see the seeds in here

849
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:25,980
when they're smaller about this size

850
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:29,690
then we eat them otherwise we save them

851
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,690
for seeds and for Christmas decorations

852
00:36:30,829 --> 00:36:40,199
I had two different varieties of this

853
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:44,309
anybody recognize this point this is a

854
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:46,980
dried one this is a dried artichoke use

855
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:49,500
this for Christmas as well the

856
00:36:46,980 --> 00:37:05,940
artichokes we grow don't have very good

857
00:36:49,500 --> 00:37:07,710
flavor and this is really fun Jefferson

858
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,869
called this the most minutest board ever

859
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:12,570
seen and he sends it to his

860
00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:14,730
grandchildren it's the Tennessee

861
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:17,760
spinning board so you can grow toys and

862
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:25,940
garden so who knew that Jefferson had a

863
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:25,940
sense of humor so I'll show you this

864
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:34,890
this is gonna be hard for you to figure

865
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:39,750
out the most important part is right

866
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:45,809
here at the top right here take this off

867
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:49,809
crush it and what do you have there

868
00:37:45,809 --> 00:37:53,139
let us seed so I don't know how many of

869
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:54,549
you've seen let us go to seed well we in

870
00:37:53,139 --> 00:37:56,549
fact here's all the seeds down here

871
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:59,590
shake it out

872
00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:01,870
we we cut the heads off usually shorter

873
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:03,850
than this like about here dry the heads

874
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:06,219
in the greenhouse in a dry greenhouse

875
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:08,529
and then crush them through sips to get

876
00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:11,139
the seeds out and what's interesting is

877
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:13,180
the ants love lettuce seed too and so if

878
00:38:11,139 --> 00:38:15,099
we're in a rush we can just pick up the

879
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:16,809
newspaper and underneath will be cute

880
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:17,349
little piles of lettuce seed already

881
00:38:16,809 --> 00:38:21,389
clean

882
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:21,389
we just scoop it up

883
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:36,389
I'll show you this plant here because

884
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:40,119
it's one side there's another side

885
00:38:36,389 --> 00:38:41,710
anybody recognize this tobacco so we

886
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:44,559
grow that arena Kota backhoe which is

887
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:46,360
what Jefferson would have had came from

888
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:48,820
Surinam there's great stories if you

889
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,960
read a book by a prevent from the 1600s

890
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:55,180
the first book by a woman author

891
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:58,480
describing the plight of slaves and it

892
00:38:55,179 --> 00:39:01,899
became a stage play in the Victorian era

893
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,750
it's all about a renico who was a slave

894
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:07,420
who he was actually a prince to marry

895
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:10,989
the princess and he sold as a slave and

896
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:12,280
then he and his wife-to-be have a pact

897
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:14,319
that they're gonna kill each other

898
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,720
because they can't well his wife is

899
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,510
actually taken by his dad really bad

900
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:20,739
stuff happened so his last words is all

901
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:22,780
I want before I die

902
00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:26,019
is to smoke pipe before in a cook

903
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:29,530
tobacco so it's pretty good but um this

904
00:39:26,019 --> 00:39:32,050
is being dried now and what I really

905
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:34,540
liked is this fall was that he was such

906
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:39,610
a ladybug factory you can see some

907
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:42,610
evidence of bugs here the we had a pits

908
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:44,769
galore and then the aphids all attracted

909
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:46,809
ladybugs and all kinds of beneficial

910
00:39:44,769 --> 00:39:49,360
insects that were using though the

911
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:50,590
honeydew and it was it's amazing how

912
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,820
many ladybugs we have in the garden

913
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:56,079
because this happened on our sorghum

914
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:58,030
last year and so we had no reason to

915
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,079
remove them so we just let them go when

916
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:02,140
he had a

917
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:02,590
lady ladybug larvae over six inches or

918
00:40:02,139 --> 00:40:05,099
somes

919
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:07,329
hull patch it was just loaded and a

920
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:08,679
tobacco farmer came and I said you know

921
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:10,840
usually I wash all these leaves off

922
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:17,859
because of all this stuff he says no one

923
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:19,900
else does so just so now I'll show you a

924
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:23,050
couple of tools and then I'll be I'll be

925
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:24,010
done I think here's one special tool

926
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:28,269
that I was telling you about

927
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:31,300
right here how many of you have symbols

928
00:40:28,269 --> 00:40:33,489
today that's very impressive

929
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,720
so in Jefferson's day every woman would

930
00:40:33,489 --> 00:40:37,629
have had it everywhere in child would

931
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:39,549
have a symbol and sometimes you and I'll

932
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:43,000
show you this beautiful thing that got

933
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:45,640
recently and I saw this on one of your

934
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:52,480
posters in the hallway so does anybody

935
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:54,069
know what this tool is it's it's a

936
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,590
string line so we use the string lines

937
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:58,120
for everything in the garden and I use a

938
00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:00,130
compass with a string line to make sure

939
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:01,480
everything is parallel and then

940
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:03,160
sometimes you treasuring sticks to

941
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:07,030
measure out the plants sometimes use my

942
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:09,309
feet and so this I love this thing but

943
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:11,890
this is actually 1800s something a

944
00:41:09,309 --> 00:41:14,710
little less extreme but I wanted to show

945
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:16,299
you that because that's what Jefferson

946
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:19,360
you know something like that's what

947
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:21,970
Jefferson had and this is what his

948
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:25,210
Indian neighbors were using compare the

949
00:41:21,969 --> 00:41:28,259
different ways of gardening it's just

950
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:30,250
you know it really is phenomenal so

951
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:49,090
thank you very much for putting up with

952
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:50,469
life we do so many things are you

953
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:54,820
talking about bugs are you talking about

954
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:56,139
poorly yeah or legged mammals so we have

955
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:59,170
an electric fence we put up every night

956
00:41:56,139 --> 00:42:01,869
for deer and other we have some

957
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:03,070
woodchucks that are just monsters we put

958
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:04,839
up a fence every night take it down

959
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:06,519
every morning we have a three dogs so

960
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:09,070
you let out to get the little animals

961
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:10,960
raccoons and stuff you had a beautiful

962
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:12,470
baby raccoon treed last year is really

963
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,769
cute and

964
00:42:12,469 --> 00:42:17,839
some Fox and we have other things skunks

965
00:42:15,769 --> 00:42:19,940
you know a lot of animals because we're

966
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:24,590
right in woods basically a lot of birds

967
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:27,470
the crows are really obnoxious so we put

968
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:29,930
cages over any emerging cotton having

969
00:42:27,469 --> 00:42:33,019
corn or beans because they'll pull them

970
00:42:29,929 --> 00:42:35,358
right out so yeah we have to and we let

971
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:41,800
him get up to a good height before we

972
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:49,909
take the cage off other methods sort of

973
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:51,830
period no you know I don't know what his

974
00:42:49,909 --> 00:42:54,949
crow problem might have been but he had

975
00:42:51,829 --> 00:42:57,858
a paling fence which means ribbon boards

976
00:42:54,949 --> 00:42:59,509
and have been 12 feet high around the

977
00:42:57,858 --> 00:43:01,670
whole garden including the fruit garden

978
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:03,890
so it was like almost a mile-long fence

979
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:05,329
and the boards were close enough so he

980
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:06,889
said so what hair wouldn't go through so

981
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:08,809
we rabbit wouldn't go through before he

982
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:11,210
had the fence built Martha would write

983
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:14,509
to him saying that the pigs are trashing

984
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:17,349
the garden so they they had animal

985
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:17,349
problems beyond ours

986
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:36,200
Janina Oh up here I was curious

987
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:39,530
one of your earlier slides said that he

988
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:43,608
had 15 types of broccoli that's the

989
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:48,019
problem have you been able to find or

990
00:43:43,608 --> 00:43:51,108
grow those kinds are seen them or know

991
00:43:48,019 --> 00:43:54,380
any extra information I'm happy to send

992
00:43:51,108 --> 00:43:58,029
you an email instead but I'll show you

993
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:58,030
the list that I have for broccoli

994
00:43:58,909 --> 00:44:12,748
okay idea we do grow Torah starts

995
00:44:08,369 --> 00:44:16,230
shining but we grow the white broccoli

996
00:44:12,748 --> 00:44:17,909
the early purple we've grown different

997
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:20,298
kinds of green and I just sort of label

998
00:44:17,909 --> 00:44:28,710
them as Roman or green or whatever and

999
00:44:20,298 --> 00:44:32,389
the black broccoli down there thank you

1000
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:32,389
so much we really enjoyed it up here

1001
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,550
[Music]

1002
00:44:40,338 --> 00:44:48,900
tomato we have the pomme d'amore yes and

1003
00:44:43,048 --> 00:44:50,400
it grows beautifully for us so that's C

1004
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,048
that's a tricky question because and

1005
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,749
Jefferson's day well I'll show you what

1006
00:44:52,048 --> 00:44:56,248
he says about tomato it stomata Spanish

1007
00:44:54,748 --> 00:44:57,748
tomahto bigger than the other ones and

1008
00:44:56,248 --> 00:45:00,118
the dwarf damata that runs around the

1009
00:44:57,748 --> 00:45:05,429
ground like a weed so that's all he's

1010
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:08,249
got to say here's tomahto so we know

1011
00:45:05,429 --> 00:45:11,068
that he goes to Williamsburg and meets

1012
00:45:08,248 --> 00:45:13,379
his family physician is dr. John Disick

1013
00:45:11,068 --> 00:45:14,730
Kyra who I'm probably pronouncing his

1014
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,470
name wrong but he's working at

1015
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:19,670
Williamsburg and he advocates eating

1016
00:45:16,469 --> 00:45:21,868
tomato everyday for eternal health

1017
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:25,440
that's been change over time hasn't it

1018
00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:28,289
and so we know that's in the earliest of

1019
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,909
the 1760s or so and in 1781 and this

1020
00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:31,499
notes on the state of Virginia Jefferson

1021
00:45:29,909 --> 00:45:33,690
lists tomatoes along with most melons

1022
00:45:31,498 --> 00:45:36,238
and passionfruit and everything else so

1023
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:38,700
we know the tomato is you know just

1024
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:41,699
being cultivated in Virginia without

1025
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:44,578
much fanfare so but this is all he says

1026
00:45:41,699 --> 00:45:48,629
because of that issue of not having

1027
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:51,239
variety means so we grow all kinds of

1028
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:53,519
tomatoes and basically the cost of ludo

1029
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:56,159
Genovese Augusto de Catanese because

1030
00:45:53,518 --> 00:45:59,818
Italy has its regionality and has a

1031
00:45:56,159 --> 00:46:02,548
tomato ride for each region and they've

1032
00:45:59,818 --> 00:46:05,190
been in in cultivation since the 1500s

1033
00:46:02,548 --> 00:46:09,108
the Medici family had tomatoes

1034
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:11,159
it became the food of the peasant so I

1035
00:46:09,108 --> 00:46:11,730
descried to cry to grow things that grow

1036
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:13,319
well for

1037
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:15,838
and this year we grew Cherokee purple

1038
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:17,730
tomatoes which did not grow very well at

1039
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:19,650
all and it wasn't from seeds that we had

1040
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:20,969
saved over time so I'm going to save

1041
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:23,099
some seeds and see if they'll grow

1042
00:46:20,969 --> 00:46:27,088
better next year but that's a modern

1043
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:31,019
1990 tomato and you know it's just it's

1044
00:46:27,088 --> 00:46:41,880
not suited oh this lady had a question

1045
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:44,809
forever because this is so amazing

1046
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:47,670
there are some there's some references

1047
00:46:44,809 --> 00:46:49,440
there's some guy named Edwin Ruffin who

1048
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:53,159
I was reading and he was talking about

1049
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:55,320
manuring and crop rotation so that's a

1050
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:57,139
great question and you know be

1051
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:59,309
interesting to see if any of Jefferson's

1052
00:46:57,139 --> 00:47:01,909
information debt dispersed to his

1053
00:46:59,309 --> 00:47:05,338
neighbor's some he had he did have his

1054
00:47:01,909 --> 00:47:07,170
friend George divers at Farmington who's

1055
00:47:05,338 --> 00:47:09,989
down in in Charlottesville we're up hill

1056
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:12,180
we're at 800 feet off Charles Ville

1057
00:47:09,989 --> 00:47:14,069
George had his farm and Jefferson would

1058
00:47:12,179 --> 00:47:16,500
send some of his seeds to George as a

1059
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:19,200
plan-b like in case mine fail you'll

1060
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:21,210
have the plant and they had a pecan test

1061
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:23,699
which is always touted to all the kids

1062
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:25,349
who had the first dish appease and won

1063
00:47:23,699 --> 00:47:27,629
and then that person would give a big

1064
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:29,970
dinner and one apiece and so one year

1065
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:31,800
Jefferson's peas came in first but he

1066
00:47:29,969 --> 00:47:33,959
says to Martha George best loves giving

1067
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:39,780
a dinner we're not going to tell him our

1068
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:41,010
peas came in first so but that's a great

1069
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:45,380
question as something I really should

1070
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:45,380
look into yeah and so you had a question

1071
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:59,129
so it'd be really great if trees could

1072
00:47:55,739 --> 00:48:00,838
persist 250 years but you know but we

1073
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:03,450
have we have records of what they are

1074
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:05,009
and so we reintroduced those trees and

1075
00:48:03,449 --> 00:48:07,500
we have you know put them in the right

1076
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:10,770
spots and one interesting thing is that

1077
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:11,849
he has a really large leaf magnolias I

1078
00:48:10,769 --> 00:48:14,219
think it's macrophylla

1079
00:48:11,849 --> 00:48:16,769
and he's got it on the you know the

1080
00:48:14,219 --> 00:48:18,269
house and there's the garden the flower

1081
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:20,068
garden and then the slope this goal we

1082
00:48:18,269 --> 00:48:23,130
called the upper Grove he's got them

1083
00:48:20,068 --> 00:48:24,440
sighted there and I should should take

1084
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:26,510
in a picture but um

1085
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,639
where they're cited then they're facing

1086
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:31,310
its the north facing here and then the

1087
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:33,799
West when the Sun sinks in the West here

1088
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:36,980
the north side of that tree trunk is

1089
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:38,930
frozen and then when the West sunshine

1090
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:41,358
hits the trunk in the wintertime it

1091
00:48:38,929 --> 00:48:42,889
splits it and so all of the magnolias

1092
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:44,239
have these splits in the trunk and then

1093
00:48:42,889 --> 00:48:46,039
they die we cut them off and then they

1094
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:47,479
come back up so they've been there over

1095
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:56,358
and over again but it's a terrible

1096
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:59,420
location but we put it in that way yeah

1097
00:48:56,358 --> 00:49:01,190
it gets things from from Andre from in

1098
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:03,050
Paris a number of things then those are

1099
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:26,059
written down to I'm really not a tree

1100
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:28,609
expert I spend a lot of time yeah well

1101
00:49:26,059 --> 00:49:30,769
it's we have this Barden Ambassador

1102
00:49:28,608 --> 00:49:32,210
Program with Master Gardeners from ten

1103
00:49:30,769 --> 00:49:33,769
to two who answer the question that

1104
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:35,539
everybody asks is like what happens to

1105
00:49:33,769 --> 00:49:37,009
all the vegetables and I really you know

1106
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:38,179
that's great it takes all that weight

1107
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:40,579
off of me so then when they have a

1108
00:49:38,179 --> 00:49:42,259
really cool question they send them over

1109
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:44,030
and I get to talk to them and I can

1110
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:45,530
mention something like did you know this

1111
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:46,910
is where sesame is or if we're just

1112
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:49,040
somewhere and somebody's poking around

1113
00:49:46,909 --> 00:49:50,389
and saying that looks like a and then

1114
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:51,710
they get lost you say well that's

1115
00:49:50,389 --> 00:49:53,539
actually a pumpkin that's actually a

1116
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:56,150
plant and then you can kind of go from

1117
00:49:53,539 --> 00:49:57,980
there so I really do try to help people

1118
00:49:56,150 --> 00:50:09,410
along when they're when they look

1119
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:11,510
interested in what they're seeing this

1120
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:17,078
has been a production of Cornell

1121
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:17,079
University on the web at Cornell edu
