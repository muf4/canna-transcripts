1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,798
University good afternoon everyone thank

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,518
you so much Katie for the introduction

4
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:15,919
um and I would like to thank the chairs

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,240
for the invitation uh unfortunately I

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:20,640
couldn't uh do the seminar in person but

7
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:24,358
I'm excited uh to be sharing with you

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,880
today our uh ongoing research on the

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,279
secure ecosystem engineering and design

10
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,678
to mitigate the impacts of uh non-native

11
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,200
fungal path

12
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:34,399
on manag

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,280
ecosystems um so as Katie already

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,679
presented I'm an early career staff

15
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,520
scientist at oid National Lab for those

16
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:43,920
of you who don't know I put the map uh

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,520
the lab is located in East Tennessee and

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,079
I put as as reference Atlanta which is

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:53,239
two and a half hours drive uh from okd

20
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:56,120
um and here's a picture of our um C

21
00:00:53,238 --> 00:00:58,919
campus where Cutting Edge research meets

22
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:02,878
uh natural beauty um I want to just give

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,198
two fun facts about uh ORNL um so the

24
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:08,280
lab has played an important role in the

25
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:11,759
discovery of tennessine adding a unique

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,960
element um to the periodic table also

27
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,560
it's the proud home of Frontier which is

28
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:19,919
the world's fast

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,879
supercomputer um so at ORNL uh we focus

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,680
on delivering um scientific discoveries

31
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:28,078
to ensure um the United States security

32
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,400
and prosperity by addressing uh

33
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:34,078
different challenges uh rang ing from

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,880
energy environmental and security

35
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:39,039
challenges another fun fact many are

36
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,438
surprised to learn that at ORNL we

37
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,040
actually conduct fungal research because

38
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:46,438
when they think of National Labs ORNL or

39
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,439
other National Labs they think that just

40
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:51,319
do like nuclear science nuclear

41
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:52,798
engineering or Material Science uh but

42
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:55,879
the fact that we actually have a

43
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,680
bioscience division is surprising for a

44
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:01,759
lot of people um actually my colleague

45
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,280
Dr Tomas rash who I actually met at w

46
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,000
medicon he was also in the Plant

47
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,679
Pathology Department uh with Katie uh

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,959
and and I we both corun the fungal lab

49
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,560
and the fungal program at ORNL uh

50
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:17,360
tomas's research mainly focusing on

51
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,598
fungal interactions and biotechnology

52
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,920
whereas my research as a fungal

53
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,439
geneticist and biologist focus on

54
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:27,759
developing Advanced genetic engineering

55
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:31,000
tools to UNL to unlock the potential of

56
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:34,039
fungi for sustainable application PS and

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,120
here are pictures from our busy lab this

58
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:38,519
past

59
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,200
summer um the research I will be

60
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:43,599
discussing in my seminar today is part

61
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:47,399
of the secure ecosystem engineering and

62
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:50,000
design short for seed Science Focus area

63
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,879
so in this SFA we drive Innovative

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,959
Science and Technology to be able to

65
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,318
understand and man manipulate how

66
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,000
microorganisms can either be bacteria or

67
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:02,318
fungi which is our Focus are able to to

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,919
establish spread and how they are

69
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:07,318
impacting ecosystems that are critical

70
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:10,039
or of high importance for the US

71
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:12,280
Department of energy so here's the

72
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:15,158
outline of my talk today so first I will

73
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,959
start by giving um a brief overview

74
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:21,479
about the pathos system that we focus on

75
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:23,400
within our csfa trying um to further

76
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:25,719
understand it I will highlight the

77
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,080
critical knowledge of gaps mainly when

78
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:30,759
it comes to understanding um the

79
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,840
molecular mechanisms of responsible for

80
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:35,719
the pathogenicity of um our pathogen and

81
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,080
how we

82
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:42,239
are in my second part I will talk about

83
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:45,319
uh how we are driving Innovative genetic

84
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,878
research um to be able to elucidate the

85
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:51,560
mechanisms driving the violence uh but

86
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:53,280
as well as developing genetic strategies

87
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,719
uh to better control the spread of

88
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,840
fungal

89
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:01,919
pathogens um so first uh why popular so

90
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,680
poppers are vital uh crops for the

91
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:07,039
Department of energy and because first

92
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,760
they are like fasted growing uh tree

93
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,679
species uh but also because they serve

94
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,438
as a foundational feed stock for

95
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,000
producing biofuel bioenergy and other

96
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:22,000
biobased chemicals at orl we focus

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,959
primarily at polar uh just because uh it

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
has um a fully sequenced genome actually

99
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,239
it was one of the first three genomes to

100
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,839
be published and it was uh this work has

101
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,000
been done by by a scientist at orl and

102
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,038
it made it to the cover of science on

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,639
September 15

104
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:41,719
2006 but we also valued working with

105
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,400
popper due to its genetic tractability

106
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,479
so it has a transformation system and

107
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,478
strong hybridization potential which

108
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,879
made it a prime model to be able to

109
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:54,599
advance research

110
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:56,918
efforts however this crop is um limited

111
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,000
to be used in industrial application

112
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:01,599
mainly due to the fungal diseases that

113
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,038
are caused primarily by the pathogens

114
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,160
ferina miva or known for the longest

115
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:09,599
time as septoria miva which is an asisd

116
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,560
fungal pathogen so this pathogen was

117
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,160
first described in 1884 on popus

118
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,319
deltoides in New York States but it has

119
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,199
later been uh uh spread unintentionally

120
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,960
by human activities uh as it will and it

121
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,120
was recently introduced and established

122
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,198
into the Pacific Northwest of North

123
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,079
America and now it's everywhere so in

124
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,439
this figure on the right show I show the

125
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:34,399
propagation

126
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:36,879
sorry I showed the propagation of um

127
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:39,159
this pathogen uh that spread across

128
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,959
North America and we saw that there was

129
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,720
like distinct

130
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:46,560
population um so we have uh the

131
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,520
Southeastern US population we have the

132
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,560
US Canadian subpopulation and we also

133
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,918
have a genetically distinct British

134
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,759
Columbia population so I'm bringing this

135
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,439
population right now because they will

136
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,800
come up later in my talk which we're

137
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,759
going to talk about them more in dep uh

138
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,079
um but just note that we actually have

139
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,720
122 isolates of each of these population

140
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:08,639
that were collected and we have the

141
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,039
genome sequence for them and that has

142
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,478
really been very helpful to invance our

143
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,038
research

144
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,199
efforts so this pathogen is responsible

145
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,759
for the septoria leaf spots and stem

146
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,360
caner diseases on susceptible pop

147
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,919
genotypes so while the leaf spots are

148
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:29,360
mainly um just of reducing the a static

149
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:31,318
values of popular the caners are uh the

150
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,319
one that have the greatest industrial

151
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:36,479
impacts due to the fact that uh a single

152
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,720
infection can kill a whole tree and snap

153
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:41,439
it in half uh and that would reduce uh

154
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,680
the yields and the use of poppler for

155
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,639
industrial

156
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,918
applications here's I'm actually also

157
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,960
showing uh additional pictures that were

158
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:52,758
taken by Tomas in our local blound

159
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:55,159
County popess field where most of our uh

160
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,319
field experiments take place so on the

161
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,439
left I'm showing how a diseased popular

162
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:03,199
look like and um help healthy so I put

163
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:06,199
it in quotes healthy because although it

164
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,520
is a resistant genotype it can still be

165
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:11,120
infected by sperina and that we've seen

166
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:13,038
that several times where the pathogen is

167
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,959
actually endophytically living inside

168
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,878
the plant but it does not cause uh

169
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,159
diseases because the genotype is

170
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,919
actually resistant uh to the symptoms

171
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,759
and the disease

172
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:26,758
development here's also other um uh

173
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,639
pictures showing uh canker disease

174
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:32,960
propagation uh and how the caners um

175
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:35,680
look like when it's a la8 stage canker

176
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,680
um just want to note that those caners

177
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,879
although we were able to isolate sperina

178
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,800
from it we cannot necessarily say that

179
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:43,680
they're adjusted du to sperina because

180
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,680
we were able to isolate other pathogens

181
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,038
that cause cankers as well but just

182
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,000
wanted to show you how a caner disease

183
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:53,199
propagation um look

184
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,918
like I believe a lot of you are already

185
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,478
familiar with fungal pathogen

186
00:07:54,918 --> 00:08:01,240
classification um so as we know uh

187
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:04,079
pathogens um their pathogen it uh have a

188
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,680
a spectrum ranging from biotrophy uh to

189
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:09,439
necrotrophy so biotrop are closely

190
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,360
associated with living host cells um

191
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,639
they extract the nutrients and grow and

192
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,680
reproduce without killing the host but

193
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:18,478
that doesn't mean that they are uh not

194
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,000
able uh to cause damage um which the

195
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:24,519
great example is uh rust fungi that

196
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,560
cause uh significant uh damage on crops

197
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:29,878
we have also the necrot trro that would

198
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,598
rely on uh that host tissue uh to

199
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,719
extract nutrients and they release

200
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,598
enzymes and toxins that will actually

201
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,599
break down the cell wall and will kill

202
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,680
the host cells we also have and the

203
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,919
greatest example is uh Bettis we also

204
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,519
have a third class which is where our

205
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:50,000
sperina pathogen Falls in which is the

206
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:55,240
Hemi bioto pathogens where they begin uh

207
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,759
their life cycle um as um as botro uh

208
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,440
but then later they would transition

209
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:02,759
into um into an necrotrophic uh phase

210
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,440
and they will um

211
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:07,519
sorry into an necrotrophic phase where

212
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,600
they will actually uh kill the tissue

213
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,039
and extract nutrients and

214
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,959
reproduce so here's a brief overview

215
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:18,599
about the life cycle of sperina miva so

216
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:20,879
the infections actually starts in Spring

217
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,560
where the pathogen release ascospores

218
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,958
where they will enter the popular leaves

219
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,958
through the stomata and they will uh

220
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,879
develop lesions three to four weeks

221
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:31,838
after Bud burst then during SU

222
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:33,799
there will be secondary infections where

223
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,959
the spores will spread to other parts of

224
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:38,479
the plants they will enter the stems the

225
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:40,679
branches um and other leaves and

226
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,200
creating secondary infections then

227
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:45,039
during fall the leaves that are infected

228
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,440
with the pathogen will fall off the

229
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:50,480
ground and then the sexual stage will

230
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,480
begin with the formation of the sexual

231
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:57,039
fruiting bodies Pia and then the cycle

232
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,039
will start all over again in

233
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,839
spring in terms of disease management to

234
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:05,359
mitigate ASAS infection uh there has

235
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,880
been like use of fici sdes but just as a

236
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,879
preventive approach because uh once the

237
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:11,480
pathogens actually established there was

238
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:13,639
no chemical treatments that were shown

239
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,519
to be effective but as I mentioned

240
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:20,480
earlier in my presentation uh popler has

241
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,679
actually um a strong hybridization

242
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,639
potential uh which actually uh made a

243
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:28,159
substantial amount of research focused

244
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:30,559
on the host side either by identifying

245
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,559
and planting resistant the genotype or

246
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,919
through breeding uh program efforts

247
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,399
aimed at developing new genotype that

248
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:39,799
can be resistant to the

249
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:41,519
pathogen other management approaches

250
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:43,479
aimed at preventing the spread of this

251
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,440
pathogen has focused on biological

252
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:49,399
control so um as I'm showing here in

253
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,720
this first study in 2003 they were able

254
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,799
to show that when they spray stomy

255
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,680
strains in the field they were able to

256
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:59,559
suppress leaf spot diseases a more

257
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:02,439
recent study in 2021 a research were

258
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:04,958
able to identify uh other basilis V

259
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:08,360
sensus trains that were also shown to

260
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:11,078
have antagonistic activity against s

261
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,800
ferina uh but the problem of those uh

262
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:16,239
biocontrol strategies is the limited

263
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:19,120
longevity of the bacterial strains uh

264
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,360
when they're used imp

265
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,078
Plantation the pathogen in this path

266
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,800
system has been overlooked for the

267
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:27,439
longest time in terms of disease

268
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,319
management and this is mainly due to the

269
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,200
insufficient understanding of the

270
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:35,079
molecular mechanisms that drive esas

271
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,200
penic but also this intertwines with the

272
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:39,239
absence of genetic manipulation

273
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,040
manipulation tools where there's a lot

274
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,399
of genetic tools as I mentioned on

275
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:46,559
popper for the longest time we did not

276
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:50,159
have any genetic tools to be able to um

277
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:52,319
manipulate uh this pathogen um so that

278
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:55,278
made it like our primarily objective

279
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,600
within the csfa is to develop a crisper

280
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:00,320
genetic tools for this pathogen that

281
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,200
aims not only at advancing uh the basic

282
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,079
research elucidating Gene functions

283
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:08,160
implicated and pathogenicity but also at

284
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:10,078
advancing applied research um towards

285
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:13,399
the development of crisper enabled

286
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:16,078
technology uh to be able to um control

287
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:18,078
the disease and um ensure like

288
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:20,479
sustainable population

289
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:23,198
management so for the second part of my

290
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,440
talk um I will discuss the progress that

291
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:27,599
we've made so far into developing

292
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,920
synthetic biology and genetic strategies

293
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,720
for combating Esa and mitigate its

294
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:35,399
impact on pois plantations and I will

295
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,959
divide this part into uh three subp

296
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,839
parts so first I will talk about uh how

297
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:42,198
we were able to develop chis procast

298
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,680
tool to genetically manipulate uh this

299
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:46,319
pathogen and then later how we leverage

300
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:49,278
these tools to uncover genetic

301
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,278
determinant of pathogenicity and other

302
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:54,360
um genes that has ecological functions

303
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:57,600
and how we are taking this another step

304
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,399
further uh to develop um crisper enabled

305
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,199
the gene drives for population

306
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,839
control but first for for those of you

307
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:08,039
who are not familiar with uh crisper

308
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,519
crisper stands for clustered regulatory

309
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:13,439
interspaced short palindromic uh repeats

310
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,159
uh it's a natural defense mechanisms

311
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,279
that was found in bacteria and that

312
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:21,078
helped them in protect against viruses

313
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,320
but later this natural occurring

314
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:26,159
mechanism has been adapted for synthetic

315
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:29,800
genome editing in a groundbreaking way

316
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:31,919
and in a lot of organisms

317
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:34,919
so crisper is often referred to as the

318
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:37,278
gene uh scissor why because it caused a

319
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:40,278
double strand DNA break in a specific

320
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:43,120
sequence in the genome so this Gene uh

321
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:46,240
this tool actually is composed of the

322
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,959
cast nine protein which will unwind and

323
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,440
cleave the DNA double strand break and

324
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:54,559
the second component of the crisper is

325
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,880
the guide RNA so it's the RNA component

326
00:13:54,559 --> 00:14:00,958
that is composed of the Tracer RNA and

327
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:03,600
the crisper RNA so the TR RNA um it will

328
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:07,159
bind to the cast 9 protein whereas the

329
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,879
crisper RNA will hybridize to a specific

330
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:11,480
uh region in the DNA so to any Gene of

331
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:14,480
interest that we want to knock it out or

332
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,839
delete it um so the crisper RNA is the

333
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,680
part that we actually uh designed based

334
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:22,199
on our uh Gene of

335
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:26,359
interest uh so the Tracer RNA and the

336
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:28,679
crisper RNA will uh fuse uh together to

337
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:31,159
form what we call the guide RNA and the

338
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:32,120
guide RNA will form a complex with the

339
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:36,078
cast

340
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:38,039
9 then this guide RNA and cast 9 complex

341
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:40,359
will go and will search for the sequence

342
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:42,838
of interest that we want to knock out

343
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,079
and the nuclease would be the nucleas

344
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,600
domains of the cast n would be activated

345
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:51,000
after the guide RNA hybridized to this

346
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:54,278
specific uh region and it will generate

347
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,278
a DNA cut or a DNA double strand break

348
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:59,078
then this double strand break that was

349
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:02,278
created by the guide RNA cast 9 complex

350
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:04,879
will be repaired uh in a prone in an

351
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:07,439
error prone way generating multiple

352
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,879
mutations or what we call indels

353
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,320
referring to insertions or deletions

354
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:15,879
because they are randomly repaired and

355
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,879
most likely those mutations will um will

356
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:21,039
result in the gene being knocked out

357
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:23,480
because its open reading frame has been

358
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:25,879
um cut in the middle and repaired in an

359
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,879
or error prone way containing a lot of

360
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:28,879
mutations

361
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,159
so just to give you a brief overview

362
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:37,919
about the advanc sorry uh the

363
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:40,318
advancement of uh crisper cast systems

364
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,439
uh into in in fungal research so this

365
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:44,958
tool has revolutionized actually fungal

366
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,959
genetic engineering in both yeast and

367
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:50,518
filamentous species enabling precise and

368
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:52,439
efficient genetic modifications and it

369
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:55,318
has been used for various application

370
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,959
that range of from uh genome engineering

371
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:59,799
primarily in yeast species to create

372
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:02,638
yeast libraries or to construct

373
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:04,599
synthetic yeasted chromosomes as well as

374
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,360
for metabolic engineering

375
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,040
transcriptional regulation um and we

376
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,318
also uh recently saw that crisper has

377
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:15,120
opened up new avenues for actually

378
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:17,198
detecting and controlling fungal

379
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,399
infections in Plant Pathology

380
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:22,359
specifically the applications of crisper

381
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:25,240
cast tools are also rapidly expanding so

382
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,360
these tools her help improving um plant

383
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,039
disease resistance by targeting both the

384
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,278
crops and the fungal Pat pathogens have

385
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:35,078
helped deepening our understanding of

386
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:37,000
plan pathogens interactions and has also

387
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:40,559
enabled the development of innov

388
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,318
innovative diagnostic tools uh for early

389
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,879
pathogen

390
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:47,000
detections so as a first step in our

391
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,399
efforts I worked on developing a crisper

392
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,440
cast n transformation system in our

393
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:55,639
non-model fungal pathogen asmea so here

394
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:59,120
I'm showing how the esa spores look like

395
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:03,318
and then uh how after digesting them we

396
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,640
a mix of different um digestion enzymes

397
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:07,918
how we are able to generate those bubble

398
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,120
looking uh structures that are called

399
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,759
protoplast so those are cells without

400
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:15,078
the cell wall uh and then we use those

401
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:19,318
protoplast for the delivery of the cast

402
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:21,038
9 guide RNA uh complex uh to be able to

403
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:23,279
generate the double strand DNA break

404
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:25,439
that I already talked about it so as a

405
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:29,759
proof of principle for the success of

406
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:32,279
this um tool in Esa I targeted uh an

407
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:35,640
oxitop Gene called per G because it

408
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:37,960
allowed an easy screening on foa plates

409
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,160
in CA when this Gene is actually knocked

410
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:43,440
out and then randomly I selected the 20

411
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,679
transformant from this transformation

412
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,919
and I did a sequencing of the region

413
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,000
where the guide RNA is supposed to cut

414
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,720
and I aligned those uh sequences from

415
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,119
the different transformant to the while

416
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,400
type and I was able to see multiple

417
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,759
insertions and deletions that actually

418
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,559
resulted in the mutation of this Gene

419
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,679
validating the success of this

420
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:05,960
transformation and the success of this

421
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,240
tool in

422
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,720
Esa so now that we have developed the

423
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,720
crisper cast 9 tool in Esa I wanted to

424
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,279
leverage it to identify genetic

425
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,279
determinants of pathogenicity and in

426
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:21,079
fungal plant pathogens pathogenicity

427
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:23,720
determinants can be either carbohydrate

428
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:26,119
active enzymes that are involved in the

429
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,400
degradation of plant cell wall which are

430
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:31,879
a key part of the pathogenicity of many

431
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:35,519
fungal pathogens we also have eector

432
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,400
genes which are secreted molecules that

433
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,759
directly manipulate the host cell

434
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,679
function and allowing the fungus to

435
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:45,319
successfully infect the host and uh

436
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:48,080
suppressing its immune responses and

437
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:50,439
lastly we have secondary metabolites

438
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,798
that are specialized molecules so

439
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:56,120
secondary metabolites unlike primarily

440
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:58,960
mole primary metabolites that are not

441
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:01,839
essential uh for the growth and

442
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,480
development but um they provide

443
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:06,439
Advantage for survival of the pathogen

444
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,798
for the pathogen and they can act as

445
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,720
virence factors and the production of

446
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:13,079
those metabolites are are usually

447
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,919
regulated as shown on uh the bottom

448
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:19,000
right by a cluster of genes so these

449
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,720
genes are clustered together uh and they

450
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,960
have um different function some of them

451
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:28,919
can encode for um accessory accessory

452
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:31,640
enzymes um and coordinate the synthesis

453
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:33,759
and modification others in codes for

454
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:38,240
Transporters um that are responsible for

455
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:40,440
the transport and um uh the actual

456
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,240
secretion of those metabolites and we

457
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,360
have also transcription factors that

458
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,558
regulate the expression expression of

459
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:49,319
those Gene in the cluster in our study

460
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:51,960
we focus on those two classes

461
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:54,359
identifying effectors and secondary

462
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,079
metabolites that are that can be

463
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,759
regulating the pathogenicity of sperina

464
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:00,839
Misa

465
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:03,200
so to identify fector genes we

466
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:05,759
collaborated with Dr Jared leales at

467
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,120
Oregon State University to conduct a

468
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,440
transcriptomic analysis on ASA during

469
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,599
stem caner

470
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,640
formation um so we collected RNA at two

471
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:18,359
and three weeks post inoculations with

472
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,799
the pathogen uh and this analysis have

473
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:24,439
enabled us to reveal 70 genes that were

474
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:27,158
differentially expressed at two weeks

475
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:30,200
and 110 genes that were differentially

476
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:32,520
expressed at three weeks between um the

477
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,600
stem caners like the RNA extracted from

478
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:38,359
stem caners uh and the control which is

479
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:40,918
uh fungus growing on am

480
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:42,879
media and among those genes that were

481
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,520
differentially expressed the gene that

482
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,520
had the highest expression at two weeks

483
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:51,639
and the second highest at three weeks en

484
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:54,759
code for extracellular protein 2 or

485
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:57,679
short for ecp2 which is predicted to be

486
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:59,839
an effor protein it was characterized in

487
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,480
other fungal pathogen and shown to be

488
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:04,240
responsible for pathogenicity it was

489
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,720
found as I mentioned to be highly

490
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,720
expressed during infection and when we

491
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,278
did an um an infiltration of this

492
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,798
protein uh on popular leaves we show

493
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:16,798
that it invokes hyper sensitive response

494
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:19,839
in some of the susceptible

495
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:22,240
genotypes so using our crisper tool that

496
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:25,678
uh we were able to develop uh but this

497
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:28,759
time instead of having a random repair

498
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:32,679
um we inserted with along with the

499
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:35,440
crisper cast 9 uh complex a donor DNA

500
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:37,480
that has a 1kb homology arm that

501
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,600
correspond to the cut site of the guide

502
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,919
RNA in the ecp2 sequence and contain a

503
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:46,480
selectable marker hph that encodes for

504
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,360
hydy which will allowed us later on to

505
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,919
select those mutants on hygromycin uh

506
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:54,240
enriched media so this is the structure

507
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,720
of the guide RNA that was designed to

508
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,159
cut in the ecp2 sequence um and after

509
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,480
doing the transformation

510
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:05,480
we collected randomly 20 mutants we did

511
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,759
the PCR confirmation and we selected of

512
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:11,480
those positive PCR mutants uh three uh

513
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:13,519
independent mutants uh that we performed

514
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,880
whole genome sequencing to make sure

515
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,519
that we don't have any cast 9 of targets

516
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,640
which is something that could happen

517
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,879
where the cast 9 would generate Cuts in

518
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,480
other parts of the genome and would also

519
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,400
have mutations not only necessarily at

520
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,919
the targeted low side but also in other

521
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,440
parts of the genome so we can confirmed

522
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:34,159
that in the three mutants that are

523
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,840
independently uh selected we did not

524
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:40,559
have any cast nine of Target and we have

525
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:43,079
a cut in the ecp2 sequence and a repair

526
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:45,480
integrating the hydy selectable marker

527
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:48,199
in those mutants later we use those

528
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,480
mutants and we perform pathogenicity

529
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,759
experiments uh by spraying different

530
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,798
popular genotypes that represent a broad

531
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:57,640
spectrum of susceptibility so some of

532
00:22:54,798 --> 00:23:00,038
them are known to be susceptible to Esa

533
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,600
where others where uh

534
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:05,400
resistant and as we can see here by

535
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:08,278
looking at uh the coner developments per

536
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:11,519
centimeters uh we were able to see that

537
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:15,119
The Knockout of ecp2 resulted in a

538
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:18,200
significant um um decrease of caners per

539
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:20,519
centimeters in certain genotypes uh but

540
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,120
interestingly those genotypes were the

541
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:24,720
same genotypes that when we did

542
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:29,918
infiltrations were also showing hyper

543
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:31,480
hyper um response um so also when we did

544
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,520
when we looked at the Leaf Disease

545
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:36,079
severity we were able to see a

546
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:38,038
significant reduction of Leaf Disease

547
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:40,599
severity uh when the plants were

548
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:42,879
inoculated with the Delta ecp2 compared

549
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:44,719
to the wild do strains so using this

550
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,520
crisper cast mine tool we were able to

551
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,798
validate the function of the

552
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:51,839
necrotrophic effector ecb2 that is

553
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:54,599
involved in necrotic caners formation uh

554
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,720
on PO systems and this effector can

555
00:23:54,599 --> 00:24:00,079
actually serve as our first Target for

556
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,919
the development of the chain drive

557
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:04,879
but besides the factors secondary

558
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,640
metabolites were also our Gene targets

559
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,240
of interest uh and they and they also

560
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,200
play a key roles in pathogenicity so to

561
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,839
be able to identify secondary

562
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,240
metabolites that are potentially

563
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:20,038
involved in ASA pathogenicity uh we used

564
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,159
anti smatch which is an online tool that

565
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:25,359
is able to predict biosynthetic Gene

566
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:28,480
clusters in fungi so when we rent this

567
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:31,119
tool on the genomes of all 122 isolate

568
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,599
ASA that we have from our collection we

569
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:35,678
were able to identify and that I'm

570
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,879
highlighting in red here a few

571
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,519
biosynthetic Gene clusters that were

572
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:42,520
either truncated or absent in the

573
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:45,119
British Columbia subpopulation that I

574
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:47,558
talked about earlier that is uh

575
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:50,319
genetically different than the others uh

576
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:54,240
population and interestingly uh when

577
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:57,319
those clusters um Clan 3030 and Clan

578
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,798
3571 were absence in the subpopulation

579
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:01,079
of British Columbia we also saw that

580
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:03,558
this um

581
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:05,798
subpopulation have also a reduction of

582
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:07,879
caners formation which made us think

583
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:10,038
that those clusters might be the good

584
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,000
targets and might be implicated in

585
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:14,480
pathogenicity so I had two of my

586
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,599
graduate students Joshua Sparks and Cole

587
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,798
Sawyer who actually graduated last week

588
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:22,000
uh working on uh characterizing those

589
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:24,839
two clusters and doing The Knockouts of

590
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,839
their backbone genes to validate uh

591
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:28,678
their implications and

592
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:32,119
pathogenicity so the work work on the

593
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:33,960
clan 3571 is still in its earlier stages

594
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:35,759
and it's known to incode for an unknown

595
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,640
metabolite so it's a little bit more

596
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:40,398
challenging than the work on Clan 3030

597
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,038
which I'm going to be focusing on uh

598
00:25:40,398 --> 00:25:45,519
today because this clan is predicted to

599
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:48,119
encode for a metabolite that is known

600
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:51,558
and identified in other fungi but not in

601
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:54,278
Esa to be appenine like B synthetic Gene

602
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:57,278
cluster so Cole has worked on

603
00:25:54,278 --> 00:26:02,000
characterizing uh this cluster uh that

604
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:05,599
is predicted to be uh um um formed with

605
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
11 putative biosynthetic genes and of

606
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:10,278
those genes as I talked earlier there's

607
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,798
a specific transcription factor which is

608
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:15,079
Gene highlighted in pink AP andh so what

609
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:17,119
is the role of this specific

610
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:19,079
transcription Factor when a cluster of

611
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:22,439
genes contain a specific transcription

612
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:24,678
Factor it works as a switch so when this

613
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,600
genes is expressed the rest of the genes

614
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:28,720
would be expressed and when it's knocked

615
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:30,798
out or not expressed the the rest of the

616
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,360
genes would be turned off and therefore

617
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:35,119
we won't have a production of this

618
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:37,119
metabolite so using the crisper tool

619
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,719
Cole was able and this is the guide RNA

620
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:42,439
sequence that he designed he was able to

621
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,558
knock out uh this specific transcription

622
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,840
factor and later he conducted the

623
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:49,038
transcriptomic analysis to confirm that

624
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:51,359
the rest of the genes are also turned

625
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:53,240
off when this um uh specific

626
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,839
transcription factors is

627
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,720
deleted and yes we actually confirmed

628
00:26:55,839 --> 00:27:00,038
that all the genes in the cluster were

629
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,839
significant ly downregulated in those

630
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:05,398
mutants we also conducted metabolomic

631
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:08,439
analysis to confirm that this cluster

632
00:27:05,398 --> 00:27:10,639
actually belong and encodes for appenine

633
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,880
uh by running it through a standard that

634
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,320
is the appenine uh commercialized the

635
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,399
standard and as we can see here the wild

636
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:20,558
type is able to produce appenine whereas

637
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:24,359
the three independent mutants that uh

638
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:28,000
Cole has selected um did not uh produce

639
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:29,639
atpenin on both tested media PDA and GMM

640
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,200
can confirming that this cluster is

641
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,919
encoding for AP penine and all the genes

642
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,000
are downregulated when the specific

643
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,919
transcription factors is knocked out we

644
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,519
also later conducted pathogenicity

645
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:43,360
experiments so similar to what we done

646
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:45,359
in the ecp2 mutants um we conducted

647
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:48,000
those pathogenicity experiments by

648
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:50,038
spraying uh different popular genotypes

649
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,398
with the spores collected from the wild

650
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:55,640
type and the mutants and to our surprise

651
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:57,959
we were expected to see a significant

652
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,399
downregulation of the disease severity

653
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:03,079
as as well as the kers per centimeters

654
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:05,398
but to our surprise um we did not see

655
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:08,240
any differences between the wild type

656
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:11,199
and the mutants inoculated plants uh

657
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,038
which actually um kind of contradict our

658
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,240
original hypothesis that this compound

659
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:18,879
uh could be implicated in pathogenicity

660
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,720
but since atpenin is already

661
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,240
characterized as an antifungal compound

662
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,640
we wanted to look at since this pathog

663
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,798
this metabolite is not implicated in

664
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,440
pathogenicity what is actually the

665
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:33,879
ecological function of this compound is

666
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,080
it really regulating the microbiome so

667
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,000
to test this hypothesis call has

668
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:40,480
selected different fungi that are

669
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,839
associated with popper uh here I'm

670
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,960
showing just results from uh two

671
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:47,879
pathogens uh sorry two fungi that were

672
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,278
uh selected and were isolated from

673
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,559
popler we have Laria bolar and

674
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:56,038
tricoderma gamy which are beneficial

675
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:58,398
fungi and as we can see when the fungus

676
00:28:56,038 --> 00:29:00,919
is growing alone we were able to measure

677
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:03,959
uh the growth and we also did pairwise

678
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:07,000
interactions or co-cultures uh where uh

679
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:10,759
Cole grew his um mutants and his wild

680
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,519
type along with um the wild type of

681
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:16,599
tricoderma gamy and the Cara byor and as

682
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:19,120
we can see when um the appenine is not

683
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:21,398
produced by the mutants we did not see

684
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:23,479
any reduction of the growth whereas when

685
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:25,359
we grow it with the wild type and aine

686
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,159
is actually produced we saw a

687
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:28,719
significant reduction of the growth of

688
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:31,039
both um

689
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,278
uh fungi in tricoderma and Laria by

690
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:34,398
colar we saw significant uh decrease of

691
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:37,000
the

692
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:39,558
growth and then here after that we

693
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,960
confirmed that adenine is not a verance

694
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:44,759
factor uh we were able to use this

695
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:47,200
crisper tool and characterize an ancient

696
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:49,480
biosynthetic Gene cluster that was found

697
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,120
to be Pro providing a competitive

698
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:56,278
ecological advantage to our pathogen

699
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:56,278
over other uh popular Associated

700
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:02,278
fungi so we also beside looking at anti

701
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:06,000
smatch predicting what is absent what is

702
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:09,398
present in uh some of those 122 isolate

703
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,079
of Asa we used also another approach to

704
00:30:09,398 --> 00:30:14,518
identify secondary metabol that might be

705
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:17,079
implicated in pathogenicity and this

706
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:19,839
approach rely on modulating the

707
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:21,678
expression of global Regulators so as I

708
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:24,480
as we have like specific transcription

709
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:27,038
factors we also have a global Regulators

710
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,599
or Global transcription factors uh and

711
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:32,200
they are commonly found in all fungi and

712
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:34,719
they regulate the production of seconder

713
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,880
metabolite by regulating the expression

714
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,720
of specific biotic gen clusters and a

715
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:42,880
lot of those metabolites were found to

716
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,720
be implicated in pathogenicity or in the

717
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,080
interaction with neighboring

718
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,798
microbes and in the past when I used

719
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:53,879
this approach in my uh PhD and in my

720
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:56,200
postdoc um I was able to identify

721
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,960
different metabolites that were able to

722
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,240
either playing a role in regulating my

723
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,519
microbiomes or in pathogenicity so in

724
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,880
this first study uh when I did a

725
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:07,919
knockout of f which is a global

726
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,278
regulator uh I was able to identify

727
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,880
serotine which is a compound that I was

728
00:31:10,278 --> 00:31:14,960
able to find that is playing a crucial

729
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,360
role in regulating the chees rine

730
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,319
microbiome and a different a study when

731
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:21,798
I did it on a penicilium expansum which

732
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:24,038
is a post Harvest PL pathogen and I did

733
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:26,480
a knockout of another Global regulator

734
00:31:24,038 --> 00:31:29,119
Crea I was able as we can see on this

735
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,440
apple um the mutants were nearly

736
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:33,558
avirulent and when we did metabolomics

737
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,440
and transcriptomic I was able to

738
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:38,359
identify two biosynthetic Gene clusters

739
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:41,159
one that is encoding for pyin and the

740
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:42,678
other one for citrine that were

741
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:46,080
essential for

742
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:48,320
pathogenicity um so we decided um since

743
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:50,720
this approach has been proven to be very

744
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:53,000
effective in other pathosystems to use

745
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,360
this approach on sperina missa popular

746
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,960
pathosystem to see if that would help us

747
00:31:55,359 --> 00:32:00,000
pinpointing to certain metabolites that

748
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,480
can be implicated in

749
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,200
pathogenicity so we did a knockout of Le

750
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:08,120
a in ASA and when we conducted

751
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:11,278
pathogenicity experiment we showed as we

752
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:13,759
can see here a significant reduction of

753
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:16,599
a leaf disease severity across all the

754
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:19,599
genotypes tested except for one and we

755
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:21,678
also saw a reduction of uh caners per

756
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:24,398
centimeters in certain genotypes but not

757
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:27,038
in the others um which indicate that

758
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:30,079
that could be an actually very effective

759
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:32,480
strategies to looking at or identifying

760
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:35,519
or characterizing uh biosynthetic Gene

761
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,599
clusters implicated in pathogenicity and

762
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,960
we're taking this uh to doing

763
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:42,398
metabolomics and transcriptomic Analysis

764
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,639
that would help us seeing what are the

765
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:47,199
Clusters that are down regulator in our

766
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:49,599
L A mutants and what are the metabolites

767
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,278
that are not produced which could be

768
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:53,759
like good targets uh for pathogenicity

769
00:32:52,278 --> 00:32:56,720
and of course later we have to do a lot

770
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:59,839
of other um validations like what I did

771
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,839
in my previous studies

772
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:04,119
so while we are continuously working on

773
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,960
identifying genetic determins of

774
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:08,278
pathogenicity that could serve as

775
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:11,798
targets for the development of the genan

776
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:16,159
drive um we actually decided uh to start

777
00:33:11,798 --> 00:33:18,398
working on uh advancing um This research

778
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:21,880
and actually started developing the gene

779
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:24,638
Drive um on uh I'm gonna talk about it

780
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:27,799
later on the PKS Gene of the melanin

781
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:30,278
pathway but first what is a gene Drive

782
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:32,759
so when we have an irregular mandelian

783
00:33:30,278 --> 00:33:35,240
inheritance and we have an alter Gene

784
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:37,839
this Gene will only have a 50% a chance

785
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:40,839
to be pass to the progeny and therefore

786
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:42,798
after many populations and multiple

787
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:46,278
progenies this Gene would actually be

788
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:49,480
diluted and not present anymore whereas

789
00:33:46,278 --> 00:33:52,079
when we have this alter Gene compined to

790
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,679
the cast 9 and the guide RNA which what

791
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:57,359
we called a dri's train during the

792
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:59,399
meeting the cast nine would be able to

793
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,439
generate a cut because the guide RNA

794
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:04,319
will guide the cast n to this specific

795
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,558
region on the wild type chromosome and

796
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:09,039
then this cut would be repaired by hom

797
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:11,519
homology directed repair transferring

798
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:13,398
this drive Machinery to the wild type

799
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:15,199
chromosome and therefore the wild type

800
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:18,159
strain would also becoming a drive

801
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:21,199
strain and that that Gene would have a

802
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:23,838
nearly 100% chance of transferring to

803
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,239
the progeny so that's how a crisper cast

804
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:27,719
9 Gene Drive

805
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:30,039
function this tool has been widely used

806
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:33,319
used in disease vectors to eradicate

807
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:35,199
diseases like malaria and zika so it has

808
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,240
been developed on mosquitoes and other

809
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:39,678
disease vectors but it has never been

810
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:44,118
done before on a filamentous fungal

811
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:47,960
pathogen um but to be able to develop a

812
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:50,159
gene Drive um the organism of Interest

813
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:53,240
has to be having a sexual reproduction

814
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,760
or ability to mate uh and as I mentioned

815
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:58,399
already in the sperina life cycle if you

816
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,040
remember uh it has actually part of its

817
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:04,079
life cycle when it's on the leaves it

818
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:05,800
has a sexual reproduction uh stage

819
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,280
therefore this approach can seem

820
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,760
particularly promising for effective for

821
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:14,160
Effective population control in this

822
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,480
organism so as a proof of principle of

823
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:19,039
the gene drive applicability before we

824
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,920
actually go right away and test it on

825
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:24,199
genetic determinance of pathogenicity

826
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:26,358
which is our out um overarching goal we

827
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:28,239
decided to start working on a gene that

828
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:30,440
would allow us to see an easy

829
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:33,000
phenotyping therefore we decided to

830
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,240
Target the melanin pathway because when

831
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,440
the PKS gene or the backbone Gene of the

832
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:40,239
melanin pathway is knocked out the the

833
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,960
the fungus would have an albino

834
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:45,358
phenotype so instead of looking a dark

835
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,199
green or black it would look it would

836
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:50,838
have a white uh phenotype and that would

837
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:53,519
be easy for us to screen the progenies

838
00:35:50,838 --> 00:35:56,559
coming from this mating so we decided to

839
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:58,679
Target um this Gene and uh there's

840
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,880
something I did not mention earlier when

841
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:03,679
when we have an active Gene drive when

842
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,318
the cast 9 the alter Gene and the guide

843
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:08,960
RNA are localized next to each other on

844
00:36:06,318 --> 00:36:12,079
the same Locus we have what we called an

845
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,880
active Gene drive so even if it's uh

846
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:17,000
generating traits that are unwanted it

847
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,880
will be so active and it will spread

848
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,920
over multiple generation so in this case

849
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:24,400
since it's a proof of principle we

850
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,880
didn't want to design an active Gene

851
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,599
drive so we decided to design what was

852
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,119
called a safe guarding Gene drive so we

853
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:35,800
decided to insert the guide RNA at one

854
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:38,440
Locus which would be our PKS Gene uh to

855
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:41,200
interrupt its uh expression and we

856
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:44,159
decided to insert our cast line at a

857
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:46,159
different Locus um and that's in that

858
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,838
way the gene Drive won't be active

859
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:50,838
enough and it will be uh kind of like

860
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:53,920
safeguarded and

861
00:36:50,838 --> 00:36:56,960
contained um so this is how our uh

862
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,680
design for the genan drive um are so

863
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,240
first we're going to do a transformation

864
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:04,039
to insert the guide RNA at the PKS Locus

865
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:06,279
and we have another transformation on

866
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:09,079
the strain to insert the cast

867
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:11,640
9 at the pure G Locus because it will

868
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:14,599
allow an easy screening on foa

869
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:17,078
plates but a crucial Pro a problem for

870
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:19,760
synthetic a gene Drive is the evolution

871
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:21,839
of natural resistance against them so if

872
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,280
we have a mutation in the wild type

873
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:26,519
strain at the guide RNA site the guide

874
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,000
RNA won't be able to hybridize and

875
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:31,079
therefore the cast 9 won't won't be able

876
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
to cut to so as a first step forward

877
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:36,280
towards the establishment of this Gene

878
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,639
Drive uh we decided to look since we

879
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:42,400
have 122 isolates that are sequenced we

880
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:45,440
decided to leverage from that and we did

881
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:48,240
an alignment of the PKS Gene and we were

882
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:51,000
able to design three guide RNA that are

883
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:52,559
on conserved regions uh which can help

884
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,800
us predict what's going to happen in

885
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:57,119
nature uh making sure that those guide

886
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,920
RNA are not in regions that have natural

887
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,640
mut

888
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:05,639
patient um and we later tested those

889
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:07,440
three guide RNA on a substitute of this

890
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:10,279
population because it's a lot of work to

891
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:15,240
test it on all 122 isolates so we

892
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:17,519
selected based on um uh on this tree uh

893
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:21,118
a subset of this population so we tested

894
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:22,679
them on 29 uh isolates uh selected

895
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,960
across North

896
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:27,039
America and when we tested those guide

897
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,960
RNA so how does the test work we

898
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:32,039
actually sequence a region where the

899
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,800
guide rnas would be able to cut and then

900
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:38,119
um we hybridized the guide RNA and the

901
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,880
cast n to form a complex and we use them

902
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:41,838
kind of like a restriction enzyme to see

903
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,880
if they will cut in the sequence or not

904
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:46,318
so it's kind of like an invitro test for

905
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,559
the ability of the guide RNA to test to

906
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:51,119
cut and as we can see on this table

907
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:53,920
guide RNA 1 was able to cut in all the

908
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,400
tested strains whereas guide RNA 2

909
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,280
although it is uh designed in a similar

910
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,920
way uh considering efficiency

911
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,280
specificity and other criteria that are

912
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,200
essential for guide RNA design it did

913
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,280
not cut in any of the strains guide rna3

914
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:12,559
was able to cut in almost all of them

915
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,480
but not in all of them so from this um

916
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:17,318
uh quick screening we were able to see

917
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:20,199
that guide rna1 is the actual best

918
00:39:17,318 --> 00:39:24,119
candidate to go further with in our uh

919
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:26,919
Gene Drive design so Josh was able uh to

920
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:29,358
take this guide rna1 confirmed sequence

921
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,358
oops sorry

922
00:39:30,318 --> 00:39:35,358
sorry for that okay so after confirming

923
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:37,519
that the guide rna1 was our best

924
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:40,078
candidate Josh took this guy RNA

925
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:42,280
sequence and he designed a construct

926
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,960
that will cut in the PKS and he

927
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,599
performed the First Transformation and

928
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,079
here I'm showing some of the plates he's

929
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:50,039
actually still screening them by PCR and

930
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,920
whole genome sequencing but just wanted

931
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:54,199
to show how the phenotype of the wild

932
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,599
type look like so it's like uh sometimes

933
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:58,199
it's even darker green than that that's

934
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:00,200
how the wild type look like and that's

935
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:03,318
how the PKS phenotype look like and as

936
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:06,078
you can see like um they have a weird

937
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:08,000
phenotype which is we're really excited

938
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,519
about because that would help us uh

939
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,760
later on in the screening of the progeny

940
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:14,800
uh once we do the mating experiments so

941
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:18,079
do EST strin after Josh gonna confirm

942
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,960
them that they are uh correct they have

943
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,000
no cast nine off targets and any

944
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,838
anything like that he would use them to

945
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,079
introduce the second components of the

946
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:29,519
gene drive and the strain would be ready

947
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:32,240
to be tested in our uh mating essay that

948
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:33,800
we're actually working on developing so

949
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:36,919
just to give you a brief background on

950
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:40,000
how um we came up with this uh meeting

951
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:42,680
essay we were first able to see if we

952
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,920
were able to meet uh the esa strains in

953
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:47,879
vitro but we were not successful we

954
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,960
tested uh The Mating on detached leaves

955
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:52,358
but also that was really challenging

956
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,838
that because the the leaves were dry out

957
00:40:52,358 --> 00:40:56,039
uh and the meeting was

958
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:59,920
unsuccessful uh until we came out we

959
00:40:56,039 --> 00:41:03,079
came across uh this bioarchive

960
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,559
manuscript in zos septoria species which

961
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:08,640
is a closely related species to

962
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:12,000
Etha um and if you remember in the life

963
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:14,960
cycle where we showed that uh the sexual

964
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,079
reproduction actually occur on fall on

965
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,599
fallen leaves on the ground where the

966
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:21,318
sexual fruiting bodies will develop so

967
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,359
this essay actually we're trying to

968
00:41:21,318 --> 00:41:27,400
mimic the natural uh conditions for uh

969
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:29,719
for mating uh so we will use plants we

970
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:32,119
will spray them with two opposite mating

971
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:34,159
types uh and we will let the plants go

972
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:36,960
through their natural sence then we will

973
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:39,440
collect those sleaves uh and we will put

974
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,639
them under sterile conditions uh we'll

975
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,960
use like velcro to have a plates upside

976
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:49,078
down uh plates that have the selection

977
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,880
uh for our genetic events um and then um

978
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:53,280
those sexual spores will be able to

979
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,640
shoot and the cols will be forming on

980
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,560
those open plates and then later we will

981
00:41:55,639 --> 00:42:00,679
be able to uh look for the asport

982
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:02,639
derived colonies under the microscope

983
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:05,358
and we will for we will perform whole

984
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:08,159
genome sequencing to confirm uh The

985
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:10,838
Mating and the success of the

986
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:12,879
drive so this mating assay is actually

987
00:42:10,838 --> 00:42:14,719
ongoing right now we don't have results

988
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,480
from that yet but just wanted to show

989
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:18,799
you the approach that we're following

990
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,440
where we are actually really mimicking

991
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,720
the natural conditions for sexual

992
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:25,358
reproduction and this

993
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:28,159
pathogen and I would with that I would

994
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:31,000
like to conclude um I was able to show

995
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:32,879
you that uh how we were able to advance

996
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,679
the development of crisper cast 9

997
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:39,559
genetic tool in this non-model

998
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:41,279
organism how we used this crisper tools

999
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:44,319
uh and how we are still leveraging this

1000
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,040
tool um to uh pinpoint to crucial

1001
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:49,159
genetic uh factors influencing disease

1002
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:50,358
severities including affector genes and

1003
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:52,598
secondary

1004
00:42:50,358 --> 00:42:54,960
metabolites how we are taking that a

1005
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:57,559
step forward towards the development of

1006
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,720
the first crisper enabled Gene Drive

1007
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:03,119
aimed at eradicating uh Esa to protect

1008
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:05,879
and sustain popular plantations and

1009
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:08,760
although this approach uh offer Insight

1010
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:10,559
mainly on the ASA populis pathos system

1011
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,800
but it has the potential to be applied

1012
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:15,720
to other pathos system either in forest

1013
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:18,119
ecosystem as well as an agricultural

1014
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:20,159
settings and with that I would like to

1015
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:21,920
thank the ceds sa for funding This

1016
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:24,759
research I would like to thank our

1017
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,559
collaborators at Oregon State University

1018
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:29,040
uh I would like to thank my uh

1019
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,800
collaborator at ORNL and my research

1020
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:32,759
group and I would like to thank you all

1021
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,119
for attending this seminar and I would

1022
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,119
take any questions you might

1023
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,440
have thank you so much Dr Tannis that

1024
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:45,640
was wonderful um so yeah we're gonna

1025
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:47,800
open it up to questions now um so please

1026
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:50,159
feel free to either uh raise your hand

1027
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:53,119
directly unmute raise your hand or type

1028
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:57,558
in the chat and I will

1029
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:59,160
read go for it gallan thank you very

1030
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:04,240
much

1031
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:06,920
um can you compare crisper

1032
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:08,519
driven homologous

1033
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:14,318
recombination

1034
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:18,280
with uh non crisper approaches

1035
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:20,159
to homologous

1036
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,040
recombination you mean when we use a

1037
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:24,279
crisper for homologous Rec combination

1038
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:25,400
where we where uh we don't use crisper

1039
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:28,040
and we use like a standard

1040
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:32,639
transformation

1041
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:34,719
sorry is that the question yeah yeah so

1042
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:36,279
in the past actually before joining orl

1043
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:39,239
I was always using a standard

1044
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:42,920
transformation where we design our uh

1045
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:45,318
construct that have homology arms of 1kb

1046
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,159
to the C to the to the region that we

1047
00:44:45,318 --> 00:44:49,800
want to

1048
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:52,318
transform um but after using crisper I

1049
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,400
really see a great improvements in the

1050
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:56,279
specificity because before when I was

1051
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:59,559
using without the crisper to generate

1052
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:01,359
the cut our construct although designed

1053
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:03,480
to be specifically going to this

1054
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:06,078
specific region we saw that it was

1055
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,519
inserted in other multiple places in the

1056
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,880
genome so when we perform either whole

1057
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:13,318
genome sequencing or Southern blot we

1058
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,880
saw that our construct is like being

1059
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:18,079
inserted in different other places uh

1060
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,720
crisper has really improved the

1061
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:24,240
specificity because it actually generate

1062
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:25,519
a cut and most of those um donor DNA

1063
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:28,318
that we're inserting in our

1064
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:30,838
transformation would go towards this cut

1065
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:33,480
to repair the DNA double strand break so

1066
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:36,400
yeah we saw a great Improvement in h

1067
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:38,880
specificity and after we we do a whole

1068
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,800
genome sequencing we rarely find

1069
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,800
insertion on other

1070
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:46,039
lowai

1071
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:51,480
thanks

1072
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:57,880
um second question have you regarding

1073
00:45:51,480 --> 00:46:04,199
mating have you tried uh m

1074
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:04,200
both Partners on siness and

1075
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:13,959
poer so take H CEST leaves and try it on

1076
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:16,159
yeah yeah no we did not try that because

1077
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:18,599
um yeah that's a good question but

1078
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:20,639
there's another thing that we tried and

1079
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:23,000
we did I did not mention here we

1080
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:25,279
actually think that there's something

1081
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,039
coming from the leaves either an acate

1082
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:31,000
or something that is probably secreted

1083
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:33,480
during sinin that could be driving the

1084
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:37,199
mating uh so that's it was actually

1085
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:39,559
tomas's idea um he took sinast leaves

1086
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:42,000
and he did a metabolite extraction by

1087
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:45,000
Sol by using organic solvent and he was

1088
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,599
able later on to lyophilize this uh

1089
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,239
crude extract from sest leaves to see if

1090
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:53,400
there was any metabolites that could be

1091
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:55,879
secreted and be essential and he used it

1092
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:58,318
in an invitro setting so he used those

1093
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:02,240
crude extracts coming from CEST leaves

1094
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:04,480
into a media and try to do ating but we

1095
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:06,439
were we were we're still not successful

1096
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:10,480
so I don't know if it's actually really

1097
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:13,400
the plant material that is essential um

1098
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:16,079
not just metabolite uh that could be on

1099
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:18,400
those sinast leaves um but yeah we did

1100
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,920
not try it on sinast leaves we we

1101
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,838
decided to go with the the actual

1102
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:27,519
natural cence going on rather than like

1103
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:29,599
take CEST leaves and spray them but that

1104
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:32,838
can also be an approach to

1105
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,838
take thank

1106
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:39,239
you I have one um that so it's uh it's

1107
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:41,439
not directly related to your

1108
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:42,879
extraordinary scientific content um but

1109
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,280
one of the things I was wondering if you

1110
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,920
might uh reflect on for the sake of our

1111
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,519
graduate students in the audience um

1112
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,000
what your experience is working at a

1113
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:53,599
National Lab environment um you've had

1114
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,679
diverse experience at different types of

1115
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,200
universities and I was just wondering if

1116
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:58,519
maybe like to their perspective Ive you

1117
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:00,199
know they're exploring different career

1118
00:47:58,519 --> 00:48:02,358
options um what's it like to work at a

1119
00:48:00,199 --> 00:48:04,039
national lab and how might they best

1120
00:48:02,358 --> 00:48:06,318
prepare themselves for that career

1121
00:48:04,039 --> 00:48:09,639
option if they're interested in pursuing

1122
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:11,880
it sure yeah um I was actually so

1123
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:16,159
interested in academic Physicians before

1124
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:18,358
joining ORNL uh I did a post dog at U

1125
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:22,078
which was like um yeah an academic post

1126
00:48:18,358 --> 00:48:23,960
dog um so after working at ORNL I I

1127
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,240
really liked the environment and the

1128
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:28,079
dynamic uh the next thing I really liked

1129
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:31,399
about orl and I believe a lot of

1130
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:34,359
National Labs are the same is that uh we

1131
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:36,960
have like within um so under the same

1132
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:40,400
umbrella of ORNL we have different

1133
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,920
expertise so we have uh so in within the

1134
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:46,079
bioscience for example we have the

1135
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:48,039
computational science uh we have um the

1136
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:51,160
analytical groups so they they do all

1137
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:54,798
our lcms uh we have like the genetic

1138
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:58,399
group um so that really helped instead

1139
00:48:54,798 --> 00:49:01,519
of uh going and seeking for external

1140
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,639
collaborators um to be able to do

1141
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:06,159
everything under the same umbrella and

1142
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:08,078
same institution uh and that like we

1143
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:12,519
find it that it it saved us a lot of

1144
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:14,559
time and a lot of uh efforts um and it's

1145
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:17,159
kind of like each one would focus on its

1146
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:19,920
expertise so you don't have to be doing

1147
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:21,399
everything um sometimes for certain

1148
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,559
people it's good for certain people they

1149
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:25,519
like to be doing everything from A to Z

1150
00:49:23,559 --> 00:49:28,519
so in Academia for example I was the

1151
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:31,318
person doing the genetic the analytical

1152
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:33,199
um the pathogenicity experiments uh and

1153
00:49:31,318 --> 00:49:36,920
sometimes like the bioinformatic and

1154
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:40,838
computational um I feel like in at orl

1155
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:43,159
specifically um we have this like a

1156
00:49:40,838 --> 00:49:45,358
inter teams collaborations where

1157
00:49:43,159 --> 00:49:47,679
everyone works towards the same goal So

1158
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:49,639
within the stas sa for example uh

1159
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:52,558
there's a teams of uh bacterial

1160
00:49:49,639 --> 00:49:55,159
geneticist uh fungal geneticist uh

1161
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,960
fungal biologist computational science

1162
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:59,159
analytical and that's like with within

1163
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,599
one Science Focus area and a lot of

1164
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:03,639
other projects are the same way and we

1165
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,440
find that that really Advanced the

1166
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:08,598
science uh in a speedy

1167
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:10,760
way I don't know if that answered the

1168
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:11,680
question oh it totally does awesome um

1169
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,520
is there anything that you might

1170
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:15,118
recommend for um a graduate student

1171
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:17,358
perhaps or a postto talk that might be

1172
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,079
interested in pursuing a career um at a

1173
00:50:17,358 --> 00:50:21,119
National Lab like oid is there anything

1174
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:24,000
in particular you'd recommend they do or

1175
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:25,680
Reach Out resources uh so we all like

1176
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,599
for a graduate student they would have

1177
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:30,639
to be associated so uh we're all

1178
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:32,920
associated with uh the University of

1179
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:35,078
Tennessee Knoxville to be able to take a

1180
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:37,559
graduate student so they will take their

1181
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:40,839
classes at utk but they do their

1182
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:42,359
research at ORNL um for graduate

1183
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:43,838
students I meant like if they would

1184
00:50:42,358 --> 00:50:45,759
wanted to be in a position like yours

1185
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:48,000
one day like what they might okay as

1186
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,319
like a post for example so we always

1187
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,798
have yeah like post do positions open

1188
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:54,039
sometimes when we go to conferences like

1189
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:57,759
and we have a position that is open uh

1190
00:50:54,039 --> 00:51:00,079
we'll try to like um like talk about it

1191
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,799
and what are the expertise then like you

1192
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:03,559
would apply to every open positions

1193
00:51:01,798 --> 00:51:06,039
there's a lot of positions that comes

1194
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:07,359
out every week not necessarily in our

1195
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:09,960
division but there's several

1196
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:12,239
directorates at ORNL and each one would

1197
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:14,159
have open positions uh and as a post

1198
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:17,000
talk usually it's for two years up to a

1199
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:19,920
renewal for a third year um in terms of

1200
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,599
transitioning from postto to staff

1201
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:25,119
scientist

1202
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:27,960
um it's not always like it happened

1203
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:30,559
because at orl they usually don't hire

1204
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:32,440
people that do the same thing so for

1205
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:35,798
example for me and Tomas we both are

1206
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:37,639
fungal people uh but each one of them

1207
00:51:35,798 --> 00:51:40,079
each each one of us actually does

1208
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:41,920
different things so to be able to be

1209
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,960
hired as a staff scientist you really

1210
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:47,519
have to distinguish yourself from other

1211
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:50,119
um existing scientists or staff

1212
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:52,318
scientist um so where Tomas for example

1213
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:56,039
he does not do genetics at all I'm the

1214
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:57,119
only fungal geneticist at RL um I don't

1215
00:51:56,039 --> 00:51:59,400
know if that

1216
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:01,318
answer the question no I certainly think

1217
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:03,519
so thank you um and I think we have time

1218
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:06,119
for one more question from the chat we

1219
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:08,400
have um Isabelle jackmont Parks asks um

1220
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:09,798
she says hi amazing talk I agree I

1221
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,639
really appreciate your Insight you

1222
00:52:09,798 --> 00:52:13,440
mentioned there are some resistant pop

1223
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:16,159
genotypes do you know if crisper is

1224
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:18,880
being used for the pop genome to address

1225
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:20,639
pathogens rather than the fungus yeah

1226
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:23,000
actually the the research on the plant

1227
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:25,440
is way more advanced compared to fungi

1228
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,960
and that's what I mentioned earlier like

1229
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:30,480
uh we have a sci us at orl that does a

1230
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:33,039
lot of crisper work on they're they're

1231
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,880
actually developing biosensors right now

1232
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:38,318
to be able to detect the pathogens at

1233
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:41,000
early State at early stages um so yeah

1234
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:43,079
the the research on the crisper on the

1235
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,480
plant part is way more advanced whereas

1236
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:47,839
when I joined as a post dog we did not

1237
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,599
have any genetic tool to even manipulate

1238
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:51,920
the fungus was like really a non-model

1239
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:54,519
organisms even if you look in terms of

1240
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:57,400
Publications there was barely like three

1241
00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:58,960
Publications on the pathogen um so it

1242
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:01,599
was really challenging at the beginning

1243
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:04,798
to start like from scratch uh whereas

1244
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:06,960
for popular the research is on on

1245
00:53:04,798 --> 00:53:09,480
another high

1246
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:14,280
level wonderful thank you so much for

1247
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:16,719
joining us presentation so either like

1248
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:19,440
you know Round of Applause or just Kudos

1249
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:22,439
so weird and please if if everyone if

1250
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:24,480
anyone have questions or something that

1251
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:26,159
maybe I did not touch on during my

1252
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:29,318
presentation for the limitation of the

1253
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:30,879
time please feel free to email me and um

1254
