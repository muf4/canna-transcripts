1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,480
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,480
university

3
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:13,919
thanks alan let's see if that stays up

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,759
there so it's it's fun i've been the

5
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:17,278
director of the national museum now for

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,879
23 months

7
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,239
and it's a pretty phenomenal place

8
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,759
you've probably all been there at one

9
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:23,518
form or another as a visitor we get

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,600
seven million visitors

11
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,598
a year which makes it the most visited

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,480
natural shoe museum in the world

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,920
and there's 127 million objects in the

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,160
collections

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,239
and 400 scientists

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,959
last year did research in 70 countries

17
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,799
and published 392 new species

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,399
so it's a pretty cool place

19
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,679
complicated place to get your hands

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,280
around

21
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,359
what's cool for me about it the reason i

22
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,079
came from denver to the museum was that

23
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,840
of those 7 million visitors 85 percent

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,759
of them are unique

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,680
visitors they're tourists which means

26
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,679
that every year there's a different 85

27
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,119
percent of 7 million which means over a

28
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,479
decade we'll see something like 60

29
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,000
million people

30
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,279
in the building

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,040
which is amazing which means that

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,920
equivalent of 20 percent of our nation

33
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,280
will walk into that building in a decade

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,280
so it makes it one of the most

35
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:13,840
visited

36
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,079
informal science places in the world if

37
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:20,719
not the most and that was what attracted

38
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,319
me there was this perception that

39
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,158
it's really important

40
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,559
that we communicate with people about

41
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,520
science in a very effective way

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,560
and we know that

43
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,959
kids

44
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,478
are scientists because they're curious

45
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,719
and

46
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,640
somehow they lose that curiosity some of

47
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,039
them do some of them don't

48
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,200
but whatever it is that persuades people

49
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,720
to keep being curious part of that is

50
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,799
this perception that science is a

51
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,798
valuable part of our culture so it's an

52
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,560
interesting place to be working because

53
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,759
the potential is huge the potential to

54
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,879
put those 127 million objects those 400

55
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,280
scientists and those seven million

56
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,679
visitors together and stir them up

57
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,159
is pretty cool as a potential and um

58
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,600
it's fun to come here to cornell i came

59
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,920
because i was invited by alejandro

60
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,159
gondolfo long-time collaborator she and

61
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,759
i have worked in patagonia for a long

62
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:13,039
time and amazing projects and related to

63
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,399
what i'm talking about today but i'm not

64
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:15,840
going to talk about the patagonian stuff

65
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,480
so make sure you get alejandro up here

66
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,598
to give a talk about the cool patagonian

67
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,840
projects

68
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,919
soon i also came to visit david skorton

69
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,159
who is uh your president and soon to be

70
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:28,238
our secretary of the smithsonian

71
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,239
and uh the handoff's gonna occur

72
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,439
sometime next spring he's gonna come to

73
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,719
the smithsonian on july 15th so it's uh

74
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,800
it's great to get back in cornell and

75
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,318
thanks for inviting me

76
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,200
i want to talk about

77
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:43,679
the origins of biomes and if you look at

78
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,439
this map of the tree canopy of the world

79
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,959
today you see that the world is by and

80
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,359
large

81
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,120
not that forested but the forests that

82
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,400
do exist occur in some pretty distinct

83
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,640
patterns you can see the tropical

84
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,760
rainforests you can see the bands of

85
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,279
boreal forest you can see the coastal

86
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,039
rain forests and you can see the

87
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,400
deciduous forest and then a whole lot of

88
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,598
white space

89
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,519
but as a paleontologist

90
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,439
who thinks about deep time the evolution

91
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,039
of plants but also the evolution of the

92
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,959
landscapes that host different kinds of

93
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,919
plants in particular trees i kind of

94
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,479
wonder how that pattern came to be

95
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:21,439
and with geologic time you have both the

96
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,359
evolution of different plant lineages

97
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,359
you also have the continents themselves

98
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,879
are in play the continents are moving at

99
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,120
some fairly good speeds actually

100
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,239
continents kind of trip along until at

101
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,680
certain points in earth history

102
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,560
continents can move several inches a

103
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,120
year

104
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,640
and over the millions of years of time

105
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,680
over which plant evolution is happening

106
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:39,439
the continents are moving around and

107
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,920
bang into each other

108
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,158
and we have this phenomenal

109
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,798
fossil record on the planet and i think

110
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,798
we're so lucky that our planet buries

111
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,680
its dead

112
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,439
right

113
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,879
it didn't have to be that way you could

114
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,639
imagine a scenario where planet didn't

115
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:55,759
bury its dead but because of the rock

116
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,598
cycle

117
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,438
as mountains erode and the debris from

118
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,839
mountains gets deposited in low-lying

119
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:04,000
areas the corpses of plants and animals

120
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,158
get buried and entombed and those layers

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,799
of rock

122
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:10,959
hold the record of the planet and so we

123
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,280
can ask sort of ask the question how did

124
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,438
that modern configuration of forests

125
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,279
actually come to be what was the pathway

126
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,358
to get there

127
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,958
and uh we've got additional information

128
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,439
that's kind of interesting and useful

129
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,519
this is uh dana royer's curve that shows

130
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,240
the last 600 million years

131
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,319
of

132
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,680
our best gas at carbon dioxide in the

133
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,079
atmosphere

134
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,519
and our best guess of when ice

135
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,918
was prevalent and one of the biggest

136
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:38,399
surprises for most people is that our

137
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:40,560
present planet a planet that's frigid on

138
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,159
the ends and warm in the middle

139
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,639
in fact was not always frigid at the

140
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,960
ends it's always been warm in the middle

141
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,560
but not frigid on the end so in fact the

142
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,560
periods of ice

143
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,280
there are two great big ice house

144
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,879
periods one around 300 million years ago

145
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,519
and one for the last 34 million years

146
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:00,560
but for the vast majority of the last

147
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,560
600 million years the planet

148
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,399
has not had

149
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,839
polar ice caps

150
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,159
so our present world is kind of this

151
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:10,000
weird anomaly relative to the history of

152
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,160
the planet and that makes you wonder

153
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
about how forests fared

154
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,919
in these different worlds in these

155
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,918
greenhouse worlds so greenhouse world

156
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,279
ice house world two great big mega

157
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,879
patterns the last

158
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,918
70 million years

159
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:23,439
shows

160
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:24,879
warming at about

161
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,199
a warm planet at the end of the

162
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,600
cretaceous into the paleo scene with a

163
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,919
spike in the early easting at 55 million

164
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,759
years a really warm period of 50. then a

165
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,000
gradual decline

166
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,720
about 34 million years ago the passage

167
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,079
between antarctica and and south america

168
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,360
opens up and the world cools

169
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,959
dramatically

170
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,600
it warms back up in the myosin and it

171
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,959
cools to the present time period and we

172
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,800
don't really get

173
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:51,198
ice in the northern polar areas until

174
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,360
about 5 million years ago

175
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,520
so in fact

176
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,840
those earlier ice periods when there was

177
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,519
no land in the arctic were actually

178
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,439
unipolar

179
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,959
in their ice coverage so we're living in

180
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,519
a bipolar

181
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:07,439
icy world for the first time

182
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,719
in earth history for the last five or

183
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,560
six million years

184
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,520
so the present distribution of forests

185
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,759
must

186
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,279
arc through that story somehow the fact

187
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,879
that ice comes and goes the continents

188
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,478
move around

189
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,560
and i um

190
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,918
hopefully that will pop back up there

191
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,399
um i

192
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,399
ran into this dramatically when i was um

193
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,399
an undergraduate and got lucky enough to

194
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,079
spend two summers in ellesmere island

195
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,599
about 1500 miles north of the arctic

196
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,399
circle as part of a

197
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,800
expedition to the arctic in search of

198
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:39,198
eocene fossils a woman named mary dawson

199
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,120
at the carnegie museum in pittsburgh had

200
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,879
posited that

201
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,959
the fossils that were found in the paris

202
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,319
basin in london and the and the bighorn

203
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,279
base in wyoming were similar enough

204
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,479
there must have been an arctic

205
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,318
connection

206
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,599
during the eocene it said you know there

207
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,360
was some way that these

208
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,439
would cross over the arctic and she went

209
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,199
to the arctic with the idea of

210
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,680
finding the earliest

211
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,120
pre-ice age fossils in the arctic and

212
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,439
she went to ellsmere island which is an

213
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,478
amazing place it's the size

214
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:07,519
of england and it's got about 200 people

215
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:08,959
in it

216
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,639
mainly inuits

217
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,959
hopefully this will keep going on that's

218
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,680
elvesmere in the middle there and her

219
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,439
first trip in 79 she found fossils and

220
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,519
what she found was amazing she found

221
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,079
fossil crocodile teeth

222
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,120
1500 miles north of the arctic circle

223
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,279
which

224
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,439
was surprising to her

225
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,839
and everybody else

226
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:32,800
i went with her the next couple years

227
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:34,879
and flying around in this area that's so

228
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,360
far north that there are no

229
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,800
um trees at all in fact the one species

230
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,400
of woody plant is the arctic willow

231
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,038
which is prostrate so it's not even

232
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,359
bushes in this this latitude and this is

233
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:48,240
an area where the permafrost goes down

234
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,319
for over a kilometer in depth

235
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,240
the mean annual temperature is minus 30

236
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,479
degrees

237
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,560
there's three months of sunlight in the

238
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:57,918
summer and three months of darkness in

239
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,079
the winter and the further north you go

240
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:02,159
the more that that barrier is but if you

241
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,598
fly around you see tremendously thick

242
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,360
coal seams

243
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:06,800
and the coal seams themselves are full

244
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,199
of those white rocks when in close

245
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,439
inspection are actually tree stumps

246
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,598
so here we are 2 000 miles north of the

247
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:17,038
nearest tree

248
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:18,399
and there are stone tree stumps

249
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,560
when you date these rocks they date

250
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,638
around 55 to 60 million years old so the

251
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,879
peak of that warming

252
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,038
instead of ice caps you have forests

253
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,400
which is a pretty amazing observation i

254
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,318
mean i think if you had to say two words

255
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:33,278
anybody talk about the impact of climate

256
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,639
change just say the words polar forests

257
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,639
or alaskan palms

258
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,719
and here's these forests they're lying

259
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,478
there and the coal seams are amazing we

260
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,480
found coal seams that are up to

261
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,399
up to 150 feet thick so some of the

262
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,519
thickest coal seams in the world

263
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,559
are actually polar forest coal seams

264
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,080
and

265
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,199
if you rummage around in the in the

266
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,639
footage of these coal seams you find

267
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,120
ample vegetation the conifers are not

268
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:03,120
the pinease that you find populated in

269
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,679
the boreal forests of today

270
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,240
they're in fact relatives of metasequoia

271
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,599
sequoia glyptostrobus

272
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,680
the cyprus

273
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,519
the warm conifers that are present

274
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,000
mainly in places like the gulf of mexico

275
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,679
and mexico and the yellow river in china

276
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,519
the mid-latitude warm conifers and these

277
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,199
are the dominant conifers

278
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,720
and you find a variety of other things

279
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,879
like these fragments and paleontologists

280
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,839
and paleobotanists are experts in

281
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:31,439
fragments we primarily deal in fragments

282
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,640
so you might not immediately see that as

283
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,000
the

284
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,278
besides the fact that it's totally out

285
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,519
of focus

286
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,838
you might not recognize that as a um the

287
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,759
center part of the lumbo

288
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,760
so we can tweak this i'm sort of missing

289
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,200
about half right it comes and goes okay

290
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,958
just thinking

291
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,080
um and here i notice as i'm walking

292
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,518
around the campus today there's tons of

293
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,240
beautiful sort of film trees on the

294
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,679
campus here and cersei the film is one

295
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,600
of the more common things that we see in

296
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,519
these polar forests so you have this

297
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,278
interesting world that kind of looks

298
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,720
like central china

299
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:02,000
except it's 2000 miles north of the

300
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,639
arctic circle

301
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,440
so those early trips in 84 and 85

302
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:09,838
drilled into my brain that the planet

303
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,560
is really different today

304
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,720
from what it was 50 million years ago i

305
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,639
mean dramatically different and here's a

306
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,800
a diorama that i built for the american

307
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,639
museum in new york of

308
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,559
the high arctic

309
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,319
55 million years ago and you have a

310
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:27,119
dense forest you have these big griffith

311
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,800
animals they're flying lemurs there's

312
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,959
crocodiles and turtles and snakes

313
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:34,159
there's lotuses

314
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,278
that's your arctic in the warm world

315
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:37,759
and one of the things we've learned

316
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:39,120
about the gradient is today if you think

317
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,039
about the temperature gradient from the

318
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,799
equator to the pole

319
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,958
minus 30 degrees

320
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,719
at the pole plus 30 degrees at the

321
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,319
equator today so this from the equator

322
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,639
to the pole today there's a 60 degree

323
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,320
centigrade gradient a mean angle

324
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,159
temperature

325
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,920
in the eocene

326
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,679
the equator was somewhat warmer we don't

327
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:58,879
know exactly how much but let's say 35

328
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,319
degrees c

329
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,078
and it looked like the polar regions had

330
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,839
a meaningless temperature around 10 or

331
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:06,719
15 degrees

332
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,800
so the gradient is much much smaller

333
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,759
another way to think about that is that

334
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:13,759
when climate changes it changes

335
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,480
much faster in the arctic regions in a

336
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:18,639
warming climate it'll it'll warm five to

337
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,240
six times faster than it does

338
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:21,519
at mid-latitudes

339
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,839
which is interesting because it means if

340
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,200
you want to see the future now

341
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,480
go to the arctic because it's happening

342
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,360
faster

343
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,560
there now so here's the arctic today

344
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,560
i mean if you go up there it's quite a

345
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,879
phenomenal place because it's an ice

346
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,518
scape and it's both the permafrost on

347
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:40,399
land and the floating sea ice at sea

348
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,320
and in 2005 there was an amazing paper

349
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,519
published by an american european

350
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,360
coalition that had gone out to the

351
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,639
middle of the arctic ocean

352
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,639
and they uh there's a submerged

353
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,399
ridge in the arctic ocean called the le

354
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,838
mans off ridge

355
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,839
and

356
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,920
you can see the this uh ridge going

357
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,240
across it's now about eight thousand

358
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:02,958
feet down in the bottom of the ocean

359
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,360
and they drilled the lamana's off ridge

360
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,799
and brought up seafloor samples

361
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,000
expecting to see

362
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:11,838
the

363
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,440
marine foram the marine plankton record

364
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,880
of the ancient arctic ocean and what

365
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,680
they found was really startling they

366
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:17,759
found

367
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,439
the spores of the floating aquatic

368
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,360
fernanzola

369
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,079
so you have an arctic ocean

370
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,919
that in fact not only wasn't producing

371
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:27,919
marine forams it was producing fresh

372
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:30,240
water fern spores

373
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:33,039
in great abundance and here's you've all

374
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,360
seen a zola that's what it looks like

375
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:38,000
and there were layers in these rocks

376
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,800
that are 47 to 50 million years old of

377
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,078
azola spores so you have this crazy

378
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,000
situation

379
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:45,919
of an arctic ocean that

380
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,120
must have had a freshwater lens on it

381
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,958
which makes some sense that you have a

382
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,278
closed basin a freshwater runoff into

383
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:53,838
the arctic ocean so a freshwater lens

384
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:55,120
lake floating on top of a deep saltwater

385
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,279
basin

386
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,120
and on top of that lake we're floating

387
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,519
aquatic ferns so

388
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,120
um here's a lake in amazonia i love

389
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,560
going to amazon it's a great bus man's

390
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,759
holiday if you ever want to go

391
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,958
experience delightful times but out in

392
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:10,639
central amazonia there are these

393
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,159
gigantic lakes that are so big you can

394
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,200
get on a small boat not see the edge of

395
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,879
the lakes

396
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,639
and the lakes are often totally covered

397
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,559
in zola

398
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,039
so here's an amazonian lake that is

399
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,559
actually the arctic ocean

400
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,399
of 50 million years ago which is you

401
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,159
know actually kind of a very compelling

402
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,919
thought to realize the planet has

403
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,719
changed that much

404
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,838
and most people you know have no idea of

405
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,560
the arctic

406
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,200
wasn't always polar and in fact polar

407
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,879
arctics well that is technically polar

408
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,879
let's just say frigid

409
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,879
phrygic arctics turn out to be

410
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,958
the exception not the rule and it's

411
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,480
pretty unclear exactly how the physics

412
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,078
of that works because we all know that

413
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,600
there's more sun at the equator and less

414
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,919
of the poles and the earth's tilt is

415
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,600
still there so how you keep the arctic

416
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:57,360
warm in a dark winter is an unresolved

417
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,360
mystery that some modeling progress on

418
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,600
but we don't understand that exactly and

419
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,959
it's not like this is just a chunk of

420
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,040
land that floated up there because we

421
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,359
have the same kinds of fossils all

422
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,198
around northern russia and in fact

423
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,879
antarctica as well so there's a very

424
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:14,159
good well-documented saga of warm polar

425
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:15,600
regions

426
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,679
in the warm world of the eocene and

427
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,360
paleocene

428
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:21,359
which sort of begged the question to me

429
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,839
when did tropical rainforests start

430
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,880
and the second part a little bit less

431
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,720
intuitive is where did they start

432
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,120
because they happen to be in equatorial

433
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,560
regions now we assume that they must

434
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,120
have started in the equatorial regions

435
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:42,078
but i think that might be flawed logic

436
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,000
now there's some argument for that and

437
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:47,519
just to sort of introduce you to my

438
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,480
basic tool which is the humble leaf

439
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,919
as a paleobotanist we find

440
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,079
leaves pretty frequently you could be a

441
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:56,879
paleobonus of your charcoalified flowers

442
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,559
like bill crepe and alejandra do here or

443
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,000
if can look at pollen grains and those

444
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,119
are all great ways to look at fossil

445
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,399
plants and fossil plants are great

446
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,480
because they

447
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,278
represent plants in many different forms

448
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,440
tree trunks pollen grains charcoalified

449
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:11,439
flowers or leaves but i'm a leaf guy

450
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,040
i like leaves and leaves are pretty

451
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,880
compelling things

452
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:16,639
and there's lots of them a single tree

453
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,838
can have like between 100 000 and a

454
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,680
million

455
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,959
leaves i mean i actually cut a tree down

456
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,078
once and counted the leaves just to

457
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,479
prove that

458
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,719
99 284

459
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,199
was the number of leaves on my tree her

460
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,879
50 foot tall red maple

461
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:33,919
and if you look at a leaf like this a

462
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:36,159
classic tropical rainforest leaf

463
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:39,039
it's got a couple of very distinctive

464
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:42,480
characteristics one a very smooth margin

465
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:43,679
and this elongate narrow tip also called

466
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,600
a drip tip

467
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,439
and this was noticed by a guy named

468
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,879
bailey who used to work here

469
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,839
back in the day

470
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:54,320
and published in 1915 this observation

471
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,320
that leaves are actually indicators of

472
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,560
climate that smooth margin leaves are

473
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,720
more common in warm climates

474
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,719
and that drip tips are indicative of

475
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,879
very wet places

476
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,320
in tropical rainforests

477
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:10,000
many of the leaves have these features

478
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,680
we did a survey in yashini in ecuador

479
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,759
and looked at 400 species and something

480
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,519
like 70 percent of the leaves had smooth

481
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,440
margins and elongated drip tips it's a

482
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,000
convergent forcing thing that show up in

483
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,120
tropical rainforest in very wet areas

484
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,399
not all

485
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,320
tropical rainforest leaves have drip

486
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,839
tips not all have smooth margins but the

487
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,160
percentage with smooth margins and drip

488
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,680
tips is much higher in wet tropical

489
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,759
rainforests

490
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:32,719
and here would be this is

491
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,839
actually

492
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,680
my bed spread in my hotel in

493
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,600
manaus and i've just laid out a sample

494
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:40,799
of leaves from an amazonian stroll in

495
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,399
the woods

496
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,838
and what you see is that by and large

497
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,839
the leaves are large they have smooth

498
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,320
margins a lot of them have drip tips

499
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,639
that's a classic tropical rainforest

500
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,278
modern tropical rainforest looking kind

501
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,198
of leaf assemblage

502
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,360
now this is a curve that shows you

503
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,958
without years but these are the stages

504
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,039
of the cretaceous period so buremian's

505
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,119
like 130 million years old cinematic is

506
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:06,480
about 95 million so it's from

507
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,720
130 to 95 and then from left to right is

508
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,599
paleo latitude with the equator in the

509
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,679
middle

510
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:14,078
north latitude to the right south to the

511
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,839
left and this shows the first occurrence

512
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:18,078
of angiosperm

513
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,678
pollen grains a very old slide there's

514
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,599
probably better slides showing this now

515
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,759
but what you see is that some of the

516
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,279
earliest angiosperms appear at low

517
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,679
latitudes

518
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,678
equatorial latitudes it's not a great

519
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,759
data set you can see there's a strong

520
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,280
bias towards mid mid latitude northern

521
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,879
hemisphere stuff which just reflects the

522
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:36,558
location of paleobotanists more than

523
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,200
anything else

524
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:41,839
but you see that by the cinemanian

525
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,558
at both poles north and south

526
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:46,798
angiosperms are present at the poles

527
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:49,519
so angiosperms appear darwin's

528
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,119
abominable mystery they appear

529
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,519
apparently right at the end of the

530
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:56,079
jurassic beginning of the cretaceous

531
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:58,558
apparently somewhere equatorially

532
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,918
and very rapidly cover the globe

533
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,000
so by a hundred million years you've got

534
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,240
angiosperms and pulled a pole in a world

535
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,759
with no ice you can do that

536
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,359
right so

537
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,519
you would think oh

538
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:10,798
there it is the first angiosperms are

539
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:12,720
equatorial

540
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,480
tropical rainforests are equatorial you

541
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,839
can read many textbooks that say well

542
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,519
tropical rainforests have been around

543
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,359
for hundreds of millions of years

544
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:20,558
they're they form the equators that's

545
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,479
why there's diversity because you have

546
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,960
they started there in a long time but if

547
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,558
you actually look at the fossils

548
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,720
these early

549
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:30,399
cretaceous fossils of angiosperms they

550
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,519
don't look like tropical rainforest

551
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,640
leaves

552
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:36,720
they're actually quite lobed and small

553
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,480
they don't have drip tips in fact

554
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,720
cretaceous leaves throughout the

555
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,558
cretaceous have a tendency to be a

556
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,558
variety of different shapes that might

557
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:46,160
even fit more with your mental image of

558
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:48,639
what a deciduous

559
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,400
forest would look like and that's not an

560
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,440
oak but it looks like an oak it's

561
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,880
probably more closely related to a

562
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,798
laurels but there's a lot of these

563
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,200
repeated shapes these load leaves are

564
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:58,558
pretty common in cretaceous floras

565
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,000
throughout the cretaceous and this in

566
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:02,319
fact this assemblage is from the last

567
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,480
two million years of the cretaceous

568
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:06,480
so you've got this world where

569
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,839
where you find them the leaves don't

570
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,319
really look like tropical rainforest

571
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:13,038
leaves and i spent a lot of time chasing

572
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:16,960
this problem around and i finally found

573
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:18,960
an equatorial flora in baharia oasis in

574
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,038
in egypt in 2000

575
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,160
and the leaves i found were small lobed

576
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:24,079
leaves

577
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,120
right on the equator 100 million years

578
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,319
ago

579
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,839
so it's an interesting question like

580
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:29,359
where you know if those are tropical

581
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:30,798
rainforests

582
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:32,558
when did they start and where do they

583
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,480
start starts to be a little bit more

584
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:35,839
compelling to me and if you look at a

585
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,679
reconstruction of the world 80 million

586
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:39,038
years ago which is in lake cretaceous

587
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,880
you're confronted by one kind of

588
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:43,279
dramatic fact which is

589
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,400
there wasn't that much land

590
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:48,000
at the equator 80 million years ago

591
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,320
so just even if you wanted to put

592
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,839
tropical rainforest at the equator

593
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:52,798
there's not really much place to put

594
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:54,240
them

595
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:56,000
you got to have land to put a forest on

596
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,079
it at the end of the day you can see

597
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,079
that the the great open ocean the tethy

598
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,558
sea separates north america and south

599
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,399
america separates africa and europe and

600
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:06,160
separates india and asia and separates

601
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,519
australia into malaya so there's a great

602
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,759
big east west

603
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,359
seaway in the cretaceous

604
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:13,919
that during the time of angiosperm

605
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:16,399
evolution and diversification

606
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,320
was clearly a barrier for the presence

607
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,600
of large tropical rainforests the big

608
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:20,960
exception being the northern tip of

609
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:22,480
south america

610
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,919
the northern part of africa and the

611
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,120
southern tip of india malaya so those

612
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,440
would be places you want to go look if

613
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:28,959
you want to answer that question

614
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,279
so again in mori

615
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,960
morley in 2000 published a book about a

616
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:35,918
very speculative book based on

617
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,960
pollinology primarily about the his

618
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,038
guess

619
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,640
of the origin of tropical rainforest and

620
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,158
he basically

621
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,480
proposed that

622
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,840
during the warm cretaceous if you warm

623
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,200
the planet up the equator gets

624
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:51,038
drier and then he sort of predicted two

625
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,319
sort of music wetter zones to the north

626
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:55,119
and the south

627
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:57,359
but a dry equatorial region

628
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,798
ziegler and his students in chicago

629
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,759
looking at the distribution of different

630
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:03,119
rock types have shown that the horse

631
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:05,679
latitudes

632
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,678
have been persistently dry through earth

633
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,038
history so you've got those deserts

634
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,159
north and south of the equator and the

635
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,720
question is

636
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:15,679
was there in fact any persistent wet

637
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,038
areas at the equatorial regions at all

638
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,400
now

639
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:20,879
the other way i backed into this

640
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,280
question was by studying the fossils of

641
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,120
the american west and in particular what

642
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,798
happened to plants

643
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,798
at the cretaceous tertiary boundary the

644
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:31,279
event where the asteroid strikes

645
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:34,000
smooshes the dinosaurs and my question

646
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:36,000
was what did it do to the ecosystems

647
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,919
and that involved collecting about 100

648
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,200
different quarry sites about 12 000

649
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,038
fossil leaves

650
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,440
in the rocks that had dinosaurs looking

651
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:46,558
at the pollen the leaves the dinosaurs

652
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,038
and what we saw there was a a diverse

653
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:50,960
lobed-leafed cretaceous flora gives way

654
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:52,960
to a very non-diverse

655
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,400
early paleocene flora

656
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,840
of basically wetland plants

657
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,519
and that was the picture we saw in north

658
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:02,000
dakota we took that work down to the

659
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,599
denver basin and when i moved to denver

660
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,919
in 1990 and started actually around

661
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,359
denver and denver turns out to be

662
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,200
an amazing place because it's in the

663
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,240
denver basin it's a it's a sedimentary

664
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,400
basin

665
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,960
that most of the rocks beneath downtown

666
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,759
denver are late cretaceous or

667
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,720
paleocene age so i moved to town the

668
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:19,839
first week i was there they were

669
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,960
building the denver international

670
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:24,158
airport and i got a call from a workman

671
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,798
out at the airport he said we found a

672
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,400
gigantic fossil fish

673
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:29,440
like that's awesome so i raced out to

674
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,840
the airport

675
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,840
and what they had found was a palm frond

676
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,880
which if you've never seen a palm or a

677
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:38,879
fish

678
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:44,879
might look like the tail of a fish

679
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,080
and we found huge palm fronds all over

680
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,400
the side of the airport when you fly

681
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:49,759
into dia you're flying into a paleocene

682
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,120
palm forest

683
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:52,640
and one of the most traumatic

684
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,599
experiences in my early character life

685
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,159
was watching a big track hole bury an 11

686
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:00,079
foot long pin 8 palm frond

687
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,880
on a big slab of rock that's underneath

688
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:05,038
like runway 2 right now

689
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,120
but i realized that come on i moved to a

690
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,279
museum that's literally built

691
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,599
on the kt boundary in fact the kt

692
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:13,038
boundary is in between the museum and

693
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,798
the airport

694
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:16,798
and downtown denver is in cretaceous

695
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:18,960
rocks and in 1992 we found a

696
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:20,720
tyrannosaurus rex in a backyard

697
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,759
it was the 11th known tyrannosaurus rex

698
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,360
at the time

699
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:25,119
we found several other dinosaurs in

700
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:28,079
neighborhoods in denver

701
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:29,759
and we started going out to construction

702
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,199
sites and one of the great things about

703
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,720
plants is they're more common than

704
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,240
animals

705
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,480
and so you might find one dinosaur but

706
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,400
for every dinosaur you'll find thousands

707
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,919
and thousands of leaves and we started

708
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,440
collecting fossils and we collected

709
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:45,038
about 200 sites in the denver area

710
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,519
and what was cool about denver was the

711
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:48,960
rocky mountains were coming up

712
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,038
exactly at the end of the cretaceous

713
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,319
period so the denver basin not only

714
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:53,759
recorded the cretaceous tertiary

715
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:55,599
boundary it also recorded the uplift of

716
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:56,879
the rocky mountains and the creation of

717
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:58,319
topography

718
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,320
so we had landscapes that range from

719
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:02,399
near montane out into flat swampy

720
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:04,798
landscapes we also had adaptive

721
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,038
conditions on a landscape as well as

722
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:08,960
change through time

723
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:10,720
and in 1994

724
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,919
i was sitting in my office and this guy

725
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,759
walked into my office and he had a

726
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,840
cardboard box

727
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:19,119
and he had been by the side of the road

728
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:21,759
25 miles south of town on interstate 25

729
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:24,319
in a place called castle rock colorado

730
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:26,480
and he walked in carrying four leaves

731
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:29,038
and the leaves were great big smooth

732
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,319
margin things with drip tips on them

733
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:31,599
and i had just gotten back from the

734
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,918
amazon like

735
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:35,038
where'd you get these things he said 25

736
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,480
miles south here on the side of the

737
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,558
interstate highway

738
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,640
so we went down there and dug into this

739
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:41,839
outcrop and it's the most nondescript

740
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,520
outcrop you can imagine i mean there it

741
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:47,918
is it's a slumped hill those blue tarps

742
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:49,278
are the holes we dug

743
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,360
and here's the guy with one of these

744
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,679
leaves

745
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:54,879
i always use some people for scale it's

746
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,360
quite handy

747
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,559
but here's a 24 inch long

748
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:02,798
leaf a big leaf it's like this long

749
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:03,519
and we dug into this site immediately

750
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:05,599
and

751
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:06,960
fossils were pouring out of the hill i

752
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:08,240
mean it was unbelievable everything you

753
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,640
found and what we actually found was

754
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,400
that there was a buried soil horizon and

755
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,000
for about eight inches above the soil

756
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,600
horizon there were just layers of leaves

757
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,798
so it was basically a forest floor that

758
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,959
was flooded

759
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,879
and these leaves are lying in there in

760
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,000
tremendous abundance

761
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,600
and of course we're along the side of

762
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,480
i-25 with 5 000 cars an hour going past

763
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:28,399
us

764
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,839
and we had a lot of a lot of media

765
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,038
showing up and we were pulling these

766
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:35,199
great big slabs out of the ground

767
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:36,558
that were curious because

768
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,558
people known about fossil leaves in

769
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:40,558
denver basin for a long time but

770
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:42,720
they had never found a site like this

771
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:44,639
before the site was unique

772
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,558
it had really big leaves it had a great

773
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,880
diversity of species a lot of the leaves

774
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,399
had smooth margins and drip tips on them

775
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,120
i'm like you know looks like a rain

776
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,159
forest smells like a rain forest

777
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:58,798
it just happens to be latitude 39.

778
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,400
at the time we didn't know the age of it

779
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,240
um and i was thinking well it must be

780
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,798
from the early years that's the really

781
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,278
warm time

782
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,798
what's also great was the fossils were

783
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:10,159
extraordinarily well preserved a lot of

784
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:12,319
them had cuticle and the leaves would

785
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,720
just simply peel off the rock it was

786
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,319
kind of tragic you split the leaf open

787
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,919
and a little the leaf would just peel

788
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,158
off and blow into traffic and get run

789
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,159
over

790
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:25,519
and

791
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,679
what was amazing about too was that

792
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:29,038
having spent

793
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,880
basically

794
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:33,359
already a decade collecting fossil

795
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,440
leaves in the dakotas in montana and

796
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,359
collecting literally thousands of leaves

797
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,519
and knowing quite well the cretaceous

798
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:41,519
and paleocene floors of the rocky

799
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:43,599
mountain regions this site contained

800
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,038
many things i'd never seen before

801
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:46,399
many things that are only known from

802
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:48,000
this site

803
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,679
and that seemed kind of odd big

804
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,599
beautiful complete things like this

805
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,960
great preservation

806
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,918
and then just

807
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,159
50 with drip tips

808
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,000
so it seemed that

809
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,200
if you were to use those characteristics

810
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,079
to recognize

811
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,600
a

812
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:07,839
wet warm place this place would qualify

813
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,278
and here's a just a garden variety leaf

814
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:12,240
from the amazon and the garden variety

815
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:14,240
leaf from the rain forest castle rock

816
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,278
as we did more work and did the dating

817
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,359
in the site we actually were able to

818
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:19,440
show the site was 64 million years old

819
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:20,639
so not not only easy but in fact early

820
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,759
paleocene

821
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,559
just two million years after the

822
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:26,000
cretaceous tertiary boundary

823
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:27,759
and what was kind of cool about the site

824
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
was it was an in-situ site that is to

825
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:32,000
say we actually found standing in place

826
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,359
plants so you can see here where the

827
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,359
hammer is there's a trunk going

828
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:37,119
vertically and those are roots radiating

829
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:38,319
out on the soil surface

830
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:40,558
we're able to actually uncover the

831
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:41,918
forest floor itself

832
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:43,278
and

833
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,200
see the forest floor which means that we

834
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:48,240
were able to map then

835
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,240
the occurrence of fossils on a landscape

836
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,640
next to a highway

837
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,000
and here's uh as we dug this we dig in

838
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,559
with backhoes and then we take the

839
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
fossils out and we were digging here we

840
00:27:56,558 --> 00:27:59,678
realized that we were following these

841
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,119
big trails of carbon and we realized it

842
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,960
would actually

843
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:05,759
expose the base of quite a large tree

844
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,079
the rope is a ring of carbon those other

845
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:09,759
ropes are other linear bands of carbon

846
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:11,359
what you're looking at here is

847
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:13,440
basically a carbonized base of a

848
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,359
gigantic tree trunk

849
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,278
and one of the things that we always

850
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,439
think about as

851
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,960
when we're casual sloppy thinkers is

852
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,120
where are the petrified trees but

853
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,399
petrofaction is a process that happens

854
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,719
sometimes

855
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:29,119
in areas around volcanoes but most trees

856
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,640
don't get petrified most trees

857
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:32,558
rot away

858
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,120
for a walk in the forest

859
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:37,200
the corpses of the dead trees are

860
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:39,359
reduced by termites to carbon dioxide

861
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,278
and the tree goes away so the fate of

862
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:42,158
most trees is not to become a petrified

863
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:44,640
tree

864
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,960
it's to become carbon dioxide again

865
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,720
so when you walk through forests

866
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,759
you think about the forest there's not

867
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,440
much that tells you about the history of

868
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:52,640
the forest because the trees are are

869
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,919
basically being returned to the

870
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,080
atmosphere

871
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,600
and so it's not a surprise not to find

872
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:58,960
petrified forests but then you realize

873
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:00,639
you can actually find the traces of

874
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,759
trees other ways

875
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,200
and start to get a sense of where the

876
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:05,359
threes were so you start to think okay

877
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,480
here's what this place must have looked

878
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:09,678
like big trees small trees

879
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,480
and

880
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,159
abundant palms

881
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,200
again same guy for scale so you have to

882
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,200
adjust your mental thinking

883
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:22,240
and not only abundant palms but a bunch

884
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:24,000
of different kinds of palms right so

885
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,278
there's there's a host of different

886
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,720
palms

887
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:29,119
today there's some a couple thousand

888
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,640
species of palms palms tend to be plants

889
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:32,079
that don't like places where the ground

890
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,080
is frozen you probably couldn't do too

891
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:35,599
well the palms here in ithaca i would

892
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,839
imagine

893
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:40,639
but here in the denver basin where ample

894
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:42,158
palms pinate palms costa palmate palms

895
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,159
palmate palms

896
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,039
abundant

897
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,760
and then we found this beautiful frond

898
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:51,038
meter-long frond of a cycad

899
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:53,278
and while we were digging we actually

900
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:55,919
realized that we'd found a whole cycad

901
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:59,038
plan this beautiful thing

902
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,600
there were 25 fronds laid out

903
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:03,839
and a trunk in place

904
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:05,199
and was kind of fun because when you

905
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,038
work for a museum you can just call up

906
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,558
the evening news we came they came down

907
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:09,839
at five o'clock we opened this thing

908
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:12,480
this outcrop

909
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:14,240
live at five on the evening news

910
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,839
always striving to communicate science

911
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,519
whatever possible way and here's a

912
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:19,839
reconstruction of this

913
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:21,599
a still unnamed genus of palms it's

914
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:24,000
similar to diawan

915
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:25,359
but it's not dia1 and we actually found

916
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,278
next to the trunk

917
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:28,719
in place seedlings

918
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:30,398
of the palm

919
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,679
in place

920
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:33,678
so

921
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,038
we published we did an analysis using

922
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,120
leaf margin and got a mean annual

923
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:39,278
temperature on 22 degrees c

924
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:40,879
a meaning of precipitation of over two

925
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:41,839
meters of rain

926
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,039
and

927
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:46,959
um over a hundred different species

928
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:49,359
in the initial analysis and as we kept

929
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,960
digging this site because

930
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:52,798
there was more road work and each time

931
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,679
they did more road work they found more

932
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:57,679
fossil sites so we kept going back

933
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,840
we kept finding more and more species

934
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,919
here and it was a staggeringly diverse

935
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:06,158
fossil site i mean fossil leaf sites

936
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:08,480
typically have 5 to 25 species

937
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,840
these sites are producing 60 to 70

938
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,919
species

939
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:14,000
for a single hole in the ground which

940
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,840
would be equivalent to a single grab

941
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,159
sample of leaf litter in the forest

942
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:20,558
floor think about it that way and it's

943
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,000
actually difficult to get 60 species in

944
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:23,839
a leaf letter sample because when you're

945
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,759
even in the most diverse tropical

946
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:27,918
rainforest in amazonia

947
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,359
you can only pack so many trees into a

948
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,120
certain amount of space

949
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:33,038
and the leaf litter is only capturing

950
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:36,719
the leaf litter from the nearby trees so

951
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:38,798
it's even if in yasuni or or manu it's

952
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,720
pretty rare to get more than 45 or 50

953
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:42,879
species per leaf sample graph we're

954
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,440
getting as many as 60 here and here's

955
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:49,200
just a rarefaction curve from one quarry

956
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,919
there of just dicot diversity 73 species

957
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,798
from 500 specimens

958
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,360
so hyper diverse

959
00:31:54,798 --> 00:32:01,440
64 million year old

960
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:04,719
tropical rainforest not in the tropics

961
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,038
and here's a here's just a view of

962
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,640
the fossils laid out the footlong ruler

963
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:10,480
over there for scale

964
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,840
and this site really kind of rained my

965
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,558
bill said what in the world is going on

966
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:13,918
here

967
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:15,599
what does this say about tropical

968
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,840
rainforest origins and i went into the

969
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:19,918
literature and looked for the evidence

970
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:22,319
in the tropics of early tropical

971
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,080
rainforest and it's pretty sparse

972
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:25,519
it was after this site that the site of

973
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:27,519
sarahone in colombia was discovered

974
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,278
which is late paleocene about six

975
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,759
million years younger than this as

976
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:34,240
perhaps the best known equatorial

977
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:36,640
tropical rainforest site

978
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,720
so we did a landscape transect here we

979
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,360
had this long hill we were able to cut

980
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,759
into the soil a long length of it and we

981
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:45,918
did that in many places

982
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:47,839
the lowest layers of the rain forest is

983
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,240
you can see the tree trunks in place

984
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:52,639
and we then took the

985
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,000
common taxa and we census them along the

986
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,159
hill so you imagine if you're walking

987
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,839
through a tropical rainforest as you

988
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,039
walk through the forest the leaf litter

989
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:00,558
beneath your feet changes its

990
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:01,599
composition as you walk under different

991
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:03,200
trees

992
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:04,719
because the trees are heterogeneous in

993
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,558
distribution in the forest so as you're

994
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,000
walking through the forest you'll your

995
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:09,678
leaf litter will literally change its

996
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,519
composition and our hypothesis was that

997
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,080
we'd see the same thing here

998
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:18,240
and so what you're seeing here is

999
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:20,000
the distribution of this leaf cr23

1000
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,839
large there lower or else but if you go

1001
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,240
across the ladder you can see that these

1002
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:26,319
different species appear sometimes

1003
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,240
broadly distributed sometimes local

1004
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:30,000
sometimes spiked

1005
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,000
all the way across

1006
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,679
the forest so there really was like this

1007
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,759
heterogeneous distribution of species

1008
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,679
across the landscape at the same exact

1009
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:41,200
stratigraphic level which seems to

1010
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,278
suggest we have the same heterogeneity

1011
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,960
that you get in a tropical rainforest

1012
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:47,038
now a lot of these things down below are

1013
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,558
things we've never seen before

1014
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:50,319
and i started scouring the literature

1015
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:51,359
for those species in the paleo botanical

1016
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,519
literature

1017
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:55,599
and coming up pretty dry we we did a

1018
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,120
painting of this reconstruction of this

1019
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:58,639
landscape

1020
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:00,798
what it looked like and you can see that

1021
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,080
uh the cycad

1022
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:03,679
everything here is based on actual

1023
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:05,759
fossils with the exception of the

1024
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,079
buttresses the buttresses are an

1025
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:10,000
artistic conceit that obviously makes

1026
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,480
you think tropical rainforest

1027
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,320
so i admit that up front

1028
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,878
we did not find any buttressed trees

1029
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,679
that little critter there that's a

1030
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:21,440
selena daunting teeniodont

1031
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,119
which you may not have ever heard before

1032
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,559
it's an extinct lineage of mammals that

1033
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,800
appears in the early paleocene because

1034
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:29,599
extinct in the lady is seen known for

1035
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,839
probably less than 15 skulls

1036
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,480
and while we were doing this excavation

1037
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:35,759
these guys were driving down the road

1038
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,918
nearby

1039
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,760
it's a true story they stopped to take a

1040
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,279
leak on the side of the road

1041
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,879
while they were taking the leak they

1042
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,639
spotted the thing they thought was a

1043
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:46,799
coyote skull

1044
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,720
they brought it to the museum

1045
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,359
and in fact it was a paleocene cylinder

1046
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:53,279
daunting teeniodon so we actually have

1047
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,039
one of the denisons of this forest and

1048
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,720
it turns out in paleontology that peeing

1049
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:57,519
is the best way to find good fossil

1050
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,959
sites

1051
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:00,800
because most people don't look at the

1052
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,800
ground until you're actually like oh my

1053
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,800
god there's a fossil there

1054
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,720
so don't ever feel bad about it it's all

1055
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,039
good

1056
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:10,959
so now the context of this site is that

1057
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:12,639
in the late cretaceous there was a

1058
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,240
seaway that bisected north america and

1059
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:15,759
north america was actually

1060
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:17,519
western north america was effectively a

1061
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,119
peninsula of asia

1062
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:21,519
sitting down and we were starting to

1063
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,320
call this peninsula laramidia

1064
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:24,880
and

1065
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,119
there was a wide sea that at times was

1066
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,640
about a thousand miles wide 600 feet

1067
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,720
deep that separated larimidia from

1068
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:35,358
appalachia or

1069
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:36,799
effectively flooded most of kansas

1070
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:39,358
nebraska

1071
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,720
and you can see the colorado's net space

1072
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:43,279
if you look at this diagram you can see

1073
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:45,199
in dark red the uplifted blocks of the

1074
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,720
rocky mountain range and in the denver

1075
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:48,000
basin we can actually date quite

1076
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:49,838
precisely the uplift for the rocky

1077
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,358
mountains we see

1078
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:52,639
in the stratographic layers adjacent to

1079
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:55,039
the mountains we see the first

1080
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:56,879
appearance of gravels being shut off the

1081
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:58,400
mountains so we know that the rocky

1082
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,480
mountains first breached the surface

1083
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,358
about 68 million years

1084
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,679
ago

1085
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:05,358
and the site at castle rock is right up

1086
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:07,358
against the mountain range we know the

1087
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:10,239
mountain range was there at 64 million

1088
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:12,239
years ago and in fact we even find

1089
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:13,598
lahar deposits which are lahars are

1090
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:16,639
these volcanic mud flows that came off

1091
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,800
volcanoes the around denver there were

1092
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,000
volcanoes they're gone because volcanoes

1093
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,400
are ephemeral but the debris from

1094
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,320
volcanoes gets buried we find lahars

1095
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,280
that are composed of chunks of volcanic

1096
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,359
rock and petrified palm trunks

1097
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,079
so there's vault there's palm

1098
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:34,639
studded volcanoes in denver

1099
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:38,400
sliding off the mountain range into this

1100
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:39,838
tropical rainforest landscape

1101
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,039
i hope you get to see these things

1102
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:42,239
should come in

1103
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:44,159
um

1104
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:46,239
so here's the location of the castle

1105
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:47,679
rock rainforest

1106
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:48,639
up at the foot of these mountains and

1107
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:50,078
then

1108
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,279
one sometimes these things are so

1109
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,800
obvious you don't notice it but when you

1110
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,880
go to denver you live in denver they

1111
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,079
have a thing called the monsoon

1112
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,160
which is not the monsoon of the

1113
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,680
himalayas but they talk about the denver

1114
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:00,879
monsoons and what the monsoons are is

1115
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:02,399
that in the

1116
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,320
spring in the fall

1117
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,480
when there's cold weather coming down

1118
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,838
from the north and moist which are

1119
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,440
coming off the gulf of mexico you get

1120
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:10,799
heavy rainfall

1121
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,800
on the eastern side of the rocky

1122
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,960
mountains those are the monsoons

1123
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,519
and so we did some modeling and it turns

1124
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,240
out in a warmer world

1125
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:21,920
we have a closer wetter water source

1126
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:23,439
you can predict much higher rainfall on

1127
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,960
the eastern flanks of these mountains so

1128
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,079
that this is an orographic effect we're

1129
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,920
seeing that's why we didn't see these

1130
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,039
things before is the previous fossil

1131
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,000
sites weren't close enough to the

1132
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:31,920
mountains

1133
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,320
to actually get

1134
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,639
enough rainfall to make the rainforest

1135
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,640
so it's like oh yeah rain forests are

1136
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:40,078
truly localized

1137
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:41,679
in fact to

1138
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,000
places like volcanoes which give you

1139
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:46,159
localized high elevation and orographic

1140
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,920
increased rainfall

1141
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:49,039
so that was the sort of the model for

1142
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,440
this thing

1143
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:53,279
and in morley's book he prints this

1144
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,960
really interesting diagram

1145
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,079
with not a lot of evidence for it

1146
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,159
frankly

1147
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,320
he kind of deduced that

1148
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:02,960
in the paleocene there might be as many

1149
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,559
as three bands of tropical rainforest

1150
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,559
one equatorial

1151
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,320
one mid-latitude north one mid-latitude

1152
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:09,599
south

1153
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,200
and you know that was an interesting

1154
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,800
hypothesis and it's curious that the

1155
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:15,838
castle rock site is pretty much where

1156
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,200
that northern band is located

1157
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:18,559
so

1158
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:20,078
in my mind that starts to be a

1159
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:21,920
compelling story

1160
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,400
and then the question is how what's the

1161
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,320
evidence for that equatorial

1162
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,320
paleocene rainforest

1163
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,440
we have the one site in cerrone in

1164
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,838
colombia

1165
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,920
but boy that big band in central africa

1166
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:35,519
unexplored that big band in amazonia

1167
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,280
unexplored

1168
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:38,800
so these are hypotheses right we don't

1169
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,280
really know

1170
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,519
when the equatorial rainforest kicks in

1171
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,720
primarily because lack of of exploration

1172
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:46,159
and fossils which is the argument for

1173
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:48,719
paleontology in general as the good

1174
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:50,159
stuff is all out there still

1175
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:52,159
so

1176
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:54,000
further work on the study as we started

1177
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:55,838
digging into the affinities plants most

1178
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,519
of our plants seem to have asian

1179
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:59,679
affinities not south american affinities

1180
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:01,920
which makes sense because

1181
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:03,519
they were a peninsula of asia

1182
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,680
in a warm world you can get stuff across

1183
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:07,199
the very land bridge and down

1184
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:08,399
obviously south america is a long ways

1185
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:10,399
away

1186
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,720
so if there were these three bands you'd

1187
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,800
have a northern band

1188
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:16,719
with asian affinities a southern band

1189
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,560
with australasian affinities

1190
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:19,759
and who knows about the equatorial stuff

1191
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:21,039
the bit of evidence we have from the

1192
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,079
pollen record suggests that south

1193
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:27,358
america has some input from africa

1194
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:29,680
as well in the in the eastern now just

1195
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:32,239
to close this up i um

1196
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:34,960
my day job now is has imperiled my

1197
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:36,719
extensive field work which is annoying

1198
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,199
in the extreme

1199
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:41,279
but i um i still continue to do uh

1200
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:43,039
various kinds of public communication of

1201
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,040
science i'm doing a three-hour tv show

1202
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:46,960
for nova about the making of north

1203
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:48,639
america it's a geology of the continent

1204
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,240
and they're flying me all over the place

1205
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:51,920
and i'm working with ray troll who's an

1206
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:54,399
alaskan artist about a book about the

1207
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,480
west coast so those two things i slip

1208
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,838
out the door occasionally and disappear

1209
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,400
into the wilds and i've been spending a

1210
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:01,920
lot of time between seattle

1211
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,519
and fairbanks

1212
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,920
up the coast so one of the questions i

1213
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:08,079
have is like this place today

1214
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,599
is home of the great

1215
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,680
temperate rain forest the pacific

1216
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,160
northwest so from northern california

1217
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:16,480
all the way up to effectively the

1218
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:17,838
latitude of home or alaska you have

1219
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,800
temperate

1220
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:22,239
conifer dominated rain forests and it

1221
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,320
occurred to me to ask the question when

1222
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:25,439
do those things show up when do you get

1223
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,359
your first

1224
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,358
western red cedars and your dog furs and

1225
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:31,039
your sitka spruces one of those kicking

1226
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:32,319
gear when is this forest this is the

1227
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:35,039
forest of my childhood when does this

1228
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:36,838
forest come into being

1229
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:39,920
and so i've

1230
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:41,119
now found three sites

1231
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,358
that are pretty interesting in this

1232
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,119
context

1233
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,799
the checkernut the kutsunahu and the

1234
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,358
chickaloon

1235
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,359
great names

1236
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:53,679
none of these are

1237
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:55,519
well studied yet they've all been known

1238
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:56,799
for a long time as most fossil sites

1239
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,639
have been but most people look like

1240
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,640
fossil sites we're collecting the

1241
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:02,879
fossils and not thinking about

1242
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:04,639
the site or the location and of course

1243
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,960
this is a landscape which is full of

1244
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:08,159
exotic trains these are chunks of many

1245
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,318
continents that hit the cars the north

1246
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:11,920
americans slide upwards to the slot so

1247
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:13,920
there's some northward translation of

1248
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,039
these things

1249
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,119
but it depends where you're on the

1250
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:18,559
faults and and we now

1251
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,200
have looked at these three sites which

1252
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:23,358
seem to be in a docked position when

1253
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:25,759
they were deposited so they weren't

1254
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:27,679
carrying fossils and docking after they

1255
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,319
had fossils they were docked and the

1256
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:32,399
fossils were buried in those locations

1257
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:35,199
and in chucking it in washington state

1258
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,760
which is amazing is it looks like castle

1259
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:41,039
rock there's palms there's big leaves

1260
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:44,079
with drip tips there's huge leaves

1261
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:44,079
there's cycads

1262
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,400
and

1263
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:49,759
in kutsnahoo which is uh it took me a

1264
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,240
long time through this there was a paper

1265
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,640
there's a paper in 1911 of a usgs

1266
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:56,959
geologist who went um to kupernoff

1267
00:41:54,639 --> 00:42:00,000
island which is east of sitka

1268
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,000
in southeast alaska and he publishes

1269
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,358
just a few general slices there's

1270
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
hamilton bay

1271
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:08,719
and near cooper now island but in there

1272
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,800
there was an illustration of a cycad

1273
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:15,039
and one of the species that i have from

1274
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,720
castle rock in colorado so after much

1275
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:18,639
negotiation to figure out where little

1276
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:20,639
hamilton bay was in finding the boat to

1277
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:23,358
get to little hamilton bay

1278
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:24,960
um i went to hamilton bay in 2012

1279
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:27,440
and it's a pretty cool place it's a

1280
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,000
pretty nondescript bit of coastal alaska

1281
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,400
and we cruise around the bay and there

1282
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,760
was almost no outcrop we're like where

1283
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,680
was he digging the fossils and the tide

1284
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,280
went out there's about 15 feet of tide

1285
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:40,318
there there's a tidal now you can see

1286
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,760
slabby stones right at low tide

1287
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:44,559
so we went ashore and started pulling up

1288
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,079
these big slabs of stone

1289
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:47,358
and

1290
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,960
there was

1291
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:51,039
and one of the left is actually a castle

1292
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,800
rock species it's one i've only seen

1293
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:55,119
that castle rock

1294
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,480
and as we dug further

1295
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:01,519
we get into these really curious cycads

1296
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,880
was this really that triangular apex is

1297
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:04,639
actually

1298
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,039
not an accident we found several of that

1299
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:09,358
preserved on them

1300
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:10,800
but just two months ago i took the nova

1301
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:14,078
crew up there

1302
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,280
and at low tide we popped out a gigantic

1303
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,920
palm frond

1304
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,359
at low tide and as we as we did this

1305
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,639
other tide came up and washed over the

1306
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:22,159
top of that thing and we hauled away

1307
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:24,480
this thing we got this still size it's a

1308
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:26,000
seven foot wide palm frond at latitude

1309
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,280
57.

1310
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,079
so i say to you alaskan palm

1311
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,319
right polar forest alaskan palm

1312
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:36,079
and where are the sitka spruce and it's

1313
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:38,079
like this is this is a different world

1314
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,680
again that we've ever thought about a

1315
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,519
different forest

1316
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:43,358
probably in this case not an orographic

1317
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:46,318
forest but a coastal forest or a coastal

1318
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:50,318
horographic kind of situation a wet warm

1319
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:51,759
landscape and it turns out um

1320
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:53,358
we'll be going back to this spot for

1321
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,960
sure but

1322
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:58,000
the chickaloon

1323
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,119
which i thought was more of a temperate

1324
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,559
flora and this is what you find in

1325
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,400
museum collections the chickaletta again

1326
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:04,000
the meta sequoias the comptonias and

1327
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,079
things like that it turns out they're

1328
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,440
palms in chickaloon as well

1329
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:10,800
so there is this pacific northwest coast

1330
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,400
floor that's only known from a few

1331
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,079
places and no one's really kind of put

1332
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,000
the whole story together yet but i think

1333
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,839
there's it's very curious what do you

1334
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,440
want to call this forest but it's not

1335
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:22,078
the forest of today

1336
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,720
and it tells me that there's an argument

1337
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,960
for a lot more fieldwork and

1338
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:28,719
the warm world of the past is a pretty

1339
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,639
compelling way to talk about climate

1340
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:32,639
change i find because fossils are data

1341
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:34,318
man if you show a fossil of a palm in

1342
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:36,639
alaska

1343
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:38,880
and we're redoing the dinosaur hall at

1344
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:40,318
the smithsonian now i arrived there and

1345
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,640
immediately closed at that answer hall

1346
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:44,559
for its first ever renovation

1347
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:47,039
and it will take us several years to do

1348
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:49,599
it but when we reopen there'll be this

1349
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:50,960
palm frond from alaska

1350
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,280
in the exhibit and it'll just say

1351
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:56,000
alaskan palm

1352
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,000
thank you very much

1353
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,880
so

1354
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:07,039
plays a significant role in many ways

1355
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:09,039
because north america is moving in fact

1356
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:10,480
elsewhere island is a lower latitude now

1357
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,079
than it was when it was had those

1358
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,159
fossils on it so what you have to do

1359
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,599
with any fossil site is do your best to

1360
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:16,879
reposition it

1361
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,599
where it was when the fossils are

1362
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,480
deposited secondly the continents come

1363
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,160
together

1364
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,159
and close off when south america hits

1365
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:27,920
north america changes circulation and

1366
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:28,719
rainfall locally or creates mountains

1367
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,119
and

1368
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:32,399
in addition these exotic terrains come

1369
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,838
in and smash into the west side of

1370
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,160
america may see the western part of

1371
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:37,358
north america it's created by microcon

1372
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:39,279
that's slapping into the side of our

1373
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:41,199
camera and sliding north

1374
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,200
so there is a floor for instance in

1375
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:46,078
washington state called the wizard flora

1376
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:47,759
is about 115 million years old that

1377
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,280
looks like

1378
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,079
the floor that made that was the

1379
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,800
positive of the ladder of mexico

1380
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,318
and the flora was then buried fossilized

1381
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,920
and that chunk of rock stood out in the

1382
00:45:56,318 --> 00:46:00,639
position of washington state that's the

1383
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,800
baja bc concept they call that um

1384
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:05,118
malcolm mckenzie's they call that the um

1385
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,119
viking funeral ship another vikings when

1386
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,400
one of the key biking guys would pass

1387
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,079
away they like barry won the shipments

1388
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,240
of the ship out the city there's a dead

1389
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,359
guy floating so it's a dead home

1390
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:15,358
floating

1391
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:17,440
and um there's that kind of so there's

1392
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:19,039
lots of ways that you have to understand

1393
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,960
your your continental literature

1394
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:22,960
techniques to interpret these things but

1395
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,318
once you deconvolve that

1396
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,318
the story comes into focus

1397
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:30,880
the idea of a tropical plant community

1398
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:32,399
reacting to like

1399
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,960
you know three four five months of

1400
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,318
darkness at a time is super weird

1401
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,440
um

1402
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:39,279
are there any thoughts about especially

1403
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,720
if it's migrating you know from an area

1404
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,560
below the electric circle through the

1405
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:44,399
arctic circle through those extreme

1406
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:45,920
variations in like daylight hours are

1407
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,680
there any like

1408
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,760
thoughts as to how that's shaping or

1409
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:51,759
affecting these plants that are migrated

1410
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,680
through that area so

1411
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,440
yeah this is a really important question

1412
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:58,239
and i think what i showed you like that

1413
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,240
palms is high enough is 61. but 61 is

1414
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:02,639
still south of the arctic circle the

1415
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,078
floors from elsmere appear to be all

1416
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:06,000
deciduous

1417
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,519
so you know the situation seems to be a

1418
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,480
perfectly reasonable response than the

1419
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,239
white

1420
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,159
in fact you think of deciduousness as a

1421
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:14,000
response to cold winters but it could

1422
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:15,358
just as well be a response to the light

1423
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,559
right if you don't there's no light will

1424
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:18,480
have a leaf

1425
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:19,519
so and there if you think about it

1426
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,199
there's even an argument that

1427
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:23,440
deciduousness

1428
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:24,879
started in no light conditions because

1429
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,159
in a warm world we're getting a cold

1430
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,240
weather

1431
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:30,960
so you might actually have an exception

1432
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:33,439
from polar darkness during deciduousness

1433
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,358
that's pre-adapted for life in the cold

1434
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,760
world which evolves later

1435
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:39,119
so the the northern extent of tropics or

1436
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,280
for that matter the southern extent of

1437
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:44,240
tropics remains an interesting question

1438
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:47,760
because we're finding tantalizing clues

1439
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:50,799
that both across virginia and across

1440
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,640
scandinavia and across antarctica that

1441
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,720
some things that are pretty tropical

1442
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:57,199
managed to get across

1443
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:59,358
so we do have these time periods and

1444
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:01,919
there's one called the paleozoic thermal

1445
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:03,519
maximum 56 million years ago where in an

1446
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,200
already warm world in an already

1447
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:06,800
ice-free world

1448
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:09,519
there was an abrupt

1449
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,200
60 degree centigrade spike

1450
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:12,639
so and that doesn't last very long last

1451
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:14,318
100 000 years but a hundred thousand

1452
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:17,358
years is plenty of time for a monkey to

1453
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:20,159
walk from manchuria to wyoming

1454
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:21,759
and we think that in those moments when

1455
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:23,118
you have they're very the hyper thermals

1456
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,599
are on these things we have

1457
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,800
hypothermials you might be able to

1458
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,599
squirt

1459
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,280
tropical adapted packs across polar land

1460
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,720
bridges

1461
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,960
and that's kind of the interesting thing

1462
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:36,399
for me and we see examples of this

1463
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,559
both in the north and the south where

1464
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,318
things that are pretty thermophilus have

1465
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:42,880
representatives on both sides of land

1466
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:44,318
bridges how'd they get there is a pretty

1467
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,720
good question

1468
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:48,159
but fully tropical stuff and then

1469
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:50,318
you know once you get away from you have

1470
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:51,838
to be careful about terminology because

1471
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:53,759
tropics definitely means between the

1472
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:54,960
camp tropic of capricorn and cancer i've

1473
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,040
completely abused the use of that

1474
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,639
terminology in this stock you're using

1475
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:01,199
traffic to describe i have a plant

1476
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:03,039
conversation a climate parameter

1477
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:05,598
and so equatorial is probably a better

1478
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:07,039
word but i i'm really fascinated by this

1479
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,039
stuff and i think that

1480
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:10,719
it's the reason we haven't been finding

1481
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:12,960
these things everywhere is that you need

1482
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:15,199
photographic conditions

1483
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,960
to have the heavy rainfall to give you

1484
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:18,639
the evidence and the temperature is

1485
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,400
there from other proxies it's just a

1486
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:23,598
matter of targeting our search image to

1487
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:25,039
find more examples of this stuff

1488
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,559
question is about finding forest fires

1489
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:28,159
in the fossil organ we certainly find

1490
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:29,839
charcoal all the time

1491
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:32,639
so a charcoal has got to be a forest

1492
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:34,558
fire it's actually quite abundant both

1493
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:36,879
macro charcoal and micro charcoal of

1494
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,880
course these charcoal flowers these guys

1495
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,800
are evidence of forest fires

1496
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,400
um and one of the things that's getting

1497
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,400
interesting is that we predict forest

1498
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,079
fires in the q2 boundary

1499
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,838
we don't find the charcoal at the tp

1500
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,200
boundary it's very interesting we find

1501
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:50,719
charcoal throughout the cretaceous and

1502
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:52,000
the palestine but actually at the qt

1503
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:53,919
battery itself

1504
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,318
we don't see charcoal that's predicted

1505
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,079
by some of the scenarios that we have

1506
00:49:56,318 --> 00:50:00,239
so i'd say there's definitely good

1507
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,960
evidence for forest fires

1508
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:04,959
say except your degrees latitude what

1509
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,559
would the winter temperatures i mean

1510
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,119
you're saying the model is not very good

1511
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,200
yet but when both winter temperatures

1512
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:13,280
get down

1513
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:15,439
well this is the thing right i mean

1514
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,960
we've got um

1515
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,440
i mean you can do the experiment take a

1516
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,440
crocodile and turtle and snake

1517
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,800
and see where they go we don't seem to

1518
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,880
have palms

1519
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,800
that far north and palms don't seem to

1520
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,720
like frozen ground

1521
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,119
um so conceivably things that could

1522
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:33,118
hibernate or be deciduous i mean it may

1523
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,358
not they might be

1524
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:38,400
pulling winners and then um in 2012 they

1525
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:40,558
went up to the colorado river in alaska

1526
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,318
and on the global river there are bone

1527
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,079
beds of dinosaurs that are 70 million

1528
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:45,838
years old and they're

1529
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:47,839
i was i've heard about this for years i

1530
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:49,599
just wanted to check it out i found two

1531
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:51,199
things that i went there that were kind

1532
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,800
of surprisingly one was the bone beds

1533
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:54,318
are primarily babies

1534
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,680
they're um they're small they're duct

1535
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:57,679
talented but most of them are small

1536
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:59,440
animals about this big these are not

1537
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,719
migrating animals animals that were born

1538
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,639
locally

1539
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:05,279
um and died in some sort of probably a

1540
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:07,440
big storm surge about the beaufort sea

1541
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,760
because they're they're literally

1542
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:13,119
we i dug one third of a cubic meter of

1543
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:15,119
this bone bed that got 260 bones

1544
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:17,358
the little tiny baby dinosaur bones and

1545
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:19,760
the bone bed went for miles

1546
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:23,039
but also their volcanic ash deposits

1547
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:24,720
there volcanic ashes are really great um

1548
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:26,880
thing for fossils because if you think

1549
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:28,959
about volcanoes they erupt

1550
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,480
and the ash rains out of the sky that's

1551
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,559
basically like

1552
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,719
raining out of rock

1553
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:36,480
and they bury landscapes so you get

1554
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:38,639
pompeii like

1555
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,639
situations in uh pompeii is a great

1556
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:42,960
example maybe the best fossil site in

1557
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:45,199
the world i would argue is a site called

1558
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,639
ashfall in nebraska it's in the middle

1559
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:48,879
of nowhere in ambassador it's worth

1560
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:51,039
going to would say it's about 11 million

1561
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,800
year old ash fall from an eruption that

1562
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:54,318
happened in idaho and it buried a herd

1563
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,000
of rhinos

1564
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:58,480
in place

1565
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,239
and um it's amazing that their baby

1566
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,440
rhino is next to the mothers there's

1567
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:06,000
birds it's everything is exactly as it

1568
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:08,240
happened 11 million years ago

1569
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,639
and about 1990 scott william the

1570
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:13,679
smithsonian found a asphalt dairy

1571
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:16,400
cretaceous meadow where the ash buried

1572
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:18,960
an herbaceous ridiculous landscape with

1573
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,318
all the plants and growth position

1574
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,920
as you can actually see for the first

1575
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:24,000
time what herbaceous vegetation of the

1576
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,000
quotations looked like and when i was up

1577
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,679
in the colvell river

1578
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,599
there were these ash beds and i just

1579
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:32,239
picked one up the bottom of it and it

1580
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:34,800
was just covered in ferns

1581
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:36,399
so there's this world up there in the

1582
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,000
cretaceous that's

1583
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,400
you know i think the other point about

1584
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,679
the hierarchical warm situation is that

1585
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,280
because we talked there was a lot of

1586
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:45,679
discussion about the place and thermal

1587
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:48,480
maximum it looks like the warmth there

1588
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:51,759
was a long life and the high wall was

1589
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,119
sporadic it was it was always forested

1590
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:57,680
and so

1591
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:59,440
in my mind that biome the arctic

1592
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:01,440
forest biome

1593
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,679
of the eoc is a really cool place to

1594
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,358
study because of those issues of winter

1595
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:07,598
darkness it's got to get cold right but

1596
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:09,838
people have modeled methane clouds

1597
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,200
they've modeled warm currents they've

1598
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:12,558
modeled a variety of ways to keep it

1599
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:14,480
from getting frigid

1600
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:18,400
i think it's a challenge

1601
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,400
if i get cold but it can't be frigid

1602
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,440
okay

1603
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:42,599
this has been a production of cornell

1604
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:42,599
