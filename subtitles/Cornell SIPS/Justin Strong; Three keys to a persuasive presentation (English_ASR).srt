00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,158
this is a production of Cornell

00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,158
University

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:11,780
thank you so much for

4
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:17,100
expert to present on this topic because

5
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:18,660
what I'm passionate about this uh I

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,920
believe this will help you in your

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,899
careers

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,359
help you anywhere you go in your life

9
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:27,239
because presentation skills are skills

10
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,118
that you you can use anywhere in any

11
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:32,039
type of job that you get into also there

12
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:33,719
are basic communication skills a lot of

13
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:37,079
times and then just persuading somebody

14
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:40,260
to do something the things that I I'm

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,239
presenting here I've actually used uh in

16
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:44,519
several areas one of the area that I

17
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:47,218
actually use is for a personal friend

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,739
so I was trying to convince him to go to

19
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,058
Switzerland with me and he did not want

20
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:54,659
to go he didn't like traveling

21
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:57,718
internationally but uh but I know that

22
00:00:54,659 --> 00:01:00,299
he did like some of this and so I went

23
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,120
to my presentation skills and I thought

24
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:05,280
how do I persuade him to go with me so I

25
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,920
put together an actual presentation

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,560
and I emailed it to him and I convinced

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,359
him actually after 10 years to go to

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,799
Switzerland with me so it's not only in

29
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:16,799
business but your personal life you

30
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,439
could use this also

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,860
so let's get into this

32
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:26,039
all right it's estimated that there are

33
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:28,819
30 million business presentations given

34
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,900
every single day

35
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:33,899
unfortunately what a lot of those

36
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,939
presentations all they do is to convince

37
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,500
the audience that they had wished they

38
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:39,500
never had attended the presentation

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,400
so I'm going to give you some tips on

40
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,560
how to avoid that how not to put your

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,478
audience to sleep but more importantly

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,640
to be able to convince them to take

43
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,039
action

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,200
Warren Buffett how many people have

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,299
heard of Warren Buffett raise your hands

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,180
he arguably he's one of the most

47
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,939
successful investors in history

48
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,360
now Warren Buffett had said that you can

49
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:08,399
improve your value by 50 by learning

50
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:11,639
communication skills or presentation

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,360
skills now Mr Buffett has a single

52
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:16,979
certificate on his wall in his office

53
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,900
and what it is I'll give you a hint it's

54
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:21,659
not his business certificate his

55
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,879
business degree it's from a class that

56
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:26,759
he took on presentation skills at the

57
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:27,598
beginning of his career Dell Carnegie

58
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:30,000
class

59
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:32,039
and while I couldn't get Mr buttock to

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,318
personally endorse my class or

61
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:36,179
presentation I'm sure that he would

62
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,878
Lodge your efforts to increase your

63
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,480
presentation or communication skills

64
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:45,419
MBA programs have long understood and

65
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:48,439
the value of presentation skills so

66
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:52,259
Chicago and Stanford and Harvard

67
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:55,439
Orton Columbia and Berkeley Haas and

68
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:57,419
many other communicate MBA programs have

69
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,400
included presentation skills in their

70
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:02,280
programs

71
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,239
now one of the unfortunate things is

72
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,979
that

73
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,099
people are deathly afraid of

74
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:09,719
presentations in fact there was a study

75
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:11,939
done by Harvard Business School where

76
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:15,060
they asked people would you rather give

77
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:17,639
a five minute presentation or for five

78
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,860
minutes have electric shocks put through

79
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:24,658
your wrist guess what most people show

80
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,280
they chose to have electric shocks put

81
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:28,199
through their wrist in another study

82
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,900
people were asked what is your biggest

83
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:33,959
fear presentation giving a speech was

84
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,300
number one death didn't even make the

85
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,158
list

86
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,659
so Jerry Seinfeld said if you're at a

87
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:43,500
funeral most people would rather be in

88
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:45,479
the coffin than giving the viewers

89
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,340
so I'm going to help you to again get

90
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,679
over some of the fears by giving you the

91
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,019
tools and techniques to become a more

92
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,080
confident person

93
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:58,319
you can have the greatest idea in the

94
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:01,200
world but if you cannot persuade enough

95
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:03,359
people it doesn't matter

96
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:07,679
science even math

97
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,200
the most logical of Endeavors is a

98
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,319
social activity what happens if somebody

99
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,759
has a a new Theory what do they do they

100
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:16,439
go and tell their colleague hey what do

101
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,019
you think about this and that is

102
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:22,199
published and it's peer review

103
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,959
and and it's just it's a social type of

104
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:28,020
activity we have to convince others that

105
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,918
our ideas have value and Merit and if we

106
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:32,779
can't

107
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:32,779
an idea may just fail

108
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,540
so

109
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,100
um this is for the online presentation

110
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,919
so

111
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,840
um now as people feel free to enter into

112
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:45,719
the chat Windows some of the challenges

113
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,758
that you face but uh for the audience

114
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,560
that's here in the room what are some of

115
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,840
the challenges that you face when

116
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,839
preparing presentation content

117
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:00,418
just shut it up yeah the balance between

118
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,939
uh overwhelming my presentation or

119
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:04,319
underwinding my presentation sorry what

120
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:06,779
was that

121
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,819
the balance between to find the balance

122
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:11,638
between overriding my presentation

123
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:14,399
slides and underwording them

124
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,978
over okay

125
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:19,019
over wording and underwording yes okay

126
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:20,819
what's another one what's another

127
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,500
challenge that you face when preparing a

128
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:26,099
presentation

129
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,720
yes the audience knowledge like putting

130
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,639
my presentation to the audience the

131
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,840
audience knowledge absolutely extremely

132
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,160
important I think there was another hand

133
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:36,719
up over here

134
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,520
time time yes okay how much that you

135
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,199
have one person said I would have

136
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:42,478
prepared a shorter presentation but I

137
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:44,819
didn't have enough time preparing a

138
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:47,699
short presentation often takes more time

139
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:49,860
than a longer one yes

140
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:52,978
what type of visual dates that you use

141
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,379
absolutely yes linking topics or science

142
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:57,959
okay yes the transitions between

143
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:59,339
different topics all the yeah very very

144
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:01,319
valid things

145
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:04,500
well I'm going to talk to you about

146
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,879
Aristotle and his ideas behind

147
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,639
persuasion

148
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:12,779
Aristotle was a philosopher that lived

149
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,400
2000 years ago and he had three he had

150
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:17,099
thoughts on the three most important

151
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,120
aspects of what makes a persuasive

152
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,300
argument

153
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,478
and science is actually validated a lot

154
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,400
of those ideas since that time and the

155
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:29,758
three ones that he really believed were

156
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:35,038
important were in Greek ethos pathos and

157
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:37,439
logos or credibility emotion and logic

158
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,659
and he believed that you had to have

159
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,160
three components of a persuasive

160
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,840
argument and you needed to have all

161
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,240
three so I'm going to go and talk about

162
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:48,000
each one of those components and how

163
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,560
they fit into a persuasive argument now

164
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,259
I have to tell you my background is in

165
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,538
Computing science and I really thought

166
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:56,759
that this all this is all that matted

167
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:57,959
logic your data as long as you had

168
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,520
enough data and you had a logical

169
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:03,299
argument you could convince anybody of

170
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:06,659
anything and it took me 20 over 20 years

171
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:09,060
to actually get myself off of that and

172
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,520
realize that that emotion is really

173
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,660
important and establishing credibility

174
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,659
is also really important

175
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,520
so to prepare a persuasive presentation

176
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:21,959
you need to be able to establish your

177
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,598
credibility I'm going to talk about

178
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:27,000
making it memorable with structure and

179
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:29,279
then the power of story

180
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,418
so let's talk about each one of us

181
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,500
first of all let's talk about

182
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:37,019
credibility establishing credibility

183
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,478
well for establishing credibility you

184
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:42,299
need to accept you need to provide your

185
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:45,418
credentials up front

186
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,978
give your audience a reason on why they

187
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:49,198
should believe you

188
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:52,680
and this is really important up front

189
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,199
because if you do have if you do

190
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,019
convince your audience that you are

191
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,939
believable and credible that makes the

192
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:02,818
rest of the presentation that much

193
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:05,519
easier now you could establish

194
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:07,500
credentials up front for yourself or

195
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,779
maybe it's your group or maybe your

196
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,339
company whatever it might be but

197
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:13,500
establishing credibility is really

198
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:16,439
important so giving your audience a

199
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,360
reason to listen to listen to you and

200
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:21,660
generally you want to spend the least

201
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,960
amount of time to get the job done if

202
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,400
you spend too much time you come off

203
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:30,060
egotistical oh look at me I'm so great

204
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:31,918
but you do want to establish credibility

205
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,200
so here's here's some ways that you can

206
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,299
do that and remember that results are

207
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,459
more important than experience I can say

208
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:41,098
yeah I have 30 years of experience but

209
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:44,338
more importantly the results if you can

210
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:46,020
if you can tell people what results that

211
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:48,779
you've gotten in the past

212
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:50,699
that's more important than experience

213
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,679
okay so here's an example of what I do

214
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,660
it takes me 30 seconds at the beginning

215
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:56,699
of my classes that I teach I teach

216
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,679
classes on presentation skills at

217
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,720
Western Digital and outside

218
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:03,239
I say my name is Justin strong I have 30

219
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,040
years of presentation experience I'm an

220
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,440
instructor and author of presentation

221
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:10,860
skills at Western Digital and my classes

222
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,800
typically get 4.9 out of 5 stars

223
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,480
30 seconds I'm done then I'm off to the

224
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:17,519
rest of my presentation

225
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,959
so I do have experience here but more

226
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,000
importantly results

227
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,518
people say oh wow other people have

228
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,820
really uh enjoyed your class and they've

229
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,560
gotten a lot out of it perfect okay so

230
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,600
um that's what I do

231
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,619
um so your credibility statement is

232
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,259
going to look a little bit different

233
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,899
than that however you do need to

234
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:39,259
establish your credibility hopefully at

235
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:43,259
the beginning of your presentation

236
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:46,139
and people will see you more credible if

237
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:48,720
somebody else refers to you as an

238
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:51,838
authority on the subject and it turns

239
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,420
out that that person doesn't necessarily

240
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,779
need to be an expert themselves so there

241
00:09:54,419 --> 00:10:00,299
was a study done at a real estate office

242
00:09:56,778 --> 00:10:02,700
where the receptionist would answer the

243
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:05,519
phone in one of two ways the first way

244
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,560
was I'll put you through to Mary she is

245
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,080
one of our real estate agents

246
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:12,359
and the second way was just slightly

247
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,720
different she said I'll put you through

248
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,159
to Mary she has 20 years of experience

249
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,278
selling homes

250
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:22,679
now the receptionist is hardly a expert

251
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:25,439
on real estate agents

252
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:29,519
however just that one small change

253
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,860
results in 20 more assistance and 15

254
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,480
more signed contracts

255
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,519
so if you could get somebody to

256
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,339
introduce you at the beginning of your

257
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,379
presentation and refer to you as an

258
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:42,779
expert in the subject and however you

259
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:45,559
want to establish your credibility that

260
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:45,559
will definitely help

261
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,180
okay I'm going to skip this one over

262
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:53,939
um let's go on to the next one which is

263
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:56,278
logic okay this is the one I think of

264
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,440
and and I still think of when I first

265
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:01,439
what data do I have what logical

266
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,779
arguments do I have well

267
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,860
uh one of the things that you want to do

268
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:10,259
is provide structure to your logic so

269
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,720
here's an example of a presentation

270
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:16,259
where it had a really good structure now

271
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,899
Steve Jobs is one of my heroes he is

272
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:21,720
what I feel is one of the best product

273
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:24,000
managers that have ever lived I'm a

274
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,100
product manager at Western Digital and I

275
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,278
kind of view him as one of the product

276
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,620
manager Heroes now his iPhone

277
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:33,958
introduction the first presentation when

278
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,339
they first revealed the iPhone was

279
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,979
considered one of the best business

280
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:39,060
presentations and here's some of the

281
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,579
reasons why

282
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:43,739
he had a structure in his presentation

283
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:47,039
and a structure kind of went like this

284
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:49,139
first he presented what is so he talked

285
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,219
about all of the phones that existed at

286
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:53,480
that time

287
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:57,480
there was a Blackberry I think a Nokia

288
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,600
there was a palm Trio and let's see that

289
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,860
was uh

290
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,740
motor Motorola right those are the

291
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,419
phones that existed at that time and he

292
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:10,200
said well you know they have some

293
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:12,500
problems with them they have a fixed

294
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,500
keyboard

295
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:22,200
they have a fixed keyboard they have a

296
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:25,278
screen that's relatively small and

297
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:28,860
they're not really very easy to use

298
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:31,439
and they have a stylus that you that is

299
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,720
difficult and you always lose it he says

300
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,820
but what if

301
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,339
you had a large screen that took up the

302
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,959
whole phone and you didn't have a fixed

303
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:41,880
keyboard you didn't have to worry about

304
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:43,319
a stylus that you could lose and

305
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:44,700
everything just worked together like

306
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,860
magic

307
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:49,440
so he said what is what's the current

308
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,839
situation what could be what if you had

309
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,639
this and then you introduced the

310
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,519
solution the iPhone

311
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,079
so very simple structure in his

312
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,778
presentation

313
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:03,539
but really

314
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:04,980
served as a way to describe his solution

315
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:06,778
to the audience

316
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,120
there's lots of different structures

317
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:11,338
that you can use but the point is here

318
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,639
is that when you have a logical argument

319
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:17,220
in data when you put it into a structure

320
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,259
it's easier for your audience to

321
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,839
remember in fact there was a Stanford

322
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:26,458
study that said people are 40 percent

323
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:30,740
more uh liable to remember data that's

324
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:30,739
structured rather than unstructured

325
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:41,700
okay so that is uh so the the structure

326
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:45,120
that he used is what is but what if and

327
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,620
here's my solution you can use this in a

328
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,778
lot of your presentation here's the

329
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,879
current situation the problem that we

330
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:53,100
face but what if we didn't have to deal

331
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,899
with those problems and then you have

332
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,740
your audience ready for for your

333
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:57,539
solution

334
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,379
now a lot of times what people do is

335
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:02,879
they'll put the solution up front and

336
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:04,139
that's certainly a valid way of

337
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:07,259
presenting

338
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:09,720
um but this is also very interesting and

339
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:12,299
good way because it sets your audience

340
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,639
up to Really Want Your solution because

341
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:17,099
they identify what the problems that

342
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,240
you're telling them and and you say Hey

343
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,778
what if you didn't have to deal with

344
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,639
those problems and they're like yes yes

345
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:26,480
how could you solve that and so then you

346
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:26,480
present Your solution

347
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:33,120
so here's an example structure you would

348
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:35,939
do your opening and let's say five

349
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,799
reasons why cloud storage will double

350
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,079
over the next three years

351
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:42,359
we're the global cloud storage leader

352
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:43,919
and then you're closing so that's a

353
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,899
another structure that you can use you

354
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:49,078
have your opening you've got five

355
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:51,059
reasons why your your particular

356
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:52,919
proposal is true

357
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:55,198
and then you're telling your audience

358
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:57,240
hey where are the cloud Global cloud

359
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,759
storage leaders and then you have your

360
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,980
closing which which may contain a call

361
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,899
to action to ask your audience hey check

362
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:07,100
out our website if you think that you'd

363
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,100
like to use our cloud storage

364
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:12,179
another thing you want to do is make

365
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:14,159
sure data relevant to your audience

366
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:16,979
there was a comment at the beginning on

367
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:19,679
hey how do I make sure that my audience

368
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,480
will understand what I'm talking about

369
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,519
so one of the things you want to do is

370
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,278
make your data relevant to your audience

371
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,899
well here's an example how to do that so

372
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:29,939
let's say that you work for a Solar

373
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:34,019
Company a company that produces solar

374
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:36,440
panels and you said our company saved

375
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:38,879
one billion of 1 billion kilowatt of

376
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,019
hours of electricity in the United

377
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,120
States

378
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:45,000
well if you're not part of the solar

379
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:49,500
industry you might say what's a kilowatt

380
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,720
hour and it's a billion very much is it

381
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,039
one percent of all

382
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,778
um you may not know if you're in the

383
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,179
industry but if you count it in

384
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:59,820
different terms you say our companies

385
00:15:57,179 --> 00:16:02,759
say 15 minutes of all of the electricity

386
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:04,920
consumption in the United States now all

387
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:07,620
of a sudden even if your audience is not

388
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:10,198
in the electricity or solar power energy

389
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,459
industry they're going to understand

390
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:13,679
that

391
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:15,599
so you want to ensure that one you want

392
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,278
to understand who you're talking to now

393
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,680
if you're talking to

394
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:22,139
members of your audience who are in your

395
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,239
particular profession

396
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:27,659
then it's okay to use technical language

397
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,419
and this may be perfectly valid but if

398
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:32,939
you have members of your audience who

399
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:34,198
aren't in your particular industry or

400
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,420
you don't know

401
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:38,639
this would be a lot easier for your

402
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:41,759
audience to relate to so if you make

403
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,320
data relevant to your audience

404
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,600
they're going to be able to understand

405
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,680
it a lot easier and then relate to what

406
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,920
you're saying

407
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,919
foreign

408
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:53,458
so those are a couple of suggestions

409
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:56,100
when you have

410
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:59,099
logic and data to present to your

411
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,199
audience how you can make it easier for

412
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,959
your audience to consume it one put it

413
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:06,480
into a structure to make data relevant

414
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:08,458
to your audience now there's a lot of

415
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,039
other techniques and tools I teach a

416
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:14,759
two-day class in my company and we only

417
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:16,318
have less than an hour here so I'll give

418
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:18,359
you a couple of principles but there's

419
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:20,418
certainly a lot more that you can do but

420
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:23,338
those are two definitely

421
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:25,799
two principles that definitely will help

422
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:28,078
you to make your logical arguments more

423
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:31,259
relevant to your audience so number

424
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:33,298
three emotion the last one

425
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:36,779
so this is the one that I struggled with

426
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:39,660
a lot of times because one I thought

427
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:41,639
isn't this just manipulating your

428
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,700
audience right with the motion you know

429
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:47,340
when you see those ads for starving kids

430
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,840
in Africa and then you see them and

431
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:51,538
you're just yeah I thought people are

432
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:54,058
just manipulating your emotions

433
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:57,359
but I really have changed my thinking

434
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:59,759
then and realized that emotion is an

435
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:02,699
integral part of our decision making

436
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:08,099
process and in fact it's an integral

437
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:10,620
part of us taking action on on any uh on

438
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:13,199
any argument that we hear I'll talk

439
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:17,399
about the science behind that

440
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:20,400
so data leads us to conclusions but the

441
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:23,038
motion leads us to action

442
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,440
data leads us to conclusions but emotion

443
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:27,599
leads us to action

444
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:30,660
so Antonio damasio is a social scientist

445
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,918
and his specialty is decision making and

446
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,200
emotion

447
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,360
he's done a lot of research on that and

448
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,880
one of his most interesting experience

449
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:41,339
uh sorry one of his most interesting

450
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,679
experiments were with people whose

451
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:44,819
emotional part of their brain was not

452
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,519
functioning

453
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:48,659
these people could not feel any emotion

454
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:50,639
at all

455
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,919
now you would think that they would be

456
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,780
the best decision makers they would make

457
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,280
totally logical decisions they would be

458
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:58,798
like Spock

459
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:01,200
and not have to be impacted by their

460
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:03,720
emotions

461
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,038
well it turned out to be exact opposite

462
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,380
was the case

463
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,058
that those people whose emotional part

464
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,039
of their brain was damaged and they

465
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:14,759
couldn't feel any emotion at all

466
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:16,200
could not make any decisions at all they

467
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:18,000
couldn't decide what to wear in the

468
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,259
morning they couldn't decide what to eat

469
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,259
for breakfast

470
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:25,140
they couldn't decide what uh what shoes

471
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:27,298
to put on and when Antonio asked the

472
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,240
subjects in this experiment hey what's

473
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:32,519
going on how come you can't make any

474
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,798
decisions they said well we know what we

475
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:36,839
should do we just can't bring ourselves

476
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:40,200
to do it

477
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:43,319
so data leads us to conclusion but

478
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,259
emotion will lead us to take action

479
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:47,879
so that's data well what do we do with

480
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:49,859
it right do you want to make your

481
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,620
audience cry in every presentation that

482
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:53,939
you have or you know make them laugh or

483
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:56,519
whatever well

484
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,860
not really no but there is a way that

485
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:02,339
you can bring out emotions in your

486
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:04,439
audience uh that are perfectly valid and

487
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:06,839
and are not manipulative and one of the

488
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,000
best ways to do that is through

489
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:13,980
storytelling

490
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,419
storytelling will elicit emotions in in

491
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,579
people

492
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:21,059
in a non-manipulative way

493
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:25,079
and help them to take action we are born

494
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:29,339
storytellers and story listeners in fact

495
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:32,819
we used to use stories to transmit Vital

496
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:35,099
Information that we needed to survive

497
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:36,720
we used to transmit information people

498
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:38,819
would sit around the fire at night and

499
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,860
sit and tell each other how they

500
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:43,678
survived during a drought

501
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:46,019
or what happened when the herds went

502
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,780
away and they had to find new places to

503
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:51,418
live and that storytelling is how we

504
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:53,099
transmitted Vital Information that we

505
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:56,038
needed

506
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:58,259
so we are wired for storytelling so how

507
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:00,660
do we use that in a business environment

508
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:03,179
well I didn't believe in the power of

509
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:06,720
Storytelling until one day

510
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:08,700
uh I had to give a presentation I had

511
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,319
been on a business trip to the UK and

512
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,360
I've been there for a month

513
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:15,599
and we were working with the largest

514
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:17,459
cellular phone provider in in Europe

515
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:18,298
and we were working on a project with

516
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,700
them

517
00:21:18,298 --> 00:21:22,319
and I was there for a month and helping

518
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,200
them with the implementation and the

519
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,399
project and I came back I came back on a

520
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,500
Friday

521
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,360
I was back in the office on a Friday and

522
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,640
Friday morning my boss came to me and

523
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:35,579
said the executives want you to present

524
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:39,419
what your findings were they want you to

525
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:42,779
talk about what results that you got

526
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:45,960
I was a little bit nervous because while

527
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:49,500
we I had some achievements we didn't

528
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:52,200
really have a lot of data to present

529
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:54,538
and I had presented to the executives

530
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,519
before I left and I put business case

531
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:58,319
after business case together showing

532
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:59,460
what return on investment that we would

533
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:01,980
get

534
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,798
however before I went I knew that our

535
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:06,079
project was at risk was at risk of being

536
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,519
defunded

537
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:10,439
so I was really nervous I didn't really

538
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:12,179
have any new data to present and I

539
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,340
really believed that you should really

540
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:15,900
make data based decisions

541
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:18,058
and I really didn't have a lot of new

542
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,980
data to present but I did have some

543
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:22,200
stories to present so

544
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,599
they wanted I had to do it I couldn't

545
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,940
refuse and so I went into the

546
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:29,519
presentation with all the executives and

547
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:32,220
I told stories about how the customer

548
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:34,798
was happy about what we were doing about

549
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,000
how they had some successes in some of

550
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,940
the areas

551
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,220
and I finished the presentation and

552
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,798
I thought well okay I guess you know

553
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,960
whatever will happen will happen Monday

554
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:48,960
morning I came in my bus goes Justin's

555
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,460
congratulations and I go what yeah the

556
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,259
executives want to fully fund your

557
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,600
product

558
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:56,579
but why

559
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:59,399
I didn't present any new data all my

560
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:00,960
business cases they were lukewarm

561
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,780
responses to them

562
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:07,319
and yet I told stories and now all of a

563
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:10,798
sudden they want to fully fund them

564
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:13,980
and uh honestly it took me years after

565
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:16,798
that to really comprehend

566
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,298
the power of story and it wasn't until I

567
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:20,940
had done research

568
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:24,058
on the power of story and then thought

569
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,798
back to that experience and I had my aha

570
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:28,918
moment oh

571
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:30,538
stories really do have power to lead

572
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:32,700
people to take action

573
00:23:30,538 --> 00:23:35,099
I had the data now don't get me wrong

574
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,000
data is extremely important you need

575
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:39,658
that

576
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,599
but you also need stories to help bring

577
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:45,080
it to life and to lead your audience to

578
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:45,079
take action

579
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:49,379
Richard Branson how many people have

580
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:53,579
heard of him

581
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:55,380
he is the CEO of Virgin Enterprises

582
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:57,658
um he said regardless of the medium

583
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:00,900
there is nothing more effective and

584
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:03,659
affecting than storytelling every year

585
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:06,240
he brings his top Executives to his

586
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:08,580
private island Necker Island and they

587
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,519
gather around a virtual fire and they

588
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:14,339
tell stories about their business and

589
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:17,158
how their successes and failures and it

590
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:19,139
really believes in that power

591
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:21,480
Jerome Bruner uses an educational

592
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:24,480
researcher he says when you have data

593
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:28,079
that's couched in a story people are 22

594
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,240
times more likely to remember it

595
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:33,058
I'll teach you more times likely to

596
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,519
remember data that's been a story than

597
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:39,119
not

598
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:41,099
well in the analysis of TED Talks 500

599
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:43,259
TED Talks someone did an analysis of 500

600
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:46,259
TED Talks actually it was

601
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:48,298
um Carmine gallo and he's a very famous

602
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:49,460
speaker and he wrote a book called The

603
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:51,418
the

604
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:54,840
Storyteller Secret

605
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:56,220
and he did an analysis of 500 TED Talks

606
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:56,819
and

607
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,798
um

608
00:24:56,819 --> 00:25:03,298
he looked at the percentage of those

609
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:05,519
talks that were emotion story data and

610
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:08,038
credibility so what percentage of it was

611
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:11,158
evolved with involved with storytelling

612
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:14,339
or emotion data and credibility

613
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:18,720
well I'm just going to go through well

614
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:20,879
65 was data motion and storytelling oh

615
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,058
before I go any further how many people

616
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,039
have not heard of TED Talks okay I just

617
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:28,319
want to make sure I I know it's but some

618
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:32,038
audience that I talked to uh some people

619
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:35,759
haven't heard of it 25 was data and 10

620
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:38,099
was credibility TED Talks are considered

621
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:40,798
I think in a lot of people's career the

622
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:42,658
Pinnacle of presentations if you get

623
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,700
invited to do a TED Talk you're

624
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:47,820
considered one of the best storytellers

625
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:51,120
or presenters in the world and so the

626
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:53,158
world's best presenters 65 of their

627
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:55,579
presentations are storytelling or

628
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:55,580
emotion

629
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:03,538
let me give you another example I work

630
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:05,399
for a company called Western Digital we

631
00:26:03,538 --> 00:26:07,798
make hard drives we own the company

632
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,740
called SanDisk which makes flash memory

633
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:11,759
flash memory cards uh we're totally data

634
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,819
driven

635
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:18,179
now if I went to let's say I was doing a

636
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:21,418
customer presentation and I said 65 of

637
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:23,759
consumers lost data from a computer or

638
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:27,778
mobile device in 2019.

639
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:31,558
now that's data it leads you to

640
00:26:27,778 --> 00:26:35,278
conclusions wow that's terrible yeah

641
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:39,000
but what if I added a story to that

642
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:42,419
I said my hard drive failed last year

643
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:46,140
and I lost all the photos from the first

644
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:49,820
three years of my children's life

645
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:52,799
just imagine how upset my wife was

646
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:54,980
my wife laughs because this has some

647
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:54,980
truth

648
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,200
but now you tell a story and now people

649
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,658
are like oh

650
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,640
I don't want that to happen I need to

651
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:07,679
find a solution what what solution do

652
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,820
you have so data leads you to

653
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,038
conclusions

654
00:27:08,819 --> 00:27:12,538
about a story and this is a very short

655
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:14,940
story

656
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:17,819
but would lead you to take action

657
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,500
because now you've seen how it applies

658
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:21,619
to you

659
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,659
so data these conclusions of

660
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:26,959
Storytelling or emotion leads you to

661
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:26,960
action

662
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:33,740
can you tell an effective story in two

663
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:33,740
sentences

664
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,798
again another kind of personal story my

665
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,080
wife came to me and said hey we should

666
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:43,139
get an Apple TV

667
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:45,918
and in the next sentence wait what is an

668
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,919
Apple TV anyway

669
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:52,460
That's The Power of bread

670
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,460
she was so enamored with Apple products

671
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:57,379
I had to have one even though she had no

672
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:57,379
idea what it did

673
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:01,740
so yes you can count an effective story

674
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:04,380
in just a couple of sentences you don't

675
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,419
have to have long stories in fact you

676
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:09,960
don't have to have a story that's

677
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:13,140
really um exciting or overwhelming to

678
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:15,419
your audience but if it's sincere and

679
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,740
it's relevant to the topic that you're

680
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:19,200
talking about

681
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,940
it can be effective and that's one of

682
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,000
the things you have to remember when you

683
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:25,919
choose a story it has to be related to

684
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,298
the topic that you're talking about some

685
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,820
stories are great

686
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:32,960
but maybe great for another presentation

687
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:32,960
and not this one

688
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:42,239
okay so in summary

689
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:44,399
we have three aspects to a persuasive

690
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,380
presentation and to have a really

691
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,759
persuasive one you want to have all

692
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:50,100
three

693
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,359
you want to have of course your data and

694
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:53,038
your logic

695
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:55,019
do you want to establish your

696
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:57,778
credibility up front

697
00:28:55,019 --> 00:29:00,960
and then ideally have some type of a

698
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:04,019
story uh in your presentation

699
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:07,140
uh start how are we doing for time

700
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:10,579
it's yeah if you can finish one minute

701
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,580
yeah one minute yeah

702
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:16,139
um Okay so

703
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:20,220
one of the things that I do also and

704
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:23,100
this is I'm going to use one minute to

705
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:24,778
talk about this is that I use a Content

706
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:27,240
development worksheet and I'll send this

707
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:29,159
to you so that you can look at this I

708
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,620
use what I call content development

709
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:34,080
worksheet for every presentation that I

710
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:36,778
do I did it for my friend's presentation

711
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:39,119
I did it when I had to do a eulogy last

712
00:29:36,778 --> 00:29:42,240
year for my best friend every

713
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:44,819
presentation so what is it what does it

714
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,558
contain you first of all you want to

715
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:48,000
know who your audience is and what do

716
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,460
they care about

717
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,079
your outcomes what you want your

718
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,538
audience to know as a result of your

719
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:55,740
presentation and what you want them to

720
00:29:54,538 --> 00:29:58,319
do

721
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:00,778
then there's your supporting material so

722
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,759
this is you know your logic uses the

723
00:30:00,778 --> 00:30:05,159
need of your presentation

724
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:08,398
your topics and I have a reminder here

725
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:10,020
you use emotion logic and credibility so

726
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:11,519
this is you and you want to have a

727
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:13,798
structure in this area this is where you

728
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:15,720
have your structure and then finally

729
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:17,639
you're opening and this may sound

730
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,298
character intuitive but I do my opening

731
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,700
after I do all this material

732
00:30:20,298 --> 00:30:25,619
capture your attention of your audience

733
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:28,798
establish your credentials and then your

734
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:31,079
closing summarize and have a call to

735
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:33,119
action what is it that you want your

736
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:34,319
audience to do as a result of your

737
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,339
presentation

738
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:39,960
don't forget to leave this out

739
00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:41,398
almost always you should have some type

740
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,019
of thing that you want your audience to

741
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:45,538
do with and it may just be go to my

742
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:48,179
website read my paper take a look at

743
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:49,798
this data whatever it is but you should

744
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,659
have something otherwise what's the

745
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:53,759
point of the presentation you want your

746
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:56,760
audience usually to do something

747
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:57,839
okay well thank you so much for

748
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:59,038
listening

749
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:00,658
um this is part of the content

750
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:03,538
development worksheet that will let you

751
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:06,480
there so here's your assignment my call

752
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:08,398
to action for your next presentation one

753
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,500
add a story

754
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:12,418
to your next presentation you might find

755
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,058
this difficult but I found that if I

756
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:17,640
really look there's a story in almost

757
00:31:15,058 --> 00:31:19,579
every presentation even if it's very

758
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,720
very technical

759
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:23,699
establish your credibility at the

760
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,278
beginning of your presentation and

761
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,899
number three use the content development

762
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:30,359
worksheet and again we'll send it out to

763
00:31:27,898 --> 00:31:33,798
you so that you have a copy of that all

764
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:33,798
right thank you very much for listening

765
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:39,960
thank you so much Justin

766
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:42,298
all right so for people on the line also

767
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,940
in the room I did a terrible job in

768
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:47,759
establishing Justin's credibility by

769
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:50,880
introducing him but that was not

770
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,919
accident okay it's intentional I'm going

771
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,120
to do the assignment I'm going to tell

772
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:56,340
your story

773
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:58,879
all right okay that's my assignment to

774
00:31:56,339 --> 00:31:58,879
tell a story

775
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:05,640
I was struggling with persuading my

776
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:07,919
audience I do too much data that's the

777
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:11,940
feedback from many many people including

778
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:14,340
maybe Kylie and many many people so I

779
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:16,919
thought what I'm going to do okay so

780
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:18,898
Adida emba last two years while

781
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:23,759
finishing while doing my full-time job

782
00:32:18,898 --> 00:32:26,219
so I graduated in May after that I felt

783
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:28,558
they told me how to handle the data all

784
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,960
the analytics I took the digital

785
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:32,879
transformation this is not didn't really

786
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,500
help me to be more effective in

787
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,320
persuading people

788
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:41,460
then what I did was this summer I joined

789
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:45,058
a cloud called Career boot camp where I

790
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:46,980
made adjusting and he thought about this

791
00:32:45,058 --> 00:32:49,079
the seminar

792
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,519
and as he mentioned

793
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:52,678
yeah

794
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:54,298
so the persuasive

795
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:57,059
take action

796
00:32:54,298 --> 00:32:59,639
I was persuaded so I took action I

797
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:03,839
emailed him and I thought I could invite

798
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:06,480
him to talk to all of you on Zoom he's

799
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:08,220
from California okay working in Vice and

800
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,980
digital

801
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:12,319
and how sincere he is he's here in

802
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:15,000
person

803
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:18,538
all right so hopefully you have a

804
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,359
wonderful uh learning and now time for

805
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:24,058
your present uh for your questions okay

806
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:27,959
anyone yeah before I tell you more story

807
00:33:24,058 --> 00:33:31,139
because how loud to share okay

808
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:34,200
wow come to Toastmaster maybe I do a

809
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:37,200
plug there okay so yeah addition to the

810
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,298
unzoom opened everywhere yeah locally we

811
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,298
also how Toastmaster Club public

812
00:33:39,298 --> 00:33:43,980
speaking so as students faculty and

813
00:33:42,298 --> 00:33:46,259
other people from Colonel outside

814
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,298
Colonel we are very diverse age

815
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:50,640
profession yeah it's helped me to be

816
00:33:48,298 --> 00:33:53,398
comfortable here oh yeah Kelly

817
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,640
uh just a I guess a quick question out

818
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:59,158
of curiosity right so I I feel like

819
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,080
I'm sort of so tied to like using

820
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:02,399
PowerPoint and kind of sort of these

821
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:04,439
standard ways of putting together

822
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,000
PowerPoint presentations you know as

823
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:09,179
someone that specializes in this do you

824
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,519
have any recommendations of of other

825
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:14,878
ways of putting together a presentation

826
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:16,679
that's maybe not so PowerPoint Reliant

827
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:19,199
how are you um yeah instead of

828
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:22,019
PowerPoint yeah uh well

829
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:24,898
it really depends on the presentation so

830
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:26,338
a lot of presentations but if you listen

831
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:28,440
to Ted Talks some of the talks don't

832
00:34:26,338 --> 00:34:31,139
have any slides at all and that's

833
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,418
perfectly valid slides though if you do

834
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:35,099
have them should support you as the

835
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:38,539
presenter you are the star of the show

836
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:42,139
not your slides the slides should be

837
00:34:38,539 --> 00:34:45,719
should be supporting you and should be

838
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:47,599
showing some information but you are the

839
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:49,980
person that they have come to listen to

840
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,320
otherwise they can just take your slides

841
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:54,418
and just watch them at home

842
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,180
so make sure that if you do have slides

843
00:34:54,418 --> 00:35:00,059
that they are are supporting you and not

844
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:01,618
the focus of the presentation you should

845
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:03,659
always be the focus of the presentation

846
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:06,358
so you can have a perfectly valid

847
00:35:03,659 --> 00:35:08,338
presentation without any slides now as

848
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:09,838
far as are there other options other

849
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:12,358
than slides where you can have a

850
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:15,299
presentation well sure one would be to

851
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:17,940
have some type of an object

852
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,500
are objects that you bring up and you

853
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,700
can have a combination of slides and

854
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,960
objects that you have in your

855
00:35:20,699 --> 00:35:25,379
presentation

856
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:28,500
I've used different techniques within

857
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:30,300
PowerPoint and zoom there's actually one

858
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,280
star did you attend the presentation on

859
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:35,820
how to present like a broadcaster yeah

860
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:38,220
okay so what I did is is that there is

861
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:41,519
capability within Zoom

862
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:43,618
to take your PowerPoint presentation and

863
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:45,980
put it as a background so what I did is

864
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:49,980
I created a virtual broadcasting studio

865
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:52,440
in PowerPoint I put a suit on I got

866
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,838
myself situated and looked like I was

867
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:57,659
actually behind a desk in a presentation

868
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:59,880
in a broadcast studio and I gave my

869
00:35:57,659 --> 00:36:02,519
presentation that way so if you look

870
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:04,680
into into PowerPoint and zoom look into

871
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:07,679
a feature it's a beta feature I think in

872
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:10,679
zoom on using PowerPoint as a background

873
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:13,559
and so you can use PowerPoint and so you

874
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:16,199
kind of are almost immersed in the

875
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:18,179
presentation itself

876
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:21,059
um also within I don't know if you use

877
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:23,699
teams at all here or yeah so in teams

878
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:26,519
you can present uh there's different

879
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:29,039
presenter views where you actually bring

880
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:32,219
you yourself into the middle of the

881
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:34,500
presentation uh or on the side and your

882
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:36,779
slides are right beside you and I like

883
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:40,199
to do that because it instead of just

884
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:42,540
being a little boxed onto the site you

885
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:44,460
actually are in your presentation right

886
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:48,000
next to your slides so that's another

887
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:50,639
way that you can bring yourself and and

888
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,500
bring yourself front and center rather

889
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:54,118
than

890
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:56,159
present I call it presenting outside of

891
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:59,039
the box right and and you're actually

892
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:00,299
more of a part of the presentation so I

893
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:01,500
don't know if I fully answered your

894
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,180
question but there's a couple of things

895
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,280
there's a few things that you can do yes

896
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:07,679
yeah thank you very much for that

897
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,480
presentation which I find timely because

898
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:11,578
I was just contemplating presentation

899
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,338
that I have to give okay yeah I

900
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:16,140
appreciate the the tips that you're

901
00:37:14,338 --> 00:37:17,578
providing but my I feel like my

902
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:19,858
questions are almost for the group

903
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:22,380
because I'm trying to interpret

904
00:37:19,858 --> 00:37:25,019
a couple of things and wondering how

905
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:28,079
they would be maybe star is really a

906
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:29,820
good person to help with this like what

907
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,680
does it call to action in our science

908
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:33,119
topic so so you're gonna you know you

909
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:34,679
say you're a grad student a postdoc

910
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,980
you're giving your research I'm like

911
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:39,659
like what would be appropriate to regard

912
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:42,300
as being in the call to action that's

913
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:44,819
one thing and even like let our story

914
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:46,200
how do we interpret the word story and

915
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,820
the kind of work that we actually do now

916
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:49,439
I'm not saying that's that harder

917
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:52,019
question but it's still a lot of

918
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,240
examples of what kind of would count or

919
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:55,800
be powerful in that and you know our

920
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:57,598
context I don't know if you're the right

921
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,800
person to answer well let me answer one

922
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,559
of your questions that you've had and

923
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,380
this is what I get from a lot of people

924
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:07,019
within who are in engineering and

925
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:09,660
finance and they say I don't there's no

926
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:11,880
stories there's just numbers

927
00:38:09,659 --> 00:38:14,819
I'm saying you can always find a story

928
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,800
so one example is let's say that you're

929
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:19,440
presenting your the end of the quarter

930
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,619
numbers and it's just okay we made 40

931
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,200
million dollars and we achieved and we

932
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:27,539
had a 10 million dollars profit

933
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:29,639
okay well yeah those are just numbers

934
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:31,139
and and so I have Finance people that

935
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:33,118
tell me how do I put a story if there's

936
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:34,679
no story behind it well there always is

937
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:38,579
so here's an example

938
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:42,299
you say today and uh I actually started

939
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:44,280
last week I went to the CFO and and I I

940
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,320
told them hey

941
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,519
guess what I've got an envelope sitting

942
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,460
on this desk

943
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:52,380
and in it is our as our end of the

944
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:54,420
quarter numbers guess what they were and

945
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:58,220
he goes

946
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,220
I think it was about 35 million

947
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:05,839
a little bit higher

948
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,838
um 38 million not a higher

949
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:11,879
it's more than 38. yeah

950
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:16,500
um

951
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:17,640
about 39. it was 40 million now very

952
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,858
simple story

953
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:20,940
right and you might think well it

954
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:23,420
probably doesn't have a lot of meaning

955
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:26,280
but when you couch a number in a story

956
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:28,320
people are more likely to remember that

957
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,839
number remember that statistic where

958
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,599
Jerome Bruner said you're 22 more times

959
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:36,059
likely to remember a number if it's

960
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,500
couched in a story well if I told the

961
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:40,199
story like that

962
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:42,960
and how more likely do you think that

963
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:45,779
people are to remember the 40 million

964
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,940
number that if I just said oh here's our

965
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:50,280
numbers we got 40 million dollars of

966
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:53,400
Revenue and we achieved 10 million

967
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,380
dollars in profit so very simple story

968
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,559
and again your stories don't have to be

969
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:00,420
complicated and overly dramatic they can

970
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:03,119
be a very simple story but if they're

971
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:04,740
sincere and if they're related to the

972
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,059
topic that you're talking about it could

973
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:07,500
be a struggle that you had in getting

974
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:10,858
some of the data it could be a funny

975
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:13,199
incident that happened but if you take

976
00:40:10,858 --> 00:40:15,059
your data and wrap it in some type of a

977
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:16,679
story your audience is going to remember

978
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:19,380
it one and that's one of the things that

979
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:21,719
you want to do the sad truth is this is

980
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:24,838
that probably about 15 of your

981
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:28,559
presentation and and more will be

982
00:40:24,838 --> 00:40:30,539
forgotten within 24 hours so that's one

983
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,279
of the challenges that you have as a

984
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:35,519
presenter how do you get your audience

985
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:37,380
to remember what you said for a longer

986
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:40,019
period of time and stories are

987
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:42,059
definitely one way to do that

988
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:44,400
how about the call to action yeah call

989
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:46,139
to action well I think I've I've turned

990
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,579
to the audience to say hey what are some

991
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:49,319
suggestions that people might have

992
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:51,420
because I think they would probably know

993
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,740
that better than me I'm not the subject

994
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,940
matter expert in what you're talking

995
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:57,959
about yes

996
00:40:53,940 --> 00:41:00,119
so I put up a call to action as uh you

997
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,400
know you conclude a presentation but

998
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:04,380
then you talk about the

999
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,660
two other motion you would add that

1000
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:08,700
impact of you know what's doing those

1001
00:41:06,659 --> 00:41:10,019
next steps would mean for yourself so

1002
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:11,578
it's kind of your call to action to

1003
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:14,519
yourself is that right is that

1004
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:16,920
accountable that can be yes yes on the

1005
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:18,420
audience you know yeah yeah I would

1006
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,039
agree with the call to action is next

1007
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:22,200
steps makes a lot of sense because it

1008
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:24,599
can be a call to action for yourself but

1009
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:26,639
also especially as students who

1010
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:28,500
generally will have like a small part of

1011
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:31,019
the project the call to action is to the

1012
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,639
your field and saying like this is what

1013
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:34,800
I've added and these would be the next

1014
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:36,299
logical steps of the encouragement that

1015
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,220
you hope that someone else will take on

1016
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:40,740
the research and help develop your ideas

1017
00:41:38,219 --> 00:41:42,179
further yeah that makes sense yeah it

1018
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:44,399
might be hey does anybody have any

1019
00:41:42,179 --> 00:41:46,858
suggestions on me yeah I can try to

1020
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,660
understand it yeah Rebecca these are

1021
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:50,639
things that we don't know what to do I'd

1022
00:41:48,659 --> 00:41:52,618
like to have people suggest you know

1023
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:54,960
some things that we could maybe some

1024
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:57,000
directions there could be several

1025
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,920
different things I think or if you want

1026
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,659
to people to go to your website a

1027
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,820
website or

1028
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:05,279
um to a paper or something to get more

1029
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:07,079
information that could be it right if

1030
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,460
you're interested this is where you go

1031
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:10,440
for more information now that's one

1032
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,639
thing I always do is that for more

1033
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:17,338
information here's where you can go

1034
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:19,259
one thing I can think of is uh why the

1035
00:42:17,338 --> 00:42:22,739
power of social media yeah you can see

1036
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:25,380
it's rising I think it's a part of once

1037
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:27,000
personally you want to take action and

1038
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:29,579
through your own posting your own

1039
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,858
blogging that can really get a lot of

1040
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:34,260
people really see the impact on

1041
00:42:31,858 --> 00:42:36,000
themselves so it's more powerful than

1042
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:41,280
you even send a real publication

1043
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,280
proposal sometimes yeah yeah please

1044
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:47,280
Justin in terms of credibility you talk

1045
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:50,519
about storytelling and then in injecting

1046
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,980
that in your presentation can add value

1047
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:54,780
but in terms of credibility if it's a

1048
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:56,940
story that you're sharing that you

1049
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,680
directly yourself experience versus

1050
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:01,380
maybe telling a story that you heard

1051
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:03,179
about that somebody else is there a fine

1052
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:05,760
line there is there a difference does it

1053
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:08,399
matter in terms of credibility uh well

1054
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,440
for incredible Oh Oh you mean whether

1055
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,260
people will believe like story that

1056
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:15,240
somebody else not so much believe but

1057
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,400
just uh in terms of adding that value

1058
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:19,379
that credibility to your to your to your

1059
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,240
speed does it carry more weight if you

1060
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:24,119
yourself

1061
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:25,858
experience versus somebody else okay so

1062
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:28,318
there's a couple different aspects of

1063
00:43:25,858 --> 00:43:29,880
that certainly a personal story is

1064
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:31,920
usually of more interest to the audience

1065
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:35,039
when you tell a story of something that

1066
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,900
happened to you personally especially if

1067
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:38,639
you're talking about something where you

1068
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:40,680
want to convince your audience to do

1069
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:43,739
something and you can tell a story about

1070
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:47,098
how you have been impacted by it

1071
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:50,098
yourself so I told the story about how I

1072
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:52,619
was impacted by storytelling and and how

1073
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:55,079
it impacted me now if I told a story

1074
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:57,720
about somebody else I think that's

1075
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:58,980
perfectly valid that is but I think

1076
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:02,039
there's something a little bit different

1077
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:04,559
and a little bit more impactful when you

1078
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:07,980
tell a story about that's personal

1079
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:10,259
and and what actually happened to you

1080
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:12,659
so both are definitely very valid

1081
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:14,700
sometimes you can't find this you don't

1082
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:17,279
have a story yourself right a personal

1083
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:20,098
story so you it's definitely very valid

1084
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,740
to use and I think can be really really

1085
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:24,838
impactful if you tell a story that um is

1086
00:44:22,739 --> 00:44:27,838
related to your presentation but

1087
00:44:24,838 --> 00:44:30,119
somebody else experienced it yeah

1088
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:31,380
so for the people on the line if you

1089
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:33,539
have questions you'd like to give you

1090
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:36,900
one chance okay yeah the last question

1091
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:39,559
say for the people on the line anyone

1092
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,559
it's

1093
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:45,539
just a mute yourself

1094
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:47,759
or send it through the chat okay yeah so

1095
00:44:45,539 --> 00:44:49,619
if not there's the amount of time so

1096
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,780
Justin's going to meet graduate student

1097
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:54,420
for lunch so graduate students are not

1098
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:56,460
continue on the conversation all right

1099
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:59,300
so let's give one more round of applause

1100
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:59,300
to Joshua

1101
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:07,199
thank you so what I really think uh

1102
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:09,599
Justin the value of Hebron is from my

1103
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:12,779
technical background computer science I

1104
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:15,720
felt his worksheets also all the

1105
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:17,900
techniques tools is very easy to follow

1106
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:21,419
yeah so

1107
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:24,420
three things to be persuasive I think we

1108
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:26,519
can all replicate yeah just multiply all

1109
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:28,380
right and if you see this as a value we

1110
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:30,358
can definitely invite Justin back online

1111
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:32,519
or in person in the future we're gonna

1112
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:36,078
continue out okay with that please join

1113
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:36,079
