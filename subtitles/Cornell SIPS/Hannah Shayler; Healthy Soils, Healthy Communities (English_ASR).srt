1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,128
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,499 --> 00:00:05,128
University

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:17,089
I'm an extension associate with the

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,740
Cornell waste management institute we're

5
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:21,050
part of the soil and crop sciences

6
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:23,089
section in the school of integrative

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,179
plant sciences here they changed the

8
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:27,109
name on us just to confuse things and

9
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:29,390
force us to update all our materials

10
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:32,719
eventually many of which still have the

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:35,030
old name but so I do have some slides

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,329
but I want to keep it really informal

13
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,890
and keep this intro part really brief so

14
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:42,619
that we have some time to talk about

15
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,969
concerns and ideas and interest from all

16
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:45,890
of your perspectives because it's really

17
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:47,539
useful for me to hear from some people

18
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:52,548
that I have been necessarily cross paths

19
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:54,640
would before and broadly I begin my work

20
00:00:52,548 --> 00:00:57,320
with Cornell about eight years ago to

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,658
address concerns about soil quality in

22
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,280
soil contaminants and much of that work

23
00:00:59,658 --> 00:01:03,228
has been through a collaborative effort

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,239
called healthy soils healthy communities

25
00:01:03,228 --> 00:01:09,228
which I'll tell you a bit more about in

26
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:10,700
just a moment and so as I said I'd like

27
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:12,170
to give you a brief overview of our

28
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,350
research and extension outreach

29
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,670
resources and programs but then more

30
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:18,468
importantly spend some time

31
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,049
brainstorming a little bit how we might

32
00:01:18,468 --> 00:01:23,780
be able to all work together to address

33
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:28,039
some needs and concerns and it's always

34
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:30,108
helpful to hear any perspective so

35
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:32,989
healthy soils healthy communities has

36
00:01:30,108 --> 00:01:35,179
been funded for a number of years by the

37
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:36,649
National Institutes of Health and the

38
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:39,740
National Institute of Environmental

39
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:41,060
Health Sciences that group that funding

40
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:42,289
has actually currently run out but it's

41
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,780
supported this program for a number of

42
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:46,909
years this partnership was led by

43
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,280
Cornell together with the State

44
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:52,640
Department of Health and a number of

45
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,200
partners in New York City including new

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,829
york city parks and recs greenthumb

47
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,780
program as well as other partners in New

48
00:01:57,828 --> 00:02:03,169
York City Buffalo and elsewhere across

49
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:05,539
the state and broadly the goal of this

50
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,638
research was to help understand more

51
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:11,180
about levels of contamination and urban

52
00:02:07,638 --> 00:02:12,889
gardens and farms and then what that

53
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,709
might mean for possible exposures and

54
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:18,318
health risks and to inform our

55
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:20,120
understanding of how we can recommend

56
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,069
affordable and feasible healthy

57
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,270
gardening practices so we don't want to

58
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:25,560
just point out to people that there's a

59
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:28,469
problem we want to focus on

60
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,520
feasible strategies that they can

61
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:33,810
implement in their own gardens or yards

62
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,550
so this healthy soils program was

63
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,870
focused on urban community gardens more

64
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:40,380
specifically but a lot of what we've

65
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:44,400
learned carries over to rural areas

66
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:45,840
residential properties we don't just get

67
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,280
questions from urban gardeners even

68
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,700
though that was the focus of this part

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,699
of the study

70
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:55,400
you all know gardening and farming have

71
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:57,829
many many benefits you know everything

72
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,900
from source of healthy food to physical

73
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:01,130
and mental health benefits community

74
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,860
building all of these really great

75
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:04,849
things that I don't need to get into of

76
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,520
this crowd because you're all well aware

77
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:09,409
of them so we want to keep those

78
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:14,510
benefits in mind but the reality is is

79
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:16,430
that there are also risks at times years

80
00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:20,329
of human activity have sometimes left

81
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,650
contaminants in soils in many areas we

82
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,240
don't have enough information about

83
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,490
levels of contamination and what might

84
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,230
be going on and sometimes gardening and

85
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:29,150
farming activities and any other

86
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:30,289
activities you know recreational

87
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,090
activities anything that could increase

88
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:33,739
contact with the soil may also bring

89
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,200
people in contact with the contaminants

90
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:38,600
and we kind of jokingly call this guy

91
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:40,009
exposure man just to give you an idea of

92
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:41,810
the possible ways that people can come

93
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:44,479
in contact with contaminants in their

94
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:46,789
environment they may be eating products

95
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,219
that are grown in soils such as

96
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:50,870
vegetables or chicken eggs they may be

97
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:52,639
accidentally breathing in or swallowing

98
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,819
so loyalists they're working in the

99
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:58,699
garden their skin may be touching soil

100
00:03:54,819 --> 00:04:00,109
and then little kids of course also may

101
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:01,518
be eating soil may be playing in the

102
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:07,100
soil we want to think about all these

103
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:09,469
pathways for people contacts will this

104
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:12,349
work and my job here and our extension

105
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:14,359
focus have really come out of lots of

106
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:17,750
questions that we get from gardeners and

107
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,930
homeowners and County educators and in

108
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:23,180
others should people test their soil

109
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,740
does the site history matter does the

110
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,509
location matter all of these questions

111
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,879
if so how should they collect soil

112
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:30,289
samples and there's really no single

113
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,810
strategy to do that so we can help

114
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,430
people think through the decision-making

115
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,740
at the early end when they're just

116
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,360
thinking about sampling where should

117
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,329
they send the samples different labs

118
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,009
offer different services and different

119
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:46,009
educational materials sometimes none at

120
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:47,449
all watch of the results mean it doesn't

121
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:49,519
help to have numbers unless that can

122
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:51,139
help us turn that into some kind of

123
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,969
action and help the people that we work

124
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:57,709
with take some type of meaningful

125
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:59,300
feasible action and what should

126
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:01,189
gardeners do what should homeowners do

127
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,840
and that's really the focus of how can

128
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:04,040
our research efforts inform our

129
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:06,079
understanding and best practice

130
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,640
and strategies that people can do to

131
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:11,629
reduce their contact with little

132
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:14,740
contaminants and through the healthy

133
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:17,420
service projects basically we've sampled

134
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,829
contaminants in our environment in the

135
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,890
number of different ways everywhere from

136
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:24,079
the soils of gardens and farms to the

137
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:27,620
vegetables that grew in those soils to

138
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:29,060
the chicken eggs that were raised in

139
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,889
some of these urban farms and gardens

140
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,839
and that helps us understand more about

141
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:35,539
the contact that people have with this

142
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:36,919
that can then inform these best

143
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,620
practices that we've been referring to

144
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,210
which can then inform our future

145
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,290
research and help us figure out places

146
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:46,609
where we might need more information and

147
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,129
I'm not going to get into all of the

148
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:53,569
science or all the details here but

149
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:54,920
broadly our 10 best practices for

150
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:57,019
healthy gardening resource is a

151
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,759
half-sheet handout that gives an

152
00:05:57,019 --> 00:06:01,399
overview of kind of the take-home points

153
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:04,879
of all of this use clean soil and

154
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:08,089
compost use raised beds or grow in a

155
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:10,490
clean medium whenever possible avoid

156
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:12,649
treated wood certain types of wood can

157
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:16,040
contain contaminants that are a health

158
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:18,620
risk cover or mulch or soil maintain

159
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,590
soil nutrients and pH put a barrier

160
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,269
under play areas keep an eye on children

161
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:26,449
to be sure they're not just ingesting

162
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:28,189
handfuls of soil basic hygiene practices

163
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:30,889
like leaving your soil in the garden

164
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:32,389
washing your hands washing and feeling

165
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:34,669
produce can make a big difference and

166
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:36,319
again we have a variety of resources

167
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:38,379
that get into the details of all of this

168
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,579
and I'm happy to answer more questions

169
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:42,829
but just to give you a taste of how that

170
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:44,029
all this works here's an example of some

171
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:47,419
of our research findings that have

172
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:50,029
informed our understanding of best

173
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,500
practices so for example from our

174
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:54,259
research in New York City community

175
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,089
gardens through our data we have seen

176
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:58,310
that average lead levels are lower in

177
00:06:56,089 --> 00:07:00,919
gardens that have more raised beds as

178
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:02,689
opposed to growing in the ground so that

179
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,310
shows us that these recommendations are

180
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:07,969
on target and that we are actually

181
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,379
seeing results from people growing and

182
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,720
raised beds clean material rather than

183
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:14,959
growing in grand soil that in many cases

184
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:17,180
can be contaminated adding

185
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,829
helps lower lead levels and helps to

186
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,519
bind blood in the soil to make it less

187
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:24,649
available to plants we work a lot with

188
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:26,629
compost added benefit to that is of

189
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:27,978
course that compost is great for

190
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:31,360
gardening in general and there are many

191
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:35,418
other benefits aside from just the

192
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,460
considerations for contamination we

193
00:07:35,418 --> 00:07:39,649
recommend that gardeners keep their

194
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:43,939
soils and you're neutral for most crops

195
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:46,370
and as behind that recommendation is

196
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:49,098
this is what we've seen that at lower pH

197
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,590
led is in a more available form in soil

198
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:53,149
that means that is the ph is lower it's

199
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:56,359
more likely that lead can be taken up

200
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:59,000
into plans but the good news is is that

201
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,460
for lead it's actually physical

202
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,680
contamination by saleal particles not

203
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:04,848
uptake through the roots that likely

204
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,550
accounts for most of the lead and

205
00:08:04,848 --> 00:08:10,610
vegetables so it's good news that plants

206
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:12,740
are good at keeping lead out of their

207
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,449
tissue and that means that there are

208
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,949
other things we can do to keep dust and

209
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:18,129
soil particles off of plants like

210
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:20,150
mulching and washing them thoroughly and

211
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:22,189
designing our garden so that we have

212
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:26,388
fewer areas of bare soil blowing around

213
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:28,370
on our plans and crop type matters of

214
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:29,658
the results of all the vegetable testing

215
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,929
we did in New York City and Buffalo

216
00:08:29,658 --> 00:08:35,240
gardens we see lower levels of lead and

217
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:39,588
other contaminants overall in fruiting

218
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:42,049
crops fruits and vegetable fruits roots

219
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:43,399
and leafy greens can be more affected by

220
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:45,049
contamination because the roots are

221
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,509
growing directly in the soil and the

222
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:48,799
leafy greens can be more affected by

223
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:50,569
those sort of particles and could be

224
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,338
different that can be difficult to wash

225
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,320
off of them where's a lot of fruiting

226
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:57,140
crops you can wash them more easily and

227
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,820
the plant has even more natural barriers

228
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:00,528
to keep the contaminants out of the part

229
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,690
that we eat so that can be another

230
00:09:00,528 --> 00:09:06,338
useful tool if people are dealing with a

231
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,339
challenging contamination situation

232
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,279
this is the house to hand out that I

233
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,440
mentioned this is what it looks like

234
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:14,179
this is available on our website for

235
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,890
download in English and Spanish and

236
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:18,079
we're working on developing other

237
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,909
resources that are kind of short and

238
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,960
sweet like this our other fact sheets

239
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:23,240
are a little bit longer and more

240
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,639
involved in tend to be a good resource

241
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,350
for people that are looking for more

242
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:32,720
detailed science and more detailed

243
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:34,970
information and some of those are a

244
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,620
series of fact sheets that guide people

245
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,960
through thinking about sources and

246
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,600
impacts of contaminants and soils guide

247
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,070
to soil testing and interpreting results

248
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,509
best practices for healthy gardens is

249
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,560
kind of the longer version of the short

250
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:49,700
half sheet that I just showed you as our

251
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:52,699
newest resource which is called metals

252
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:57,250
in urban garden soils and that gives the

253
00:09:52,700 --> 00:10:01,550
same healthy gardening tips but also

254
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:03,679
gives detailed information for the

255
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:05,449
elements most the metals most commonly

256
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,849
of concern for human health and plant

257
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:11,030
health so lead as well as about eight or

258
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:12,670
so others and including guidance values

259
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:15,139
that can help people understand what

260
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:16,399
their test results mean and what they

261
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:19,939
should compare them Q to make informed

262
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:22,069
decisions and just some other resources

263
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,720
many of you may be familiar with the New

264
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:27,379
York State's healthy gardening brochure

265
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,940
can see this pictured here and that's a

266
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:30,710
great resource they're happy to send

267
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,060
them to folks they have lots of copies

268
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,740
printed so there's a way to order them

269
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:35,329
through the doah website if you're ever

270
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:39,080
looking for those to hand out to people

271
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:41,600
that can use them and EPA has some great

272
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,710
resources as well and through the eight

273
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,409
or so years that we've been working on

274
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:46,460
this project we've seen more and more

275
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:48,049
information becoming available from

276
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,000
federal agencies and other research

277
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:51,769
programs love to hear more about what

278
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,629
types of questions you get in your

279
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:55,279
counties whether you feel like you have

280
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:58,070
the information and resources that you

281
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,169
need if there are specific things that

282
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:02,330
you'd like to see from us we would love

283
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:04,459
to hear that you know as I mentioned

284
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:07,730
we've heard that there's a need for more

285
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:09,830
shorter resources more multimedia things

286
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,279
that are a little more digestible than

287
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:14,509
fact sheets for certain audiences which

288
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:16,549
is definitely a fair point is something

289
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:18,259
we're working on and also it would

290
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:20,059
really be great if anyone has ideas for

291
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:20,528
making connections across New York State

292
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:22,568
to share

293
00:11:20,528 --> 00:11:24,039
formation and successes and make sure

294
00:11:22,568 --> 00:11:27,188
that we're sharing whatever resources

295
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:31,169
people have I get a quick view questions

296
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:34,419
rather about pressure treated lumber and

297
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:36,278
seems like there's a I don't know if

298
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:38,828
this is a unique here but this is we've

299
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:40,899
had a fair bit of pushback recently

300
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:44,378
about about that well there's you know

301
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:47,078
there's no proof that it's you know that

302
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:51,730
the new compounds are toxic and so on

303
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:54,969
and is there a Cornell publication that

304
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:56,829
you know gives some guidance in writing

305
00:11:54,970 --> 00:12:00,180
there that we could go to people well

306
00:11:56,828 --> 00:12:03,849
you know since it's not proven safe we

307
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:06,338
suggest that you you know not use it or

308
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:10,300
something until we get better you know

309
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:12,639
some some studies come in I am not aware

310
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:15,159
of a specific resource that gets into

311
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,799
the chemicals that are currently in

312
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:19,808
pressure treated lumber as many of you

313
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:22,179
know that concern for many years was the

314
00:12:19,808 --> 00:12:24,818
CCA treated lumber that had copper

315
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:27,128
chromium and arsenic in it all of which

316
00:12:24,818 --> 00:12:29,278
are not a great idea from the human

317
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:32,949
health perspective that our position

318
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:35,409
with the current treated lumber is that

319
00:12:32,948 --> 00:12:37,149
we don't have any research showing that

320
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:39,730
it's harmful but we also don't have any

321
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:43,089
research showing that it's safe so to

322
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:45,188
err on the side of caution would be to

323
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:48,639
use a non treated and untreated

324
00:12:45,188 --> 00:12:52,750
alternative if that's possible so number

325
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:55,000
three as avoid treated wood but we don't

326
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,860
get into the details of why and part of

327
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,129
that is that this sheet is very basic

328
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:03,428
but we don't specifically named the

329
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:06,879
chemicals in the new treated wood or get

330
00:13:03,428 --> 00:13:08,649
into why there a problem in some of our

331
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:10,600
longer documents we've explained what

332
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:12,549
the problem was with CCA treated wood

333
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,230
but the more years we get out from that

334
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:16,778
being a circulation that's becoming a

335
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,159
little less relevant so I agree that

336
00:13:16,778 --> 00:13:20,350
maybe it's time to update one of our

337
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,719
longer resources to comment more

338
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,220
specifically and I mean would it still

339
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,439
be useful even if it just said something

340
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:29,170
like we don't have evidence that it's

341
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:30,909
safe or is that just a cop out you know

342
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:33,669
that that's sort of the balance is with

343
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:34,360
a lot of these issues we don't

344
00:13:33,669 --> 00:13:36,490
necessarily

345
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,850
have answers or complete research-based

346
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:41,230
information so it's a in terms of

347
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,959
putting things in writing it's a little

348
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,519
bit of a balance of when do we feel

349
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,778
confident enough that we can share

350
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,120
something without adding to the

351
00:13:46,778 --> 00:13:51,458
confusion versus areas that just truly

352
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,870
need more research and therefore we're

353
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:55,389
kind of waiting until we see some

354
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:58,000
results to fine-tune some of our

355
00:13:55,389 --> 00:14:00,939
recommendations and but that but that

356
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,589
one about treated wood I mean that

357
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,329
question of whether chemicals and

358
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:06,820
current treated wood are toxic is not

359
00:14:04,328 --> 00:14:09,578
something that our research group will

360
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,019
be prepared to handle any time soon so

361
00:14:09,578 --> 00:14:12,759
it may be that we just do need some

362
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:16,959
language to give people more specific

363
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:18,939
advice now another question related to

364
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,559
pressure-treated is if we're not going

365
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:25,750
to use pressure-treated are there other

366
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:28,689
species we want I recommend that yeah

367
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:32,230
we've had good luck with locust if

368
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:34,540
that's available where your gardeners

369
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:37,329
are where you are that's not always an

370
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:39,069
option for everyone I mean untreated

371
00:14:37,328 --> 00:14:42,958
lumber can work though it isn't going to

372
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:46,180
last quite as well as as other options

373
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:48,458
you know something like cedar could work

374
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:52,179
we could possibly pick apart the

375
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:54,278
sustainability of that but again I know

376
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:58,419
here in Ithaca local locally sourced

377
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:59,948
locust has been a great alternative for

378
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:01,719
something that's a little tricky to work

379
00:14:59,948 --> 00:15:03,129
with initially because it is so hard but

380
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,940
once you've got the beds in place

381
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:09,578
they've been holding up really well and

382
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:13,110
that's one thing that we would like to

383
00:15:09,578 --> 00:15:16,179
do more of as well is to work with

384
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:18,490
counting educators and others to have

385
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:20,649
resource lists for particular locations

386
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:23,440
for things like bed building supplies

387
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:25,870
and soil and compost and all of these

388
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,640
things that seem so basic from the short

389
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,039
version of our recommendations like how

390
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:32,049
did you conceal and compost well that's

391
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:34,360
great as long as you have a source that

392
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:37,689
is reliable and may not be contributing

393
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,990
to a contamination concern and yes use

394
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:42,100
raised beds is a very oversimplified

395
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:44,889
recommendation people want to know what

396
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,389
type of wood how high they should be you

397
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:47,860
know specifically what should they be

398
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:49,028
doing

399
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,190
some of that is really going to be

400
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:53,019
situations dependent and that there

401
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:55,180
there should be room for flexibility

402
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:57,970
based on the needs of a particular site

403
00:15:55,179 --> 00:16:00,609
but I agree that it would that more

404
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,930
tutorials more workshops would be

405
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,970
helpful for everyone and we're hearing

406
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:05,259
from people that they would like more

407
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:09,690
details for all of these recommendations

408
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:12,370
I know it's really hard to come up with

409
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:14,470
specific guidance on soil testing but I

410
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:18,909
would love to see more kinds of tools

411
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:20,860
like a flowchart related to helping

412
00:16:18,909 --> 00:16:23,289
decision-making based on site history

413
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:26,230
intended use and budget does anything

414
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:27,639
like that exists it exists in our head

415
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,250
that's actually something we've thought

416
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:31,899
a lot about it a flowchart or almost

417
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,480
like a decision to reformat that's

418
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:36,490
easier to navigate than a fact sheet so

419
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,399
yes we agree with you that that would be

420
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:40,839
really helpful we haven't made it happen

421
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,700
yet but that is definitely something

422
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:46,360
that's on our radar so if you have any

423
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,860
specific ideas for components that would

424
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,060
go into that and that you'd like to see

425
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,480
please feel free to pass them along

426
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:53,619
because that is something that we are

427
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:57,190
kind of on the back burner at the moment

428
00:16:53,620 --> 00:17:00,009
vote I would love to see that happen we

429
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:02,980
get questions regarding salt water over

430
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:06,068
wash from Hurricane sandy there were

431
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:08,880
home heating oil spills from flooding so

432
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:12,730
contamination do the weather related

433
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,860
episodes some so we get question of

434
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:17,610
whether it's safe to plant vegetables on

435
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:20,740
their property now three years later

436
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:22,779
yeah we had gotten a lot of questions

437
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,099
following Hurricane sandy as you might

438
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:25,720
imagine because we work closely with a

439
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:29,079
number of gardeners and organizations in

440
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,700
New York City I don't have the specific

441
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:33,490
resources in front of me but we do

442
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,259
actually have some information written

443
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,179
up that I would be happy to share if

444
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:39,730
that would be helpful the gist of it

445
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:42,429
basically was that given time the soil

446
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:46,509
should be able to recover from the salt

447
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:50,019
and the thing to be concerned about

448
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:52,690
would be if there were noticeable signs

449
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:56,829
of something like an oil spill so no an

450
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:59,919
oily residue in the soil or a chemical

451
00:17:56,829 --> 00:18:01,599
smell either petroleum smell or evidence

452
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,130
that some sort of other chemical

453
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,129
had made its way into the garden as a

454
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:09,340
result of the flooding depending on the

455
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:11,980
specifics of what was there I could

456
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:14,349
consult with my team to see about what

457
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,150
we're looking at three years later so

458
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:18,279
kind of just the basic oh we've had

459
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:20,500
we've had a lot of salts it's very

460
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:23,428
likely that systems are in good shape by

461
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:26,619
now if there was a more specific

462
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:30,820
contaminant spill that could possibly be

463
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:32,199
something that could be addressed

464
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,788
through testing and bringing clean

465
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,470
materials in figuring out exactly what's

466
00:18:33,788 --> 00:18:36,970
going on if that hasn't happened yet but

467
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:39,009
I'd be happy to talk further and share

468
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:44,589
what we had shared with gardeners at the

469
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:48,490
time getting questions about soil

470
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:50,918
pesticide contamination and residue any

471
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:53,558
information you have related to helping

472
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:56,799
ease people's concerns about that sure

473
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:59,139
so pesticides is a really broad category

474
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:04,179
of potential issues one thing that's

475
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:06,940
been on our radar a lot is the past use

476
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:08,890
of lead arsenate on former orchard plans

477
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:12,100
especially and also some different types

478
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:14,259
of growing areas but yeah we've actually

479
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:15,849
done a lot of research here at the

480
00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:18,908
dillman Hill student farm on campus

481
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:20,859
which is a which was an orchard site in

482
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:23,140
the past and was heavily impacted by LED

483
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:25,269
arsenate contaminations so highly

484
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:28,450
elevated levels of both lead and arsenic

485
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:30,038
which bad news for students far but has

486
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:32,558
actually turned into a really great

487
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:34,390
piece for the opportunity and the staff

488
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:35,889
and students at the farm have worked

489
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,450
with us and others over a number of

490
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:39,490
years now to be sure that they're

491
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:42,100
growing food in areas that are not

492
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,839
impacted by the contamination and we've

493
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:46,629
been able to learn a lot for our own

494
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:48,250
projects by taking advantage of this

495
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:52,780
site that was impacted by this

496
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:55,359
historical contamination so that's one

497
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:57,759
specific example of one type of past

498
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:59,199
pesticide use that has had lasting

499
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:00,879
repercussions and that's kind of a big

500
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,259
one because there's a lot of former

501
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,820
orchard land that's now being used for

502
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:08,589
gardening and other purposes and farming

503
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:10,480
we kind of think about identifying

504
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:14,089
contaminant problems as detective work

505
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,950
so Paul thinking about

506
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:18,319
cific alee what may have happened on a

507
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:21,019
set on a site sometimes we know exactly

508
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:23,000
hey this gardener or this landscaper

509
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:25,069
came in and applied this particular

510
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,690
product what does this mean and in that

511
00:20:25,069 --> 00:20:30,710
case you can look up the material safety

512
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:35,210
data sheets you can possibly test for a

513
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:37,429
particular chemical in other cases it's

514
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:39,200
more of a vague understanding that may

515
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:43,190
beat something viewed in the past in

516
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,690
general we recommend testing for metals

517
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:47,630
as a starting point if there are

518
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:50,090
possible concerns about contamination so

519
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,740
if there were lead arsenate used that

520
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:54,439
would show up in the form of lead and

521
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:56,480
arsenic testing for organic pesticides

522
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,390
for example gets very expensive very

523
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:04,519
quickly so we don't generally recommend

524
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:07,370
that people test for other specific

525
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:09,079
contaminants beyond metals unless they

526
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:11,148
really have cause to think that it's an

527
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:13,339
issue with their site in some specific

528
00:21:11,148 --> 00:21:15,500
question that they think the testing can

529
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:18,349
help with otherwise what might be a

530
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,028
better alternative is to put the money

531
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:22,759
that they would have spent on testing

532
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:26,089
into getting clean materials and

533
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:28,490
possibly just covering up the known or

534
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:30,528
suspected problem at a given site that's

535
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:32,120
not always possible but it's also not

536
00:21:30,528 --> 00:21:34,609
always possible for someone to spend

537
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:36,259
hundreds or thousands of dollars on soil

538
00:21:34,609 --> 00:21:38,469
testing particularly in a residential

539
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:40,759
situation so it's kind of a trade-off of

540
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:43,190
considering what we know about this site

541
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:45,109
what's likely to be a problem what

542
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:46,788
resources are available including money

543
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:48,589
and then figuring out the balance of

544
00:21:46,788 --> 00:21:50,569
okay it should be focused on testing to

545
00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:53,629
learn more which is that deal or do we

546
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:56,538
just put that money into implementing

547
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:58,190
best practices that can reduce contacts

548
00:21:56,538 --> 00:22:00,440
with the contaminants even if they may

549
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:03,070
be buried under kind of the working

550
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,070
surface a

551
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:08,480
so that's really where this 10 best

552
00:22:06,589 --> 00:22:11,959
practices for healthy gardening emerged

553
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,500
out of that thought of like how can we

554
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:17,740
be make best use of our resources

555
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:20,509
definitely and in a cost-effective way

556
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:23,528
site remediation meaning actually

557
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:25,759
removing contaminated soil is very

558
00:22:23,528 --> 00:22:27,589
rarely an option for a lot of the

559
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:28,548
gardener's that we work with because if

560
00:22:27,589 --> 00:22:29,839
you think about it you've you know

561
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:31,369
you've got to have the money to bring in

562
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:33,278
the equipment to get the soil out of

563
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:35,359
their son got to go to a landfill

564
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:36,798
especially in New York City logistics of

565
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,469
moving things and transport could be

566
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:41,778
really daunting so what often makes more

567
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:44,089
sense is to instead cover up the

568
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:45,710
contamination and just start fresh so if

569
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:48,199
you're growing food that often means

570
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:49,819
raised beds or you know putting some

571
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,370
type of barrier down and then bringing

572
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:55,849
in clean material you know a framed bed

573
00:22:52,369 --> 00:22:59,839
can work a mound of clean soil over a

574
00:22:55,849 --> 00:23:02,209
surface that's you know that's blocking

575
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:05,898
off the contaminated material can also

576
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:08,360
work so it's it's difficult to give very

577
00:23:05,898 --> 00:23:11,178
specific recommendations because as I

578
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:12,709
said before a lot of sites can benefit

579
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:14,509
from flexibility of finding what works

580
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,919
for them but these are kind of the basic

581
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:20,269
principles that we want people to keep

582
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:22,820
in mind if the pH is very different than

583
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:26,269
the normal surrounding soil should be

584
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:27,769
eat or you know are there any like hints

585
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:31,609
that there might be heavy metal

586
00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:32,839
contamination it's like any red flag

587
00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:37,128
testing that you can do this

588
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:38,388
less-expensive not really is the tricky

589
00:23:37,128 --> 00:23:41,058
part you know for example we can see

590
00:23:38,388 --> 00:23:43,668
plants thriving and soils that are very

591
00:23:41,058 --> 00:23:45,888
high and lead because that is not toxic

592
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:49,070
to plants the way it is to people if

593
00:23:45,888 --> 00:23:50,269
certain metals are our phytotoxic but

594
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:53,378
those don't tend to be the same ones

595
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:55,849
that are a concern for human health the

596
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:57,798
what we find most helpful is thinking

597
00:23:55,849 --> 00:24:01,609
about the most common sources of

598
00:23:57,798 --> 00:24:04,069
contaminants so for lead lead paint is

599
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:08,148
really a big one in both urban and rural

600
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:11,269
areas so if the if a garden or soil of

601
00:24:08,148 --> 00:24:12,888
any kinds is adjacent to an older

602
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:14,538
painted structure that would have had

603
00:24:12,888 --> 00:24:16,278
blood pain at some time in the past it's

604
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:17,599
very likely that there may be elevated

605
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:19,460
levels of lead

606
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:20,839
closest to that structure we tend to see

607
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,110
the highest levels right by the building

608
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:25,159
and then it decreases from there

609
00:24:23,109 --> 00:24:27,259
sometimes there was an old out building

610
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,279
on the site you know an old garage or an

611
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:29,869
old shed or something that would have

612
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:32,269
been painted and that building make it

613
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:33,649
taken down and the current owner may not

614
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:35,359
even remember that that had been there

615
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,830
or know that it had been there but if we

616
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:40,389
were to test the whole site we may see

617
00:24:36,829 --> 00:24:44,089
kind of this legacy of that past pain

618
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:47,030
LED from leaded gasoline was also a big

619
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:50,058
impact on lead levels so places closer

620
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:53,859
to busier roadways can be impacted by

621
00:24:50,058 --> 00:24:57,558
LED specifically and then also the lead

622
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:59,389
arsenate from pesticide use and the

623
00:24:57,558 --> 00:25:02,690
possible sources are a little different

624
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:04,090
for each of the different metals in our

625
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:06,409
fact sheets you can read more about

626
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:11,449
specific contaminants and where they may

627
00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:14,210
have come from but it's you know kind of

628
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:16,308
so for led you can't see it or smell it

629
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:18,230
for organic contaminants you know if you

630
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:20,210
smell something that doesn't seem quite

631
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:21,500
right if you see an oily residue that

632
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:23,240
might be evidence that something was

633
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:27,190
going on if you know that burning had

634
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:30,319
happened at a site known old burn barrel

635
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:33,110
could give you a clue that that might be

636
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:34,970
an area to pay attention to but other

637
00:25:33,109 --> 00:25:37,879
than these types of clues and trying to

638
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:39,769
parse out the site history unfortunately

639
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,539
there aren't there generally aren't easy

640
00:25:39,769 --> 00:25:44,658
ways to look at the soil or look at the

641
00:25:41,538 --> 00:25:46,940
plants and know that there's a problem

642
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:48,559
unless you see a pool of oil or smell

643
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,769
something but that's kind of an extreme

644
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:50,769
case

645
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:56,960
we're always looking to hear from people

646
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:58,549
the more we hear from people the more we

647
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,960
can make a strong case that we should

648
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:03,950
exist and that our program should be

649
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:05,840
here so you know where we're happy to to

650
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:08,269
hear in Currys directly from you please

651
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:10,279
pass along questions from people you

652
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:12,319
work with in your counties that you know

653
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:13,879
that we may be able to help answer you

654
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,519
know please please make use of us so

655
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:21,730
that we can continue to exist and be

656
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:21,730
here thank you everyone
