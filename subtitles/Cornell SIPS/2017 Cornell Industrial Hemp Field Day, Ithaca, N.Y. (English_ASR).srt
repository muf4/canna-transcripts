1
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:15,439
my name is Don vians I'm um a professor

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,160
in plant breeding and genetics in the

3
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,719
school of integrate of plan Sciences

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,160
here at Cornell and uh we put together a

5
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:25,919
program for our first hemp field day um

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,599
ever where um fortunately we have some

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,599
nice looking hemp for you to be able to

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,160
see and i' noticed everybody was kind of

9
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,200
roaming around looking at it and you'll

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,840
have opportunity to do that little bit

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,600
later on as well but uh we have a lineup

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,360
of some of us here from Cornell who are

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,160
working with hemp and we have quite a

14
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,238
few people and the number of people are

15
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:44,839
growing who are interested in working on

16
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:47,839
different aspects of hemp in terms of

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,800
research and extension and um and we

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,559
also have uh Chris log who I'm not sure

19
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,679
he's here yet but oh there he is

20
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,238
wonderful uh he's from the Department of

21
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:58,719
Agriculture and markets who is going to

22
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:01,280
be uh talking a little bit later on

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,439
about the uh potenti uses the marketing

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,519
of hemp and also some of the regulatory

25
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,079
issues that uh that Growers need to keep

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,439
in mind I noticed that uh looking at the

27
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:14,359
list of all of you who have uh signed up

28
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:16,639
or enrolled online for um this field day

29
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:18,079
uh that there's a wide variety of

30
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,439
backgrounds that you come from and

31
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:23,078
interest that you have about hemp so

32
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:25,959
what I would like to do is to keep this

33
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:27,798
informal um certainly there are uh half

34
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:29,919
a dozen or so of us who are going to be

35
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:32,159
giving talks but to keep it informal

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,640
almost such that as you have questions

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,799
or even comments or want to get into

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,399
discussion about anything just barge in

39
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,040
at any time to do that okay so uh so it

40
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:44,079
would be more fun if this was more of a

41
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,560
two-way discussion or a multiple way

42
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:49,239
discussion than if it's just us up here

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,200
uh lecturing to you uh so keep that in

44
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:56,239
mind um we also have um assembly woman

45
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,799
Donna leardo who is somewhere close by

46
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,560
but I don't think she is here there she

47
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,840
is oh wonderful so she she's just waving

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,159
her hand there I wanted to recognize her

49
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,920
because she is the one who initiated all

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,640
of the discussions about industrial hemp

51
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,919
and the potential uses here in New York

52
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,399
state and um and the subsequent

53
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:17,958
legislation and and um essentially paved

54
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,200
the way for us to be able to I mean

55
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:21,519
without her we wouldn't be having this

56
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,839
field day right now essentially so let's

57
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:23,270
give her a round of applause for what

58
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,360
she's

59
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:30,080
[Applause]

60
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,920
done and certainly anytime that you want

61
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,040
to contribute to the discussion feel

62
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,639
freee to jump right on in so so again

63
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:38,159
we'll keep this very

64
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:40,199
informal um so what I'd like to do is to

65
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,919
start out by just telling you how we got

66
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,238
into this research here at Cornell

67
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,158
University in the first place and uh and

68
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,439
it started last year with the Department

69
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:51,919
of Agriculture and markets who made some

70
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:54,919
funding available to us to to start out

71
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:57,439
by evaluating varieties of industrial

72
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:59,839
hemp that come from Canada and Europe um

73
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,560
by and large and to see which ones will

74
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,759
perform the best under our conditions in

75
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,239
New York state until we have time to

76
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,439
actually do some breeding specifically

77
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:09,239
for New York State conditions so that's

78
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,719
what this set of Trials is all about

79
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,200
here um there are a couple of people who

80
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:15,840
will explain more about this um a little

81
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:19,199
while from now so I won't try to steal

82
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,080
their Thunder but um but by the time we

83
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,199
went through all the the regulatory

84
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,640
approval process that had to be done in

85
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:29,199
tandem we couldn't do it all at the same

86
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:31,438
time uh it wasn't until late August of

87
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,798
last year we were able to actually uh

88
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:35,598
purchase some seed and obviously that's

89
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,319
too late to get some good experiments

90
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:40,479
going but uh but my research crew uh

91
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:43,759
planted out some small trials only about

92
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:46,119
a mile in that direction from here um at

93
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,679
the 1 of September last year not to

94
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,879
really get good data on on harvest I

95
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,400
mean by the time that froze um sometime

96
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,959
in November it was only about 6 or 8

97
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,200
inches tall but it at least it gave us a

98
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,878
chance to um to see how well we could

99
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:01,598
establish some experiments they actually

100
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:03,719
tried out two different planners and got

101
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,598
some good data so we have a little

102
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:08,479
experience behind us before um doing the

103
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:09,919
real trials this summer and you can see

104
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:11,840
behind me that that it was very

105
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,199
successful in establishing a good trial

106
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,759
there um so that's what last year was

107
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:21,358
all about um but what I'd like to do is

108
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:24,240
to um turn this over to Dr Chris smart

109
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,959
to describe uh more of what the research

110
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,280
plans are for us here at Cornell and uh

111
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,239
not only what we're doing now but what

112
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:32,159
we plan to do in the future

113
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,918
and um and and what's happening in terms

114
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,759
of of of production around the state in

115
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:40,159
regards to research Chris is a u

116
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,479
professor in the um section of Plant

117
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,199
Pathology and plant microbiology in the

118
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,000
school of integrated plant science um

119
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,520
and she's the one who's coordinating all

120
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,918
that we're doing here with Industrial

121
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:53,519
Hemp in our College uh and on top of

122
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:54,719
that she's uh she's also a director I

123
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,959
know you're interim director but

124
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,880
essentially you're director today I'm

125
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:01,279
director oh are you today is the day oh

126
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:03,800
wow okay so she is she is a director of

127
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,559
the school of Integrative PL science so

128
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,319
Chris well thank you Don and and welcome

129
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:13,478
everyone to Cornell uh it is a beautiful

130
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:15,839
day and this is uh a really remarkable

131
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:18,318
hemp trial Don and his his crew have

132
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:21,038
done a great job um in terms of the

133
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,479
research that we're doing here we now at

134
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:26,000
cornal let me give you a bit of a

135
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:29,680
history um last year in 2016 there were

136
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,918
15 or 16 States across the US that had

137
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,280
Industrial Hemp research projects this

138
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,560
year and and Don's group was one of them

139
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:39,079
uh it was really fantastic that he was

140
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,800
this year there's 31 States so

141
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:42,680
Industrial Hemp is booming and and we

142
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,879
have a lot of folks to collaborate with

143
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,478
across the country um so it's really

144
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:50,120
nice that um the state has enabled us to

145
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:51,918
jump in and and really um get on the

146
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,478
wave of industrial hemp that's happening

147
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:58,120
right now in terms of what we're doing

148
00:05:54,478 --> 00:06:00,159
um we now have 11 scientists at Cornell

149
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,519
that uh they and folks in their Labs

150
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,960
have projects on Industrial Hemp last

151
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,839
year this time we had one so uh so the

152
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:11,719
state has definitely got us enthusiastic

153
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:13,359
about Industrial Hemp we also have um 10

154
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,280
Educators from Cornell Cooperative

155
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,960
Extension across the state that are

156
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:21,559
involved in bringing information uh to

157
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,359
Growers about how to grow hemp and and

158
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,720
uh you know what can we do this year in

159
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,080
terms of hemp and how where are we

160
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,039
looking to the Future so that's really

161
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:31,639
exciting uh in terms of some of the

162
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:34,879
research that will be doing um there is

163
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:37,000
a research project actually um that is

164
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,759
run through Cornell but uh it's actually

165
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,680
a state funded project where this year

166
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,319
there are 29 Farms that are involved in

167
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,800
the research project these are farms uh

168
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:50,520
that are all growing the same variety of

169
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,560
industrial hemp that variety is Anka the

170
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:57,159
reason we chose Anka was not some

171
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:00,319
amazing scientific literatur driven

172
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,400
reason it's really the that we could get

173
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,720
a hold of at the time we decided to do

174
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:09,198
this large scale project um but it it is

175
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,520
a dual purpose um uh variety of hemp so

176
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,759
it'll be interesting to see how it does

177
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:14,918
on these 29 different farms in terms of

178
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:18,479
the research we know what the history of

179
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:20,918
the land that the Anka is being grown on

180
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,000
um we know we have soil tests and um

181
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:26,478
we'll have weather data we'll have yield

182
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,598
data so uh we'll know really how this

183
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:31,279
variety does we have Farms from Lake

184
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:33,839
Erie all the way way down to Long Island

185
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,598
uh Growers are amazingly entrepreneurial

186
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,359
we have Growers that are growing for

187
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,639
fiber and for seed we also have um

188
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,479
Growers that are uh uh growing plants in

189
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,439
the greenhouse and transplanting them

190
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:48,918
out uh to extract the medicinal

191
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:51,279
compounds the nonhallucinogenic

192
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:53,000
non-thc uh medicinal compounds and

193
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,359
they'll be selling those and then we

194
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,478
have Growers that are actually

195
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,720
harvesting two to three week old plants

196
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:02,318
and using them uh for baby greens uh and

197
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,240
salads and whatnot so uh I've been

198
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,800
amazingly impressed again continually by

199
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,478
The Growers in the state of New York how

200
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,800
entrepreneurial you folks are and um all

201
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:14,478
the different uses and and creative ways

202
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,520
that you can find to to thrive uh in

203
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,639
this farming environment it has been a

204
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:20,758
tough year we've had a lot of water uh

205
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,800
my background is in sorry Jen my

206
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,800
background is in uh Plant Pathology I

207
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,038
study diseases of vegetables and if

208
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,319
you're a vegetable girl you know it's

209
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,918
been a tough year it's been hard to get

210
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:31,840
in because of all the rain um but our

211
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,478
Growers have gotten the hemp in it's

212
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,439
gotten in late and uh we'll be

213
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,360
enthusiastic to see what we learn at the

214
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,000
end of the

215
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,879
season um in terms of other research

216
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,639
projects um uh Larry and Larry smart

217
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:46,679
who's a a plant breeder um in the school

218
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,240
of Integrative plant science as well uh

219
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,519
he and Don vians are going to be

220
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,080
establishing a breeding program one of

221
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:56,278
the things that we learned this year we

222
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,759
Don's group knew last year is that um

223
00:08:56,278 --> 00:08:59,480
because of the permitting issues that

224
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:02,399
Chris log will talk about you know you

225
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,159
know moving seed across state or country

226
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,679
lines can be extremely difficult and so

227
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:09,519
it'd be really great to establish a seed

228
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,319
production industry here in New York so

229
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,159
that New York Growers can buy seed

230
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,079
produced in New York um uh alleviating

231
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:19,319
some of the permitting issues and that

232
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:21,120
will be coming online um but but just

233
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,040
starting a breeding program from scratch

234
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,560
takes time and so um we're also working

235
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:29,599
with um local seed companies to try to

236
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:33,000
find ways to import the seed more

237
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,920
smoothly uh than what happened this year

238
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,200
um additionally uh in that program uh we

239
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:43,360
will be establishing a um a THC and CBD

240
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,720
CBDs are the nonhallucinogenic compounds

241
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,278
medicinal compounds produced by hemp uh

242
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,680
a testing facility that hopefully a year

243
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:53,360
from now um both researchers and Growers

244
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:56,439
will be able to use um to determine what

245
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,800
varieties have uh higher levels of those

246
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,839
uh medicinal compounds uh when grown

247
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,759
here in New York

248
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,000
so those compounds do change depending

249
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,278
on the environment depending on water

250
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,799
content and depending on heat so uh

251
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:10,320
that's going to be an important aspect

252
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:11,759
of our program we have a plant

253
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,879
Pathologists that's going to be studying

254
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,600
plant diseases we have an entomologist

255
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,919
that's looking at insects we have a

256
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,519
system scientist who's looking at how

257
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:24,078
hemp fits into a rotational system um we

258
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,240
have uh also I I along with a

259
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:27,958
microbiologist are looking at uh the

260
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,879
microbiome you've heard that you know

261
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:31,759
what's in your gut and on your skin skin

262
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,200
helps make you who you are healthy and

263
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:34,958
things like that well we're actually

264
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,079
going to be looking at the microbiome of

265
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:39,759
hemp to see what kind of microbes grow

266
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:41,679
on hemp and how that might impact some

267
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,078
of the products that we get out of it so

268
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:47,159
that's some of the research uh that

269
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:49,559
we're going to be uh doing at Cornell um

270
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:51,240
and and we're really excited actually

271
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:53,799
just to to be involved with the Growers

272
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,799
and to learn from you guys you know what

273
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:57,519
your needs are but also uh what you're

274
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:59,559
learning on your farms and how we can

275
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,240
bring that back and feed the those

276
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:04,159
questions and those Solutions into our

277
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:07,440
research program um I also want to say

278
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:12,799
that we do have a another a field day in

279
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:15,079
Geneva on um uh Tuesday August 15th so

280
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,439
the Geneva plots uh we have Cornell has

281
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:19,199
a campus in Geneva it's about an hour

282
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,959
north of here so we have four trials

283
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,879
here that Don group will talk about

284
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:26,479
today we have two identical trials to

285
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:29,480
these four in Geneva and um those trials

286
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,440
don't look quite like this so when we're

287
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,278
in Geneva we'll actually be talking

288
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,959
about some of the struggles that you

289
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:38,679
might have if you're planting a hem crop

290
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:39,799
um you know this this is beautiful as

291
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:41,278
I've heard you know some of the

292
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,120
researchers are like wow if I knew it

293
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:45,759
was going to look like this you know I'd

294
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,639
grow in a heartbeat um but what happens

295
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,639
when a field gets drown out what do

296
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,360
things look like um what disease and

297
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:53,639
insect pressures do you have and things

298
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,360
like that um so we'll have some of the

299
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:57,639
extension folks there and we'll talk

300
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,360
about some of the some of the issues

301
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:01,440
that uh you could have if you're if

302
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,480
you're growing a hemp crop um and with

303
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,360
that I think I would turn it over to is

304
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,278
it your folks back to Don um some of you

305
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,120
who have uh stood up close to the hemp

306
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:12,559
here may have noticed that these green

307
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,879
varieties here that are in bloom um

308
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,039
there's a lot of bees in there

309
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:16,958
bumblebees and honey bees and so forth

310
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:19,719
they're really doing a lot of

311
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:23,359
pollinating and appar love him for

312
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,278
pollen Source um also was thinking as I

313
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,800
came out this morning and I was looking

314
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:30,559
um not straight in this way but um from

315
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:34,240
the other direction particularly there

316
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:36,278
this stand is so thick that um that you

317
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,839
could easily use this for you know like

318
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:39,198
they have corn mazes and stuff like that

319
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,279
the

320
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:44,759
pathways so maybe maybe once the uh

321
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:47,519
regulations allow for that to happen uh

322
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:50,559
we could have hemp mazes so we'll see

323
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,480
what happens in the future um next up um

324
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,638
U we're going to have a couple of people

325
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,639
from our research program talk about the

326
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,560
actual trials that are going on here to

327
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,879
um evaluate varieties for our conditions

328
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,559
here in New York State um so I'd like to

329
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:06,799
introduce uh two people to come up Jamie

330
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:09,239
Crawford who I really have to um to

331
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:11,159
acknowledge has done a lot of work to

332
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,360
make uh the logistics of all of these

333
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:15,240
things that we're doing with hemp happen

334
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,360
um she's been very instrumental to to

335
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,560
pulling off a lot of of things there so

336
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,440
Jamie is a research support specialist

337
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:23,559
on the uh Forge breeding project which

338
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,240
is the project that I lead but of course

339
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:29,719
now we're into hemp um research as well

340
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,720
and uh along with her is Amelia uh yafi

341
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,320
who is U actually completing an

342
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,639
internship with us um she's actually

343
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,560
from Sunni kobal skll and has to do an

344
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,919
internship in order to complete her

345
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,319
degree requirements there at cobal skill

346
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:44,799
uh so she became interested in

347
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,079
industrial hemp and uh we took her on as

348
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,399
a an intern to work with the the hemp

349
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:51,000
project this summer and um has done a

350
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:52,839
lot of really nice things there so I'm

351
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,720
going to turn it over to the two of them

352
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:57,680
good morning um I have a bunch of things

353
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,399
to tell you and I knew I forget so you

354
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,519
have actually a handout for what I'm

355
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,278
going to talk about it's called 20177

356
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,078
Industrial Hemp

357
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:08,679
trials so um the very first table on

358
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:10,479
that sheet shows you our different

359
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:13,278
locations for our trials and the

360
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,560
planting dates so the trial you see

361
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:17,958
behind me right here this is um this one

362
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:22,919
was planned to June

363
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:26,799
9th and you can see it's done very very

364
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:28,679
well um the one directly behind me this

365
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,879
is our grain and Dual Purpose variety

366
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:32,719
trial

367
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:35,679
and then we also had four entries that

368
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,959
are exclusive fiber varieties and so

369
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,958
those are the next block down so those

370
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:41,479
of you interested in fiber should go and

371
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:45,799
check those out as

372
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,920
well um so you can see we planted well

373
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:49,838
Kristen mentioned how far behind the

374
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:52,759
trials were in Geneva they were planted

375
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,839
later so we planted a second trial on

376
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:58,440
this exact same soil type the day after

377
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,920
we planted the first Geneva trial and

378
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,600
that is what down at the far end so you

379
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:06,120
could be able to see a little bit of a

380
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:09,399
difference a difference 3 weeks can make

381
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,360
um the varieties are still photo period

382
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:13,159
sensitive so you can see that even

383
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,240
though they are much shorter they're

384
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:18,559
still starting to flower at about the

385
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:21,720
same time um within the last two weeks

386
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:23,359
luckily we've had uh two people from

387
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,720
different Canadian seed companies come

388
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,519
and visit us and they've said that even

389
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:32,759
though it's planted later it will still

390
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:34,519
be hard harvested in like let's see so

391
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,360
since it's there's a 3-we difference in

392
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:39,560
planting there'll probably be a week and

393
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,278
a half difference in harvesting time so

394
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:44,919
it's it's not going to be you know it's

395
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:47,720
not the full 3- week difference for the

396
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:50,240
Harvest so you can see our other trials

397
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:53,560
on on here so we have one other trial

398
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,600
here in itha that was planted on on what

399
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:58,599
I would call a challenging soil so it's

400
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,839
what we plant we planted a trial on it

401
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,000
last year and what we planted with a

402
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,120
grain drill so it was planted about a

403
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,519
1in seating depth it just didn't come up

404
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,879
at all it was terrible so we planted it

405
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:15,318
this year with a 4in seedar aiming for

406
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:19,799
about a half inch seeding depth and

407
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:22,078
then bad luck right about two days after

408
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:23,439
we planted it we got a rain and then two

409
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:28,078
nights in the

410
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:31,319
40s and so um the emergence in that

411
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:34,599
field is not what you see

412
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:36,879
here as sort of an understatement uh in

413
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:41,560
the trial right behind me we're

414
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:44,439
averaging between um between 10 and 18

415
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:46,599
seedlings per square foot and on that

416
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,160
other trial I was just talking about we

417
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,120
were averaging between four and seven

418
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:53,039
seedlings per square foot so it was a

419
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,759
big difference a big

420
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:58,198
difference um and then we have the two

421
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,278
trials planted in Geneva one of them on

422
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:02,758
a moderately well- drained soil and so

423
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:05,439
on a somewhat poorly drained soil so we

424
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:08,519
know we have those in New York state and

425
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,720
then our last trial is on a gravel it's

426
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:13,439
the only one that had a lot of rocks so

427
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:17,318
our last trial was planted in an organic

428
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:20,160
system in on the in Freeville and so

429
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:22,599
that was in that was rotating out of red

430
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,279
clover and then we planted hemp into it

431
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:27,519
so we're really looking forward to what

432
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:29,480
we see in that one so the plots behind

433
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,079
me each one is

434
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,480
well this is sort of the joke some one

435
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:34,759
of the students pointed it out to me

436
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,000
after I printed out the so our plots are

437
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:41,079
4 feet by 20 feet so everyone can make a

438
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,160
a 420 joke there you have to have one at

439
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:47,240
a hemp meeting right

440
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,960
so and then each entry is replicated

441
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:53,960
four times throughout each trial

442
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,200
um like I said we we were aiming with

443
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,159
our grain drill for about 3/4 of an inch

444
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,519
for a seating depth in all of our trials

445
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:03,720
except for the East Ithaca one where we

446
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:06,038
aim for half an inch

447
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:09,400
um and then if you want to look at the

448
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:11,879
back you can see a list of the varieties

449
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:15,559
that we have in the trials so we've got

450
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:17,440
13 varieties that are listed as grain or

451
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:20,678
dual purpose so the ones you see on the

452
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,880
signs here the four fiber Tri four fiber

453
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:24,440
entries which you can see down there and

454
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,280
then there's also some contact

455
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,038
information for the seed companies that

456
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:31,558
we got these varieties from so for

457
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:34,720
future trials we do we do hope to get

458
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:36,599
more entries um we want to be able to

459
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,600
show for the farmers of New York State

460
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:40,839
you know the full spectrum of what's

461
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:43,599
available to them so there's a couple

462
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:45,918
other seed companies in Canada that ran

463
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:47,759
out of seed this year so we're hoping to

464
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:52,880
get some of their entries from Parkland

465
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:54,359
for next year and um yeah so next Amelia

466
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,120
is going to talk to you a little bit

467
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:57,959
about some of the notes that we've taken

468
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:01,079
yeah I always wondering uh why didn't

469
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:04,480
you just culture the Cannabis that grows

470
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:06,798
organically here in indigenously in New

471
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,640
York to start a project I already have

472
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:11,839
cold weather and the soil hardiness

473
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,960
cannabis

474
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:16,519
h

475
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:20,000
i

476
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:22,879
it's that would not be commercially

477
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,319
available to Farmers right now like the

478
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,200
purpose of these trials right now is to

479
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:31,798
see what farmers can purchase and plant

480
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,679
in their fi Fields right now so like

481
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:35,798
yeah I'm here I'm trying to talk to you

482
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,600
about the variety trials that we have

483
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:40,839
that's part of a a future breeding

484
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:44,038
program right so the whole idea we would

485
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:46,359
of course you know native hemp varieties

486
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:48,119
are of interest in breeding programs but

487
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:50,759
for the trials like this is what a

488
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:54,038
farmer can get seed of and plant next

489
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:56,480
spring so that's that's what we we need

490
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:59,359
to show okay any other questions before

491
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,000
I pass yes sir the variety that has

492
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:05,000
that's 3 weeks behind do you expect it

493
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,038
to grow to this extent or it will never

494
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,919
do that I don't think it will ever get

495
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:12,000
quite this tall um they were I can

496
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,520
answer that uh once it starts the photo

497
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,880
period change it stops its uh growth

498
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:20,960
upward produces flour or seed uh the

499
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,640
gentleman who came last week he he is

500
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,640
the one who markets Anka so Ruben Stone

501
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:29,280
he was saying that they have areas where

502
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:33,720
they've planted Anka

503
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:35,558
in beginning of May and that's like 15

504
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:39,519
feet tall

505
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:42,000
so um yes Jamie aren there there a few

506
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,879
varieties that are Pho perod in

507
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,558
sensitive I thought that one up in

508
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,559
Canada

509
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,200
at I think that's what Larry actually

510
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,079
wants to bre there's nothing to stay

511
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,200
neutral yet but that would be one of the

512
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,879
first p

513
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,880
I was

514
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,038
already yes so um I'll bring in Amelia

515
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:15,119
and she's going to talk about some of

516
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:17,960
the notes that we've taken on the trials

517
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:20,678
so far hi

518
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,000
so um I'm the research intern and with

519
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,759
the help of some of our student

520
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,278
employees they've been collecting data

521
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:30,038
on our trials um on a weekly basis most

522
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:33,119
of these data include notes on uh height

523
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:35,839
stand and flowering as you can see all

524
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:38,558
of our varieties um are flow are in

525
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:40,678
bloom now I think the fiber may just be

526
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:43,759
beginning uh the fiber varieties have

527
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:46,798
been much slower um to to

528
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:48,839
begin um and something I've noticed is

529
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:51,679
there's vast differences between arm

530
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:54,798
Manish and dises varieties and for those

531
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:57,240
of you who don't know um dous varieties

532
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:59,759
are the ones that have male and uh

533
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,200
female plants that are separate and

534
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:06,679
Monisha plants produce male and female

535
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:10,440
parts on the same plant um all of our

536
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:13,640
dious varieties um began to bloom uh

537
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,679
sooner and they had um they did so much

538
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,720
more vigorously at first and then their

539
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:22,320
growth sort of slowed down whereas the U

540
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:25,120
mishas varieties have continued to um

541
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:26,798
grow a lot more at a much more steady

542
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,839
and linear

543
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:32,440
rate um we plan on combining the our

544
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:35,678
grain and Dual Purpose varieties um in

545
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:39,440
the fall when about 70% of the seeds are

546
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:42,320
mature um so we're expecting to do that

547
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,159
probably September October and our fiber

548
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:47,519
trial will be harvested uh when 20%

549
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:51,840
flowering

550
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:53,240
occurs so that's all we have for now

551
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:57,158
there was there was a note in one of

552
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:59,240
your um handouts that the the mishes are

553
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:02,559
only used for breeding

554
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,919
they not generally put in the field I

555
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:07,960
was just curious

556
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:11,120
why whether the are breeding

557
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:13,960
varieties um that are Manas I think

558
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:13,959
there are some varieties

559
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,798
already just because just had a comment

560
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:20,720
that said minisha cultivar are generally

561
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:22,278
only grown by plant freeders is that

562
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,919
that they're just not as advanced or is

563
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:26,919
that they produce less seed or

564
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,840
I'm not sure that

565
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:34,919
that's true because a lot of people

566
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:38,399
prefer money varet because they won't

567
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:41,799
lose 40% of their crop due to dead male

568
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,519
plants so that's why I was just curious

569
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:47,599
yeah will you be using the seed from

570
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:51,359
these in future plantings what about

571
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:54,519
cross-pollination between any of them

572
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:55,599
no um no we plant we plant certified

573
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:58,079
seed in our

574
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:00,240
trials and so we won't be saving any

575
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:04,199
seed well we will test the quality of

576
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:07,278
these seeds for um different oil

577
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,919
production but when it comes to planting

578
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:10,119
again we're going back to the certified

579
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:13,759
seed

580
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:16,119
bags and it's illegal I me was point out

581
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:20,240
that it is in fact illegal to save the

582
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:22,319
seed why why is that uh Chris so you

583
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:27,359
have to buy it every

584
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:31,759
year it it has to do with Federal

585
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:34,959
de intellectual property is well there

586
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,679
is yeah that's there are some varieties

587
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,720
that sign

588
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:42,000
absolutely but it's also illegal at

589
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,558
least our our permit does not allow us

590
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,119
to

591
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:50,960
hold can you these plants right down

592
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:54,038
but is that

593
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,919
legal so what are I mean under your if

594
00:24:54,038 --> 00:24:58,879
you have a license to do that then it's

595
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,240
illegal it is legal

596
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,039
oh sorry the question was can you clone

597
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,278
the plants can you put them into tissue

598
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:04,398
culture and that's absolutely something

599
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:06,278
that we're going to be doing here at

600
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:09,119
Cornell in fact the director of our

601
00:25:06,278 --> 00:25:11,798
tissue culture facility is here today um

602
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:14,439
but you have to have the appropriate

603
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:16,440
licensing from the company Who Sold you

604
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:19,120
the seed and you also have to have the

605
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,480
appropriate permits so that Matthew

606
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:24,199
doesn't get thrown in jail we we like

607
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,200
him and we like him

608
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,600
at um will breeding efforts focus on

609
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:33,278
ities or strategies that won't

610
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:35,678
necessarily incur as many licensing

611
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:38,960
issues or material transfer agreements

612
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:41,278
for Farmers that will not Ur well I mean

613
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,519
so like eventually ideally people will

614
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:46,480
be able to save see of H and won't be

615
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:49,119
breeding from varieties that

616
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,599
might previously have such um

617
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:53,918
restrictions on

618
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:55,480
them by state in Colorado are the states

619
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,120
that

620
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,120
have

621
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:03,519
yeah yeah I'm not sure how to answer

622
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:05,479
that question yeah I didn't

623
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:07,000
uh I didn't quite hear the whole

624
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,839
question there something about breing

625
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,119
what well well I if some of these

626
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:14,398
varieties um I have licensing agreements

627
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:15,798
that you can't repeatedly save seed is

628
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:18,079
that legally towards the companies that

629
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:20,240
own the variety on top of Federal

630
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:21,960
Regulation oh yes that's so that's

631
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,960
absolutely right that happens with the

632
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,000
most crop species uh even with Alfalfa

633
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,679
that you see the plots behind you there

634
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,440
uh that we work with on a project as

635
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:33,440
well

636
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,200
um especially the private companies will

637
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,519
uh go through what's called plant

638
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,798
variety protection uh some will actually

639
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:43,440
patent their varieties and so that's a

640
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:45,519
legal process so that makes sure that

641
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,120
that you or I cannot pirate this their

642
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,558
seed and call it our own variety uh they

643
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:51,439
put all all the expense into the

644
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:53,038
research and development of that variety

645
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,480
and producing the seed and so forth they

646
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:56,640
want to protect it so that they can get

647
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,720
some payback so that they continue with

648
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,919
with their efforts there uh so that's

649
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,360
just part of the legal protection system

650
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:04,559
uh it's not part of the drug enforcement

651
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:06,839
agency or anything like that uh but it's

652
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,480
just just part of the system to to make

653
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:10,678
sure that uh companies are protecting

654
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,079
their own interest so forth and and I

655
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:13,360
don't say that in a selfish way that's

656
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:14,639
that's kind of the way it needs to be in

657
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:16,879
order for companies to have the

658
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,399
incentive to put all the the funding

659
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,360
into research and development of

660
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:21,879
products like this does that answer your

661
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:25,558
question well I just wondering if you

662
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:27,360
then breed off of varieties that um have

663
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:29,879
those protections do those like just

664
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:32,278
continue forward so if we do that uh we

665
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,600
need to go to that company and ask if

666
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:36,278
they would allow us to do that and and

667
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:39,158
and sign an agreement and of course we'd

668
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:40,640
have to pay them a royalty on on um any

669
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:42,760
varieties that we develop from their

670
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,120
materials uh usually there's a royalty

671
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:46,558
basis uh per pound of seed you know so

672
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:48,000
many cents per pound of seed that we

673
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,359
have to pay back to

674
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,278
them there's a couple patent attorney

675
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:53,119
over here there's a couple different

676
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:55,159
issues going on you may actually be able

677
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:56,918
to patent a gene sequence you can't

678
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:58,320
patent the whole genome but you might be

679
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:00,360
able to patent a sequence to give gives

680
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:03,359
it a particular characteristic in that

681
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:05,199
case any of us wouldn't be able to grow

682
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:07,000
a hemp plant with that particular Gene

683
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,159
sequence in it because then we would be

684
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
violating their patent um but if you

685
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:13,200
enter into a license agreement with one

686
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,798
of these companies then there's a

687
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,720
potentially additional restrictions on

688
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:19,158
top of whether or not you can actually

689
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,200
breed with their plant technically you

690
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:23,360
know by the patent law itself if you

691
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,798
breed with their plant and then produce

692
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:26,599
something without that patented Gene

693
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:28,558
sequence you might technically be okay

694
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:30,319
by the patent laws but but by the

695
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:33,278
license agreement you you might not be

696
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:35,398
okay right right any other questions

697
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:38,038
about anything related to that yes do

698
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:41,319
you have any plans to test autoflow for

699
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:42,919
oil autoflow yeah uh we haven't thought

700
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:45,960
about that at least I haven't but that

701
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:45,960
might be an interesting thing to

702
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,720
do how much the seeds cost how much the

703
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,759
seed cost uh Jamie what did we have to

704
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,278
pay for

705
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:59,398
that need to give you the mic

706
00:28:56,278 --> 00:29:00,319
to so for the seat cost it's it's

707
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:04,479
probably

708
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:07,639
$2.50 to $3 a pound for the seat and

709
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,399
then you pay for all of the testing that

710
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,360
they have to do through apis to get it

711
00:29:09,398 --> 00:29:15,119
imported to the United States and then

712
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:18,240
the shipping is extensive on top of that

713
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:20,158
as well and then I don't know what did

714
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,679
we work it out to Chris do you remember

715
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:26,159
like it was uh 50 roughly $50 an acre

716
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:29,880
yeah had roughly $50 an acre for the

717
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:31,278
seaa and that was for that was for Anka

718
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,480
that yeah that was also when we bought

719
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:38,240
it in bulk so we bought 51,000 lb of it

720
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:42,038
and got it at about 50 so it would be

721
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:45,519
about $50 per acre how many pounds per

722
00:29:42,038 --> 00:29:47,038
acre 30 30 pound yeah so the question

723
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:49,640
was how many pounds per acre and we were

724
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:51,960
planning at 30 lbs per acre which was

725
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:54,799
about the $50

726
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,840
range yes in addition to testing for the

727
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:58,639
oil quality and the fiber content will

728
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:00,278
you take a look at the pharmaceutical

729
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,120
value of this crop even though I know

730
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:04,159
it's not intended for that purpose yes

731
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:06,639
we're very interested in doing that so

732
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,559
uh uh what we would like to do is that I

733
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,038
mean Sunni Bingington has a

734
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:12,398
pharmaceutical school now and uh we we

735
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:13,519
talked to them about a year ago about

736
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:15,518
interest I know they're working with

737
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:16,839
some other people now too but uh but we

738
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:18,919
would like to get some people interested

739
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:20,839
in looking that right so the question

740
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:22,519
was I think if I heard it right I think

741
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:25,359
the question was are we going to be

742
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:29,440
looking at other non-thc medicinal

743
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:30,719
compounds yeah basically yeah so um uh

744
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,360
this year again we're getting that up

745
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,440
and running so we'll just do it as a one

746
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:40,398
shot deal we have um at cornal our uh

747
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:42,720
BRC bio Resource Center um we'll be

748
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:48,398
gearing up for that so we'll test for

749
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:50,960
THC and then for the um cannaboid panel

750
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:54,359
uh and then next year the idea is that

751
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:57,798
you know we we'd have more time to plan

752
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:58,558
a a more rigorous scientific study and

753
00:30:57,798 --> 00:31:01,038
and

754
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:03,638
we would probably do um different

755
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:07,119
timings but at least for this year we'll

756
00:31:03,638 --> 00:31:09,678
get um information from the 17 varieties

757
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:11,759
at least a snapshot H and we'll do that

758
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,360
for each of our six locations that has

759
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,798
the varieties I'm glad thanks for

760
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:17,000
clarifying that Chris because yeah we

761
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:18,918
can't we're not doing everything this

762
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,159
year this is our initial year but but in

763
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:22,960
the future we would like to do that so

764
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:24,240
yes uh don same question I asked you

765
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,840
before about harvesting equipment want

766
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,960
to sort of throw it out if if you guys

767
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:29,839
have what are you guys doing for

768
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,120
combines are making uh adjustments to

769
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:33,319
your combines if there's any specialy

770
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:34,398
equipment you guys are looking into or

771
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:36,439
if anyone

772
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:38,278
has so I think that's a general question

773
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,080
for everybody um Ed and I were talking

774
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:43,159
about that before we started here uh

775
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,278
about Harvest equipment that you use and

776
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:45,960
it would probably be different for the

777
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:48,278
fiber varieties versus The Grain and

778
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,798
Dual Purpose varieties I mean I've heard

779
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:52,480
I've read that U that people have used a

780
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:53,960
combine for the Grain and Dual Purpose

781
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,639
types but sometimes there can be some

782
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,278
problems with um with all that stalk

783
00:31:55,638 --> 00:31:58,398
material wrapping around the the

784
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:00,759
components of the

785
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:01,959
combine um so that is an issue anybody

786
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:03,679
have any experience with that or

787
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,319
thoughts on that clients in North

788
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,559
Carolina who using a hand decorators

789
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,200
using what a hand hand decorators oh

790
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:13,558
okay

791
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,319
yeah I knew a farmer in Vermont that

792
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:18,119
actually left a remainder of the

793
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:20,798
Hempfield because it took about 2 to 3

794
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:23,479
days just to combine 4 acres oh really

795
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:27,398
um and they had to repeatedly stop and

796
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:30,200
unwind the combine and uh resharpen the

797
00:32:27,398 --> 00:32:32,879
blades whatnot because the fiber is just

798
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,159
too much for their John Deere Combine so

799
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,760
that could be an issue and I know that's

800
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:39,480
a common issue um throughout the hemp

801
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:41,200
industry right now is the hardest thing

802
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,240
of it yeah so that's that's something

803
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,200
where um some some agricultural

804
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,240
Engineers could come in handy to to work

805
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,440
out that system but there is I mean

806
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,759
obviously there's a lot of fiber in

807
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,159
there even in the grain types there's a

808
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:54,879
lot of fiber I mean otherwise this tall

809
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:55,960
material wouldn't stand up like it would

810
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,200
I mean we're just catching up with the

811
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:02,319
rest of the world here are there the

812
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,319
machines in other countries

813
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,759
Australia challenge it's always been

814
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:12,119
challenge always my company is

815
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:14,558
associated with some Partners from the

816
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:16,398
University of Taiwan and we've been

817
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:18,960
doing this in China for they've been

818
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:20,918
doing this in China for many many years

819
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,319
but entally you could buy a piece of

820
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:29,600
Machinery that actually separates all of

821
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:33,398
it seeds huh oil uh any any of the stack

822
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:37,199
so what is your company name again the

823
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:39,359
industrious that to write that down I

824
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,360
might

825
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:44,480
pie okay thank you other questions

826
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:46,038
before we go on to the next

827
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,319
speaker

828
00:33:46,038 --> 00:33:51,960
here okay here and then here I'm curious

829
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:55,079
what you'll be doing next year or any

830
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:57,120
research on like the systems work what

831
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:58,398
follows hempwell how to deal with all

832
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:00,759
the fiber

833
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:02,439
in the field for next year yeah I mean

834
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:04,599
Chris can help me answer that because

835
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,240
she's been she and she and Larry smart

836
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:08,480
have been thinking about this I mean one

837
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,838
of the things that we want to do too

838
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:14,280
right now we just have uh these these um

839
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:15,679
variety trials just on Cornell land we

840
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,839
would like to spread that out some

841
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,960
throughout the state I mean right now

842
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:22,559
producers several produc producers are

843
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,280
just growing Anka but we would like to

844
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,679
get some variety trials more widespread

845
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,359
so we can get a better idea of the best

846
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:30,960
varieties for New York State conditions

847
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:32,199
not just on our experimental Farmland um

848
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,000
so that's one but Chris I don't know if

849
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:37,078
you want to contribute more to that can

850
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,838
you guys all hear me so um yeah in in

851
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:42,079
terms of on Farm or or rotational

852
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:44,679
strategies um there's a scientist Matt

853
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,960
Ryan who's in the soil and crop science

854
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:49,599
uh section of sips and he's going to be

855
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,000
looking at integrating hemp into his

856
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,760
system study and then in addition to

857
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
that I think you know one of the things

858
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,839
that we can do fairly fairly easily is

859
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,639
right now we're looking at what is hemp

860
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:03,960
following at the 29 farms and there are

861
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:06,358
some interesting things cuz there were

862
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,280
some Growers that you know sprayed and

863
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:10,519
were ready to prep prep for soybean but

864
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,480
they couldn't get their soybean in

865
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:13,519
because of the rain and now they're

866
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,000
putting hemp in so we'll be able to tell

867
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:16,519
you know did the herbicides that were

868
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,719
put on to prep for soybean are they

869
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:20,440
attack you know are they an issue for

870
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:22,239
hemp so in some ways the 29 Farms are

871
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,679
helping us with that the other thing

872
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:25,919
that will be helped with is that we can

873
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:27,879
go back to them next year and see if

874
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,200
they're having issues you know what are

875
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,920
they following and are they having

876
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:35,679
issues so we can follow that for a while

877
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:38,519
so so right now we are developing our

878
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:42,118
systems approach but we can use the 29

879
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:43,838
Farms sort of as a as a real life you

880
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:46,599
know scientific study to see what

881
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:49,078
happens so um and any of you you know if

882
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:50,960
you if you once you guys start growing

883
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:53,480
hemp and you know anything that you

884
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,000
found has has affected the hemp either

885
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,358
that you did before the hemp goes in the

886
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
ground or after it's coming off going in

887
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:00,759
the next next year I mean that's all

888
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,920
really valuable information that you

889
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:06,200
know we hope to learn from you

890
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,960
guys any other questions before we move

891
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:11,799
on yes I was curious to know if you

892
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,159
watered this or if you just relied on

893
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,560
here yeah we've had plenty of rain you

894
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:20,318
did irrigate it once to start with

895
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:24,039
didn't you Jamie um we had one dry spell

896
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:26,440
in June and at that time we weren't sure

897
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:29,000
the DEA was going to allow us to plant

898
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:34,039
in all of our location so like we need

899
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:36,318
this to survive so we did irrigate it um

900
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:39,519
for I don't know just a couple hours one

901
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:41,639
morning at the very early seedling stage

902
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:43,920
but um none of the other trials were

903
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:46,480
irrigated we just were just like we need

904
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,880
this to survive what happens if it cooks

905
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,559
and so there was an act of desperation

906
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,599
here just to make sure but um and it

907
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:56,000
turns out it probably would have been

908
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:58,039
fine but um but none of the other trials

909
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,199
have been irrigated

910
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:01,880
you obviously it's been an unusual year

911
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:03,799
um last year was so dry and this year is

912
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,760
so wet and if you put the two years

913
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,000
together it averages out but but that's

914
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,760
not the way the plants act they don't

915
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,559
work on averages um so you know with all

916
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,160
the rain that we've had this season each

917
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:16,440
week we wonder well is the foset going

918
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:18,559
to turn off and then it's going to turn

919
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,519
dry the rest of the summer and you just

920
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:23,880
never know but it's it's just it just

921
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:26,358
keeps on going so so with I mean we got

922
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,838
this planted late later maybe several

923
00:37:26,358 --> 00:37:29,880
weeks maybe a month later than what we

924
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:31,920
really wanted to plant it but yet it's

925
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,400
it's growing very tall and so you know

926
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,800
we've had plenty of moisture to keep it

927
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:39,160
going this season so other questions yes

928
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,240
do you have any faculty positions

929
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:43,960
opening up at Cornell or anyone know but

930
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:46,559
for cannabis genetics I know and a lot

931
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:48,358
of you people are kind of taking on this

932
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:51,318
as a new plant but what about people who

933
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:52,799
specialize in Hampton cannabis turn that

934
00:37:51,318 --> 00:37:54,480
over Chris but I'm not aware of any new

935
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,920
faculty positions right

936
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,280
now all right we do have new faculty

937
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,760
positions but but uh the the ones that

938
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,680
we have right now are not um they're not

939
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,119
cemp

940
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:09,159
related shouldn't they be um well so I

941
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,559
think actually to to answer that

942
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:14,519
question quite seriously I think that I

943
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:17,799
think that um hiring a faculty member

944
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:22,039
for a 40 30 or 40 years stent or 20 30

945
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:24,400
years stent um you know is a is a

946
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:26,679
serious Endeavor and and I think that we

947
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,599
don't know yet how well hemp is going to

948
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:31,279
do in New York I mean this is really the

949
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:33,079
first time that it's been out and so you

950
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,359
know I think we need to give it a season

951
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:39,800
or two to figure out how we plug that in

952
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:41,880
to our research portfolio um and and

953
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,760
footprint across the state you know to

954
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,318
make sure that you know we still have

955
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,960
have folks that are working with our

956
00:38:45,318 --> 00:38:48,880
vegetable Growers and our field crops

957
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,159
Growers um you know just to make sure

958
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,200
we're very well-rounded and so I think

959
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:55,159
um the people that are on hemp are you

960
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:57,239
know we're all in and I I feel like you

961
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:59,440
know we're we're covering it quite well

962
00:38:57,239 --> 00:39:01,039
and um in the future if it continues to

963
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,559
expand then we would certainly look into

964
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:04,719
that area I mean we have the advantage

965
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:06,880
Chris mentioned earlier that there are

966
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:09,679
11 of us um on the faculty working on

967
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,599
this and um we we're all coming from our

968
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:12,799
different areas of specializations put

969
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,480
together as a package where we're

970
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,359
cooperating together to you know to to

971
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,000
look at the complete package so it's not

972
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:21,159
just breeding or genetics but it's all

973
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,719
different areas of of research that

974
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:25,159
we're uh working on here and that's

975
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:26,399
really what it's going to take that's

976
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:28,920
what it's going to take the work because

977
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,720
it's not just one area specialization

978
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,720
that we need to be focusing on but we

979
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:37,000
need to look at all aspects of of

980
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:39,000
production and so forth so okay yes hi

981
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,719
I'm curious uh is there a thought about

982
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,880
uh building communities in terms of um

983
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:45,559
uh worker cooperatives and such so that

984
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,000
uh the extraction devices and the

985
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:49,599
processing devices can be brought back

986
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
to the farm farming communities that's

987
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,280
all where all the money is you know it's

988
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,159
one thing to grow the plant but to

989
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,720
manufacture and farm and and to process

990
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:59,318
uh into you know the 500 different us is

991
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:01,199
that's where really the money is so I'm

992
00:39:59,318 --> 00:40:02,838
wondering if there's thought about that

993
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:05,519
yeah I'm not totally sure what your

994
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:07,159
question is about the uses of the

995
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:08,559
equipment back to the farm so for

996
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:10,559
instance in North Carolina there's a big

997
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:12,119
movement of building farm worker

998
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:14,039
cooperatives where they will buy the

999
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:16,119
extraction equ so that the farm that

1000
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:17,400
money stays on the farm okay right if

1001
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:19,480
we're seeing this in marijuana on the

1002
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,200
west coast Farmers don't make any money

1003
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,240
it's all in the processing and and

1004
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:25,239
building the market so I'm curious as to

1005
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:27,159
whether Pell or new YK state is

1006
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:29,959
thoughtful and thinking about building

1007
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:32,159
those sort of marketability yeah so we

1008
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,800
from New York I think is here Pard me

1009
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:37,118
Cheryl are you here there you are okay

1010
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,480
yes so we have Cheryl from Harvest New

1011
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,640
York Corner corate extension do you need

1012
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,079
to mic no and I don't have an answer to

1013
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:44,519
that right now I am familiar with what's

1014
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:45,720
going on in North Carolina I don't know

1015
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:47,559
that any thoughts been given that to

1016
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:51,358
that yet I would say too it's just too

1017
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:52,838
new yet so far um so um I know Chris is

1018
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:54,159
where's Chris here he's going to be

1019
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:56,358
talking about talking about processors

1020
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:57,838
towards the end of it um but I don't

1021
00:40:56,358 --> 00:41:00,039
have an answer right now to it's a great

1022
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:03,159
question

1023
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:04,400
though okay um let me move on WE we'll

1024
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:06,358
have more opportunities for questions

1025
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,960
we're not done yet this morning um but

1026
00:41:06,358 --> 00:41:10,480
let me move on before I introduce the

1027
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,760
next speaker though um I might mention

1028
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,318
some of you may have noticed or maybe

1029
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,760
you didn't notice the tall fence that's

1030
00:41:13,318 --> 00:41:19,400
around our experimental Farm here um so

1031
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:22,280
that um fence is there because we have a

1032
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,599
lot of deer problems around here and um

1033
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,280
you know you see some Ford species

1034
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,720
behind you alal and so forth if we

1035
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,440
didn't have some way to control the deer

1036
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:31,000
um we wouldn't be able to to collect the

1037
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,639
data for our research purposes that we

1038
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,960
need to collect so so I don't know Ian

1039
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:36,719
people have asked me if deer are a

1040
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,079
problem on hemp and I don't really don't

1041
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:39,799
know the answer to that we haven't had

1042
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,200
experience with it yet have have any of

1043
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,480
you U heard anything about whether deer

1044
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:47,639
will bother hemp at all Yes uh in

1045
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:50,480
Vermont um I was told that the seedlings

1046
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:53,118
um the deer really liked but as the hemp

1047
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,800
grew tall and more fibrous the deer just

1048
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:59,440
left it alone okay too much fiber in

1049
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:01,560
there so it might it might depend thear

1050
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,039
really if we didn't have this fence here

1051
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:08,199
they would be eating our alala but

1052
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:08,199
leaving the hemp alone okay I in

1053
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:14,440
col

1054
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:16,639
okay do you know if it's mainly on uh on

1055
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,920
young growth yeah he was growing for CBD

1056
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:21,400
but he didn't say at what point they

1057
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,880
were okay yeah I'm growing for CBD in

1058
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,639
Oregon and we've had no problem with

1059
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,400
here at all and we have multiple like

1060
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,759
four different Farms going right now

1061
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,318
different areas so we've been very

1062
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,920
fortunate none of them PR down okay did

1063
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:33,159
everybody hear that so he said in Oregon

1064
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,720
they they haven't had any problems at

1065
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:37,440
all with the air so okay let me

1066
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:40,000
introduce the next speaker um you know

1067
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,079
anytime you have more and more acreage

1068
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,760
of any kind of a crop species and and

1069
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:46,559
right now we don't have that a lot of

1070
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,920
acreage but it's it's growing um but

1071
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:50,280
whenever you have that um it's it's

1072
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,159
going to be susceptible the various

1073
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:55,640
disease and insect problems um so Dr

1074
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:57,679
Gary burstrom He's the um the chair of

1075
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:59,799
the department or of the section of

1076
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:01,159
Plant Pathology and plant microbiology

1077
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,800
within the school of integrated plant

1078
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:05,879
science uh and he does a lot of research

1079
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:08,359
and extension activities on diseases of

1080
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:11,079
field crops and um Elson Shields our

1081
00:43:08,358 --> 00:43:13,440
entomologist was going to be here uh but

1082
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:15,720
he's um some things came up and he's not

1083
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,599
able to be here today but he did tell me

1084
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:20,318
about a few insect problems but Gary if

1085
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,200
you've seen any insects in your okay

1086
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:26,159
I'll let you talk about diseases first

1087
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:29,439
thanks Don so uh I I uh will confess

1088
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:31,358
that I'm I'm a student of a uh of hemp

1089
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,639
diseases at this point and trying to

1090
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:37,000
learn everything I can along I suspect

1091
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:39,039
with a lot of you here so uh as as Don

1092
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,400
said I've worked in uh in field crops

1093
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:45,079
for a number of years and uh we uh are

1094
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,280
are looking forward to getting a better

1095
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:51,559
handle and inventory on what some of the

1096
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:54,119
pest problems are on Industrial Hemp and

1097
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:55,800
I've also spent some time talking to

1098
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:57,760
some colleagues in some other parts of

1099
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,599
the country and some of these recent

1100
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,319
visitors from Canada about some of the

1101
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:04,440
things they've encountered but uh by and

1102
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:07,318
large we're going to use these variety

1103
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:09,920
plots uh in itha Geneva and other places

1104
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:12,838
and these distributed Farms across New

1105
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:16,440
York state to try to inventory all of

1106
00:44:12,838 --> 00:44:19,239
the uh pest issues that uh that we find

1107
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:21,240
and typical for a new crop like this uh

1108
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:23,959
a lot of these pathogens tend to be

1109
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:27,118
rather specific in the in the crop

1110
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:29,318
species that they attack so we could

1111
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:31,920
reasonably expect as we expand the

1112
00:44:29,318 --> 00:44:34,000
acreage and intensity of the crop we may

1113
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,519
not see a lot of these pest problems now

1114
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,079
but we uh we can anticipate that they

1115
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:42,000
would increase the more that we grow the

1116
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:43,760
crop uh intensively on a particular Farm

1117
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,400
or or more

1118
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,480
extensively um so I think most of you

1119
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,480
aware there are no pesticides of any

1120
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,760
class uh used on the crop at this point

1121
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,318
and that includes fungicides and that

1122
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,680
also includes uh seed uh treatment

1123
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:00,838
fungicides uh Dr alen Taylor is going to

1124
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:03,598
talk a little bit later uh on the

1125
00:45:00,838 --> 00:45:05,838
program about the some seed treatment

1126
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:08,720
technology uh one of the things we would

1127
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:12,119
be concerned about is what protection we

1128
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:15,480
need to get these seed seed seedlings

1129
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:16,920
out of the ground and uh we one thing we

1130
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,679
have noticed in a number of the

1131
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:21,720
locations at at at fairly low incidents

1132
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:24,480
not really causing an economic problem

1133
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:27,000
but we could see even in this fairly dry

1134
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,599
season uh we have seen a number of the

1135
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:34,000
water mold uh pathogens attacking the

1136
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:36,318
the uh seed and seedlings uh that under

1137
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,280
less favorable conditions for sewing the

1138
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:41,519
crop we could anticipate more problem

1139
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,280
and uh in the vast majority of field

1140
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:46,440
crops and vegetables we uh except for

1141
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:51,000
Strictly Organic production there's

1142
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:54,159
often a uh a seed applied fungicide or

1143
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,079
water mold active uh material so that's

1144
00:45:54,159 --> 00:46:00,118
something that we would be looking at in

1145
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:03,359
the future as a a possible uh means of

1146
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:06,838
controlling some of these problems um

1147
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:09,799
we've also seen a fairly small incidence

1148
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:13,078
of some uh of some wilting and and Crown

1149
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:15,280
and root symptoms at at low incidents

1150
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:17,280
and I could uh share a whole long list

1151
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,680
of Latin names with you of the kind of

1152
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,519
organisms that we're finding there but

1153
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:24,000
this this point we're just taking an

1154
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:25,480
inventory and uh some of this goes back

1155
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,800
to what Chris was talking about the

1156
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,679
microbiome there are a lot of fungi and

1157
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:32,720
bacteria and other things that are just

1158
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:34,719
normally present and uh just Define some

1159
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:36,399
of these things doesn't necessarily mean

1160
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:39,318
that they're they're causing some kind

1161
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,358
of a plague on Industrial Hemp so part

1162
00:46:39,318 --> 00:46:43,800
of the research going forward will be

1163
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:45,920
taking some of these organisms uh trying

1164
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:49,318
to inoculate them onto healthy plants

1165
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,680
and seeing if they do uh cause disease

1166
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:53,920
and uh down the road uh I mean I'm very

1167
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:55,960
excited about this uh breeding program

1168
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,800
that'll be going on we'll look at some

1169
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,400
of the principles uh plant pathogens

1170
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,880
that we find associated with the crop

1171
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,599
and may be doing uh or someone in the

1172
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,880
future will be doing some purposeful

1173
00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:10,119
screening of some of these varieties

1174
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:12,680
with some of these uh potential pathogen

1175
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:16,079
problems um it's been mentioned a couple

1176
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:18,558
of times about cropping rotations and as

1177
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:22,160
a plant pathologist that's that's a A

1178
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:25,280
Center focus for me is not only can the

1179
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:27,399
organism survive in the soil or

1180
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,680
potentially come in with the seed

1181
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:33,599
but in many cases some of these

1182
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:35,399
organisms uh will survive on the debris

1183
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,480
that's left behind in the field and that

1184
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,960
be the bridge from run growing season to

1185
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,880
another and coming back what I said

1186
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:45,199
about the specificity of many of these

1187
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:47,640
crop diseases uh so for instance if we

1188
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:49,919
were planting this crop after a grain

1189
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:52,759
crop like corn or something like that or

1190
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:55,200
a small grain there'd be very very few

1191
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:57,400
organisms what would interact and cause

1192
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:59,639
problems on those two crops uh the

1193
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:02,079
closer they are related so we could

1194
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:05,239
expect some dcot plants to be a little

1195
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,920
more closely related uh to the uh hemp

1196
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:09,000
than than some of our monocot so we're

1197
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,720
going to be looking over time to see if

1198
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,599
there's any carryover of some of these

1199
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:15,598
pests one that does concern me long term

1200
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:18,280
and has been a problem in Canada and

1201
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:21,480
some other places is white mold uh it's

1202
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:24,040
a fungal problem that is already quite

1203
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:26,318
uh rampant in our legum crops and some

1204
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:29,239
of our other broadleaf vegetable crops

1205
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:32,000
so in soybean production probably our

1206
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:35,519
biggest disease problem right now is uh

1207
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:38,920
is sclerotinia white mold and that's a

1208
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:41,480
very broad Host range fungus and it

1209
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,720
survives the survival structures of the

1210
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:47,119
fungus called scler roia they will

1211
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:50,759
survive in the soil for a number of

1212
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:52,559
years and uh so certainly white mold is

1213
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,839
something we'll be looking at in the

1214
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:58,000
hemp and particularly in rotations that

1215
00:48:54,838 --> 00:49:00,400
would include vegetable beans dry beans

1216
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,119
uh soybean things highly susceptible

1217
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,079
crops to to white mold so uh rotations

1218
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:08,640
are very important in this sense as well

1219
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:11,680
um so I don't want to talk at you a lot

1220
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:13,798
here I want to make you aware that uh

1221
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:16,639
that we're very interested in learning

1222
00:49:13,798 --> 00:49:19,079
more uh first about what the diseases

1223
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:21,159
and potential disease problems might be

1224
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:24,119
and obviously the long-term interest is

1225
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:26,838
how to manage those uh I will mention uh

1226
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:29,440
two people from my program Kevin Meyers

1227
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:32,639
in the back year and Jamie Cummings will

1228
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:36,200
be working in our lab to do a lot of the

1229
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:38,598
diagnosis and uh of potential disease

1230
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:41,679
problems and and work with this uh with

1231
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:44,280
this new crop so um we would be

1232
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:47,519
appreciative of anybody seeing anything

1233
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:49,720
in their fields um and and letting us

1234
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:51,358
know uh we'd be glad to diagnose

1235
00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:53,798
problems in our laboratory get out in

1236
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:56,000
your fields and look so please please

1237
00:49:53,798 --> 00:49:59,719
keep us informed and let us know how how

1238
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,798
we can be a help to you so um another

1239
00:49:59,719 --> 00:50:04,959
thing just to quickly say that one of

1240
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:08,159
the main advantages against diseases is

1241
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,679
just the vigorous rapid growth of this

1242
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:11,199
crop and that's one of the things I've

1243
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:13,519
I've learned from talking to colleagues

1244
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:15,679
in other places yeah we see some Leaf

1245
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:19,079
spots yeah we see some of this and that

1246
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:21,519
uh but the crop basically outgrows them

1247
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:24,240
and and that is an advantage with this

1248
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:27,119
crop uh and that it's timely planted in

1249
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:29,439
appropriate soils um another thing we're

1250
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:32,720
not weed scientists in our in our

1251
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,679
program but uh Kevin has been taking

1252
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:36,959
some notes in the various plots about

1253
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:39,879
weed density and you know a great

1254
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:43,280
take-home message here is he said a a

1255
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:46,079
tremendous correlation between the weed

1256
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:49,200
uh density in these plots and what the

1257
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:51,440
original Stand was from the emergence

1258
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:53,078
success in emergence of those plots so

1259
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,798
the best defense against weeds

1260
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:57,559
especially in the absence of any

1261
00:50:54,798 --> 00:50:59,599
herbicides to use is just to have a good

1262
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:02,798
crop establishment have a good initial

1263
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:06,000
stand and very often uh that this will

1264
00:51:02,798 --> 00:51:07,880
be sufficient to out compete the weed so

1265
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,480
a pretty good strategy if you can do

1266
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:12,000
that any any questions or comments some

1267
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:15,079
observations others have made yeah

1268
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,159
please what is the closest uh normal

1269
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:20,318
plant in New York that family

1270
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:22,679
relationship to hemp and if you I I

1271
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:24,920
would say hops hops would be the closest

1272
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:27,078
can you then say that whatever attacks

1273
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:29,838
hops diseases or pests

1274
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:34,280
similarly probably gonna attack me o

1275
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:36,679
only as a very general uh uh statement

1276
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:40,119
uh e even within a a plant family

1277
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:41,679
there's tremendous specificity in uh in

1278
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:43,960
these pathogens there are some things

1279
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:45,399
that would be candidates that way a lot

1280
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:49,000
of the things that attack through the

1281
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:51,039
soil the water molds the Feria rise

1282
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,280
octonia some of these things tend to

1283
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:56,679
have a fairly wide Host range a lot of

1284
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:59,400
the leaf spotting type organisms are

1285
00:51:56,679 --> 00:52:01,078
really rather specific um and I think

1286
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,798
things like the Downey Milo's Chris

1287
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:05,359
would be pretty separate from the Hops

1288
00:52:02,798 --> 00:52:08,960
and the and the uh the hemp in this case

1289
00:52:05,358 --> 00:52:11,920
so uh the more this the more pathogen is

1290
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:14,798
specialized uh the the you know the less

1291
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,119
we worry about that uh for related crops

1292
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:17,639
but definitely that's something we'd be

1293
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:21,039
looking at and there are some candidate

1294
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:23,400
things we'd be looking at uh but I still

1295
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:26,318
come back to to white mold being the

1296
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,480
biggest concern that way because it's uh

1297
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:31,639
very very broad Host range the weeds as

1298
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:34,639
well as cultivated

1299
00:52:31,639 --> 00:52:37,318
crops anybody observe anything in your

1300
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:39,679
uh on your farms at this point

1301
00:52:37,318 --> 00:52:42,199
uh okay we'll keep us in mind if we can

1302
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:45,078
help yeah David jry in in regard to some

1303
00:52:42,199 --> 00:52:48,078
of the pest uh Farm viability is funding

1304
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:50,280
um Jen Gilbert Jenkins at Morrisville

1305
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,440
with some plots this summer specifically

1306
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,119
to look at insect pests I don't know

1307
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:56,880
that she's doing much with diseases but

1308
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:58,358
certainly with insects and she might

1309
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,680
have some good information to share

1310
00:52:58,358 --> 00:53:02,838
Chris Becker has been interacting with

1311
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:04,838
her and we have had a few things arrive

1312
00:53:02,838 --> 00:53:06,880
at either Chris's lab or mine in

1313
00:53:04,838 --> 00:53:09,759
connection with that but yeah we would

1314
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:11,760
absolutely love to plug in with that and

1315
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,559
get all the learning we can out of out

1316
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:16,200
out of these plots that are established

1317
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:18,519
yeah and we've also provided funding for

1318
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:22,000
her she's planning to do a Statewide uh

1319
00:53:18,519 --> 00:53:23,798
trial next summer uh on fertilization in

1320
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,079
him okay and on 10 different farms

1321
00:53:23,798 --> 00:53:27,719
around the state so we provided some

1322
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:29,920
funding for her to to buy the Seed

1323
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:32,798
already for that so that's good to know

1324
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:35,599
thank you thank you um Don would you

1325
00:53:32,798 --> 00:53:39,400
like to say a few things about uh What

1326
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:40,880
uh insects that uh yeah so again Elson

1327
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:43,358
Shields has been working on this he's in

1328
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,920
our anology department but unfortunately

1329
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:47,838
he was not able to make it here after

1330
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:50,280
all uh but he did send me uh a list of a

1331
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:53,039
few insects that he's observed in the uh

1332
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:55,599
the hemp uh around the state so far uh

1333
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:58,960
one of them is a lius bug it's maybe a

1334
00:53:55,599 --> 00:54:02,280
quarter inch uh big bug there that um

1335
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:04,079
eats the growing tips of the of the U of

1336
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,680
the plant but also the reproductive

1337
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,318
parts the floral parts of the plant

1338
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:09,118
which obviously could be very critical

1339
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:11,000
on the grain types or the Dual Purpose

1340
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:13,160
types there so that's one of the things

1341
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,318
that he's keeping a watch on another

1342
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:18,159
insect um which is actually prevalent on

1343
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:19,599
a lot of species is potato Leaf Hopper

1344
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:21,598
and we have problems with that on our

1345
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:24,160
Alfalfa uh if we don't spray an

1346
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:26,160
insecticide or use a resistant variety

1347
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:28,679
uh but apparently he's been seeing it on

1348
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:30,440
on Industrial Hemp as well a third one

1349
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:33,399
that he mentioned is thrips that's a

1350
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:35,920
very very small insect uh but that could

1351
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:38,838
get into the floral Parts uh they eat

1352
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,440
pollen and so forth um and some of the

1353
00:54:38,838 --> 00:54:42,239
things Elson didn't mention it but some

1354
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,280
of the things that I've read is that uh

1355
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:46,798
people are suspecting that some of the

1356
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:49,880
major insect problems on corn could

1357
00:54:46,798 --> 00:54:51,440
actually be a problem on hemp too uh I

1358
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,920
don't know the validity of that or

1359
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,559
whether people are speculating at this

1360
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:57,480
point but things like corn army worm and

1361
00:54:54,559 --> 00:55:00,160
some others there so so it is critical

1362
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:02,240
that entomologists be looking just like

1363
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:04,000
Gary does with the diseases there that

1364
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:06,199
we have entomologists looking at insect

1365
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,920
problems um so that we know what uh

1366
00:55:06,199 --> 00:55:11,039
challenges that we have in front of us

1367
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:12,440
so um so if you have questions about

1368
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:14,039
insects I probably can't answer them but

1369
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:16,720
you can ask I would think that the

1370
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:18,558
insect pressure would build over time

1371
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:21,118
once there's more crop available oh

1372
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:23,680
absolutely same for diseases and insects

1373
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:25,720
um you know as as the acreage increases

1374
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:27,239
across the state um certainly there's

1375
00:55:25,719 --> 00:55:29,000
potential for more problems will be

1376
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:31,798
there as well good

1377
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:35,039
point other questions or

1378
00:55:31,798 --> 00:55:38,519
comment okay so um I'm going to turn

1379
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:41,079
this over then to uh Dr Alan Taylor um

1380
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:42,358
one of the problems that we've already

1381
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:44,440
been confronted with there's one of

1382
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:46,798
these varieties in here which I think is

1383
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:49,880
this short one is it Jamie that had low

1384
00:55:46,798 --> 00:55:51,599
germination uh one of these was anyway

1385
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,838
was it down there okay but one of the

1386
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:55,680
varieties um was from seed that was a

1387
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:58,318
year older than the rest of them and the

1388
00:55:55,679 --> 00:56:00,118
germination rate was really low and uh

1389
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:01,639
even though Jamie compensated with that

1390
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:03,559
to have the same number of pure live

1391
00:56:01,639 --> 00:56:04,920
seeds per square foot so that we're

1392
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:08,039
comparing apples and apples and not

1393
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:10,599
apples and oranges um still the um the

1394
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:12,880
stand density was not as great as some

1395
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:15,119
of the other varieties so the seed's

1396
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:17,480
important as Gary said we need to get a

1397
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:19,440
a good stand establishment so we're very

1398
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:21,240
pleased that Dr Alan Taylor from the

1399
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,599
horiculture section in the school of

1400
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:26,598
integrated plant science is working on

1401
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:27,640
the the seed aspects of this thanks for

1402
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:29,798
the the

1403
00:56:27,639 --> 00:56:32,318
introduction as Chris mentioned there's

1404
00:56:29,798 --> 00:56:35,000
a number of states that have really have

1405
00:56:32,318 --> 00:56:37,639
doing research on hemp and a colleague

1406
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,039
of mine from North Dakota State as an

1407
00:56:37,639 --> 00:56:43,000
agronomist was given a talk last year

1408
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:45,599
and really talking about seed quality

1409
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,960
issues St establishment issues a lot of

1410
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:49,720
these seed related things and my program

1411
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:52,079
here at Cornell at the Geneva a

1412
00:56:49,719 --> 00:56:54,078
experiment station we interact with a

1413
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:56,240
lot of different crops vegetable crops

1414
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:58,280
but also industrial crops so I thought

1415
00:56:56,239 --> 00:56:59,078
at the time I said this would be really

1416
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:02,640
a

1417
00:56:59,079 --> 00:57:04,720
good uh project for my laboratory to get

1418
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:07,199
involved in and then here less than a

1419
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:09,078
year later here we are whereas Chris

1420
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:12,919
says we have this Cornell hemp team it's

1421
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:14,839
really a Consortium of Faculty uh with a

1422
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:16,920
wide range of expertise all kind of

1423
00:57:14,838 --> 00:57:19,000
focus on this so I think we're going to

1424
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:21,159
be able to make quite a bit of uh

1425
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,719
progress and a relatively short amount

1426
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:26,798
of time as we're we're working on this

1427
00:57:23,719 --> 00:57:29,358
also as Chris mentioned really good

1428
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:31,960
partnership with aged markets and things

1429
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:34,400
like that and being able to uh kind of

1430
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:36,280
work at the regulatory level with this

1431
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,079
and getting it out as well as the

1432
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:40,400
research and the Outreach that we're

1433
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:42,640
really so good at here at

1434
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,798
Cornell we obviously see as we're

1435
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:46,199
looking at here that that with seed

1436
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:48,639
obviously the plant breeding and

1437
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:50,719
genetics has a key role in what the

1438
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:53,159
plant growth and development is but

1439
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:55,798
another key aspect of seed is is the

1440
00:57:53,159 --> 00:57:58,440
seed quality and really the quality is

1441
00:57:55,798 --> 00:58:01,038
sure as you're buying seed if you're

1442
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:02,760
spending that at least $50 an acre to

1443
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:05,520
establish it's a major input into

1444
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:08,760
growing a a really a field crop like as

1445
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:10,759
an agronomic crop as hemp would be so

1446
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:13,400
you want to make sure that you're really

1447
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:17,440
first of all getting the good quality

1448
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:20,480
seed um as right now for these trials we

1449
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:22,280
have all the the uh the grain types or

1450
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,480
the multi-purpose types here and there's

1451
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:27,559
also other trials with the fiber types

1452
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:30,318
we have 17 seed lots that we're working

1453
00:58:27,559 --> 00:58:33,000
on uh about half of those are from

1454
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:35,358
Canada the the rest are from Europe from

1455
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,119
Eastern Europe poon Ukraine over to

1456
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:39,480
Italy France are the production the

1457
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:41,519
origin of those seeds so we're looking

1458
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:44,318
at a pretty good kind of cross-section

1459
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:46,239
of commercial seed all those seeds have

1460
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:48,798
to be imported here into the United

1461
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:50,959
States so there are aspects that really

1462
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:53,559
need to be addressed as far as the

1463
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:56,318
quality for that sort of uh Commerce

1464
00:58:53,559 --> 00:58:58,160
coming into this country

1465
00:58:56,318 --> 00:59:00,159
there's really two aspects of seed

1466
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:02,920
quality we always think well the seeds

1467
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:05,199
got to germinate to grow definitely the

1468
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:07,159
case but another aspect especially those

1469
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:10,199
that are not involved with agronomic

1470
00:59:07,159 --> 00:59:12,639
crops or or different seeded crops is

1471
00:59:10,199 --> 00:59:14,358
what we call the seed Purity what the

1472
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:16,440
Purity is is if you're buying a bag of

1473
00:59:14,358 --> 00:59:20,159
seed and that could be a bag of wheat

1474
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:22,318
could be a bag of hemp seeds is what

1475
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:24,440
else is in that bag you want for example

1476
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:26,440
down there you want the hemp the anchor

1477
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:29,838
variety but what else could be in that

1478
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:33,079
bag there could be weed seeds present

1479
00:59:29,838 --> 00:59:34,798
there could be other crop seeds present

1480
00:59:33,079 --> 00:59:37,400
and also what we just generically call

1481
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:40,519
this inner material just other materials

1482
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:43,318
be broken seeds trash materials Stones

1483
00:59:40,519 --> 00:59:45,480
things like that so in these 17 seed

1484
00:59:43,318 --> 00:59:47,759
lots that we're working with now uh

1485
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:49,760
Michael loose who's Works in my program

1486
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,079
he was the former manager of the of our

1487
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,559
New York State seed testing laboratory

1488
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:56,640
and that seed testing laboratory is now

1489
00:59:53,559 --> 00:59:59,079
moved to Albany but with Michael's

1490
00:59:56,639 --> 01:00:00,960
actually running the uh the germinations

1491
00:59:59,079 --> 01:00:02,640
and the purities on those we're seeing

1492
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,318
some of these seed lots and again I

1493
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:06,879
don't have enough data right now we're

1494
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:09,358
still doing this to have as a handout

1495
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,680
but some of these over 5% iner material

1496
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:13,318
so basically we say it's pretty trashy

1497
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:15,118
seed that we're getting again if

1498
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:16,400
somebody's buying this you want to make

1499
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:20,000
sure that you're getting good quality

1500
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:21,639
seed but probably the the the two keys

1501
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,559
that we're really concerned about in

1502
01:00:21,639 --> 01:00:27,480
this Purity are weed seeds for us to

1503
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:29,000
import seeds to receive the seeds uh

1504
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:30,760
there has to be an aphis permit

1505
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,159
conducted where that what we call a

1506
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:36,160
noxious weed exam noxious weeds are

1507
01:00:33,159 --> 01:00:38,199
seeds which are really defined by law

1508
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:39,558
that are harmful to agriculture so you

1509
01:00:38,199 --> 01:00:41,719
don't want to have those in the bag

1510
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:44,359
because you're also planting those and

1511
01:00:41,719 --> 01:00:46,480
also just other common weed seeds things

1512
01:00:44,358 --> 01:00:48,119
like that that may also be present so so

1513
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,838
we're going through these samples right

1514
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:52,880
now in and just kind of testing trying

1515
01:00:50,838 --> 01:00:54,318
to get as much information on the

1516
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,440
quality

1517
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:58,480
aspect for example

1518
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,079
with the the Canadian seed lots that

1519
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,960
we've gotten is they're close Partners

1520
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:04,920
to us they have their seed certification

1521
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:08,798
system just like Phil has a seed

1522
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:10,960
certification program here the basis of

1523
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:12,759
the two programs are the same as we look

1524
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,798
at seed certification they have

1525
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,079
different levels they have a

1526
01:01:13,798 --> 01:01:19,119
certification number one level and

1527
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:22,359
number two so how do those differ they

1528
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:25,640
really differ based on the quality the

1529
01:01:22,358 --> 01:01:28,759
level one is the high quality seed is so

1530
01:01:25,639 --> 01:01:32,358
the germination uh needs to be 85% or

1531
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:34,720
higher and just two uh weed seeds can be

1532
01:01:32,358 --> 01:01:37,119
present in just one other crop seed in a

1533
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:39,759
25 gram sample where are these other

1534
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:42,280
crop seeds coming from you ask we do we

1535
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,799
do not have a herbicide that can be used

1536
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:48,599
in the seed production field so if there

1537
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:50,440
was oats and we've seen oats as as

1538
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:52,760
contaminants as other crop seeds

1539
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:54,880
sunflower a lot of those seeds are also

1540
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:57,400
coming over in your seeds so again we

1541
01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:00,000
want that to be as clean as

1542
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:02,559
possible just as we've uh again let's

1543
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,559
use that

1544
01:02:02,599 --> 01:02:10,720
criteria with the 85% germination and

1545
01:02:06,159 --> 01:02:13,159
the 70% germination of the 17 seed lots

1546
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:14,959
that is being tested within the Cornell

1547
01:02:13,159 --> 01:02:19,239
system this

1548
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:22,039
year only five of those had 85%

1549
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:23,919
germination and higher so again we

1550
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:25,359
really need to have high quality seeds

1551
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,119
for that good initial stand

1552
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:29,000
establishment

1553
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:32,318
nine of those which is about half had

1554
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,960
over 70% so so again what you know when

1555
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:35,838
this eventually up to be a commercial

1556
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,838
crop what you're getting is very

1557
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:40,239
important because that really starts the

1558
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:42,278
basis for that so that's kind of where

1559
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:44,598
we're at right now is in this I'll say

1560
01:02:42,278 --> 01:02:46,960
characterization the quality assurance

1561
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:50,160
aspect to make sure that the farmer

1562
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:52,880
ultimately has high quality

1563
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:56,239
seed the next part is it's already been

1564
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:58,760
mentioned there are issues early

1565
01:02:56,239 --> 01:03:01,558
germination events early seedling

1566
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:04,119
emergent stand establishment issues with

1567
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:05,760
the hemp crop and again I learned from

1568
01:03:04,119 --> 01:03:07,480
this from my colleagues in out of state

1569
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,960
so this is not a New York problem it's

1570
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:11,760
not unique to us they have the problems

1571
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:15,278
in Canada they have it

1572
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:17,960
throughout the seeds in themselves I'll

1573
01:03:15,278 --> 01:03:21,559
just say are just have generally a low

1574
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:23,519
Vigor they tend to be weak germinators

1575
01:03:21,559 --> 01:03:26,798
once they get going you can see they

1576
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:29,038
they grow like heck but that early phase

1577
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:31,358
which is a very very sensitive phase and

1578
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:33,480
we need to get the plan establishment

1579
01:03:31,358 --> 01:03:35,838
again for that crop to canopy which is

1580
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:38,599
providing the weed management as well so

1581
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:41,639
so everything really rotates and getting

1582
01:03:38,599 --> 01:03:45,760
off to a good start with the hemp

1583
01:03:41,639 --> 01:03:48,920
seed now since we're not able to use uh

1584
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:52,839
labeled of chemical pesticides including

1585
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:54,960
chemical seed treatments then my

1586
01:03:52,838 --> 01:03:57,239
laboratory is interested from the

1587
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,720
research point view of looking at some

1588
01:03:57,239 --> 01:04:01,038
development of some technology so

1589
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:04,759
that'll be kind of where we're going

1590
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:07,680
with our research two areas one is Gary

1591
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:09,480
mentioned uh a lot of the the damping

1592
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:12,639
off organisms which are going to be

1593
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:15,240
ubiquitous in our soils here pums things

1594
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:17,199
like that what sort of a of of a seed

1595
01:04:15,239 --> 01:04:21,118
treatment could we use not a chemical

1596
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:23,759
seed treatment like a captan or tham or

1597
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:26,240
or an apron but what else could we use

1598
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,599
that we could still apply and so we're

1599
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:30,639
kind of going to our toolbox where I

1600
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:32,440
work with organic vegetable seed

1601
01:04:30,639 --> 01:04:34,719
Productions and not seed production but

1602
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:37,639
seed quality as well and so what can we

1603
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:39,000
take from that area as an organic seed

1604
01:04:37,639 --> 01:04:41,400
treatment so that's an area that we're

1605
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,239
going to be moving into that so we can

1606
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:48,720
get some protection uh from some of

1607
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:51,959
these early uh attacking early soil born

1608
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:56,199
pathogens the second aspect is again

1609
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:58,679
they are inherently low Vigor seeds

1610
01:04:56,199 --> 01:05:01,118
and again we've don't know enough yet to

1611
01:04:58,679 --> 01:05:03,239
really to be able to really Define the

1612
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:05,960
Vigor except doing a germination test

1613
01:05:03,239 --> 01:05:07,759
but we're we're relying on on people

1614
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:11,358
that have worked in this crop for a long

1615
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:13,000
time so in that regards uh again kind of

1616
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:14,759
some other work that we're doing is what

1617
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,679
we're calling bio stimulants bios

1618
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:18,920
stimulants are compounds these are not

1619
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:21,239
pesticides that are applied to plants to

1620
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:22,760
enhance plant growth and development so

1621
01:05:21,239 --> 01:05:24,318
we've already done work with seed

1622
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:26,520
treatments with some of these

1623
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:29,599
biostimulant type of materials natural

1624
01:05:26,519 --> 01:05:32,199
type of materials no pesticidal effect

1625
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:34,640
on them at all what would they do to a

1626
01:05:32,199 --> 01:05:37,960
hemp seed so again you know we have a

1627
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:40,239
lot to do ahead of us so we'll be ready

1628
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:42,199
for next growing season to actually to

1629
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:43,838
test some of these things but that kind

1630
01:05:42,199 --> 01:05:46,038
of gives you in kind of a a quick

1631
01:05:43,838 --> 01:05:48,440
summary where the seed science and

1632
01:05:46,039 --> 01:05:50,760
technology program is at the Geneva egg

1633
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:53,318
experiment station with Cornell uh

1634
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:56,160
focusing right now in the seed testing

1635
01:05:53,318 --> 01:05:57,838
aspect seed quality just to make sure we

1636
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:00,318
we can characterize the seed lots that

1637
01:05:57,838 --> 01:06:02,639
we're working with but then the the

1638
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:04,440
future research and development really

1639
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:06,278
kind of rolling up our sleeves and

1640
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:08,519
developing some very practical seed

1641
01:06:06,278 --> 01:06:10,760
treatments that could be used on hemp

1642
01:06:08,519 --> 01:06:13,719
seeds to enhance plant establishment and

1643
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:18,440
early season growth thank

1644
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:21,719
[Applause]

1645
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:25,798
you any questions along the seed

1646
01:06:21,719 --> 01:06:28,439
line yes I'm surprised by the substan

1647
01:06:25,798 --> 01:06:31,798
reduction in germination from that 2017

1648
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:34,278
to 2016 Lots was my understanding was

1649
01:06:31,798 --> 01:06:35,920
that 2016 lot was the one that needed to

1650
01:06:34,278 --> 01:06:38,318
have the seating rate adjusted and I'm

1651
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:40,559
wondering if that's somewhat more unique

1652
01:06:38,318 --> 01:06:43,119
to hemp maybe because of the high oil

1653
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:44,760
content um because most other crops I'm

1654
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:46,880
familiar with wouldn't show such a

1655
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:49,039
dramatic difference between was just one

1656
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:51,838
year as long as that seed was handled

1657
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:53,920
reasonably well a really good question

1658
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:56,038
and we're looking at the issues of seed

1659
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:58,798
quality but also in the case

1660
01:06:56,039 --> 01:07:02,400
uh if we have carryover seeds uh things

1661
01:06:58,798 --> 01:07:05,318
like that uh there are uh kind of as we

1662
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:07,960
look kind of cross the board of seeds

1663
01:07:05,318 --> 01:07:09,880
some seeds are just naturally shortlived

1664
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:12,400
seed like a soybean happens to be a

1665
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:14,079
shortlived seed other crops just tend to

1666
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,480
be like a tomato seed is a very long

1667
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:19,240
live so there's just sort of like my

1668
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:21,400
lifespan compared to you know the my pet

1669
01:07:19,239 --> 01:07:23,159
dog the dog has a shorter natural

1670
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:25,880
lifespan than I do so you have some of

1671
01:07:23,159 --> 01:07:28,598
that so so the hemp kind of fits into

1672
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:30,680
that as far as just the genetic basis it

1673
01:07:28,599 --> 01:07:32,960
is a high oil content seeds but some

1674
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:34,919
seeds so there's not a strict rule of

1675
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,480
thumb on on oil content for example the

1676
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:39,039
tomato seeds which is a very long live

1677
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,559
seed is a very high oil or lipid content

1678
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:43,799
seed so there's a lot of things we

1679
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:46,278
really don't know but but from again

1680
01:07:43,798 --> 01:07:49,000
kind of what we have seen is that the

1681
01:07:46,278 --> 01:07:52,599
storage especially in a carryover

1682
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,679
situation can be an issue and so for

1683
01:07:52,599 --> 01:07:56,720
example the these companies that uh

1684
01:07:54,679 --> 01:07:58,759
we've talked about up in Canada the

1685
01:07:56,719 --> 01:08:00,078
seeds that they're producing last year

1686
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:01,839
the seeds that were using so they they

1687
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:02,839
are produced harvested they have to be

1688
01:08:01,838 --> 01:08:05,759
carried

1689
01:08:02,838 --> 01:08:07,960
over of these three seed lots of Anka

1690
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:10,079
that we got all the same variety three

1691
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:12,720
different seed Lots from this is from

1692
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:15,798
their germination conducted up in Canada

1693
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:17,559
from two are in the upper 80s one is in

1694
01:08:15,798 --> 01:08:20,798
the 70 and I

1695
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:22,798
said why you know in in a nice sort of a

1696
01:08:20,798 --> 01:08:24,880
way why did that happen are these

1697
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:26,759
carryover seeds and they said no they're

1698
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:28,000
all har Ed one was harvested a little

1699
01:08:26,759 --> 01:08:29,960
later and may have had a little bit

1700
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
higher moisture content that went into

1701
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:34,279
that over winter storage that higher

1702
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,198
moisture the seeds are just going to age

1703
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:39,279
faster so so there is just so you can't

1704
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:40,798
even say variet how things are going to

1705
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:42,799
respond you really have to look at the

1706
01:08:40,798 --> 01:08:45,399
seed lot level but even like I said in

1707
01:08:42,798 --> 01:08:48,719
the example where we have lots and lots

1708
01:08:45,399 --> 01:08:51,119
of that seeds for the commercial uh uh

1709
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:53,239
use this year there are differences

1710
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:55,079
between those three seed lots and again

1711
01:08:53,238 --> 01:08:56,919
they are attributing it just to that

1712
01:08:55,079 --> 01:08:59,000
it's high higher moisture content we can

1713
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:00,838
check that moisture content we have you

1714
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,399
know we can we can look at that but

1715
01:09:00,838 --> 01:09:05,640
after the Aging has happened and Seed

1716
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:07,399
there's nothing we we we can't go retro

1717
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:10,000
on this but but at least we can

1718
01:09:07,399 --> 01:09:12,479
characterize that is knowing what the uh

1719
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,679
the moisture should be and safe storage

1720
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:17,079
very good question thank you yes sir

1721
01:09:14,679 --> 01:09:19,119
that moisture content is that dictated

1722
01:09:17,079 --> 01:09:21,880
by when you

1723
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:23,759
harvest early Harvest more moisture late

1724
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:25,880
Harvest less moisture as an example is

1725
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:27,719
that what is that possible so so what is

1726
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:31,159
going on during seed development and the

1727
01:09:27,719 --> 01:09:33,920
later phases of seed development is is

1728
01:09:31,158 --> 01:09:36,679
the seed on the mother plant is drying

1729
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:39,119
down what they would like to do is

1730
01:09:36,679 --> 01:09:41,079
ideally Harvest at the right moisture

1731
01:09:39,119 --> 01:09:43,920
content and then that could go right

1732
01:09:41,079 --> 01:09:45,318
into storage however if it is immature

1733
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:48,880
seed it's going to have a higher

1734
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:50,960
moisture or if it's rained or so so so

1735
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:53,239
that seed moisture is just going up and

1736
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,920
down with whatever the environment is

1737
01:09:53,238 --> 01:09:55,959
going on so if it's a high relative

1738
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,359
humidity

1739
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,480
if there's wetness it's going to be

1740
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:01,238
picking up moisture from there so the

1741
01:09:59,479 --> 01:10:02,839
ideal thing is that you want to harvest

1742
01:10:01,238 --> 01:10:04,879
at the right moisture content and then

1743
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:06,360
go into the storage and things like that

1744
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,119
have you determined what that moisture

1745
01:10:06,359 --> 01:10:09,719
content is I I only have some things

1746
01:10:08,119 --> 01:10:11,119
that I've written but we've not actually

1747
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:13,158
characterized that so I don't I don't

1748
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:15,000
want to I don't want to speculate on on

1749
01:10:13,158 --> 01:10:17,039
that right now but thank you that's a

1750
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:20,158
that's a that's a good point because

1751
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:23,198
again is generally when when we're in

1752
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:26,559
more of the seed or the seed buyer right

1753
01:10:23,198 --> 01:10:28,799
now New York is not a seed producer we

1754
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,000
really are relying on what has happened

1755
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,600
Upstream with the seed companies what

1756
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,520
they've done with seed processing or

1757
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:38,360
what we call seed conditioning sorting

1758
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:40,000
the seeds doing things like that uh and

1759
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:42,238
as I and and I just want to head one

1760
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,880
other point on on seed size again as

1761
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:46,039
we're doing this Purity we look at the

1762
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:47,920
seeds we're also taking we have the

1763
01:10:46,039 --> 01:10:51,359
Thousand uh seed weight or thousand

1764
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:53,279
kernel weight they call it but you do

1765
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:55,479
see varietal differences some are just

1766
01:10:53,279 --> 01:10:57,479
larger seed than others but even with in

1767
01:10:55,479 --> 01:10:59,000
the sample we have there's a large

1768
01:10:57,479 --> 01:11:01,718
difference in seed size there's small

1769
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,920
seeds medium seeds large large seeds and

1770
01:11:01,719 --> 01:11:05,600
again we want uniformity of germination

1771
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,920
we want uniformity of stand

1772
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,880
establishment that does not set us on

1773
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:12,000
the right foot if we're already starting

1774
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:14,679
off with a wide range of seed Sciences

1775
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,238
within the same seed lot so again

1776
01:11:14,679 --> 01:11:18,679
something else uh uh something else we

1777
01:11:17,238 --> 01:11:22,519
need to kind of look at a little bit

1778
01:11:18,679 --> 01:11:25,319
there too uh any other yes sir so just

1779
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:27,560
with uh your other grain and and crops

1780
01:11:25,319 --> 01:11:30,439
you have seed seed Foundation here that

1781
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:33,080
checks for quality and and uh D inerts

1782
01:11:30,439 --> 01:11:34,799
and everything else to me it looks like

1783
01:11:33,079 --> 01:11:37,639
the hemp is kind of a

1784
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:40,320
rogue introduction to the to the seed

1785
01:11:37,639 --> 01:11:42,000
industry and I would suspect that

1786
01:11:40,319 --> 01:11:44,158
importing these seeds from other

1787
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,359
countries similar to grain you're going

1788
01:11:44,158 --> 01:11:49,479
to have those imperfections you're going

1789
01:11:46,359 --> 01:11:52,079
to have those variations so I'm assuming

1790
01:11:49,479 --> 01:11:53,839
uh aphis EG and markets uh seed

1791
01:11:52,079 --> 01:11:56,039
Foundation they're going to work at

1792
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:57,760
developing uh some some basic standards

1793
01:11:56,039 --> 01:12:01,399
for the seed or is this just going to be

1794
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:03,239
a open Forum on whatever whatever comes

1795
01:12:01,399 --> 01:12:05,638
in

1796
01:12:03,238 --> 01:12:07,638
well multiple points that you're making

1797
01:12:05,639 --> 01:12:09,279
and all really all really good with

1798
01:12:07,639 --> 01:12:12,000
because the the bottom line is we want

1799
01:12:09,279 --> 01:12:13,920
to assure a New York grower that's going

1800
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,800
to be planting the hemp that they have

1801
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:20,399
good quality seed uh I I think if we

1802
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:22,840
look at Canada Canada started this 1998

1803
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:24,638
so they've been doing they've been

1804
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:26,360
growing hemp for many years and these

1805
01:12:24,639 --> 01:12:29,199
seed compan I would say are pretty

1806
01:12:26,359 --> 01:12:31,158
mature they're not MPA type of companies

1807
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:32,879
that are just you know going out here

1808
01:12:31,158 --> 01:12:34,479
whacking some seeds off and threshing

1809
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:37,199
them out and selling them now these

1810
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:40,678
These are big operations and when we're

1811
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:42,479
buying you know a 750 kilogram totes of

1812
01:12:40,679 --> 01:12:44,600
those that are coming in that's a big

1813
01:12:42,479 --> 01:12:46,479
seed production facility that they have

1814
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:48,800
I've not seen it but it's they're

1815
01:12:46,479 --> 01:12:50,599
they're very mature in that they've also

1816
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:53,560
have their own seed certification

1817
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:55,719
standards for for example to make that

1818
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:57,639
number one certified has to have the

1819
01:12:55,719 --> 01:13:00,520
high germination of 85 or better but

1820
01:12:57,639 --> 01:13:02,800
just a few seeds now if it turns out say

1821
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:05,920
just one other crop seed and then two

1822
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:08,199
weed seeds if that sample they pull has

1823
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:10,840
four weed seeds in it even though the

1824
01:13:08,198 --> 01:13:12,879
germination is 90% it drops it down

1825
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:14,880
automatically to their certified level

1826
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:17,159
number two the grower doesn't really

1827
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:19,159
know that they they just know it's a

1828
01:13:17,158 --> 01:13:20,879
it's a level two certification it's a

1829
01:13:19,158 --> 01:13:22,839
lower grade they don't know why they

1830
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:25,960
have but but we can track that down and

1831
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:27,960
know so so I think in and their system

1832
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:30,000
they're using both the Purity as a

1833
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:32,079
criteria for high quality and the

1834
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,960
germination and it's really it's well

1835
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:35,198
it's it's a good system it's a little

1836
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:37,359
different than what we do here in the

1837
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:39,039
States but it is a good system so you

1838
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:42,198
know if you're getting that number one

1839
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:45,000
certified that you're getting very good

1840
01:13:42,198 --> 01:13:47,158
SE yes sir so the numbers you gave us

1841
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:52,560
earlier on the rates of germination

1842
01:13:47,158 --> 01:13:54,759
those were provided by the um vendor at

1843
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,239
their certified levels okay there

1844
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:57,960
there's two things so when I talked

1845
01:13:56,238 --> 01:14:00,039
about the Anka the three seed lots of

1846
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:02,239
Anka I don't even have the third seed

1847
01:14:00,039 --> 01:14:04,880
lot yet everything's pretty pretty new

1848
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:07,119
and then it's it's not only 50 mil from

1849
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:09,319
from itha to Geneva but it's just

1850
01:14:07,119 --> 01:14:11,000
cumbersome I'll just put it that way and

1851
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:13,279
moving seeds around even within the

1852
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,198
Coronel system so we have not done any

1853
01:14:13,279 --> 01:14:18,639
of the testing on these three ankle Lots

1854
01:14:16,198 --> 01:14:21,158
what I'm saying is we do have samples

1855
01:14:18,639 --> 01:14:23,520
from all of these types along with four

1856
01:14:21,158 --> 01:14:25,399
other fiber types that is where we did

1857
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,120
the actual germination and we're doing

1858
01:14:25,399 --> 01:14:29,198
the Purity right now we're we're that

1859
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:31,559
new into this when we have this field

1860
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:33,198
day two weeks from today in Geneva I'm

1861
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:35,239
going to be able to talk more than I can

1862
01:14:33,198 --> 01:14:37,079
now just because we're the you know

1863
01:14:35,238 --> 01:14:38,919
we're generating the data as we speak

1864
01:14:37,079 --> 01:14:40,279
you'll be able to compare that data to

1865
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:42,679
what they certifi that's that's

1866
01:14:40,279 --> 01:14:46,119
ultimately what I want to be able to do

1867
01:14:42,679 --> 01:14:49,399
yeah is is we're taking out of a little

1868
01:14:46,119 --> 01:14:51,119
baggie a sample compared to them going

1869
01:14:49,399 --> 01:14:53,559
through their large inventory so we want

1870
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:55,800
to make sure that what we're saying is

1871
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:58,039
representative not that anybody's right

1872
01:14:55,800 --> 01:15:02,279
or wrong it's just being really

1873
01:14:58,039 --> 01:15:04,319
representative yeah exactly good yes uh

1874
01:15:02,279 --> 01:15:05,960
how do you find deal with uh seed death

1875
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:08,439
I'm not sure if there's patent laws or

1876
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:11,000
things like that surrounding seed um so

1877
01:15:08,439 --> 01:15:12,799
say somebody took a a top of headed one

1878
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,920
of your plants here and took the seed

1879
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,239
and replanted it what kind of

1880
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:18,000
repercussions would there be legal those

1881
01:15:16,238 --> 01:15:20,039
are more the legal aspects and we kind

1882
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,319
of talked about some of that but but

1883
01:15:20,039 --> 01:15:25,600
basically it's it's not legal you'd be

1884
01:15:23,319 --> 01:15:28,238
dealing with trespass in addition to the

1885
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:30,320
yeah there so there's I'll say multiple

1886
01:15:28,238 --> 01:15:32,238
issues around doing something like right

1887
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:34,679
so how is Cornell able to import is it

1888
01:15:32,238 --> 01:15:38,158
under the context of research Jamie

1889
01:15:34,679 --> 01:15:40,199
really did a Yan's job of of doing this

1890
01:15:38,158 --> 01:15:42,920
Jamie you want to talk on on acquiring

1891
01:15:40,198 --> 01:15:45,719
the seats for Corno I think I think

1892
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:50,079
Chris is going to cover all of that

1893
01:15:45,719 --> 01:15:51,880
regulatory stuff okay okay perfect let's

1894
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:55,238
stay tuned and we'll get that question

1895
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:57,600
answered for you yes sir yeah did you do

1896
01:15:55,238 --> 01:16:00,039
a moisture test on the incoming seed

1897
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:02,400
from Canada so you know what least level

1898
01:16:00,039 --> 01:16:02,399
it was

1899
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:07,079
there we have not gathered that data but

1900
01:16:05,719 --> 01:16:09,039
what we do have with the samples that

1901
01:16:07,079 --> 01:16:10,960
are still in the original bag so we can

1902
01:16:09,039 --> 01:16:12,319
go ahead and Sample out of that what

1903
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:15,039
we're really concerned about is when we

1904
01:16:12,319 --> 01:16:17,000
get a small when you get a 100 gram

1905
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:18,840
sample which is like a cup full of seeds

1906
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,880
and that's in an open porous container

1907
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:22,760
and it's a humid day or a dry day that's

1908
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:25,719
all going to change so we really need to

1909
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:27,880
go back the best we can to that and then

1910
01:16:25,719 --> 01:16:30,239
take a deep core out of that then we

1911
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:32,639
will have a more representative but yeah

1912
01:16:30,238 --> 01:16:34,919
as you know as every this whole season

1913
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:36,440
kind of progressed and getting things

1914
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:38,039
there's a lot of would a could have

1915
01:16:36,439 --> 01:16:39,799
should is and there always isn't doing

1916
01:16:38,039 --> 01:16:41,960
research but this was really a hurry up

1917
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:43,719
type of a year to get as far as we are

1918
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:46,119
right now I think next year we'll be

1919
01:16:43,719 --> 01:16:48,719
more in place with doing those quality

1920
01:16:46,119 --> 01:16:50,960
right as soon as we receive the seeds

1921
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:53,880
excellent point we need to be really

1922
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:56,359
good seedsmen here on our side as well

1923
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:59,920
okay yes ma'am do you um do all of these

1924
01:16:56,359 --> 01:17:02,479
plants have a THC and cbdc profile have

1925
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:04,840
they been tested yet and is it available

1926
01:17:02,479 --> 01:17:07,238
anywhere for us so we can know what THC

1927
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:11,440
quantity or what CBD and what types of

1928
01:17:07,238 --> 01:17:12,839
CBD is it cbda cbdb just CBD do the have

1929
01:17:11,439 --> 01:17:15,119
have these varieties been tested for

1930
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:17,039
that yet that's all to be done correct

1931
01:17:15,119 --> 01:17:18,599
Chris did you hear the question yeah so

1932
01:17:17,039 --> 01:17:21,238
the question was have have all the

1933
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:24,520
varieties been tested sorry for THC and

1934
01:17:21,238 --> 01:17:27,799
CBD levels um and the varieties were

1935
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:30,360
going growing here we test here um but

1936
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:33,480
in Canada there's a actually a really

1937
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:35,679
informative website um like on Tero

1938
01:17:33,479 --> 01:17:37,439
Canada fact sheets and they have fact

1939
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:38,719
sheets that cover lots and lots of

1940
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:42,238
different things and one of the things

1941
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:44,520
they have is a list of varieties and um

1942
01:17:42,238 --> 01:17:46,479
those they found to be low or high THC

1943
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:48,320
contents and and I can't remember off

1944
01:17:46,479 --> 01:17:50,718
the top of my head if they have cdb in

1945
01:17:48,319 --> 01:17:53,319
there as well um but that's a a very

1946
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:56,840
informative site for

1947
01:17:53,319 --> 01:17:56,840

1950
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:08,239
questions but we we are addressing these

1951

with Alan little over an hour away but

1959
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:31,279
Chris came quite a distance uh from

Albany to be here um Chris is the

1961

Agriculture markets and he'll be talking

1964
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:40,080
about some of these regulatory issues

1965
01:18:38,039 --> 01:18:42,800
like the question that was asked um as

1966
01:18:40,079 --> 01:18:44,800
well as potential markets here so thank

1967
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:47,320
you very very much for the opportunity

1968
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:49,279
to be here today I know I'm going to get

1969
01:18:47,319 --> 01:18:52,000
lots of questions so I'm glad I don't

1970
01:18:49,279 --> 01:18:53,399
have notes that I'm going to follow um

1971
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,600
I'm just going to start out a little bit

1972
01:18:53,399 --> 01:18:59,559
and tell you sort of how we got here um

1973
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:02,880
Gary described himself as a student of

1974
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:05,520
hemp diseases I have become a student of

1975
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:07,880
hemp it's the been the School of Hard

1976
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:10,040
Knocks there's some people sitting out

1977
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:13,880
here that have been very very helpful to

1978
01:19:10,039 --> 01:19:15,920
me in learning about this crop um so

1979
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:18,279
it's been a couple of years that we've

1980
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:20,199
been working on hemp and as all of you

1981
01:19:18,279 --> 01:19:23,599
know we started out at the department

1982
01:19:20,198 --> 01:19:25,879
with a pretty conservative uh program

1983
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:29,679
that limited our research Partners or

1984
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:32,760
limited research uh permits to folks who

1985
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:35,359
were uh affiliated with colleges and

1986
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:37,760
universities and institutions of higher

1987
01:19:35,359 --> 01:19:39,880
education uh this spring we were able to

1988
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:42,679
open it up and and bring some Farmers

1989
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:45,199
into it and some other folks uh and then

1990
01:19:42,679 --> 01:19:48,639
of course added a number of research

1991
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:51,678
partners with the uh Anka trial this

1992
01:19:48,639 --> 01:19:54,199
summer um so we're definitely sort of on

1993
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:57,239
the track towards a a more liberal

1994
01:19:54,198 --> 01:19:59,759
approach to this um I want to talk a

1995
01:19:57,238 --> 01:20:02,479
little bit about you know the Authority

1996
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:04,679
for any of us to be doing this so the

1997
01:20:02,479 --> 01:20:09,359
Authority for any of us to be engaged in

1998
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:12,119
this uh comes from the 2014 farm bill um

1999
01:20:09,359 --> 01:20:14,920
and basically what the 2014 Farm Bill

2000
01:20:12,119 --> 01:20:18,719
did and I'll just paraphrase uh

2001
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:20,600
basically it enabled uh universities or

2002
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:22,880
institutions of higher education and

2003
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:26,960
state Departments of Agriculture to

2004
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:29,960
engage in industrial research pilot

2005
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:33,399
programs so on the good side the farm

2006
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:36,158
bill doesn't Define what a pilot

2007
01:20:33,399 --> 01:20:37,759
research program is and it doesn't

2008
01:20:36,158 --> 01:20:40,439
necessarily Define what

2009
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:42,159
commercialization is that in a way is

2010
01:20:40,439 --> 01:20:44,279
sort of a double-edged sword it's a good

2011
01:20:42,158 --> 01:20:46,960
thing it's not defined it lets us sort

2012
01:20:44,279 --> 01:20:48,158
of figure out what the boundaries are

2013
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,719
but I think the other thing that you

2014
01:20:48,158 --> 01:20:51,879
need to keep in mind if this is

2015
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:53,158
something that you're considering doing

2016
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:55,239
that at some point along the way

2017
01:20:53,158 --> 01:20:59,279
somebody might say hey you're up against

2018
01:20:55,238 --> 01:21:02,039
the fence you're going too far okay and

2019
01:20:59,279 --> 01:21:03,759
uh we are dealing quite a bit with uh

2020
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:06,800
Department of Justice and

2021
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:08,520
DEA and um I have to tell you they've

2022
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:10,639
been extremely helpful to us I think

2023
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:12,760
they've been pretty responsive with

2024
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:14,679
Cornell and Sunni

2025
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:16,960
Morrisville but this is out of the

2026
01:21:14,679 --> 01:21:19,840
ordinary for them they regulate

2027
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:22,039
controlled substances from cradled grave

2028
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:24,360
in the case of hemp they regulate the

2029
01:21:22,039 --> 01:21:27,359
seed and then they step away from it so

2030
01:21:24,359 --> 01:21:28,799
this is new territory for them as well

2031
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:32,119
the other piece that I'll throw out

2032
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:35,199
there uh is that the farm bill will be

2033
01:21:32,119 --> 01:21:38,960
uh up for Renewal or renegotiation in

2034
01:21:35,198 --> 01:21:40,638
2018 and so uh we need to be aware that

2035
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,800
you know there could potentially be some

2036
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:44,480
changes in that language in the farm

2037
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:47,320
bill and so that's one of the things

2038
01:21:44,479 --> 01:21:49,559
that's on my tick list from a policy

2039
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:52,158
perspective uh working with some of our

2040
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:55,080
policy folks in Albany and in Washington

2041
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:58,759
DC to make sure that we can continue to

2042
01:21:55,079 --> 01:22:01,000
move forward so uh going forward with

2043
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:04,079
the 2018 farm bill you could see the

2044
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:06,520
same language that was in 2014 you could

2045
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:09,359
see a step back away from that that

2046
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:11,840
maybe restricts us more or you could see

2047
01:22:09,359 --> 01:22:13,960
from a federal level maybe some

2048
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:17,000
liberalization um so we need to be aware

2049
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:18,679
of that from the policy perspective the

2050
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,319
other thing I'll say on the federal side

2051
01:22:18,679 --> 01:22:22,800
is is that you know we've had some very

2052
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:26,198
high level discussions with uh some of

2053
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:28,480
the federal folks and and again they are

2054
01:22:26,198 --> 01:22:30,439
uh frankly they don't answer a lot of

2055
01:22:28,479 --> 01:22:32,959
questions directly so if you start

2056
01:22:30,439 --> 01:22:35,759
asking me questions about federal policy

2057
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:38,239
I'm probably going to be a little Cy too

2058
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:40,159
um there is also if you go on our

2059
01:22:38,238 --> 01:22:42,238
website you know you can you can check

2060
01:22:40,158 --> 01:22:44,559
out a number of documents that are very

2061
01:22:42,238 --> 01:22:46,879
very important from a from a regulatory

2062
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:48,159
and an authority perspective uh the

2063
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:50,400
three things that I would say you want

2064
01:22:48,158 --> 01:22:52,079
to be looking at and be aware of on the

2065
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:55,879
federal level are the wording of the

2066
01:22:52,079 --> 01:22:58,800
2014 Farm Bill uh the wording in the

2067
01:22:55,880 --> 01:23:01,359
2016 Omnibus budget act that's very

2068
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:03,520
important as well uh and then the third

2069
01:23:01,359 --> 01:23:05,599
piece is is a guidance document from I

2070
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:10,080
think July or August of last year that

2071
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:11,880
came out from DEA FDA and USDA so those

2072
01:23:10,079 --> 01:23:14,238
are sort of the three guiding documents

2073
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:17,239
that are out there there's still a whole

2074
01:23:14,238 --> 01:23:19,879
lot of gray in this what we've tried to

2075
01:23:17,238 --> 01:23:22,238
do as we've moved forward with this uh

2076
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:24,560
is to build a program that is if you

2077
01:23:22,238 --> 01:23:26,279
will a safe harbor for folks who want to

2078
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:28,800
get involved in this we want to try to

2079
01:23:26,279 --> 01:23:31,319
keep you uh as Farmers Growers

2080
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:33,360
processors what have you uh sort of in a

2081
01:23:31,319 --> 01:23:36,000
safe place from the federal perspective

2082
01:23:33,359 --> 01:23:39,319
but at the same time trying to move this

2083
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:43,039
ahead and learn as much as we possibly

2084
01:23:39,319 --> 01:23:46,238
can um one thing I do want to uh

2085
01:23:43,039 --> 01:23:49,800
actually make sure everybody knows Kate

2086
01:23:46,238 --> 01:23:52,158
in the back there Kate is the person who

2087
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:54,199
if you call our office and you call the

2088
01:23:52,158 --> 01:23:56,599
hemp 800 number that was announced a few

2089
01:23:54,198 --> 01:23:59,839
week weeks ago you will most likely talk

2090
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:01,480
with Kate uh and she will if she can't

2091
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:03,600
answer your question she's going to take

2092
01:24:01,479 --> 01:24:05,399
down your information and and get it get

2093
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:08,199
the question to somebody who can help

2094
01:24:05,399 --> 01:24:10,399
you um so bear with us on that we're

2095
01:24:08,198 --> 01:24:13,279
sort of building this as we

2096
01:24:10,399 --> 01:24:16,319
go I want to make a just a quick comment

2097
01:24:13,279 --> 01:24:18,479
on the trial behind me here um this is

2098
01:24:16,319 --> 01:24:20,639
probably the best hemp I've seen not

2099
01:24:18,479 --> 01:24:23,238
that I've seen a lot but I was in

2100
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:25,560
Kentucky a couple of weeks ago for the

2101
01:24:23,238 --> 01:24:28,678
hemp regulatory comp conference and we

2102
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:31,120
were on several farms and basically we

2103
01:24:28,679 --> 01:24:33,639
were hearing all the same things that

2104
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:35,920
all the Cornell faculty have said

2105
01:24:33,639 --> 01:24:39,319
today uh seed

2106
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:42,118
quality uh emergence competition with

2107
01:24:39,319 --> 01:24:43,960
weeds the lack of herbicides if you're

2108
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:45,880
if you're in a situation where you would

2109
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:49,039
use an herbicide or another crop

2110
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:50,760
protectant on this we're we're coming up

2111
01:24:49,039 --> 01:24:54,039
against all the same issues that have

2112
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:56,440
been been identified in other states uh

2113
01:24:54,039 --> 01:24:59,039
so we're learning a lot as we go

2114
01:24:56,439 --> 01:25:02,479
along so a little bit about the process

2115
01:24:59,039 --> 01:25:04,399
going forward um I've from a from an

2116
01:25:02,479 --> 01:25:06,839
administrative perspective I've kind of

2117
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:08,719
felt for the last two and a half years

2118
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:12,199
like I've been a little bit behind the

2119
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:13,840
curve on the timing on this um and so

2120
01:25:12,198 --> 01:25:16,519
we're always trying we're always on a

2121
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:20,000
scramble to get things done and so our

2122
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:23,960
goal going forward this year is uh for

2123
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,880
2018 I should say is to try to roll out

2124
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:28,679
um

2125
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:31,159
the application process very very soon

2126
01:25:28,679 --> 01:25:34,000
and so I'm going to throw some dates out

2127
01:25:31,158 --> 01:25:35,960
there please don't come call me if this

2128
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:38,639
doesn't come true and give me a hard

2129
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:41,039
time I'd like it to open up uh for

2130
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:43,199
applications during the month of August

2131
01:25:41,039 --> 01:25:45,519
that's this month probably towards the

2132
01:25:43,198 --> 01:25:47,559
end of the month because we've got some

2133
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:50,360
uh vacations and some other professional

2134
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:54,600
meetings that we our staff are engaged

2135
01:25:50,359 --> 01:25:56,319
in um and what that would do is

2136
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:59,159
basically we'd probably leave that

2137
01:25:56,319 --> 01:26:01,158
application period open for uh several

2138
01:25:59,158 --> 01:26:03,599
months maybe into the middle or end of

2139
01:26:01,158 --> 01:26:06,198
October that's going to give folks

2140
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:08,280
adequate time to develop their research

2141
01:26:06,198 --> 01:26:10,319
plan and again I keep circling back

2142
01:26:08,279 --> 01:26:12,039
around to that farm bill that allows us

2143
01:26:10,319 --> 01:26:13,840
to do research not

2144
01:26:12,039 --> 01:26:15,600
commercialization so the thing that I'm

2145
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:18,400
going to weigh most heavily on an

2146
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:19,600
application is what's your research plan

2147
01:26:18,399 --> 01:26:23,198
what are you going to be able to bring

2148
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:24,800
to the table to offer uh as far as new

2149
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:27,479
knowledge or knowledge

2150
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:30,480
and that again we take a very very broad

2151
01:26:27,479 --> 01:26:34,399
approach to research it can be agronomic

2152
01:26:30,479 --> 01:26:37,158
it can be uh Pest Management it can be

2153
01:26:34,399 --> 01:26:40,599
marketing it can be product development

2154
01:26:37,158 --> 01:26:42,399
you name it you can probably make the

2155
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:45,480
argument that it's

2156
01:26:42,399 --> 01:26:48,319
research um so basically getting that

2157
01:26:45,479 --> 01:26:50,959
out there August September October of

2158
01:26:48,319 --> 01:26:53,238
this year is going to give you folks uh

2159
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:55,520
time to develop a good plan it's going

2160
01:26:53,238 --> 01:26:58,959
to give you time to start talking with

2161
01:26:55,520 --> 01:27:01,679
your seed suppliers in Canada the

2162
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:03,800
European Union wherever you uh decide

2163
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:06,279
you're going to get your seed from and

2164
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:09,800
it also gives us a little bit more time

2165
01:27:06,279 --> 01:27:14,399
we actually applied for our DEA import

2166
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:18,560
permit on March 17th of this year and uh

2167
01:27:14,399 --> 01:27:20,079
the DEA came out I think on June 27 or

2168
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:22,440
something and they interviewed several

2169
01:27:20,079 --> 01:27:25,600
of us they took all of our personal

2170
01:27:22,439 --> 01:27:27,399
information names of our eldest children

2171
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:30,079
where they were located all that kind of

2172
01:27:27,399 --> 01:27:35,118
good stuff and um so we're waiting on

2173
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:37,920
our permit so next year hopefully that

2174
01:27:35,118 --> 01:27:39,719
permit will be in place soon I'd like it

2175
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:41,800
to be in place before we go out with our

2176
01:27:39,719 --> 01:27:44,480
application for 2018 I don't know if

2177
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:46,239
that's realistic or not so once that

2178
01:27:44,479 --> 01:27:49,118
permit is in place that's going to give

2179
01:27:46,238 --> 01:27:51,198
us the opportunity at the department to

2180
01:27:49,118 --> 01:27:54,679
play the role of the Importer so what

2181
01:27:51,198 --> 01:27:58,118
that means is if you were a uh uh

2182
01:27:54,679 --> 01:28:00,800
research partner with the Department in

2183
01:27:58,118 --> 01:28:02,719
2018 you would figure out what seed

2184
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:04,279
variety you wanted or varieties you

2185
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:06,560
wanted you would talk with the seed

2186
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:08,840
company Canada the European Union

2187
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:11,119
wherever and uh make all the

2188
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:13,000
arrangements Financial shipping what

2189
01:28:11,118 --> 01:28:15,359
have you to get the seed into the

2190
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,359
country uh and when it's imported it

2191
01:28:15,359 --> 01:28:19,238
would be delivered to Albany and at that

2192
01:28:17,359 --> 01:28:22,839
point you would come to Albany and pick

2193
01:28:19,238 --> 01:28:23,919
it up we would release it to you um so

2194
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:26,560
that's kind of what we're looking at

2195
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:28,760
going going forward so we're hoping for

2196
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:32,400
a much more streamlined

2197
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:35,679
process um definitely invested in this

2198
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:38,920
want to be uh as helpful as we can to

2199
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:40,920
folks um a couple things from the

2200
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:44,199
processing perspective that was the

2201
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:47,279
other thing um that I was asked to talk

2202
01:28:44,198 --> 01:28:50,638
about today so two things I think I want

2203
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:52,759
to sort of talk a little bit about sort

2204
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:54,960
of what I think of what's going on in

2205
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:58,000
the industry I kind of look at the two

2206
01:28:54,960 --> 01:29:00,560
major issues that I think are facing us

2207
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:03,238
almost almost like a set of book ends

2208
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:05,639
you got the seed issue okay and we've

2209
01:29:03,238 --> 01:29:09,079
talked about a lot of the physical

2210
01:29:05,639 --> 01:29:11,800
attributes of the seed um as far as seed

2211
01:29:09,079 --> 01:29:14,000
quality emergence all that type of thing

2212
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:15,920
you have the political the regulatory

2213
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,679
aspects of it where can you get it it's

2214
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:22,520
hard to get into the country okay need a

2215
01:29:18,679 --> 01:29:25,399
lot of permits so if this industry is

2216
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:28,639
going to move forward I think the plant

2217
01:29:25,399 --> 01:29:30,960
breeding program and getting a domestic

2218
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:33,039
seed supply and when I say domestic seed

2219
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:35,399
supply I mean the seed supply within the

2220
01:29:33,039 --> 01:29:37,800
borders of New York state where this

2221
01:29:35,399 --> 01:29:40,000
product is under the state's Authority

2222
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:42,400
is really really

2223
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,279
important I'm not a plant breeder but I

2224
01:29:42,399 --> 01:29:46,479
do have a background in horiculture I

2225
01:29:44,279 --> 01:29:50,118
think we all have to realize that's not

2226
01:29:46,479 --> 01:29:52,279
going to happen overnight okay um I've

2227
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:54,079
had a bunch of questions here and I

2228
01:29:52,279 --> 01:30:00,118
heard some questions here today about

2229
01:29:54,079 --> 01:30:01,559
about uh feral stands of uh hemp and so

2230
01:30:00,118 --> 01:30:04,039
that's definitely something that's sort

2231
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:06,199
of on our radar screen we got to

2232
01:30:04,039 --> 01:30:08,560
understand what that what that is so

2233
01:30:06,198 --> 01:30:11,879
that feral hemp that's out there that

2234
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:13,600
could be um that could be something else

2235
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:18,880
we don't know probably hasn't been

2236
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:20,239
tested for THC number one uh number two

2237
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,960
uh we need to understand what the

2238
01:30:20,238 --> 01:30:23,599
genetics of it are so it could be the

2239
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:25,319
foundation for a really good breeding

2240
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:28,079
program it might be something that we

2241
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:30,599
don't want okay and so it's going to

2242
01:30:28,079 --> 01:30:34,439
take some time to understand what that

2243
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:37,800
is okay um the other book end that I

2244
01:30:34,439 --> 01:30:40,439
think is really really important um is

2245
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:42,239
the processing and the marketing okay so

2246
01:30:40,439 --> 01:30:44,719
that's the other thing that is

2247
01:30:42,238 --> 01:30:46,519
potentially a little bit risky and where

2248
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:49,239
we need to do a lot more work and have a

2249
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:50,880
better understanding of uh what this

2250
01:30:49,238 --> 01:30:53,599
what this plant and what this industry

2251
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:55,319
can do and uh you know there's some of

2252
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:57,760
you here that have known me for a while

2253
01:30:55,319 --> 01:30:59,238
I was in extension for over 20 years and

2254
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:01,560
actually this isn't very much different

2255
01:30:59,238 --> 01:31:03,638
than any other crop I talked with a hemp

2256
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:05,320
farmer the other day and I said hey I'm

2257
01:31:03,639 --> 01:31:07,760
going to tell you the exact same thing I

2258
01:31:05,319 --> 01:31:10,759
talked to people 20 years about

2259
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:12,679
strawberries Greenhouse flowers whatever

2260
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:15,199
we can teach you how to grow

2261
01:31:12,679 --> 01:31:17,359
this but we can't necessarily teach you

2262
01:31:15,198 --> 01:31:19,519
how to sell it how to Market it that

2263
01:31:17,359 --> 01:31:21,479
part of it you guys have to really sort

2264
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:23,639
of take the ball and and run with that

2265
01:31:21,479 --> 01:31:25,319
to a certain extent so what we're

2266
01:31:23,639 --> 01:31:27,560
working working on as far as marketing

2267
01:31:25,319 --> 01:31:30,000
is concerned is we have in our uh

2268
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:32,520
division of a development we have some

2269
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:35,118
staff who uh do work on marketing

2270
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:37,719
efforts and we're uh at least taking the

2271
01:31:35,118 --> 01:31:40,279
step of moving forward identifying

2272
01:31:37,719 --> 01:31:42,960
processors within the state of New York

2273
01:31:40,279 --> 01:31:45,479
because again relatively easy if you've

2274
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:47,600
got some hemp product you can in

2275
01:31:45,479 --> 01:31:50,359
relative with relative ease move it

2276
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:52,440
about within the borders of the State uh

2277
01:31:50,359 --> 01:31:54,639
we're also identifying processors

2278
01:31:52,439 --> 01:31:56,238
outside the state of New York and so at

2279
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:59,800
least we'll have a resource list

2280
01:31:56,238 --> 01:32:02,000
available to you that folks can look at

2281
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:05,039
um and then the other thing is I believe

2282
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:07,079
yesterday or the day before Empire State

2283
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:10,359
development came out with some processor

2284
01:32:07,079 --> 01:32:12,238
grants so there are some funds available

2285
01:32:10,359 --> 01:32:14,519
uh to help to Spur the processing

2286
01:32:12,238 --> 01:32:16,638
industry and so if you call us at the

2287
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:19,320
department and talk with Kate I'm pretty

2288
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:21,880
sure you do have a uh you've got a

2289
01:32:19,319 --> 01:32:25,158
contact person at ESD now so we have

2290
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:26,880
someone we can we can refer you

2291
01:32:25,158 --> 01:32:31,359
to

2292
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:34,960
um seed seed certification certification

2293
01:32:31,359 --> 01:32:38,000
yes thank you um the other thing that's

2294
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:40,198
on our tick list coming out of uh the

2295
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,118
bill signing and the summit and really

2296
01:32:40,198 --> 01:32:44,399
related to my my comments about

2297
01:32:42,118 --> 01:32:47,079
developing a domestic within the borders

2298
01:32:44,399 --> 01:32:49,238
of New York seed industry uh one of the

2299
01:32:47,079 --> 01:32:51,880
things that we really have high on our

2300
01:32:49,238 --> 01:32:54,079
list to do is to develop some seed

2301
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:56,639
certification standards so we've got if

2302
01:32:54,079 --> 01:32:58,479
you look in uh the agon markets law

2303
01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:00,400
there are seed certification standards

2304
01:32:58,479 --> 01:33:03,359
for all kinds of different crops that we

2305
01:33:00,399 --> 01:33:06,198
grow we work closely with the folks here

2306
01:33:03,359 --> 01:33:08,198
um New York uh State seed Improvement

2307
01:33:06,198 --> 01:33:10,158
and Cornell when we develop those

2308
01:33:08,198 --> 01:33:12,118
standards but that's going to be very

2309
01:33:10,158 --> 01:33:15,079
very important and really what it comes

2310
01:33:12,118 --> 01:33:17,238
down to as Dr Taylor said in a nutshell

2311
01:33:15,079 --> 01:33:20,198
is sort of consumer protection for the

2312
01:33:17,238 --> 01:33:22,519
people who are buying that seed okay uh

2313
01:33:20,198 --> 01:33:24,399
and that's really going to uh set the

2314
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:26,840
set the stage for developing that

2315
01:33:24,399 --> 01:33:29,920
industry along with development of of

2316
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:31,760
some genetics that are uh good for New

2317
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:34,639
York as well as good for the various

2318
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:38,119
uses of industrial

2319
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:40,400
hemp with that I can answer some

2320
01:33:38,118 --> 01:33:41,519
questions I'm sure there will be some

2321
01:33:40,399 --> 01:33:45,519
there always

2322
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:47,840
are yes sir uh with respect to the 2018

2323
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:49,960
Farm Bill what are the political

2324
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:52,719
pressure points that can be used to make

2325
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:55,639
sure it's motivated in a favorable

2326
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:57,960
Direction so the the question was uh in

2327
01:33:55,639 --> 01:33:59,920
regards to the 2018 Farm Bill what are

2328
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:02,920
the pressure points as far as a

2329
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:05,118
favorable outcome you know I think one

2330
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:08,440
of the things with anything at a federal

2331
01:34:05,118 --> 01:34:10,399
level and and again hemp is a very small

2332
01:34:08,439 --> 01:34:11,960
piece of well actually not it's a very

2333
01:34:10,399 --> 01:34:14,000
large piece of what I've been doing over

2334
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:15,600
the last couple of years but we've got a

2335
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,118
lot of other issues where we're dealing

2336
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:21,199
with the federal government and I would

2337
01:34:17,118 --> 01:34:24,960
just say in general there's a lot of

2338
01:34:21,198 --> 01:34:29,238
um anxiety among sort of middle

2339
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:32,920
management folks and uh and federal

2340
01:34:29,238 --> 01:34:36,319
agencies um not necessarily a great deal

2341
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:39,000
of of Direction I would say one thing

2342
01:34:36,319 --> 01:34:42,920
that we may have from a favorable

2343
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:45,039
perspective is Kentucky is a big state

2344
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:47,960
in hemp and so you have Mitch McConnell

2345
01:34:45,039 --> 01:34:49,600
with a leadership position uh and in

2346
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:53,198
Congress and so that

2347
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:56,199
potentially um you know helps with the

2348
01:34:53,198 --> 01:34:58,479
whole hemp situation but I think you

2349
01:34:56,198 --> 01:35:00,799
know try trying to predict what the

2350
01:34:58,479 --> 01:35:02,439
pressure points are is is pretty hard

2351
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:06,039
with how things have been have been

2352
01:35:02,439 --> 01:35:06,039
working at the federal level at this

2353
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:11,679
point so the the question is is on the

2354
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:13,920
New York delegation and I think there's

2355
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:15,719
been a quite a bit of interest from uh

2356
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:17,199
from the New York delegation from my

2357
01:35:15,719 --> 01:35:21,039
perspective Donna do you have something

2358
01:35:17,198 --> 01:35:21,039
you want to add to that

2359
01:35:29,399 --> 01:35:34,519
yeah so uh we were just with Senator

2360
01:35:32,479 --> 01:35:36,839
Gill brand recently and she's one of the

2361
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:40,119
main sponsors of the

2362
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:43,719
2018 industrial Hamp farming act so our

2363
01:35:40,118 --> 01:35:46,079
hope is that um because of the interest

2364
01:35:43,719 --> 01:35:48,000
from largely from Kentucky Rand Paul and

2365
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:50,000
Mitch McConnell and others and the

2366
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:52,198
widespread support in places across the

2367
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:54,158
country where it's growing that we can

2368
01:35:52,198 --> 01:35:57,079
get around those pressure points by

2369
01:35:54,158 --> 01:36:00,439
death pressuring for full passage of of

2370
01:35:57,079 --> 01:36:03,118
legalization we think that um is uh

2371
01:36:00,439 --> 01:36:06,359
looking um much more likely than it's

2372
01:36:03,118 --> 01:36:08,439
ever before uh I'm not positive how many

2373
01:36:06,359 --> 01:36:12,559
of our New York Congressmen have signed

2374
01:36:08,439 --> 01:36:15,559
on last year I think we had five um and

2375
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:17,400
uh our Congressman uh had has recently

2376
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:19,920
retired so he's not on the bill at the

2377
01:36:17,399 --> 01:36:21,198
moment uh but yeah that's our goal the

2378
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:23,399
goal is to pass the industrial hemp

2379
01:36:21,198 --> 01:36:24,678
farming act and just make everybody's

2380
01:36:23,399 --> 01:36:27,719
life a lot

2381
01:36:24,679 --> 01:36:29,520
easier I'll stick around and kiss thank

2382
01:36:27,719 --> 01:36:31,639
you yes sir yeah I got a question

2383
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:34,600
regarding the farm bill you know why

2384
01:36:31,639 --> 01:36:37,359
there there's so much effort by the DEA

2385
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:40,440
and play on words when it comes to the

2386
01:36:37,359 --> 01:36:43,960
CBD extract part of the

2387
01:36:40,439 --> 01:36:45,799
plant if they try to make it like it's

2388
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:48,359
THC we know it's not

2389
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:51,159
THC they play around a lot of words and

2390
01:36:48,359 --> 01:36:54,000
I've read you talking about the

2391
01:36:51,158 --> 01:36:56,000
rescheduling classification not just

2392
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:59,238
well yes rescheduled but also as part of

2393
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,920
the form act they're trying to delineate

2394
01:36:59,238 --> 01:37:02,839
the

2395
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:06,639
CBD and it doesn't sound favorable right

2396
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:09,119
now so a a couple things is is there are

2397
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:10,719
even some states and as I said I was in

2398
01:37:09,118 --> 01:37:13,519
Kentucky two weeks ago for the

2399
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:16,118
regulatory conference which basically

2400
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:17,840
was pretty much limited to folks from

2401
01:37:16,118 --> 01:37:19,639
State Departments of Agriculture there

2402
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:22,400
were a few extension people there as

2403
01:37:19,639 --> 01:37:26,118
presenters as well so it was a pretty

2404
01:37:22,399 --> 01:37:28,719
open uh uh exchange and forum and even

2405
01:37:26,118 --> 01:37:32,960
some of the states have defined

2406
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:35,800
Industrial Hemp as grain and fiber only

2407
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:37,480
and have limited CBD

2408
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:40,880
Research

2409
01:37:37,479 --> 01:37:44,198
um at the federal level I think there's

2410
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:48,279
again um a little bit of a of a

2411
01:37:44,198 --> 01:37:50,079
disconnect perhaps if you will um

2412
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:52,559
because some of those

2413
01:37:50,079 --> 01:37:56,238
products have not necessarily had

2414
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:59,039
clinical trial on them and so there's a

2415
01:37:56,238 --> 01:38:00,638
hesitancy to move forward with

2416
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:04,359
them

2417
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:06,639
um and again I kind of would go back uh

2418
01:38:04,359 --> 01:38:10,279
and I'm not going to you know poke

2419
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:12,359
another agency um DEA has been pretty

2420
01:38:10,279 --> 01:38:14,679
helpful to us DEA has been pretty

2421
01:38:12,359 --> 01:38:16,960
helpful I think to Cornell and

2422
01:38:14,679 --> 01:38:21,319
Morrisville I

2423
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:21,319
think going back to my previous

2424
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:27,960
statement regulatory

2425
01:38:25,198 --> 01:38:29,519
officials look for black and white and

2426
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:32,079
there's not a lot of black and white in

2427
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:34,199
this and so when you have a DEA

2428
01:38:32,079 --> 01:38:35,519
investigator or someone in a leadership

2429
01:38:34,198 --> 01:38:39,079
position at

2430
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:41,400
DEA and it doesn't fit neatly into how

2431
01:38:39,079 --> 01:38:44,118
they've defined other substances they

2432
01:38:41,399 --> 01:38:46,960
really struggle with that and so I think

2433
01:38:44,118 --> 01:38:49,639
it's sort of a dis a discovery or a

2434
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:51,319
process of trying to figure out you know

2435
01:38:49,639 --> 01:38:54,599
what's what we've taken a little bit

2436
01:38:51,319 --> 01:38:56,079
more liberal approach on the CBD end of

2437
01:38:54,599 --> 01:38:58,880
things

2438
01:38:56,079 --> 01:39:00,479
but we've also had a lot of discussions

2439
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:02,400
with our State Department of Health over

2440
01:39:00,479 --> 01:39:05,879
the past six months about

2441
01:39:02,399 --> 01:39:07,920
CBD and you know they're in a role where

2442
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:11,000
they're going to be backing us up on a

2443
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:13,359
technical perspective because as I say

2444
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:16,800
to my

2445
01:39:13,359 --> 01:39:19,039
boss do you want an entomologist a

2446
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:21,480
Forester and somebody with a dairy

2447
01:39:19,039 --> 01:39:23,519
Science Background to be

2448
01:39:21,479 --> 01:39:25,799
evaluating projects that might have

2449
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:28,159
medical or health implications it's out

2450
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:29,840
of my wheelhouse if you start to talk to

2451
01:39:28,158 --> 01:39:32,238
me about the Agronomy or The Pest

2452
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:34,679
Management I can probably look at that

2453
01:39:32,238 --> 01:39:37,079
pretty easily and tell if it's a good

2454
01:39:34,679 --> 01:39:40,920
project a worthy project if I have

2455
01:39:37,079 --> 01:39:43,639
questions I have probably 11 right Folks

2456
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:45,639
at Cornell who can help me out with that

2457
01:39:43,639 --> 01:39:47,920
you start getting into some of the CBD

2458
01:39:45,639 --> 01:39:49,840
stuff and start to make Health claims

2459
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:52,000
and that type of thing and even to some

2460
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:54,159
extent nutritional claims we don't

2461
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:57,719
necessarily have the back stop for that

2462
01:39:54,158 --> 01:39:57,719
right now and so we're developing

2463
01:39:58,319 --> 01:40:02,960
that how about you hey how's it going

2464
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:06,359
good based on that line um of what we're

2465
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:10,639
just talking about now what is New York

2466
01:40:06,359 --> 01:40:13,598
State's definition then of medical CBD

2467
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:16,118
marijuana versus what I'm looking at

2468
01:40:13,599 --> 01:40:18,239
right now which is hemp with CBD oil in

2469
01:40:16,118 --> 01:40:21,079
it what's the what's the difference

2470
01:40:18,238 --> 01:40:23,000
there is it a gray area so thank you for

2471
01:40:21,079 --> 01:40:25,279
saying it's a gray area cuz it is a gray

2472
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:27,198
area we're trying to figure that out you

2473
01:40:25,279 --> 01:40:29,840
know and one of the things that's uh a

2474
01:40:27,198 --> 01:40:32,439
little bit of a challenge is Is So

2475
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:34,440
within the medical marijuana program

2476
01:40:32,439 --> 01:40:36,158
there are very strict quality control

2477
01:40:34,439 --> 01:40:38,439
standards in there very strict

2478
01:40:36,158 --> 01:40:40,719
production standards that's not stuff

2479
01:40:38,439 --> 01:40:43,198
that we have in the industrial hemp

2480
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:45,679
current Industrial Hemp regulations it's

2481
01:40:43,198 --> 01:40:48,399
not something that frankly is in the

2482
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:51,039
next iteration of the Industrial Hemp

2483
01:40:48,399 --> 01:40:54,039
regulations um but we're working on

2484
01:40:51,039 --> 01:40:57,039
trying to Define where those regulatory

2485
01:40:54,039 --> 01:40:59,760
boundaries are and and when other

2486
01:40:57,039 --> 01:41:01,079
agencies have to be brought in so we you

2487
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:02,960
know we don't want to get in trouble and

2488
01:41:01,079 --> 01:41:05,079
we don't want anybody that's s sitting

2489
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:06,599
here in the audience to get in

2490
01:41:05,079 --> 01:41:09,198
difficulty with either another state

2491
01:41:06,599 --> 01:41:11,480
agency or a federal agency and so I

2492
01:41:09,198 --> 01:41:13,158
think a little bit of patience a little

2493
01:41:11,479 --> 01:41:15,279
bit of working through it and we'll

2494
01:41:13,158 --> 01:41:19,039
certainly get

2495
01:41:15,279 --> 01:41:21,559
there a little experience in hemp and

2496
01:41:19,039 --> 01:41:23,920
marijuana and medical marijuana as a

2497
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:26,440
police officer I might not be confused

2498
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:28,520
by some of these taller varieties but I

2499
01:41:26,439 --> 01:41:30,598
definitely would be confused with the

2500
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:32,920
smaller varieties not just based on its

2501
01:41:30,599 --> 01:41:34,960
look but based on its smell its texture

2502
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:38,359
and that essentially there's not real

2503
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:40,158
there's that gray area um so is egg

2504
01:41:38,359 --> 01:41:41,598
markets when people are applying for

2505
01:41:40,158 --> 01:41:43,960
these applications helping them reach

2506
01:41:41,599 --> 01:41:46,360
out to their local police to make sure

2507
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:47,599
that they're aware I know we have a sign

2508
01:41:46,359 --> 01:41:49,238
but my neighbors would probably read

2509
01:41:47,599 --> 01:41:51,599
that sign and just report me for growing

2510
01:41:49,238 --> 01:41:54,359
marijuana so so the question was what

2511
01:41:51,599 --> 01:41:57,199
about you know uh uh working with law

2512
01:41:54,359 --> 01:42:00,198
enforcement as far as on Industrial Hemp

2513
01:41:57,198 --> 01:42:03,399
and so uh I don't have the regulations

2514
01:42:00,198 --> 01:42:05,479
in front of me but basically what we

2515
01:42:03,399 --> 01:42:07,319
currently have in the regulations and

2516
01:42:05,479 --> 01:42:10,118
I'm definitely is going into the next

2517
01:42:07,319 --> 01:42:12,559
version is a requirement for when you

2518
01:42:10,118 --> 01:42:14,880
get your Industrial Hemp research

2519
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:16,719
authorization from the Department you

2520
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:18,800
have a certain amount of time to reach

2521
01:42:16,719 --> 01:42:20,800
out to your local law enforcement agency

2522
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:24,320
and let them know that you have this

2523
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:27,480
permit okay and so each of the original

2524
01:42:24,319 --> 01:42:30,079
uh 10 authorization holders have done

2525
01:42:27,479 --> 01:42:32,359
that um and they report back to us that

2526
01:42:30,079 --> 01:42:34,279
they've completed it uh often times they

2527
01:42:32,359 --> 01:42:36,238
send us a copy of the letter or give a

2528
01:42:34,279 --> 01:42:38,519
reference to a phone call or what have

2529
01:42:36,238 --> 01:42:41,319
you that happened and interestingly

2530
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:45,520
enough we've gotten questions on it we

2531
01:42:41,319 --> 01:42:47,759
had somebody actually call in um and it

2532
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:51,239
came I don't think it came to my desk I

2533
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:53,159
think it came to Tim's desk and uh came

2534
01:42:51,238 --> 01:42:56,359
to his desk as you have an industrial

2535
01:42:53,158 --> 01:42:58,839
ATT call well it was a county sheriff

2536
01:42:56,359 --> 01:42:59,639
and a fisherman had scampered up from

2537
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:02,800
the

2538
01:42:59,639 --> 01:43:06,118
riverbank and apparently had walked some

2539
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:07,880
distance from where he started fishing

2540
01:43:06,118 --> 01:43:09,880
and he came up in something that looked

2541
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:12,840
like this and he called the called the

2542
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:15,279
police and um so you know that

2543
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:16,760
particular uh authorization holder had

2544
01:43:15,279 --> 01:43:19,399
talked with somebody within the county

2545
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:20,599
sheriff's department but it some word

2546
01:43:19,399 --> 01:43:22,439
hadn't gone through the whole

2547
01:43:20,599 --> 01:43:25,119
organization so we were able to take

2548
01:43:22,439 --> 01:43:27,919
that call and answer it we also have had

2549
01:43:25,118 --> 01:43:30,479
calls from New York State Police uh

2550
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:32,199
intelligence unit because some of our

2551
01:43:30,479 --> 01:43:35,000
authorization holders have sent the

2552
01:43:32,198 --> 01:43:36,678
license in um the license looks like our

2553
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:40,439
plant life plant

2554
01:43:36,679 --> 01:43:44,199
industry uh plant dealer or plant grower

2555
01:43:40,439 --> 01:43:45,960
license and um when you photocopy it the

2556
01:43:44,198 --> 01:43:49,000
security paper The Watermark doesn't

2557
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:51,039
show up and so they rightfully

2558
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,238
questioned whether it was a re the real

2559
01:43:51,039 --> 01:43:55,039
deal or not did you want to add

2560
01:43:52,238 --> 01:43:55,039
something Donna

2561
01:43:56,079 --> 01:44:03,118
two things uh just for um for reference

2562
01:43:59,599 --> 01:44:06,000
in uh bingamon university has 15,000 uh

2563
01:44:03,118 --> 01:44:07,639
CBD Rich plants in the ground in a

2564
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:10,238
raised bed format they're doing a

2565
01:44:07,639 --> 01:44:13,840
different type of grow uh their plants

2566
01:44:10,238 --> 01:44:16,678
were imported as cuting from Kentucky

2567
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:18,920
it's IP that is IP protected material

2568
01:44:16,679 --> 01:44:22,599
that's been cut it cut and

2569
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:23,960
cloned and the local sheriff was very uh

2570
01:44:22,599 --> 01:44:27,520
interested to come and see what was

2571
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:29,800
going on but we've had across the board

2572
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:31,400
support from law enforcement largely

2573
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:32,119
because when they understand the issue

2574
01:44:31,399 --> 01:44:34,359
of

2575
01:44:32,118 --> 01:44:37,359
cross-pollination this does uh have an

2576
01:44:34,359 --> 01:44:39,198
impact on illegally grown marijuana

2577
01:44:37,359 --> 01:44:41,479
which makes them very happy some of us

2578
01:44:39,198 --> 01:44:43,118
not so much but some some people are not

2579
01:44:41,479 --> 01:44:46,279
happy about

2580
01:44:43,118 --> 01:44:48,319
yes so and since Donna brought up

2581
01:44:46,279 --> 01:44:52,198
Kentucky I guess I should address that

2582
01:44:48,319 --> 01:44:55,079
issue so if you look at the program or

2583
01:44:52,198 --> 01:44:57,759
the if you look at the US Department of

2584
01:44:55,079 --> 01:45:00,319
Justice guidance and you look at the uh

2585
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:03,719
USDA the the three agency guidance

2586
01:45:00,319 --> 01:45:06,920
document from a year ago it expressly

2587
01:45:03,719 --> 01:45:08,198
forbids the movement of plants and seeds

2588
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:10,719
among

2589
01:45:08,198 --> 01:45:13,678
states however there's another document

2590
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:18,880
that says Industrial Hemp can move among

2591
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:22,440
states that have um programs State

2592
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:24,960
authorized programs and so the guidance

2593
01:45:22,439 --> 01:45:28,158
document doesn't necessarily have force

2594
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:30,960
of of law behind it I will tell you that

2595
01:45:28,158 --> 01:45:33,519
the DEA is fully aware that plants and

2596
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:37,800
seeds are coming from Kentucky and

2597
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:41,080
Colorado and Oregon um the Department's

2598
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:43,320
not going to facilitate that um but we

2599
01:45:41,079 --> 01:45:45,198
are not at this point going to forbid

2600
01:45:43,319 --> 01:45:47,719
you from doing that I think that will

2601
01:45:45,198 --> 01:45:50,919
probably continue to be a question that

2602
01:45:47,719 --> 01:45:54,319
we wrestle with a little bit um you know

2603
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:57,880
some of the other states in uh that we

2604
01:45:54,319 --> 01:45:59,719
interfaced with down in Kentucky um

2605
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:01,400
basically we're saying well once you do

2606
01:45:59,719 --> 01:46:03,439
that you don't kind of know what you're

2607
01:46:01,399 --> 01:46:05,799
getting into your state and so

2608
01:46:03,439 --> 01:46:09,079
potentially you have some issues going

2609
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:11,239
forward um from a regulatory perspective

2610
01:46:09,079 --> 01:46:14,719
so if you do that you're doing it at

2611
01:46:11,238 --> 01:46:17,559
your own risk and anybody who's a

2612
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:19,719
current authorization holder has read

2613
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:21,679
all of the releases and signed the forms

2614
01:46:19,719 --> 01:46:25,000
anybody that applies you'll you'll see

2615
01:46:21,679 --> 01:46:27,800
the paperwork that's involved in

2616
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:30,719
this

2617
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:33,880
sir one of my wife's Canadian relatives

2618
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:36,560
involved in the hemp industry up there

2619
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:38,639
he says a nightly occurrence car pulls

2620
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:41,000
up jumps the fence whack a few bushes

2621
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:43,400
back in the car and away they go as a

2622
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:46,439
grower or possessor of hemp in New York

2623
01:46:43,399 --> 01:46:48,519
through this program what are my legal

2624
01:46:46,439 --> 01:46:51,759
responsibilities should that happen on

2625
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:53,440
my farm go back to bed call the cops

2626
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:57,760
this is getting out into the Community

2627
01:46:53,439 --> 01:47:00,919
even what whatever it's in it so first

2628
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:03,760
off I'm not an attorney I'm a plant

2629
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:06,599
industry director but what I would say

2630
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:09,199
is is if I if I held a if I held a

2631
01:47:06,599 --> 01:47:11,719
research authorization and that was

2632
01:47:09,198 --> 01:47:15,719
happening I would

2633
01:47:11,719 --> 01:47:17,560
first for our regulation you've already

2634
01:47:15,719 --> 01:47:19,480
got a relationship with your local law

2635
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:21,159
enforcement that's part of the reason we

2636
01:47:19,479 --> 01:47:23,118
want you to call if you have our

2637
01:47:21,158 --> 01:47:24,960
research authorization that's part of

2638
01:47:23,118 --> 01:47:27,519
the reason we want you to call local law

2639
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:29,118
enforcement so they know it's there so

2640
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:30,520
they maybe can drive by a little more

2641
01:47:29,118 --> 01:47:32,279
often if they want to keep an eye on

2642
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:35,159
what's going on but also so you have a

2643
01:47:32,279 --> 01:47:38,479
relationship so I would say you want to

2644
01:47:35,158 --> 01:47:39,799
you want to call them and report it um

2645
01:47:38,479 --> 01:47:42,399
and the other piece of it is is for

2646
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:45,920
whoever's taking

2647
01:47:42,399 --> 01:47:48,638
it they have no legal protection once

2648
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:51,719
they cross the fence okay if I cut one

2649
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:55,359
of these now and I went outside across

2650
01:47:51,719 --> 01:47:58,000
that fence I have a controlled substance

2651
01:47:55,359 --> 01:48:00,519
and so any law enforcement officer

2652
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:02,880
because I'm not a research authorization

2653
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:06,080
holder in the program would have every

2654
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:09,520
right to stop me so I would say you

2655
01:48:06,079 --> 01:48:11,118
report it and document that as well

2656
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:13,960
because one of the things that you know

2657
01:48:11,118 --> 01:48:15,920
potentially happens going forward is is

2658
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:18,480
you potentially get into a situation

2659
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:20,679
where your neighbor maybe doesn't like

2660
01:48:18,479 --> 01:48:23,238
this kind this form of Agriculture and

2661
01:48:20,679 --> 01:48:26,520
decides they want to challenge you on

2662
01:48:23,238 --> 01:48:28,279
that so you want to have uh a good you

2663
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:31,080
know good record that you have been

2664
01:48:28,279 --> 01:48:34,039
diligent about controlling this product

2665
01:48:31,079 --> 01:48:35,000
and keeping it uh from getting where it

2666
01:48:34,039 --> 01:48:37,679
shouldn't

2667
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:39,800
be yes sir kind of a compound question

2668
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:42,359
for you here Chris flowing from this one

2669
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:44,440
um how do you establish the the chain of

2670
01:48:42,359 --> 01:48:47,279
title or provenance of the product that

2671
01:48:44,439 --> 01:48:49,519
you have if you do acquire it um by

2672
01:48:47,279 --> 01:48:51,719
appropriate means and you're a processor

2673
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:54,199
Etc you need to have a certification you

2674
01:48:51,719 --> 01:48:57,439
know the bill of sale what documentation

2675
01:48:54,198 --> 01:48:59,279
will um essentially qualify you to hold

2676
01:48:57,439 --> 01:49:03,759
that product and then you had mentioned

2677
01:48:59,279 --> 01:49:05,559
earlier um that it's fairly easy to move

2678
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:07,440
this product around within the state of

2679
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:09,119
New York that suggests to me that it

2680
01:49:07,439 --> 01:49:11,359
might be a little bit but you also did

2681
01:49:09,118 --> 01:49:13,639
say identifying processors out of state

2682
01:49:11,359 --> 01:49:16,319
so I'm I'm curious is it uh is it

2683
01:49:13,639 --> 01:49:19,400
something where the raw product the raw

2684
01:49:16,319 --> 01:49:22,039
seed Etc is more difficult to send out

2685
01:49:19,399 --> 01:49:23,679
of state if once it's processed into a

2686
01:49:22,039 --> 01:49:27,800
product is that relatively easier to

2687
01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:29,719
send out sure so uh a couple things so

2688
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:31,599
number one uh your first question was

2689
01:49:29,719 --> 01:49:33,920
sort of how do you how do you establish

2690
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:36,560
the chain of title correct and so what

2691
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:39,118
we've done up to now is is that we have

2692
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:41,960
had our authorization holders if they're

2693
01:49:39,118 --> 01:49:45,399
sending a product to processing we've

2694
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:48,480
added that processor as a site under

2695
01:49:45,399 --> 01:49:52,799
their existing license I think what

2696
01:49:48,479 --> 01:49:55,919
we're going to do going forward um is to

2697
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:58,480
actually register processors and so we

2698
01:49:55,920 --> 01:50:01,239
don't Envision the registration of

2699
01:49:58,479 --> 01:50:03,439
processors to have a fee attached to it

2700
01:50:01,238 --> 01:50:05,598
at this point in time it's basically

2701
01:50:03,439 --> 01:50:09,359
you're filing with us to say you are a

2702
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:12,079
hemp processor that way if you are in

2703
01:50:09,359 --> 01:50:15,279
possession um and really what concerns

2704
01:50:12,079 --> 01:50:17,800
us um is if you were a processor and

2705
01:50:15,279 --> 01:50:19,559
you're in possession of any propagative

2706
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:21,719
material so in other words seed that

2707
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:23,320
hasn't been roasted or denatured or

2708
01:50:21,719 --> 01:50:26,840
sterilized

2709
01:50:23,319 --> 01:50:28,238
um we want to have you as a processor

2710
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:30,159
have a piece of paper in your hand that

2711
01:50:28,238 --> 01:50:33,399
says you're authorized to have that in

2712
01:50:30,158 --> 01:50:36,879
the event that Federal officials came in

2713
01:50:33,399 --> 01:50:39,638
and you know asked why you had that

2714
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:42,840
product um the second part of your

2715
01:50:39,639 --> 01:50:45,279
question was again about uh the ease of

2716
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:49,000
transporting product across state lines

2717
01:50:45,279 --> 01:50:51,519
raw productes so if you go back and

2718
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,880
again I don't have the exact wording in

2719
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:55,400
my mind but if you go back of the

2720
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:57,159
Controlled Substances Act of 1970 it

2721
01:50:55,399 --> 01:50:59,118
actually exempts certain parts of the

2722
01:50:57,158 --> 01:51:02,118
plant even right within the Controlled

2723
01:50:59,118 --> 01:51:03,639
Substances Act now one of the things I

2724
01:51:02,118 --> 01:51:05,799
will say and again I'm not in the

2725
01:51:03,639 --> 01:51:07,840
business of poking another agency

2726
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:10,000
especially the DEA since I need to get a

2727
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:13,520
permit from them right now they don't

2728
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:16,479
haven't if you in if you interpret the

2729
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:18,360
Controlled Substances Act uh

2730
01:51:16,479 --> 01:51:21,319
literally you could make the

2731
01:51:18,359 --> 01:51:24,000
interpretation that hemp was never

2732
01:51:21,319 --> 01:51:25,799
illegal it was just really hard to get

2733
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:28,560
the permits for it in fact nobody ever

2734
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:34,159
got the permits for it over the past 50

2735
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:36,440
years um so seed and plants probably

2736
01:51:34,158 --> 01:51:40,158
pretty difficult to get

2737
01:51:36,439 --> 01:51:42,839
from uh state to state that's going to

2738
01:51:40,158 --> 01:51:46,000
peque the interest of the DEA and I will

2739
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:48,920
tell you in in our interviews they're

2740
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:50,639
well aware of what's going on and have

2741
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:53,118
what I would say is pretty good

2742
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:55,920
intelligence um

2743
01:51:53,118 --> 01:52:00,118
the other parts of the plant should move

2744
01:51:55,920 --> 01:52:01,880
very easily among states that have an

2745
01:52:00,118 --> 01:52:04,920
industrial hemp

2746
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:06,679
program North Dakota I believe last year

2747
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:08,880
ran into some problems where one of

2748
01:52:06,679 --> 01:52:10,599
their authorization holders had a large

2749
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:12,679
amount of material and I don't can't

2750
01:52:10,599 --> 01:52:16,840
remember what part of the plant it was

2751
01:52:12,679 --> 01:52:19,199
that DEA uh held for a period of time

2752
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:23,119
and the Department of Agriculture and

2753
01:52:19,198 --> 01:52:26,078
the DEA you know got into a into a

2754
01:52:23,118 --> 01:52:27,920
uh war of letters and eventually the

2755
01:52:26,078 --> 01:52:29,679
product was released and went to where

2756
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:32,560
it needed to go so I think we're going

2757
01:52:29,679 --> 01:52:35,399
to run into some bumps like that from

2758
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:38,560
time to time and again what happened

2759
01:52:35,399 --> 01:52:41,359
last year which was I believe in was

2760
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:44,960
either in December or January uh and

2761
01:52:41,359 --> 01:52:47,519
talking sort of informally with my

2762
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:50,118
counterpart in North Dakota his take on

2763
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:52,679
it was there was an Administration

2764
01:52:50,118 --> 01:52:54,799
change going on there was a lack of CL

2765
01:52:52,679 --> 01:52:58,760
ity as to where this was going and that

2766
01:52:54,800 --> 01:53:01,679
somebody at a regional level had decided

2767
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:04,800
to take advantage of that change and try

2768
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:07,599
to make an example so to speak so I

2769
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:10,360
think you know I think as we move

2770
01:53:07,599 --> 01:53:12,400
through the 2018 Farm Bill process we're

2771
01:53:10,359 --> 01:53:14,319
going to have a much better sense of

2772
01:53:12,399 --> 01:53:16,960
what the federal Administration is

2773
01:53:14,319 --> 01:53:20,759
thinking and where we're going on

2774
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:24,319
this yes ma'am so if you if you're

2775
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:27,560
planting h on forested land CU I I've

2776
01:53:24,319 --> 01:53:30,639
had theft on forested property and this

2777
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:33,239
was handled by the I guess the Forestry

2778
01:53:30,639 --> 01:53:36,840
Department of the State Police so if

2779
01:53:33,238 --> 01:53:39,078
you're planting him on a property that's

2780
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:41,800
forested well let's say part of it is

2781
01:53:39,078 --> 01:53:46,399
forested and you planted

2782
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:48,000
M um who do you go to if you have a I

2783
01:53:46,399 --> 01:53:49,799
think if you have a theft issue and

2784
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,679
you're holding our you know if you're

2785
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:53,560
holding our Ag and markets research

2786
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:54,960
authorization

2787
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:57,199
you would go to your local law

2788
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:59,039
enforcement officials but you would also

2789
01:53:57,198 --> 01:54:01,559
want to be sure that we at the

2790
01:53:59,039 --> 01:54:04,599
department knew what was going on as

2791
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:08,039
well and do you get signage to put on

2792
01:54:04,599 --> 01:54:09,679
the property so the current regulation

2793
01:54:08,039 --> 01:54:13,560
and again the current regulation that's

2794
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:16,599
on the books we wrote those uh with the

2795
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:18,199
research institutions in mind so frankly

2796
01:54:16,599 --> 01:54:20,319
they're a little bit outdated for where

2797
01:54:18,198 --> 01:54:23,598
we are right now as far as what's going

2798
01:54:20,319 --> 01:54:26,759
on in the state those orig regulations

2799
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:29,960
did have a specific signage requirement

2800
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:33,079
and going forward that's not going to be

2801
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:34,719
in the next iteration of the regulations

2802
01:54:33,078 --> 01:54:38,279
because you sort of have a double-edged

2803
01:54:34,719 --> 01:54:40,599
sword with signage it can if you put a

2804
01:54:38,279 --> 01:54:44,840
no trespassing sign

2805
01:54:40,599 --> 01:54:46,960
here I'm not going to go in but if my

2806
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:49,119
wife saw a no trespassing sign here she

2807
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:53,039
would go in because she'd want to see

2808
01:54:49,118 --> 01:54:54,799
what was in there um

2809
01:54:53,039 --> 01:54:56,719
we tested that years ago at the

2810
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:58,599
Washington State Governor's Mansion and

2811
01:54:56,719 --> 01:55:00,719
the Troopers took us out of there so you

2812
01:54:58,599 --> 01:55:02,400
know we we got like three steps up the

2813
01:55:00,719 --> 01:55:05,880
driveway it's not like in Albany where

2814
01:55:02,399 --> 01:55:07,839
there's a gate anyway um so you know

2815
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:11,159
signage is really going to depend upon

2816
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:14,400
your your situation um you know driving

2817
01:55:11,158 --> 01:55:16,479
up and looking at this from the road I

2818
01:55:14,399 --> 01:55:18,519
could tell it was hemp from the road but

2819
01:55:16,479 --> 01:55:20,559
I was looking for hemp if I was driving

2820
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:22,880
by here and had no idea that it was here

2821
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:25,840
I would just think it was some different

2822
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:29,039
field crop so A lot's going to depend

2823
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:30,639
upon upon your location the signage to a

2824
01:55:29,039 --> 01:55:32,279
certain extent you know one of our

2825
01:55:30,639 --> 01:55:34,639
authorization holders said hey we're

2826
01:55:32,279 --> 01:55:37,158
you're putting an advertisement on this

2827
01:55:34,639 --> 01:55:39,239
and he wasn't concerned about the local

2828
01:55:37,158 --> 01:55:41,920
kids going in the field and stealing it

2829
01:55:39,238 --> 01:55:45,078
he was concerned about uh you know

2830
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:47,239
somebody else within a 5 mile radius

2831
01:55:45,078 --> 01:55:50,759
that was perhaps growing something else

2832
01:55:47,238 --> 01:55:54,158
and didn't want the pollen from his crop

2833
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:57,760
to contaminate and IIT grow and having

2834
01:55:54,158 --> 01:55:57,759
it be destroyed because of

2835
01:55:58,639 --> 01:56:07,199
that yes um is there any answer as to

2836
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:10,479
whether uh a farmer who's holding a

2837
01:56:07,198 --> 01:56:12,919
federal program benefit like through FSA

2838
01:56:10,479 --> 01:56:15,479
can grow under the New York

2839
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:18,440
permit excellent question so the

2840
01:56:15,479 --> 01:56:20,879
question was uh can somebody who is

2841
01:56:18,439 --> 01:56:22,960
participating in some of the federal

2842
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:25,319
some of the other Federal prog programs

2843
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:29,078
like conservation Reserve or what have

2844
01:56:25,319 --> 01:56:31,198
you can they uh hold our permit and

2845
01:56:29,078 --> 01:56:34,639
participate without putting into

2846
01:56:31,198 --> 01:56:36,439
Jeopardy their other payments and so

2847
01:56:34,639 --> 01:56:38,920
we've been going back and forth quite a

2848
01:56:36,439 --> 01:56:41,238
bit with our legal council on that and

2849
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:44,039
we don't necessarily have a have a clear

2850
01:56:41,238 --> 01:56:47,919
answer on that our legal council at the

2851
01:56:44,039 --> 01:56:49,319
department feels as though um with our

2852
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:51,520
research

2853
01:56:49,319 --> 01:56:54,039
authorization there shouldn't be a

2854
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:57,239
problem but that is not to say that

2855
01:56:54,039 --> 01:56:59,920
somebody at the county level in an FSA

2856
01:56:57,238 --> 01:57:02,479
or another federal office couldn't hold

2857
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:04,520
something up so I think that's something

2858
01:57:02,479 --> 01:57:08,399
we're still working on and trying to

2859
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:10,360
hammer that out and perhaps um you know

2860
01:57:08,399 --> 01:57:12,118
perhaps that's something from a policy

2861
01:57:10,359 --> 01:57:14,319
perspective that needs to be defined

2862
01:57:12,118 --> 01:57:15,960
better in the farm bill I do think the

2863
01:57:14,319 --> 01:57:19,399
bill that was signed here back a few

2864
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:21,078
weeks ago the at the state level um

2865
01:57:19,399 --> 01:57:23,118
reiterates the fact that this is an

2866
01:57:21,078 --> 01:57:25,039
agricultural commodity and I think that

2867
01:57:23,118 --> 01:57:27,399
may help a little bit with this but

2868
01:57:25,039 --> 01:57:29,519
we're sort of on on tested waters on

2869
01:57:27,399 --> 01:57:30,960
that but it's a great question and one

2870
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:34,199
that we've heard a number of times and

2871
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:34,198
are working on so thank

2872
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:41,960
you yes sir Chris uh mentioned we've got

2873
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:44,039
what 31 States now that are involved in

2874
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:47,800
research and hemp production of some

2875
01:57:44,039 --> 01:57:51,158
sort is there any uh uh group lobbying

2876
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:52,719
effort uh on a you know going on a

2877
01:57:51,158 --> 01:57:56,359
federal level to

2878
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:59,279
to look at legislation for the 2018 farm

2879
01:57:56,359 --> 01:58:03,719
bill I mean our current attorney general

2880
01:57:59,279 --> 01:58:06,479
is probably not hemp hemp uh friendly

2881
01:58:03,719 --> 01:58:07,960
friendly or sure I I think you mentioned

2882
01:58:06,479 --> 01:58:10,319
one other Workshop that he spells

2883
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:13,359
everything po

2884
01:58:10,319 --> 01:58:16,000
so but but I mean moving forward I mean

2885
01:58:13,359 --> 01:58:19,158
as as uh as these states develop this

2886
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:20,760
this Federal uh I thought that was going

2887
01:58:19,158 --> 01:58:23,078
to be one of the book The bookends you

2888
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:24,880
were talking about is is a Federal

2889
01:58:23,078 --> 01:58:30,319
Regulation yeah I mean that one is that

2890
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:32,560
one is for sure is is also in there um

2891
01:58:30,319 --> 01:58:35,000
so you know I've been asked actually was

2892
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:37,239
asked yesterday to be sure to write up

2893
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:41,520
you know my policy issues within plant

2894
01:58:37,238 --> 01:58:44,439
industry for uh the 2018 farm bill and

2895
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:46,800
and uh you know was encouraged to have

2896
01:58:44,439 --> 01:58:48,598
several that related to Industrial Hemp

2897
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:51,480
so I think we'll come at it from that

2898
01:58:48,599 --> 01:58:53,078
direction I also think that the uh

2899
01:58:51,479 --> 01:58:56,598
National Association of State

2900
01:58:53,078 --> 01:58:58,000
Departments of Agriculture uh will will

2901
01:58:56,599 --> 01:58:59,880
likely and that's basically the

2902
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:02,319
Commissioners and the state directors

2903
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:04,960
and and uh those types of folks at the

2904
01:59:02,319 --> 01:59:08,279
highest levels um will probably have

2905
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:10,039
something from a policy perspective um

2906
01:59:08,279 --> 01:59:12,118
and then you know there's the hemp

2907
01:59:10,039 --> 01:59:14,439
Industries Association and some of the

2908
01:59:12,118 --> 01:59:17,198
other like vote hemp who I think will

2909
01:59:14,439 --> 01:59:20,000
have some some pressure from you know

2910
01:59:17,198 --> 01:59:22,279
the producer and the general public side

2911
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:23,359
yor far and Farm Bureau probably will as

2912
01:59:22,279 --> 01:59:25,399
well I don't know is that in their

2913
01:59:23,359 --> 01:59:27,238
policy manual if this policy book I got

2914
01:59:25,399 --> 01:59:29,598
it put in there I got that 10 limit put

2915
01:59:27,238 --> 01:59:32,078
in there too we Lobby in Albany and in

2916
01:59:29,599 --> 01:59:33,639
um Washington and I make sure that I go

2917
01:59:32,078 --> 01:59:35,519
because some of the older people still

2918
01:59:33,639 --> 01:59:38,039
don't understand the difference between

2919
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:39,679
marijuana and hemp and still legislators

2920
01:59:38,039 --> 01:59:41,198
like when you said there about five um

2921
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:42,279
when Donna was saying that like there

2922
01:59:41,198 --> 01:59:44,519
really weren't when I brought it up

2923
01:59:42,279 --> 01:59:45,920
people were not in the last 3 years

2924
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:47,599
understanding it now it's like they're

2925
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:48,840
like oh yeah I've heard about this and

2926
01:59:47,599 --> 01:59:53,078
we're going to keep going and if you

2927
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:55,000
want to contact your county Farm Bureau

2928
01:59:53,078 --> 01:59:56,599
and help support them and let them know

2929
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,679
that people are farmers are interested

2930
01:59:56,599 --> 01:59:59,159
and if they don't know farmers are

2931
01:59:57,679 --> 02:00:01,158
interested in it they're not going to

2932
01:59:59,158 --> 02:00:02,759
want you know we Farm Bure supports what

2933
02:00:01,158 --> 02:00:04,359
Farmers want and if they're not feeling

2934
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:05,599
a need from Farmers then they're not

2935
02:00:04,359 --> 02:00:09,279
going to want to support it you know

2936
02:00:05,599 --> 02:00:11,199
that I'm just a crazy hump lady so no

2937
02:00:09,279 --> 02:00:14,519
not at all cuz I had a question we heard

2938
02:00:11,198 --> 02:00:16,719
a lot about seed protection and cloning

2939
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:18,400
protection but what about it's a

2940
02:00:16,719 --> 02:00:21,319
perennial

2941
02:00:18,399 --> 02:00:23,439
plant mm so how are we protecting it

2942
02:00:21,319 --> 02:00:26,719
from growing back perennial like if a

2943
02:00:23,439 --> 02:00:28,439
farmer cuts it down say with a Sith and

2944
02:00:26,719 --> 02:00:29,760
leaves the roots in the ground there's a

2945
02:00:28,439 --> 02:00:32,759
good chance it's going to come back on

2946
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:34,039
its own or if they let it go to seed and

2947
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:35,159
they don't collect all those seeds

2948
02:00:34,039 --> 02:00:36,319
before they hit the ground there's a

2949
02:00:35,158 --> 02:00:38,638
good chance it's just going to seed

2950
02:00:36,319 --> 02:00:40,319
itself so how how are we talking about

2951
02:00:38,639 --> 02:00:42,480
protection on that and like with apples

2952
02:00:40,319 --> 02:00:44,759
or other Farm Commodities is there like

2953
02:00:42,479 --> 02:00:47,000
a statue of limitations like an apple

2954
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:49,039
that is cross bread they have a new

2955
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:52,319
Snapdragon one I can plant it but I

2956
02:00:49,039 --> 02:00:54,198
can't sell it for 10 years and and then

2957
02:00:52,319 --> 02:00:56,279
I will be able to sell it as whatever

2958
02:00:54,198 --> 02:00:58,519
are there are there things like that for

2959
02:00:56,279 --> 02:00:59,840
this so prenal growth and so I don't

2960
02:00:58,520 --> 02:01:01,719
think we've really addressed that at

2961
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:03,078
this point in time and perhaps that's

2962
02:01:01,719 --> 02:01:04,118
something you know I know that's an

2963
02:01:03,078 --> 02:01:06,238
issue

2964
02:01:04,118 --> 02:01:08,519
because what I've learned is when it

2965
02:01:06,238 --> 02:01:11,399
goes through the combine it does shatter

2966
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:13,320
and so you do have a lot of uh receding

2967
02:01:11,399 --> 02:01:15,439
during just during the harvesting

2968
02:01:13,319 --> 02:01:17,799
process so that is probably something

2969
02:01:15,439 --> 02:01:21,759
that we've got to address at some point

2970
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:21,760
going forward yep

2971
02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:29,360
yes is there any uh um interest in in

2972
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:30,679
developing a market for the herd and

2973
02:01:29,359 --> 02:01:32,118
putting that back in the ground and

2974
02:01:30,679 --> 02:01:34,118
getting carbon credits I know there's a

2975
02:01:32,118 --> 02:01:36,639
lot of activity in India and in uh

2976
02:01:34,118 --> 02:01:39,158
Europe uh there's a whole market so we

2977
02:01:36,639 --> 02:01:41,719
actually have an authorization holder or

2978
02:01:39,158 --> 02:01:44,198
current authorization holder that has a

2979
02:01:41,719 --> 02:01:46,279
piece of that in their research plan to

2980
02:01:44,198 --> 02:01:50,559
be looking at that a little bit and I

2981
02:01:46,279 --> 02:01:51,960
think um I think uh uh Dr vians was

2982
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:53,800
talking a little bit about the

2983
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:56,719
systematics person looking at how it

2984
02:01:53,800 --> 02:01:59,360
fits into a rotation um and so there may

2985
02:01:56,719 --> 02:02:02,719
be some you know really good agronomic

2986
02:01:59,359 --> 02:02:04,559
and and carbon uh credit issues uh you

2987
02:02:02,719 --> 02:02:06,719
know that are benefits in a rotation

2988
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:11,039
even if you weren't going to the extent

2989
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:11,039
of growing it for grain or some other

2990
02:02:12,439 --> 02:02:18,960
purpose is there is there going to be a

2991
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:21,000
cap on how many research license holders

2992
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:22,679
um are going to be available for next

2993
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:26,399
year so the C

2994
02:02:22,679 --> 02:02:30,199
was removed from the law okay so what I

2995
02:02:26,399 --> 02:02:32,000
would say to you is um you know we're

2996
02:02:30,198 --> 02:02:33,319
still going to require an application

2997
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:36,279
we're still going to require the

2998
02:02:33,319 --> 02:02:38,439
application fee it's $500 for three

2999
02:02:36,279 --> 02:02:41,039
years and we're still going to as long

3000
02:02:38,439 --> 02:02:42,960
as the farm bill is in place and says

3001
02:02:41,039 --> 02:02:46,118
it's a research pilot program we're

3002
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:48,800
still going to be evaluating proposals

3003
02:02:46,118 --> 02:02:51,880
um and you know making sure that that

3004
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:53,800
the projects that we that we uh give the

3005
02:02:51,880 --> 02:02:55,840
authorizations to you know have a

3006
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:58,719
research outcome associated with them

3007
02:02:55,840 --> 02:03:01,039
but we don't anticipate a limited number

3008
02:02:58,719 --> 02:03:04,679
now you know the other piece of it I

3009
02:03:01,039 --> 02:03:08,118
also need to be protective of the fact

3010
02:03:04,679 --> 02:03:09,239
that there are many important missions

3011
02:03:08,118 --> 02:03:12,078
that my

3012
02:03:09,238 --> 02:03:14,319
division is responsible for in New York

3013
02:03:12,078 --> 02:03:17,519
state and I have a limited number of

3014
02:03:14,319 --> 02:03:20,799
people out there to do this work um and

3015
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:23,079
so we have export certification and

3016
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:25,719
Interstate certification a of of many

3017
02:03:23,078 --> 02:03:27,359
agricultural products that are very uh

3018
02:03:25,719 --> 02:03:29,078
lucrative for the state of New York for

3019
02:03:27,359 --> 02:03:32,319
our Farmers we need to make sure we

3020
02:03:29,078 --> 02:03:35,078
fulfill that uh we have uh plant pest

3021
02:03:32,319 --> 02:03:38,238
and Survey responsibilities for invasive

3022
02:03:35,078 --> 02:03:40,479
uh insects and diseases that would uh

3023
02:03:38,238 --> 02:03:42,399
you know cause damage to the agriculture

3024
02:03:40,479 --> 02:03:44,718
of New York as well as the environment

3025
02:03:42,399 --> 02:03:47,000
we have to take that very very seriously

3026
02:03:44,719 --> 02:03:50,319
so I guess where I'm going is if I got

3027
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:54,920
10,000 applications I probably

3028
02:03:50,319 --> 02:03:56,960
can't award or uh give out 10,000

3029
02:03:54,920 --> 02:03:58,840
authorizations but what we're hoping to

3030
02:03:56,960 --> 02:04:01,480
do is create an environment where we're

3031
02:03:58,840 --> 02:04:03,599
learning as much as we can going forward

3032
02:04:01,479 --> 02:04:06,718
for the time when maybe the industrial

3033
02:04:03,599 --> 02:04:09,400
hemp farming act sails through and if

3034
02:04:06,719 --> 02:04:13,000
it's no longer a regulated substance

3035
02:04:09,399 --> 02:04:14,519
then our role is diminished a great deal

3036
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:16,599
I would say from a regulatory

3037
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:18,559
perspective the other part that I'll

3038
02:04:16,599 --> 02:04:21,319
just throw out there is is I think

3039
02:04:18,559 --> 02:04:24,239
anybody who's involved in this for the

3040
02:04:21,319 --> 02:04:26,238
time being with it being federally

3041
02:04:24,238 --> 02:04:28,959
regulated as well as regulated at the

3042
02:04:26,238 --> 02:04:30,479
state level um you have to understand

3043
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:32,158
what it is that you're growing you need

3044
02:04:30,479 --> 02:04:35,718
to know your seed source you need to

3045
02:04:32,158 --> 02:04:38,638
know that it's does meet the 3%

3046
02:04:35,719 --> 02:04:41,559
THC um and you need to do everything you

3047
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:42,880
know in your power to protect yourself

3048
02:04:41,559 --> 02:04:45,239
as well as

3049
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:47,800
protect um all the great work that's

3050
02:04:45,238 --> 02:04:50,238
been done to bring this from something

3051
02:04:47,800 --> 02:04:52,279
that everybody was scared to death of

3052
02:04:50,238 --> 02:04:54,479
two years ago to something where there's

3053
02:04:52,279 --> 02:04:57,359
you know 50 or 100 people under a tent

3054
02:04:54,479 --> 02:04:59,519
at itha talking about it so Donnie you

3055
02:04:57,359 --> 02:05:01,639
want to make a comment on

3056
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:03,639
that I know we're running long but I

3057
02:05:01,639 --> 02:05:05,559
just want to make a couple of quick

3058
02:05:03,639 --> 02:05:07,078
summary comments first I want to thank

3059
02:05:05,559 --> 02:05:09,480
Cornell for putting this together this

3060
02:05:07,078 --> 02:05:11,238
is really informative um just wanted you

3061
02:05:09,479 --> 02:05:12,879
to know that she feel really good about

3062
02:05:11,238 --> 02:05:14,558
being in New York state right now around

3063
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:16,679
this compared to other states who may be

3064
02:05:14,559 --> 02:05:19,920
permitting this I mean all of the gears

3065
02:05:16,679 --> 02:05:21,880
are in motion uh as hard as it is to

3066
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:23,520
believe I have to pinch myself the

3067
02:05:21,880 --> 02:05:26,960
governor just put $10 million down on

3068
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:29,520
the table for a processor grants of

3069
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:33,279
$250,000 and we have a One-Stop shop and

3070
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:35,880
a help line and and many many folks good

3071
02:05:33,279 --> 02:05:38,359
folks like Chris Lo and others uh in aam

3072
02:05:35,880 --> 02:05:40,440
markets who are very committed to this

3073
02:05:38,359 --> 02:05:42,598
what I'm hoping to see happen and what

3074
02:05:40,439 --> 02:05:44,839
one I wanted to leave you with from my

3075
02:05:42,599 --> 02:05:46,279
end is we're hoping that hubs will be

3076
02:05:44,840 --> 02:05:47,840
developing we're seeing a food and

3077
02:05:46,279 --> 02:05:50,238
beverage Hub starting to develop in

3078
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:51,960
central New York we're seeing a CBD

3079
02:05:50,238 --> 02:05:53,919
pharmaceutical Hub starting to develop

3080
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:56,198
in the Southern Tier Hudson Valley is

3081
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:58,679
also doing some food and beverage and

3082
02:05:56,198 --> 02:06:00,759
and some other and some CBD but it would

3083
02:05:58,679 --> 02:06:03,319
be helpful if the Farm Bureau and farm

3084
02:06:00,760 --> 02:06:04,559
collectives could get more organized so

3085
02:06:03,319 --> 02:06:06,639
that we're not sort of tripping over

3086
02:06:04,559 --> 02:06:08,279
each other that you've got 10 Farms all

3087
02:06:06,639 --> 02:06:11,078
growing the same thing with a partner

3088
02:06:08,279 --> 02:06:13,479
farmer I mean a partner processor with a

3089
02:06:11,078 --> 02:06:16,198
market in line so we're not sort of in

3090
02:06:13,479 --> 02:06:18,479
the wild west here um the governor has

3091
02:06:16,198 --> 02:06:20,000
um directed all ire State development

3092
02:06:18,479 --> 02:06:23,238
all the regional Economic Development

3093
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:24,880
councils to priority I this so in

3094
02:06:23,238 --> 02:06:27,000
central New York Finger Lakes and

3095
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:28,880
Southern Tier where there's a lot of

3096
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:31,198
money from the upstate revitalization

3097
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:32,960
initiative they're looking for projects

3098
02:06:31,198 --> 02:06:35,839
and they want to be able to provide some

3099
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:37,760
funding to to help this so we're lucky

3100
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:39,078
in this regard so thank you thank you

3101
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:42,800
everybody for going along with this

3102
02:06:39,078 --> 02:06:44,960
crazy uh Chris I have a question do you

3103
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:46,800
make a list of the farmers available to

3104
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:49,679
people who want to process so that we

3105
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:51,880
know where to go get material so we have

3106
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:56,760
not done that at this point in time and

3107
02:06:51,880 --> 02:06:59,319
so we're working through some uh some uh

3108
02:06:56,760 --> 02:07:01,119
foil issues on that and just trying to

3109
02:06:59,319 --> 02:07:03,880
understand exactly what we can and can't

3110
02:07:01,118 --> 02:07:05,598
release and so we probably will have the

3111
02:07:03,880 --> 02:07:07,599
answers to those questions in the next

3112
02:07:05,599 --> 02:07:10,520
couple of weeks because we've been

3113
02:07:07,599 --> 02:07:12,520
asked but there's I mean if if

3114
02:07:10,520 --> 02:07:14,559
processors are really

3115
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:17,280
interested extension puts out

3116
02:07:14,559 --> 02:07:19,320
newsletters to all Farmers putting add

3117
02:07:17,279 --> 02:07:21,039
newsletters that you're looking for feed

3118
02:07:19,319 --> 02:07:23,679
or you're looking for fiber what you're

3119
02:07:21,039 --> 02:07:27,000
looking for for and they'll come to you

3120
02:07:23,679 --> 02:07:29,118
right and then no foil needed right

3121
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:31,520
right so if you were to get a farm to

3122
02:07:29,118 --> 02:07:33,319
give you seed it has to be sterilized at

3123
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:36,199
the fmer level or are you allowed to

3124
02:07:33,319 --> 02:07:38,719
sterilize so as a processor as a

3125
02:07:36,198 --> 02:07:41,078
processor you could sterilize it but the

3126
02:07:38,719 --> 02:07:43,319
other thing is is that from what I've

3127
02:07:41,078 --> 02:07:45,319
been told by some of the uh

3128
02:07:43,319 --> 02:07:47,840
authorization holders is one of the

3129
02:07:45,319 --> 02:07:50,719
things that they want is to be able to

3130
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:52,039
use the unsterilized seed and some in

3131
02:07:50,719 --> 02:07:53,679
some product

3132
02:07:52,039 --> 02:07:56,238
and that there are some attributes of

3133
02:07:53,679 --> 02:07:58,239
the seed you know before it's roasted or

3134
02:07:56,238 --> 02:08:01,198
before it's denatured in some other way

3135
02:07:58,238 --> 02:08:03,279
that are beneficial and so uh what I

3136
02:08:01,198 --> 02:08:05,359
would say as long as it's not moving

3137
02:08:03,279 --> 02:08:08,719
beyond the borders of the state where we

3138
02:08:05,359 --> 02:08:12,479
can't really have any real impact on you

3139
02:08:08,719 --> 02:08:14,559
know changing that policy today um you

3140
02:08:12,479 --> 02:08:18,000
know work with work with us to figure

3141
02:08:14,559 --> 02:08:18,000
out how to get it to where it needs to

3142
02:08:18,520 --> 02:08:27,320
go yes sir clarify we navigate the gray

3143
02:08:23,399 --> 02:08:29,960
area um can you get an application to

3144
02:08:27,319 --> 02:08:33,799
grow for CBD only in New York state

3145
02:08:29,960 --> 02:08:37,239
right now submit one okay and as far as

3146
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:38,159
the processes go our extractions part of

3147
02:08:37,238 --> 02:08:40,799
that

3148
02:08:38,158 --> 02:08:43,799
dialogue absolutely so what what's going

3149
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:46,039
to happen um on CBD a little bit more

3150
02:08:43,800 --> 02:08:47,440
detail on that I guess I I glossed over

3151
02:08:46,039 --> 02:08:49,319
it a little bit so a little bit more

3152
02:08:47,439 --> 02:08:53,000
detail on that is is that the Department

3153
02:08:49,319 --> 02:08:56,799
of Health has asked us to put several

3154
02:08:53,000 --> 02:09:00,800
CBD related questions on the application

3155
02:08:56,800 --> 02:09:03,159
so that we can flag projects that need

3156
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:06,000
to have somebody with a health

3157
02:09:03,158 --> 02:09:11,198
nutritional or medical background help

3158
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:12,840
us to review and so um those are

3159
02:09:11,198 --> 02:09:15,039
probably going to go into a separate

3160
02:09:12,840 --> 02:09:17,440
pile and we will have a group of folks

3161
02:09:15,039 --> 02:09:19,158
from our department as well as from

3162
02:09:17,439 --> 02:09:21,558
Department of Health who will be looking

3163
02:09:19,158 --> 02:09:23,759
at those and trying to navigate those go

3164
02:09:21,559 --> 02:09:25,199
through the system and understand

3165
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:27,880
exactly what it is that you're wanting

3166
02:09:25,198 --> 02:09:29,759
to do and what we're contemplating and

3167
02:09:27,880 --> 02:09:33,199
again this is early on and it's an

3168
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:35,639
important detail that you ask about um

3169
02:09:33,198 --> 02:09:37,638
we'll probably we have a what's called a

3170
02:09:35,639 --> 02:09:39,880
research partner agreement so the way

3171
02:09:37,639 --> 02:09:41,078
the process works right now is you

3172
02:09:39,880 --> 02:09:44,078
submit an

3173
02:09:41,078 --> 02:09:47,118
application uh we act upon it we say we

3174
02:09:44,078 --> 02:09:49,960
like your project and then the next step

3175
02:09:47,118 --> 02:09:53,238
is we send you our research partner

3176
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:55,118
agreement which is basically outlining

3177
02:09:53,238 --> 02:09:57,158
what your responsibilities as our

3178
02:09:55,118 --> 02:09:58,799
research partner at the with the State

3179
02:09:57,158 --> 02:10:00,759
Department of Agriculture what your

3180
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:03,239
responsibilities are what our

3181
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:06,239
responsibilities are and so in that

3182
02:10:03,238 --> 02:10:08,678
agreement on the CBD end of things there

3183
02:10:06,238 --> 02:10:11,839
probably will be some specific Clauses

3184
02:10:08,679 --> 02:10:14,480
that are inserted in there um that are

3185
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:17,639
again trying to build you a safe harbor

3186
02:10:14,479 --> 02:10:20,000
within what we currently know about CBD

3187
02:10:17,639 --> 02:10:22,800
and it's every state is struggling with

3188
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:25,078
the CBD thing because there's a lack of

3189
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:27,480
clarity I can tell you one more thing

3190
02:10:25,078 --> 02:10:30,439
that that out in Oregon we struggle with

3191
02:10:27,479 --> 02:10:32,439
in Oregon had a th000 Acres planted last

3192
02:10:30,439 --> 02:10:36,118
year and they have 3,000 Acres planted

3193
02:10:32,439 --> 02:10:38,879
this year much of it for CBD M there is

3194
02:10:36,118 --> 02:10:42,319
not enough of infrastructure to do

3195
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:44,840
anything with this material is so limit

3196
02:10:42,319 --> 02:10:47,679
limited on extracting facilities food

3197
02:10:44,840 --> 02:10:50,039
grade approved facilities you get old as

3198
02:10:47,679 --> 02:10:51,880
flour and it's going out of state to get

3199
02:10:50,039 --> 02:10:54,198
extracted because it has

3200
02:10:51,880 --> 02:10:55,760
mhm yeah and there's definitely some

3201
02:10:54,198 --> 02:10:58,118
challenges with that you know we were in

3202
02:10:55,760 --> 02:11:00,239
a processing plant in Kentucky you know

3203
02:10:58,118 --> 02:11:02,759
one part of it was for for food grade

3204
02:11:00,238 --> 02:11:05,959
work the other part was was fiber and

3205
02:11:02,760 --> 02:11:08,199
you know Structural Materials and uh you

3206
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:10,840
know I think they said that's one of the

3207
02:11:08,198 --> 02:11:13,839
biggest plants in the country and it

3208
02:11:10,840 --> 02:11:15,760
wasn't very big so you know that's as I

3209
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:17,800
said you know the bookends the seed and

3210
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:22,079
the processing the processing piece is

3211
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:22,079
vitally important going forward

3212
02:11:24,238 --> 02:11:29,118
um several people have mentioned grower

3213
02:11:27,039 --> 02:11:31,760
co-ops and collectives and things like

3214
02:11:29,118 --> 02:11:34,639
that and Cornell does have a a resource

3215
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:37,400
in Bobby Severson in the Dyson school

3216
02:11:34,639 --> 02:11:39,599
that provides guidance in terms of uh

3217
02:11:37,399 --> 02:11:43,598
Co-op formation so there is that

3218
02:11:39,599 --> 02:11:46,319
resource if you would like to pursue

3219
02:11:43,599 --> 02:11:49,239
it thank you that's very

3220
02:11:46,319 --> 02:11:50,840
helpful so Chris maybe we should wrap up

3221
02:11:49,238 --> 02:11:51,959
and let folks talk to everyone

3222
02:11:50,840 --> 02:11:54,039
