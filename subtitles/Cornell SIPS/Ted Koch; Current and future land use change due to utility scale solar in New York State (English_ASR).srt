1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:11,080
University all right so thanks Peter for

3
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:13,160
that great introduction my name is Ted

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,199
kotch uh and for the past year or so

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,800
Peter and I have been working on trying

6
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,679
to understand the land use implications

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,320
of solar New York solar in New York

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:25,118
State uh what it's looked like up to

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,960
this point and even try to extend some

10
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:30,719
modeling into the future to see uh how

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,679
this uh new demand for renewable energy

12
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:36,600
is going to shape our

13
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,399
landscape uh so when we embarked on this

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,960
analysis we had a few simple questions

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,719
that you'll soon see were a little bit

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,079
more complex to get to the bottom of

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,239
than we initially expected um but our

18
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:49,799
overall goals were to identify where

19
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:52,159
solar is being developed uh across New

20
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:54,119
York State uh analyze the trends in

21
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,479
what's happening in terms of land use

22
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:59,439
for these sites so what were they before

23
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,919
they became solar farms uh and then

24
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,479
looking for into the future try to

25
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,478
quantify how much solar we're actually

26
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,319
going to need uh all the way across the

27
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,679
state in order to meet certain renewable

28
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:13,679
energy goals that are continuously

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,759
evolving and then you know if we get

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,799
good results from that what will the

31
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,920
land use implications be of that

32
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:24,240
quantity of solar so the overarching

33
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,478
context of this is the clcpa uh this is

34
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,519
a ambitious piece of climate legislation

35
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:32,239
put forth by New York State and uh it

36
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:35,078
has a slew of goals but the ones that

37
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:38,919
we're looking at are its goal to become

38
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:41,839
entirely uh carbon neutral or uh

39
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,320
decarbonized energy grid by 2040 so in

40
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,079
other words uh not producing electricity

41
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:49,319
through fossil fuel combustion um it

42
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:51,879
also mandates the decarbonization of

43
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:54,158
many key sectors that are currently

44
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:56,399
powered by fossil fuel so that's uh

45
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,960
transportation and space heating mainly

46
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,200
and then also uh it has the ultimate

47
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,839
goal of getting to complete carbon

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,960
neutrality by 2050 and so that means

49
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,560
that uh even if we are generating some

50
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,118
carbon emissions those emissions are

51
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,360
being captured within the state by our

52
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:14,878
forests and

53
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,640
soils uh so along with this sweeping

54
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,799
piece of climate legislation uh they

55
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:22,159
also put out quite a bit of analysis

56
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:26,439
that they um commissioned uh and this

57
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:28,439
graph here shows the uh expected energy

58
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:31,800
generation and the sources of that

59
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:35,120
generation from now until that future

60
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,000
Target of 2050 so each of these uh

61
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,920
colored bars represents an energy source

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,639
and the two key takeaways to take from

63
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,799
this are that a we are going to be

64
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:48,039
consuming vastly more electricity in the

65
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,360
future than we are currently uh so that

66
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:51,639
means that not only do we have to

67
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,319
replace these fossil fuel energy sources

68
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:56,878
we also have to add additional capacity

69
00:02:55,318 --> 00:03:00,079
to accommodate things that are coming

70
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,759
online such as uh electric cars uh

71
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,680
electric space heating all these things

72
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,759
that currently take uh carbon emitting

73
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,239
fossil fuels that are ultimately going

74
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:13,280
to be powered by renewable

75
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:16,840
electricity and the second thing is

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,640
this uh large orange section in the

77
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,400
middle of each bar that's starting out

78
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:24,359
pretty small and getting very large by

79
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,560
2050 that represents solar so not only

80
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,840
is solar going to be doing a lot of

81
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,959
heavy lifting it is going to be the

82
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,598
dominant source of energy uh in in the

83
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:36,120
future uh so wind is pretty substantial

84
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:37,919
but um solar will be at least that's the

85
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,438
anticipation of New York State the

86
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:43,119
dominant source of

87
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:44,639
energy so before I get into our analysis

88
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,239
I just want to cover some jargon so that

89
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,878
we all know what I'm talking about um

90
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:52,319
first off capacity this is just kind of

91
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:54,000
the sticker value that people put on a

92
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:57,679
power generation Source in this case

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,759
solar uh this means uh the maximum

94
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,439
output of a solar site under ideal

95
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:05,479
conditions uh and this does not take

96
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:08,039
into account Regional or weather

97
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:11,238
anomalies um such as clouds or nighttime

98
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:12,598
or dust or Seasons uh this is just kind

99
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,680
of a blanket statement that can be

100
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:18,759
applied to a solar system in Arizona and

101
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,280
the same size system in New York uh if

102
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,280
we want to start to understand a little

103
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,279
bit about how a system is actually

104
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:25,319
performing uh we want to use capacity

105
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:28,879
factor and that just kind of

106
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:30,918
incorporates Real World um performances

107
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,759
of the site

108
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:34,799
uh finally uh I'll be talking about two

109
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,520
main Solar Technologies today single AIS

110
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,240
tracking uh these are sites that have

111
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,959
mechanical linkages and Motors that

112
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,519
allow them to follow the sun on one axis

113
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:46,599
so either east to west uh following it

114
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:49,120
throughout the day or uh north to south

115
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:52,759
but technically up and down um to follow

116
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,600
the sun um as it moves higher and lower

117
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,319
in the sky and finally fixed axes these

118
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,400
are sites that just don't move at all uh

119
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:00,279
they're at a single angle and they'll

120
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,079
remain

121
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:07,079
thatting so I don't expect you to read

122
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:10,159
every uh node in our analysis flowchart

123
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:12,439
but broadly um our analysis consisted of

124
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,800
synthesizing existing data creating a

125
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:17,279
few new data sets to fill in uh holes

126
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,680
where there was uh uncertainty in the

127
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:24,719
existing data modeling out um future

128
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:28,360
scenarios and um evaluating what those

129
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,360
could look like under different

130
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,199
conditions okay

131
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,479
so when trying to understand any sort of

132
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,120
system starting with the most easily

133
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:41,120
accessible data is a generally a good

134
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:44,399
start step um and in this case uh New

135
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,160
York state has a great treasure TR of

136
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,239
data that's publicly available where

137
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,800
they track uh most commercial siiz solar

138
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:55,600
sites uh with data including their

139
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:58,439
capacity um their output and performance

140
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,600
uh and their approximate location so

141
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:03,560
just by taking all this compiling it

142
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,759
together and setting a trend over time

143
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:09,918
we are able to see uh how solar has been

144
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:12,240
growing and what specific Trends are

145
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,478
starting to form so this graph here on

146
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,360
the right on the horizontal axis we have

147
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:22,120
years and on the vertical axis we have

148
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,919
um capacity in megawatts um so we can

149
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,240
see uh oh sorry the dotted lines

150
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:29,240
represent sites that are currently

151
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,000
incomplete and the um solid lines

152
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,918
represent sites that are done and are

153
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,918
not performing um red represents uh

154
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:38,318
fixed access sites and blue represents

155
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:42,719
single aess just in case you can't see

156
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,560
the Legend um so in the beginning uh

157
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,520
around 2016 when solar was first

158
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,319
starting to take off there's almost zero

159
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:52,918
single axis track sites um and then now

160
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,800
we can see in the developing sites that

161
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:58,240
those sit uh those single AIS track

162
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,160
technology is rapidly taking off and

163
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,800
even looks like it might start to out

164
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,520
perform fixed access sites uh in the

165
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,400
near future we can also see various

166
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,478
details on how long it takes to develop

167
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:11,439
sites um and what the rate of capacity

168
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:14,560
growth

169
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,279
is but as I said in the beginning our

170
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,360
main goal is to understand land use

171
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:22,038
implications of this of solar and we

172
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,919
can't get to the bottom of that with an

173
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:26,680
approximate Point location on a map so

174
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:29,240
we took it a little bit further and we

175
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,759
um found these sites in aerial imagery

176
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,960
and we traced their uh fence lines

177
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,919
manually to create a polygon data set of

178
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:42,598
about 150 sites that were randomly

179
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:44,758
selected um a key uh piece of our

180
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:47,478
analysis is that we're looking at the

181
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:50,560
fenced area of these sites so when you

182
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:53,959
look at a solar site uh the array which

183
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,598
is these uh vertical black lines here

184
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:59,239
surrounded by the blue boundary that's

185
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:01,598
going to be the most impactful part of

186
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,400
the site uh you know obviously there's

187
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:04,759
going to be a lot more shade underneath

188
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,120
that there might be some compaction from

189
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:09,319
the construction of the site um there's

190
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,439
certainly going to be dry and wet areas

191
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:14,280
because they're blocking rain and

192
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:16,079
concentrating it in specific locations

193
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:17,758
um but if you're a farmer if you're a

194
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,598
land developer you're going to look at a

195
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,800
site and say all right the only uh I'm

196
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:24,878
not going to be able to access the

197
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,439
inside of that fence the way I usually

198
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,199
would so for our intents and purposes

199
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:31,800
that fence line is the maximum area that

200
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,599
is going to be taken out of commission

201
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,719
for regular use by a solar site and this

202
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,879
is to my knowledge the first study that

203
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,479
actually looked at this specific

204
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:45,039
area we were also curious about uh

205
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,040
larger sites so these are sites that are

206
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,799
over 25 megawatts in capacity um I think

207
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:51,879
the nearest one that's kind of in this

208
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:53,679
scale is going in the Yellow Barn

209
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:56,399
project a few of you might be familiar

210
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:58,239
with that locally um and these are sites

211
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,200
that are hundreds if not thousands of

212
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,759
Acres I think mainly in the hundreds but

213
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,320
they they're very large so since none of

214
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,480
these sites have been completed at this

215
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:11,360
point uh we had to rely on site planning

216
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,879
documents so we Geor referenced those

217
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:19,120
blew blew them up to scale and then Trac

218
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:19,120
them as if it was a site on aerial

219
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,680
imagery and from this we were able to

220
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:27,159
understand a key parameter of solar

221
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:30,039
sites and that is power density so what

222
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:32,319
is power density that is a of how much

223
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:35,159
energy or how much power they are

224
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,040
producing for a given area and that's

225
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:38,919
important not just for developers who

226
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,759
are trying to get the most output they

227
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:43,879
can from the smallest area possible

228
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,799
because you have to pay rent on land um

229
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:47,320
but that's also important for those of

230
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:49,559
us who use land for things that aren't

231
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,000
solar Farms so um people who are

232
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:53,399
studying habitat um people who are

233
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,839
farming you know there's a lot of

234
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:58,360
reasons you want to get as much area uh

235
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,399
as much energy out of a small area and

236
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,639
so that is a trend that we've generally

237
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:07,039
been seeing uh more panels on smaller

238
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:09,240
Footprints uh and then digging into that

239
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,439
relationship with site type we're able

240
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,919
to see that surprisingly these larger

241
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,079
sites these 25 megawatt overs sites uh

242
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:20,278
they are performing the poorest um in

243
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:24,000
other words they are not able to produce

244
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:26,439
as much energy uh per given area uh and

245
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,600
then single AIS track sites somewhat

246
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,839
less surprisingly are also not quite as

247
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,680
good as fix ACC sites because they have

248
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,880
to be spread out a little bit more to

249
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:38,559
allow tilting to not shade the panels in

250
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:38,559
front or behind

251
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:45,919
them uh so this this plot shows power

252
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,799
density in megawatts per hectare um and

253
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:50,319
the three Technologies are on the

254
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:50,319
horizontal

255
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:56,639
axis uh so we had 150 sites we had their

256
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,240
fence boundaries that would have been

257
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,720
enough to start looking at what types of

258
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,360
land were underneath these sites uh but

259
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,240
really we wanted to get the most

260
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,079
comprehensive picture of where solar is

261
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,919
going in New York state as possible and

262
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:11,719
so to do that instead of meticulously

263
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:15,838
manually digitizing every site I could

264
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:20,040
find we got a computer to do it um we

265
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:22,839
took that 150 polygon data set and uh

266
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:24,919
aerial imagery from the USDA trained a

267
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:27,959
computer model to detect sites from that

268
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:29,879
imagery and then ran it on all of the

269
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:32,278
imagery in New York state for

270
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:33,439
2022 and the results of that are we

271
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:38,000
found about

272
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:40,920
509 sites um which occupy about 3,700

273
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,799
hectares of land and based on our power

274
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:46,799
density estimates we predict that they

275
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:49,359
were outputting at that point about 2300

276
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,799
megawatts of

277
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,480
power uh and as far as we know this is

278
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:55,799
the most comprehensive data set of where

279
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,519
solar is in New York there are several

280
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:01,000
different state and federal data sets as

281
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:03,440
well um but we found a lot of them are

282
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,200
uh pretty incomplete and only find about

283
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,200
half of the

284
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:12,639
sites so with this data set that we hope

285
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:15,278
is as comprehensive as possible we were

286
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,278
able to uh perform some land cover

287
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:19,399
analysis in other words looking at what

288
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,519
the land was before it became a solar

289
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:24,639
site and to do this we overlaid it

290
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,240
overlaid our polygons with uh a crop a

291
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,720
data set called the crop data layer

292
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,320
which is produced by the USDA and it

293
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,720
does a good job of trying to estimate

294
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:39,480
what each uh square foot or in this case

295
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:41,639
30 square meter 30 meter on a side cell

296
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,879
of area in New York state was whether

297
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:48,959
that's forest or pasture or grassland or

298
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:51,559
corn um and as you can see uh in this

299
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:54,039
golden bar here annual row crops were

300
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:57,399
the dominant previous land cover of all

301
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:59,679
these solar sites uh in fact that about

302
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:02,720
864

303
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:05,078
of annual R crop land was occupied by

304
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,480
these sites that we found uh that's

305
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:10,278
followed by hay pasture unfortunately

306
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:14,600
Forest uh and then some alphaalpha so

307
00:13:10,278 --> 00:13:14,600
more high intensity um forage

308
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,600
crops it became more uh apparent to us

309
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:26,120
that there are some inaccuracies in the

310
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,600
crop data layer um unsurprisingly it's

311
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,919
difficult to tell what type of crop is

312
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,519
in any given area just from satellite

313
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:37,639
imagery uh and so we particularly found

314
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:41,320
that there's a lot of inaccuracy in this

315
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:43,079
uh pasture category and looking a little

316
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:47,360
bit into the literature we found a

317
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:49,919
report um that checked the discrepancies

318
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,440
between the census of a data that New

319
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,759
York and the federal government collects

320
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:58,120
every five years and this crop data

321
00:13:54,759 --> 00:14:00,600
layer uh data set and they found that

322
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,639
there's approximately 650,000 hectares

323
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,320
of land in New York state that is

324
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,720
classified as active agricultural land

325
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,480
by the CDL but is actually what we're

326
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,920
calling former agricultural land um and

327
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,240
this is land that uh is probably

328
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,439
something you're all familiar with just

329
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,759
grassy Fields maybe somebody mows them

330
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,199
once or twice a year to keep them from

331
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:23,600
turning into forests But ultimately uh

332
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:26,319
they are not being used for commercial

333
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,519
agriculture which is our main focus and

334
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,600
what we're looking

335
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:33,278
at and so by by taking the ratios that

336
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,639
the study found uh on a crop by crop

337
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:39,838
basis figuring out that about 30% of

338
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,799
land uh considered pasture by the CDL is

339
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:46,880
actually former agricultural land we're

340
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:50,399
able to get to this uh 16% or 607

341
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:51,919
hectare figure uh long story short

342
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,759
essentially a lot of the land that we

343
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:58,159
are finding out or appears to be uh

344
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,079
active agricultural land May in fact

345
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,919
just be Gra fields and that kind of

346
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:05,198
makes sense if you're thinking about it

347
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:07,240
um farmers who have active agricultural

348
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:11,240
land that they're tilling or grazing or

349
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:13,879
uh paying are more likely to try to get

350
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,519
people to develop solar on the less

351
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,799
productive land that they're not

352
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,799
actually

353
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,759
using so uh there's a more to a given

354
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,519
area than just uh what it's being used

355
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:32,039
for so we also wanted to see uh what

356
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:35,078
types of uh soils are being um covered

357
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:37,240
by solar uh because you know just

358
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:40,039
because a piece of land isn't being used

359
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,240
for agricultural uses today uh doesn't

360
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:45,039
mean it couldn't be tomorrow and so a

361
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,000
good indicator of whether land could

362
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:49,559
potentially be used for agriculture is

363
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,519
its soil quality uh and for this we used

364
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:57,278
a data set um called the mineral soil

365
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:59,159
groups and this is uh a soil ranking

366
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:03,639
system developed by New York State

367
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:06,318
primarily for tax reasons um however

368
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:07,440
it's useful in the case of solar because

369
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:10,799
um there

370
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,319
are uh restrictions on what types of

371
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:15,039
high quality soils can be used for solar

372
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:17,198
sites and so for example if you're a

373
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:19,639
developer you're coming into a site and

374
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:22,078
you want to put a solar facility there

375
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:24,879
if it's over 50% highquality

376
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,439
agriculturally suitable soil there are

377
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,439
going to be penalties that you have to

378
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,920
pay for converting that out of

379
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,920
agricultural

380
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,679
production uh we found that uh the

381
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:39,399
dominant soil group that is being

382
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:40,958
covered by solar is uh mineral solar

383
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,600
group five which is right in the middle

384
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:46,359
of the scale from 1 to 10 with one being

385
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:49,600
the best and uh 10 being the worst but

386
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,959
there is about 44% of all land under

387
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,399
solar that is in this highquality

388
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:56,679
mineral soil groups one through four uh

389
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,919
range um and so that's not just an

390
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:00,599
indicator that we're losing a lot of

391
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:02,439
good soil to these solar sites but also

392
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,078
that these incentives that are in place

393
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,439
to try to dissuade developers from using

394
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:09,720
uh highquality soils they're not quite

395
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:11,959
working as well as we would hope they

396
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,880
would

397
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:17,558
be um so trying to get a little bit

398
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,319
Inside the Mind of the developers uh

399
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:21,599
because this is going to be what

400
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:25,159
ultimately informs where we expect solar

401
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:27,318
to go uh is the choices of developers we

402
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,160
started looking at uh the distance to

403
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:31,399
transmission lines it can be to a

404
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,440
million dollars a mile to run a grid

405
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,080
interconnect from a solar site to a

406
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,279
transmission line and so obviously

407
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:41,519
that's a lot of incentive for solar to

408
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:43,599
be built very close to those power lines

409
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,558
and we wanted to take a closer look and

410
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:49,959
we found that that is indeed the case um

411
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:52,200
just about every site uh was within uh

412
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,679
like five kilometers of a solar site but

413
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,480
there are a few um that ventured a

414
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,840
little bit further up to like 15

415
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,640
kilometers um so this will come back

416
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,240
later on in the presentation but

417
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,880
distance to transmission lines is an

418
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:10,279
incredibly strong predictor of where

419
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:13,080
solar is ultimately likely to

420
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:16,798
go we also took a look at slope of these

421
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:19,038
sites we found that uh in terms of uh

422
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,639
how steep developers are willing to

423
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:22,798
build on they're a little bit more

424
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,480
flexible than some of these other uh

425
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,519
site

426
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,440
characteristics so before I jump into

427
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:29,918
the sort of future part of this analysis

428
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,320
are there any questions so far I know

429
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:36,400
I'm unloading a lot of information on

430
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:39,678
everybody Lou I was just curious like if

431
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,280
you have a line this means that you can

432
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,080
hope to that line right there or there

433
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:50,158
has to be some sort of kind of a

434
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:52,558
conversion plant yeah so um if there is

435
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:55,000
capacity uh and if they the solar site

436
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,319
is large enough they will uh create a

437
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,240
substation to boost the voltage up to

438
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:59,439
what it's necessary for the

439
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,880
interconnection

440
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,440
uh an important point though is also we

441
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,039
did not model if these transmission

442
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,679
lines have capacity for solar so you

443
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:09,640
know sometimes they are in fact full

444
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,759
especially if they're these transmission

445
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:17,000
lines funneling hydroelectricity from

446
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:19,038
Canada down state um but yeah typically

447
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,200
uh the best location is next to a

448
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,079
substation because that's what's going

449
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:26,720
to get the power up to the necessary

450
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:28,038
voltages um but it seems like if the

451
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,440
site can just be really close to a

452
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:33,480
transmission line the developers will

453
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,480
build the infrastructure

454
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:37,960
needed oh yeah Hannah have some

455
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:40,678
interesting information at the beginning

456
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:43,558
that talked about how the single access

457
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:46,559
track was like took longer to finish and

458
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:48,480
was also less um efficient are there any

459
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,918
cases that you would want to use those

460
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,279
or like why have people been building

461
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,679
yeah so U maybe I didn't do the best job

462
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:58,440
of explaining the differences in power

463
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,400
and energy Dynamics so uh single AIS

464
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,440
track sites because they have to be

465
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,600
spread out a little bit more the rows of

466
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:08,159
panels themselves in order to avoid

467
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:10,279
shading uh they typically have what's a

468
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,440
lower power density um and so this means

469
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:14,158
that you know if you took the sticker

470
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,159
rating of every single panel in the site

471
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,760
and added it up divided it by the Acres

472
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:20,799
that would be lower however because

473
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:23,440
they're tilting to follow the sun they

474
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:25,279
actually do capture more energy

475
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,519
throughout the day than a fixed access

476
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:31,558
site and so when you spread that out

477
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:34,440
over a year their yearly energy output

478
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:35,359
is marginally greater than a fixed axis

479
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,279
say would

480
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:41,918
be uh any other questions oh

481
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:44,678
yeah so about the printed power density

482
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,400
also you mentioned that is for example

483
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:49,759
the solar panel orientation east and

484
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,600
west or sometimes the North and South in

485
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:54,798
that in that case the UN mention is the

486
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:58,599
same as of our density or beneficial to

487
00:20:54,798 --> 00:21:00,759
tracking or the fixed case is the same

488
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:03,798
if could we just add the more parameters

489
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:07,000
of our solar panel the orientation is

490
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:10,359
the same are you asking if uh single AIS

491
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,240
sites that go uh east to west in their

492
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:16,199
tracking that sort of orientation comes

493
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,759
to the North and the South in that case

494
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,200
the what you mentioned before is the

495
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:23,319
same situation or different uh we didn't

496
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:26,400
look at within single AIS tracking sites

497
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:28,879
if the power production is the same in

498
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,320
the east west orientation as the North

499
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:36,039
South orientation um I think just about

500
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:38,119
every site that we looked at does track

501
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:40,599
um you know they run north to south and

502
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:42,439
they track east to west um so that's not

503
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:44,038
information I could speak

504
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,080
on

505
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:51,359
like yeah

506
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:52,839
yeah okay oh uh another question um I

507
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,719
was wondering could you go back real

508
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:59,759
quick to the the density side of the

509
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:02,038
power density uh sorry it's the remote's

510
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:02,038
a little

511
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:09,240
slow bad

512
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:12,520
question you mentioned that right the

513
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:15,278
yeah the the the fixed the fixed axis

514
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:17,839
yeah having now are these significantly

515
00:22:15,278 --> 00:22:19,679
different these like sat and that that

516
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:21,319
oh yes yeah they are they are okay so I

517
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,278
just don't understand yeah the I guess

518
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:27,558
the the magnitude of a power density or

519
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:29,759
yeah so the axis is uh scaled pretty

520
00:22:27,558 --> 00:22:31,918
narrowly so um um they are

521
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:35,038
not substantially different but they are

522
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:39,080
significantly different got um so yeah

523
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:41,519
the single axis uh sorry the large sites

524
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:42,960
they're like quite a bit poorer

525
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:44,960
performing than the other two groups and

526
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,600
then the single axis and the fix AIS

527
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,840
small sites

528
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:51,278
are closer yes

529
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:54,079
Peter I mean there's a lot of overlap

530
00:22:51,278 --> 00:22:57,000
between the two there that's another

531
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,960
something remaining to be explored is is

532
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,319
there room to exploit

533
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,038
that variation can you push them higher

534
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:05,918
within that range what's controlling

535
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:08,400
that we don't know yeah so there is a

536
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:12,120
lot of variation in all these data sets

537
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:15,000
and that we think is primarily driven by

538
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:16,158
uh how developers build their fences I

539
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,159
think that's you know a pretty big

540
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:22,559
takeaway is that you can save a lot of

541
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:24,320
land just by maximizing your uh area

542
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:25,879
your panel area to fence area but

543
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,200
unfortunately you know we live in New

544
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,960
York it's a patchwork landscape people

545
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,679
are dealing with HED RS and outcroppings

546
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,319
and you know really the shape is not

547
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:36,880
going to be a perfect rectangle every

548
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:40,158
time so um but when you say like large

549
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,520
sites use less land the efficiency is is

550
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,960
primarily I guess coming from the

551
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:46,000
orientation of the panels like

552
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,759
maximizing area of land in and that like

553
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,720
that's why their power density is is

554
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,759
less than someone who has smaller land

555
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,919
so we don't actually have the ability to

556
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:58,679
you know get into how they're lower uh

557
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,440
in terms of power density uh you know

558
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:03,640
power density is ultimately a factor of

559
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,798
um the site Arrangement as well as the

560
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,278
panel efficiency so it could be that you

561
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:09,798
know when they are planning these sites

562
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:11,359
the developers speced out like really

563
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:14,240
poor performing panels and that's

564
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:16,119
skewing the data um so ultimately you

565
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,679
know since these sites don't exactly

566
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:21,599
don't actually exist yet you know we're

567
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,960
least confident in these results um and

568
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:25,480
you know that's that's probably the main

569
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,480
driver

570
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:33,319
thank uh you had a question too um yeah

571
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:35,759
how do the mineral soil groups map onto

572
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:38,918
the Sergo classification stuff is one

573
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:40,798
through four like Alpha sols and that's

574
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:44,038
you know I I did dig a little bit into

575
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:45,639
that um a while ago but uh mainly it's

576
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:48,158
just like a big chart and they take

577
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,759
every single soil group and map it to a

578
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,840
specific

579
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:54,839
um mineral soil group category yeah I

580
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:59,240
can say a little so this this was

581
00:24:54,839 --> 00:25:02,240
developed uh in SCS by agronomist and it

582
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,880
it's based on yield potential for Maze

583
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,919
that's the short answer so multiple soil

584
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:11,399
types and and every soil type is ranked

585
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,799
but the basis is yield potential for

586
00:25:11,398 --> 00:25:16,000
Maze I believe it's kind of like similar

587
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:16,839
to a New York state specific version of

588
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,480
the

589
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:24,240
nccpi except one being

590
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:27,000
better okay so

591
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,720
uh in this first half of the analysis we

592
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,558
found uh pretty good correlations

593
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,640
between uh land covariates and existing

594
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:38,480
solar sites and so we wanted to see if

595
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:41,159
we could take that and extrapolate into

596
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,200
the future um and in order to do that we

597
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:44,760
needed to answer a few questions such as

598
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,640
how much solar are we actually going to

599
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:50,960
need um how much area that would take up

600
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,600
what the land use trends that we're

601
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,480
currently seeing would look like if

602
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:57,119
they're allowed to continue and since

603
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,159
we're modelers and we're making up

604
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,079
scenarios anyway we deci decided well

605
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:03,080
let's get a little bit more imaginative

606
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:06,278
and see what happens if we start to

607
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:07,918
tweak some parameters of that and change

608
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:11,519
what the future outcome could look like

609
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,840
just to uh see the difference so getting

610
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:16,440
to that first question how much solar

611
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:18,359
are we actually going to need um the

612
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,038
state of New York with their handy

613
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:23,839
analysis that accompanied the clcpa they

614
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:27,200
gave us some uh benchmarks of what they

615
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:30,038
expect we will need uh so again this

616
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,919
graph is showing uh annual generation in

617
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:36,000
gwatt hours on the vertical axis and

618
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:40,000
year on the horizontal and they're

619
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,960
estimating that uh we will need about 95

620
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,558
terawatt hours per year of energy to be

621
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:49,120
generated from these utility scale solar

622
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:52,398
sites and they also estimate that that's

623
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:53,678
going to come from about 65 GW of solar

624
00:26:52,398 --> 00:26:57,038
capacity so again there's that

625
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:59,960
difference between energy and capacity

626
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:03,599
um with you know terawatt hours being a

627
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:05,840
quantity of energy and 60 gaw uh or 65

628
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:08,798
gaws being uh

629
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:11,240
capacity uh unfortunately we found that

630
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:13,240
based on real world performance of solar

631
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,558
sites in New York state that it is going

632
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,120
to take substantially more solar

633
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:20,558
capacity to get to that goal of uh 955

634
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:21,639
tatt hours uh we found that it's going

635
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:27,119
to be around

636
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:33,440
86 uh gws of um single access tra sites

637
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:36,319
or um 96 gaw of uh fixed access

638
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,640
sites and um you know just to kind of

639
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:41,599
give you a breakdown of the different

640
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,360
capacity factors used in these models uh

641
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:48,240
the clcpa used a value of 22% which is a

642
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:50,879
pretty good day in New Mexico uh nerta

643
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,480
which is the New York State uh research

644
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,799
energy research and development

645
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:59,919
Authority they use uh in their models

646
00:27:55,798 --> 00:28:03,599
values of 16% for ACC tracked and around

647
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:05,799
133% for fixed access sites uh this is a

648
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:08,038
lot closer to what we found when we dug

649
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:11,200
into the actual hour by hour production

650
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:14,278
values of solar sites in New York state

651
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,640
so we uh downloaded all that raw data

652
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:21,200
for about 340 sites uh we separated it

653
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:23,600
into single and fixed axis and we uh

654
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,720
looked at what those actual uh Power

655
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:28,759
outputs were year-over-year in relation

656
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,679
to what their capacity is and found

657
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:31,879
uh single AIS sites have a capacity

658
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:36,960
factor of around

659
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:39,519
13.2 and uh fixed axis are closer to 12

660
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,960
um so unfortunately quite a bit lower

661
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:45,079
than the optimistic values used um by

662
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,079
the

663
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:51,759
clcpa uh so uh these power factor or

664
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:55,359
sorry capacity Factor values were able

665
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:58,519
to give us this um range of total

666
00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:01,199
capacities needed and as we've gone over

667
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:03,240
we have power densities so if you take

668
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,720
the capacity uh and the power density

669
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,399
you should be able to get an area but we

670
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,240
wanted to go a little bit further and

671
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:10,759
see if there are Trends over time that

672
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,919
we can tease out and apply because you

673
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:14,480
know the 2050 is still a good ways in

674
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:17,759
the future there's a lot of time for

675
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,120
technology to evolve uh and improve and

676
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,640
so we don't think it's realistic to just

677
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:24,038
assume that power density is going to be

678
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,080
the same uh so we want to see if there

679
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:28,879
are trends that we can fit to

680
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:32,079
demonstrate that it is improving um and

681
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,640
so this is a scatter plot of uh Power

682
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:38,480
densities of different sites based on uh

683
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:41,080
when they're built and again uh blue is

684
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,720
representing single AIS tra red is

685
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:45,960
representing fixed

686
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:49,319
axis and we're seeing that there is a

687
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:51,399
very slight uh positive trend um it's

688
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:53,759
not a very strong Trend uh doesn't have

689
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:56,599
a ton of great confidence but we can use

690
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:58,640
that um to give us a little bit of a

691
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:02,480
better understanding of what sites could

692
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:05,559
look like in the future and so if we

693
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,519
vary that Trend over time and we also

694
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:08,798
vary the starting point of what the

695
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:10,159
power density is now because there's

696
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:14,278
also a substantial amount of variation

697
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:16,159
in that data and simulate that thousands

698
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:18,839
and thousands of times uh we can do

699
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:21,919
something called a Monte Carlo analysis

700
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:25,398
uh and so this graph here uh represents

701
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:27,720
the probability of uh different areas of

702
00:30:25,398 --> 00:30:28,479
solar in the future where the horizontal

703
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,038
axis

704
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,919
is uh total land converted to solar and

705
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:36,519
the vertical axis is uh the probability

706
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:39,240
density or how many of those simulations

707
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:41,679
ended up at a specific inclusion uh and

708
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:46,839
so this represents uh a stochastic range

709
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:51,000
of V values um with uh you know single

710
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:54,079
AIS track sites having the uh lowest

711
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,240
most probable area value and uh fixed

712
00:30:54,079 --> 00:31:00,319
access sites having the highest so for

713
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:02,558
example fixed sites are most probable to

714
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:05,038
occupy about 100,000 hectares of land in

715
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:08,480
the future uh and that is you know a

716
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:10,599
substantial quantity of land um large

717
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,519
sites uh they have a bit of a wider

718
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:14,119
distribution of spread but you know

719
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:16,038
they're they're R around 990,000

720
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:19,038
hectares of land uh and the reason you

721
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:21,759
know uh if you saw in the first graph

722
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:23,398
that large sites are performing poorly

723
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:26,000
um and now all of a sudden they're doing

724
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:28,558
better than fixed axis uh that's because

725
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,038
the uh technology

726
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:33,359
in most large sites is single AIS tract

727
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:34,960
and that is improving faster than the

728
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:36,359
fixed axis in terms of power density

729
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,120
over

730
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:43,038
time um so we could have just simulated

731
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:45,479
a massive square of solar uh popped in

732
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:46,638
the middle of New York state t Ted up

733
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,440
all the area underneath it and called it

734
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:49,678
today but we wanted to figure out if we

735
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,759
could get a little bit more specific

736
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,159
about where these sites are going to go

737
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:56,398
um so we uh did something called

738
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,519
geospatial analysis where we took

739
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:00,558
covariates that we knew played some role

740
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:03,200
in site development and we took training

741
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:07,200
data which was all the sites that our AI

742
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:09,880
model found and we created a probability

743
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,919
raster of where solar would exist in New

744
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,440
York State uh we used something called a

745
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,960
maximum entropy model or Max ENT model

746
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,399
uh this is very similar to a random

747
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,840
forest model if you're familiar with

748
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:21,678
those except it doesn't require uh

749
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:23,879
positive or sorry negative training data

750
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,278
we can confidently say there is a solar

751
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,880
sight here but we can't say there's

752
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:28,319
definitely never going to be a solar

753
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,519
sight here so in order to get over that

754
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:33,158
little hiccup we use this particular

755
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:35,200
model we ended up with a probability

756
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:38,919
raster for the entire state of New York

757
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,960
where uh 100 represents Prime Solar

758
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:44,278
Development Area uh and zero represents

759
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:47,639
almost no chance of uh solar site being

760
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:50,200
developed and in this figure here um we

761
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:54,000
can see existing sites are sitting

762
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,000
comfortably in the green area say they

763
00:32:54,038 --> 00:33:00,879
should uh we conducted the same uh land

764
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,759
land cover analysis uh as we did for the

765
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:07,200
existing sites on these polygons once we

766
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:10,158
allocated uh enough of that optimal land

767
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,960
for meeting that total area requirement

768
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,840
that we calculated with the Monte Carlo

769
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,278
analysis and we found that the

770
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:19,240
distribution of land cover types looks

771
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:21,359
pretty similar um you know in the

772
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,679
present we're looking at a lot of annual

773
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:27,959
rad crops hey in pasture that doesn't

774
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:31,080
really change much for the future um

775
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:35,159
so we we wanted to press the scales a

776
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:36,839
little bit see if we could um change the

777
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:41,080
future scenario to look a little bit

778
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:42,798
more um AG responsible and so we created

779
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:43,918
a scenario well we created many

780
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:45,599
scenarios but the one I'm going to talk

781
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,679
about is where we took mineral soil

782
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:49,558
groups 1 through four and annual row

783
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,120
crop land according to the CDL the crop

784
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:54,759
data layer and decreased their scores on

785
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:56,278
that probability surface rter and then

786
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:58,480
ran that same simulation again and we

787
00:33:56,278 --> 00:34:01,798
were able to see that um pasture land

788
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:04,159
becomes much more um dominant of that

789
00:34:01,798 --> 00:34:06,759
land cover mix if you take away high

790
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:10,039
quality soils actively till agricultural

791
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:12,039
land used for annual crops um but still

792
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:16,039
keep in all those covariates of distance

793
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:18,079
of transmission lines low slopes um Etc

794
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:21,960
you know you can start to see that uh

795
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,960
there is still uh decent land

796
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:26,519
available uh so these are our key

797
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,440
findings um we're running a little low

798
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:31,358
on time so

799
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,760
uh I will not bore you with reading all

800
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:34,838
of them but essentially we were able to

801
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,800
locate all existing sites across New

802
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:38,440
York State begin to understand what

803
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,119
their former land use characteristics

804
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:43,000
were and ultimately try to see if there

805
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,838
is a way that we could take those sites

806
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,519
learn from them and project out into the

807
00:34:44,838 --> 00:34:51,918
future what the state is going to look

808
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:55,119
like when there are you know uh 100,000

809
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:56,000
or 100 gwatt hours of solar um across

810
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:00,320
the

811
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:03,000
landscape sorry 100

812
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,920
gws uh we also found that these sites

813
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,199
are using substantial agricultural land

814
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,920
um and that to meet these State energy

815
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:12,118
targets we are going to need a lot more

816
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,200
agricultural land to be converted to

817
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:17,440
solar unless restrictions are

818
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,679
imposed uh we also have further

819
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,800
questions that we hope to find out the

820
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:23,239
answers to at some point in the future

821
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,039
uh what land is consumed outside of

822
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:28,399
solar sites you know there's land that's

823
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:30,119
um uh

824
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,960
sorry it's called

825
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:34,280
um stranded land you know land between a

826
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,599
forest and a solar fence that's not

827
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,760
going to be available for farming um

828
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:40,800
there's also a lot of uncertainty in how

829
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,200
much solar energy we'll need because

830
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,839
we'll need a lot of energy in the winter

831
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:48,519
when solar panels are not producing a

832
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:51,358
lot um and we also are curious to see if

833
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:52,920
agricultural intensification can kind of

834
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:55,838
work from the other side to reduce some

835
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,079
of that potential food energy

836
00:35:55,838 --> 00:36:00,239
competition uh this project would not

837
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,680
have been possible without Peter's uh

838
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:06,078
continual help and support uh and

839
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:08,559
strategy planning and um kind of keeping

840
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,560
me on track as well as a lot of U

841
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:13,519
manuscript editing Dave Miller also

842
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:16,480
helped with editing manuscripts and was

843
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:18,800
uh helpful in kind of figuring out the

844
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,280
more nuanced issues with my analysis and

845
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,400
then also Jennifer Whitman provided

846
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:26,119
feedback and manuscript

847
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,280
editing uh any

848
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:32,119
questions go

849
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:35,160
just in doing like a spatial analysis of

850
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:36,720
how much land is available in certain

851
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:38,480
regions like I've heard a lot of people

852
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:40,399
from Eastern New York to Albany region

853
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,480
very Progressive people be really

854
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,838
worried because their small band Alpha

855
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,039
Sals is being eaten up by

856
00:36:44,838 --> 00:36:49,279
solar which is different than Western

857
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:52,719
York there's a lot more of that yeah

858
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,680
York like fton Mony County small amount

859
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:57,399
yeah we weren't able to incorporate kind

860
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:59,000
of like uh attitude towards solar into

861
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:02,559
the analysis I mean I can say

862
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,039
anecdotally that the Albany area is

863
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:06,358
developing very rapidly in terms of

864
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:10,480
solar growth and that's I think driven

865
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:11,880
primarily by access to both the north

866
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,240
south running transmission lines and

867
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:17,800
kind of the East West transmission lines

868
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:20,199
that fall I90 um so you know Regional

869
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,160
analysis of like what land is available

870
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:24,118
both for solar and what land is valuable

871
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:25,679
for agriculture is you know certainly

872
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:28,400
important um but it's not something that

873
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:30,318
we specifically looked at oh yeah

874
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,480
have you considered doing an analysis

875
00:37:30,318 --> 00:37:36,239
that looks at where the abandoned

876
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:39,119
agricultural land is and tries

877
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:41,318
to a potential additional transmission

878
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:44,480
line to open up

879
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:47,679
access that abandoned land so that all

880
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,039
that that pressure isn't right there on

881
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:51,679
nice oil in the lake plane yeah so I

882
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:53,599
mean we're already experiencing gri

883
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:55,639
congestion it seems like we're going to

884
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,838
have to build a lot more transmission

885
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:59,480
lines if we're going to reach these

886
00:37:56,838 --> 00:38:02,000
goals uh so you know optimizing where

887
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,400
those run in order to you know maximize

888
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,760
solar production while minimizing

889
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,639
agricultural land loss is a really good

890
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,480
idea and somebody should do that um but

891
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:12,118
you know it's it's not the kind of

892
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,639
expertise I have in terms of you know

893
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:16,280
land permitting or you know nism and all

894
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:18,480
the things that go into deciding where a

895
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:22,000
transmission line goes we did look a

896
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:25,199
little bit at uh you know where planned

897
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,199
lines are being run or at least uh are

898
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:28,919
planned to run and we found that you

899
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:31,719
know either running like down the bottom

900
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:34,079
of the Hudson River or on existing

901
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:36,480
corridors of existing transmission lines

902
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,200
there's not a huge desire to you know

903
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:42,199
Branch out into new territory and run

904
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:44,399
completely new routes um Peter yeah I'll

905
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:46,519
just chime in on that and you know we're

906
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,880
intensely interested in this former

907
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:51,318
Agland and have been for a long time

908
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:55,240
because it's an unusual resource most

909
00:38:51,318 --> 00:38:57,639
places don't have it um unfortunately we

910
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:59,799
have no geospatial data about where

911
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:03,279
these are so we've done calculations for

912
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:05,079
a long time by difference so the

913
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,319
cropland data layer says there's this

914
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:11,000
much Agland the statistical surveys say

915
00:39:08,318 --> 00:39:13,559
there's a smaller amount of Agland so we

916
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,119
think most of that difference is former

917
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:20,078
Agland but again we don't know where it

918
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,880
is you know geospatially so that's a

919
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:26,240
that's a big missing data set for all

920
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:30,119
kinds of reasons thank you uh so there's

921
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:31,559
a question on Zoom as well um I'm

922
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:33,079
wondering what you think of the argument

923
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:34,799
that instead of taking up valuable AG

924
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,760
land with solar solar is protecting

925
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,880
Farmland from Housing Development that

926
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,400
would make it permanently non-ag I've

927
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:44,838
heard

928
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,440
um yeah so again that's kind of a an

929
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:50,000
area that we didn't delve too deeply

930
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:53,720
into you know certainly a solar has a

931
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,280
long lifespan uh during which uh there's

932
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:57,879
little or at least substantially reduced

933
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,519
capacity for agriculture whereas a

934
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,318
Housing Development you know there's

935
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:05,440
really no uh crops that can be produced

936
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:08,559
in perpetuity you know other than lawn

937
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,119
um so you know I guess that's the

938
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:12,880
question of are we really going to

939
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,240
remove these solar sites in the future

940
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,599
um you know we're going to continue to

941
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:20,000
need energy indefinitely so I don't know

942
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:22,880
necessarily if solar is a less permanent

943
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,880
um land use although I will say that it

944
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,318
is certainly has the potential to be

945
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:31,800
less impactful you know it can be uh uh

946
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:34,199
housing soil enriching forages or it can

947
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:36,240
be grassland bird habitat uh I think it

948
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:38,118
does have more ecological value than

949
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:40,358
Housing Development but I wouldn't say

950
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:42,800
necessarily that it can be considered

951
00:40:40,358 --> 00:40:45,440
less permanent before that

952
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,240
answer I have a couple question one the

953
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:52,079
first one is the more the macro scale is

954
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:55,759
there any special Trend where you would

955
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:58,160
have more solar plants closer to cities

956
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,880
or as soon as you reach the GR then

957
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:04,759
doesn't matter where you are yeah so um

958
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:08,720
the two things we looked into with that

959
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:10,079
are uh existing sites are less prevalent

960
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:13,000
I mean there are a fair number on Long

961
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,640
Island um but they are just less

962
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,760
prevalent as you get further south just

963
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:20,039
because the land value goes up um and

964
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,760
it's you know uh $ thousand dollar an

965
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:26,119
acre and rent doesn't really entices

966
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:28,839
many people um and then also a lot of

967
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:31,358
our future analysis was informed by grid

968
00:41:28,838 --> 00:41:33,279
interconnection capacity so the New York

969
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:35,679
state electrical grid is divided up into

970
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,440
these zones and those zones have a

971
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:40,440
rating of how much electricity they can

972
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,200
transmit from one zone to another and so

973
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:45,119
essentially because the grid is a giant

974
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:47,239
funnel taking electricity down to New

975
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,079
York City uh the further south you get

976
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:51,318
the less additional capacity there is to

977
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:54,640
go from Zone to Zone um so that kind of

978
00:41:51,318 --> 00:41:57,039
restricted the amount of solar that we

979
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:57,879
expect to be in the in the southern

980
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:00,480
around

981
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,838
would most likely be away from those b c

982
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,838
yeah

983
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:15,480
yeah kind surprised to see going from

984
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:19,039
forest to solar like how far back go

985
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,760
Forest would they cut the forest and put

986
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:23,279
right away yeah uh I mean you know

987
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,760
anecdotally I've seen that in person

988
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,480
also it seems like that's a pretty

989
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:29,480
common transition just from the data um

990
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,159
I have a feeling it's not the most

991
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,240
desirable scenario just because that's

992
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:34,598
you know expensive unfortunately I don't

993
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:37,799
think they're looking at it at an

994
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:41,359
altruistic level um but yeah that that

995
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,359
does seem to happen a fair

996
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:49,160
amount there's also a question in the um

997
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:51,240
Zoom about uh Brown fields and rooftop

998
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:53,399
solar so we did not look at rooftop

999
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:54,879
solar specifically there is about half

1000
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,480
of all solar capacity at the time that

1001
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,880
we started this analysis was rooftop um

1002
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:03,240
so that's a substantial amount uh and

1003
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:05,960
then you know also we've not only seen

1004
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:08,439
um solar being developed on a lot of

1005
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,000
brown Fields uh it's also primarily

1006
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:14,079
selected by our future prediction models

1007
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,119
um so yeah I guess that is certainly an

1008
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,160
option although it seems to be uh

1009
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:19,200
rapidly filling up all right I think

1010
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:22,838
unless there are any other questions

1011
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:22,838
I'll let you guys go

00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:35,359
this has been a production of Cornell
