1
00:00:00,549 --> 00:00:05,310
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:05,309
University

3
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:13,320
all right so the students out there when

4
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:14,788
you're practicing your seminars is it's

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,990
for moments like this when you have to

6
00:00:14,788 --> 00:00:21,028
do performance under pressure when oh

7
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:24,149
six of your slides got chewed up by your

8
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:25,948
PC or my flash drive or something so I'm

9
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:28,859
going to do my best to fill in those

10
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:31,529
gaps but hopefully it won't be too

11
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,869
serious sorry well the first thing I

12
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:35,909
want to do is thank people who did the

13
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:39,119
work towards the end but people who

14
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:40,818
funded the work long-standing funding to

15
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:44,338
my lab from the Department of Energy

16
00:00:40,819 --> 00:00:46,760
both to my lab and then through this PFR

17
00:00:44,338 --> 00:00:49,978
see that we have a Purdue called c3 bio

18
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:52,798
postdoctoral support for Pell by Nick

19
00:00:49,978 --> 00:00:55,558
Bono it's from the LS RF and we've also

20
00:00:52,798 --> 00:00:58,018
had funding from G SEPA funding agency

21
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:01,948
through Stanford NSF and our

22
00:00:58,018 --> 00:01:03,929
collaborator John Ralph in the glbrc so

23
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:07,769
what I want to talk to you about today

24
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:10,620
is what I think is I I just testimony

25
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:14,519
how fortunate I am that we did a mutant

26
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:16,650
screen many years ago I discussed the

27
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,539
first of the mutants that came out of

28
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:24,150
that screen when I interviewed at vice

29
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:25,710
Thompson in 1993 I got the job at Purdue

30
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,969
though which is where I met my wife so

31
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:29,159
that's okay everything worked out just

32
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:31,409
fine

33
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,890
but it's a mutant scream that we started

34
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:37,319
and it took us down the road of enzymes

35
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:41,189
of phenylpropanolamine biosynthesis but

36
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:42,779
more recently we with this screen we

37
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,840
identified an important regulator

38
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,950
regulatory component a part of the

39
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,450
mediator complex which is why I sort of

40
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:55,409
have this oblique pun in here about

41
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:59,189
mediate that turns out to the function

42
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:02,130
of which turns out to explain a number

43
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:04,679
of the unexpected phenotypes we saw in

44
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:06,089
our biochemical mutants so you know I

45
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,819
thought it's going to be a little bit

46
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:12,750
weaving and crossing over that I hope I

47
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:14,429
can can walk you through all this so

48
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,248
first of all why are we interested in

49
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:20,310
studying tunnel propanol metabolism I've

50
00:02:17,248 --> 00:02:22,109
had a long interest in secondary

51
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,629
Tabassum why plants make all the

52
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,459
fabulous compounds that they make but

53
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:29,879
some approximate metabolism was one is

54
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:33,000
particularly important both biologically

55
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:37,530
and in terms of the use of biomass for

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,739
humans for bioenergy or animal feed or

57
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,590
even for paper production but it's for

58
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:45,209
plants it was one of the important

59
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:49,019
innovations that permitted the

60
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:52,140
colonization of land because it involves

61
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:53,789
the generation of molecules that comes

62
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,250
our beauty light that the plants now

63
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:58,370
have two times that now have to deal

64
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,560
with if they're on land compared to

65
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:03,420
living in an aquatic environment so this

66
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,219
happens to be the molecule that's going

67
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:07,318
to feature prominently in this talk it's

68
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:10,289
a UV protected molecule that a rapid

69
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:12,208
Ossus makes called cinebulle malate and

70
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:14,848
of course this portion of the molecule

71
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:18,930
on the right that is responsible for

72
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:21,988
absorbing UV and the reason that I show

73
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:24,840
this portion of the knee in in blue is

74
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:28,530
that the great feature about this for us

75
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,719
is that it this this moiety makes this

76
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,599
molecule fluorescent under UV light so

77
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,859
as a mutant phenotype the presence or

78
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,299
absence of this fluorescent has

79
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:41,340
fluorescence has been very useful to us

80
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:44,930
the other important component that is

81
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:47,239
derive from this pathway is lignin and

82
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:49,980
this is sort of a schematic

83
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:52,109
representation of what Lincoln might

84
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:55,759
look like it's we don't still don't have

85
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:59,459
a very good understanding of the actual

86
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:01,919
structural well we know the structural

87
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:05,009
motifs but not exactly how it exists in

88
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:07,458
the wall and of course this is this

89
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:10,318
molecule I like to describe it as being

90
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:13,979
important at both the macroscopic and

91
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:16,349
microscopic level so that the lignin

92
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:19,199
polymers impress is pregnant into the

93
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,840
cell wall where it gives it rigidity and

94
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:25,469
allows these trees to stand upright and

95
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:27,629
withstand the forces of wind and what

96
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:31,340
have you so it's a very important at

97
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:33,990
that level but at the microscopic level

98
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:37,409
it's also important

99
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:40,500
as as a molecule that strengthens the

100
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,840
cell walls of water conducting tissue

101
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,610
does Island so here's a cross section of

102
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,069
a rabbit ops system and you can see the

103
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,660
trachea elements that are nice and big

104
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:51,478
and open and good for conducting water

105
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,430
and in this mutant that has lower levels

106
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:55,889
of lignin those same cells have

107
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,288
collapsed under the tension of course

108
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:59,160
that's developed by transpiration now I

109
00:04:58,288 --> 00:05:00,240
don't want to leave you with the

110
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,240
impression that lignin - the only

111
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,310
important strengthening agent a

112
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,870
cellulose deficient mutant will show a

113
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,439
similar phenotype so it's clearly a

114
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:12,379
codependent Network so anyhow it's

115
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:19,620
pretty clear that these this pathway is

116
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:21,779
very important now for as well

117
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,579
many of you probably aren't lignin

118
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:26,909
experts but have heard a lot about it

119
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:30,060
and with regard to to biomass and

120
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:32,849
biofuel production why is that well one

121
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,280
of the reasons I would argue is that it

122
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:39,860
is a it is it represents low-hanging

123
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:41,939
fruit it's a unique polymer in that

124
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,530
let's go through the other ones that

125
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:46,348
we're all familiar with them in plants

126
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:48,439
or in organisms nucleic acids we know

127
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:51,509
that their synthesis is template

128
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:53,579
dependent protein synthesis we're

129
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:56,459
reading an mRNA template to make a

130
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:57,810
protein molecule polysaccharides well

131
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:00,149
it's a little bit different but at least

132
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,220
it's but still there's other specific

133
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:05,189
enzymes that make specific linkages to

134
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,860
make very characteristic polysaccharides

135
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:12,029
in a cell wall lignin synthesis is

136
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:14,520
entirely different in that it's the

137
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:16,859
types of cross links that you see in the

138
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:20,000
lignin polymer and the components that

139
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:25,229
make it up are dependent only upon the

140
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
precursor supply so whatever whatever so

141
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:29,430
called mono leg knows that a plant makes

142
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,918
whatever ratio that they the client

143
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:35,129
makes them in is represented in what

144
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,469
what the polymer is like now it let's

145
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:39,449
just contrast that if you made it had a

146
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,159
yeast cell that overproduced leucine you

147
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:43,528
would never expect to see its proteins

148
00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:45,180
containing more losing but here we can

149
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:48,449
we have found and I'll show you some of

150
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,819
the data are really data picture

151
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:53,310
that we have that show that we can

152
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:58,560
manipulate monolid no synthesis and

153
00:06:53,310 --> 00:07:01,610
thereby manipulate pre uh bleedin both

154
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,220
chemistry and it turns out architecture

155
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:09,870
so ligand mono lignin biosynthesis

156
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:11,490
begins in the cytoplasm with amino acid

157
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:14,160
phenylalanine and there's a series of

158
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:17,310
hydroxylation and methylation reactions

159
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,580
that lead to these three alcohols para

160
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:24,750
cumin or alcohol canal qahal and cynical

161
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:27,659
alcohol so called H G and s sub units

162
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:29,279
for lignin and so you can see that what

163
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,050
we're talking about is differences in

164
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,659
the decoration of the ring so this is

165
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,980
the earliest branch of the pathway the

166
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,960
second one in the third round and I'll

167
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,840
show this slightly differently in some

168
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,029
upcoming slides so these molecules can

169
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,069
then be exported to the apple plast

170
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:46,319
where they're activated to their two

171
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:48,719
free radicals by Lac cases and

172
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,740
peroxidases which then spontaneously

173
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,510
polymerize to form the polymer so

174
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:57,269
depending upon what monolid nulls are

175
00:07:54,509 --> 00:08:00,349
made that that determines what comes out

176
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,349
and what is polymerized

177
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:09,389
so here's a a representation of the

178
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,060
pathway that probably is sufficient for

179
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:14,550
most people's purposes it I assure you I

180
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,780
know the structures involved but if I

181
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,069
showed them all you wouldn't be able to

182
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:19,229
see them and you wouldn't remember them

183
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:21,089
anyway so I I don't know maybe it's

184
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,620
teaching twenty years of undergraduate

185
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:26,159
biochemistry that's driven me to this

186
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:28,709
but so this is my schematic of the

187
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,840
pathway and it again starts with

188
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:33,750
phenylalanine and give branches to give

189
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:36,360
the G subunit canaveral alcohol the S

190
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:40,049
sub units in apoyo al qahal I want to

191
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,969
show this because this molecule I

192
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:43,889
mentioned earlier is a derivative of

193
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:47,550
this same pathway so sin upon malli

194
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:49,819
comes off of the pathway fairly late so

195
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:52,919
by looking for mutants that are

196
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,840
deficient or reduced in sin upon mallet

197
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:57,179
accumulation we have been able to

198
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,399
identify enzymes and genes and enzymes

199
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:01,349
that are not only required for these

200
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,659
final transformations but

201
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:06,420
also a number of the steps that are

202
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:09,689
common to both sin upon Aly biosynthesis

203
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:12,179
and lignin biosynthesis and so what what

204
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:15,180
you'll go through my talk I'll often use

205
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:18,479
the accumulation of simple malli

206
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:23,779
basically as a proxy or overall activity

207
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:26,159
of this pathway so as I mentioned

208
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:28,799
Singapore malate is fluorescent blue

209
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:32,309
under UV light and you can actually see

210
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,719
that in planta and so here is a wild

211
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:35,489
type plant photograph just with a

212
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,220
transilluminator for illumination and

213
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:40,019
the first means we identified that we

214
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,960
called fall one for freulich acid

215
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:44,519
hydroxylase is it completely lacks in

216
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,889
Nepal malate and you can see it has this

217
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:49,649
nice red fluorescence it comes about

218
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:51,659
because well first there's no blue

219
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:53,909
fluorescence from cinebulle Maui but

220
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:58,259
also because some formality is as

221
00:09:53,909 --> 00:10:00,990
effective UV sunscreen in its absence

222
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:03,509
that UV can penetrate down into the

223
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:05,490
mesophyll excited chlorophyll molecules

224
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:07,220
and you see chlorophyll fluorescence so

225
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:10,769
if we were to take this photograph again

226
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:12,810
with a yellow filter over the lens that

227
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:14,789
would block out this blue fluorescence

228
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:16,649
what you would see here is a red plant

229
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:18,629
and a plant that's basically just dark

230
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:20,789
because this is an effective sunscreen

231
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:24,210
of blocks UV from getting into the maze

232
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:25,529
ozone so what I want to talk what I'm

233
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,690
going to talk to you about today is a

234
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:30,509
number of these mutants the later ones

235
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:35,550
of which we refer to as ref for reduced

236
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:39,230
epidermal fluorescence all right so I

237
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:41,549
mentioned that we can manipulate lignin

238
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:43,440
biosynthesis and I mentioned that

239
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:45,929
partially in terms of the justification

240
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,850
for the research but but also it's

241
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:49,829
important for what we what's going to

242
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,600
come later in my talk so this is very

243
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:55,889
old work so I'm just going to mention it

244
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:58,019
very briefly so if we eliminate f5h very

245
00:10:55,889 --> 00:11:00,360
light five hydroxyl aids in the file one

246
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:02,340
mutant this is the first time that we

247
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,110
had shown that we could do this lignin

248
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,759
manipulation so in the absence of that

249
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,889
enzyme

250
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:10,970
the lignin is derived entirely from G

251
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:13,679
subunits and the effect on the plant is

252
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:15,060
since there is no effect these plants

253
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,279
grow and develop normally

254
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:20,489
and that's perhaps not surprising

255
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:23,909
because if you look at outside pine

256
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:25,590
trees gymnosperms make only this g

257
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:27,870
lignin so we already know that's an

258
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:29,550
effective polymer in some in some plants

259
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,870
and so these are what evidences points

260
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:33,870
are are fine with that

261
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:36,659
in fact we've also found that if you

262
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:40,259
overexpress this step we can redirect

263
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:43,980
redirect flux over to make a pure s

264
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:45,480
lignin and again it has no effect on the

265
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,340
plants its and if it's a functional

266
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,129
lignin it's quite interesting because

267
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:52,440
it's easier to degrade and it actually

268
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:54,389
has instead of being a cross-linked

269
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,420
polymer it's a linear polymer so we're

270
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:59,909
really dramatically changing the cell

271
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:03,479
wall structure but the play it's

272
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:06,299
tolerated very well now that's not

273
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,670
always the case so we have another an

274
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:13,319
example of a mutant that is very early

275
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:17,189
in the pathway c3 primate and when we

276
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:19,170
block that step so the plants make a

277
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,870
lignin that is derived from these h

278
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:24,779
subunits this d subunits make up

279
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:30,060
normally about 1 percent of the the

280
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:31,379
polymer in a wild-type plant but the

281
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:33,569
lignin in these plants is almost

282
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:36,960
entirely derived from that but that has

283
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:41,360
very severe consequences so that's what

284
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:45,810
that plant looks like and so we were not

285
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:48,180
may be entirely surprised by this in the

286
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:50,669
lignin literature it was said that that

287
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:52,169
you couldn't even make h lignin and so

288
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:53,939
we thought well this is probably not a

289
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:59,339
functional polymer for some reason or

290
00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:01,770
another so so the fact that that these

291
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:03,450
plants are dwarfed perhaps it's got to

292
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:06,929
do with and I'll just use the same slide

293
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,610
as I used earlier this idea that the

294
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:11,629
abundance of lignin is important those

295
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:14,310
plants make very little H lignin and

296
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:16,860
also show this vascular collapse and we

297
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:19,169
know obviously that that water transport

298
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,450
is very important to plant so a plant

299
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:26,149
that can't transport water just dwarf

300
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:26,150
not not a not a terribly big surprise

301
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:37,999
of course is a different thickness cell

302
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:41,248
type-specific yes in many cases so the

303
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:43,980
xylem has predominantly G lignin and

304
00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:47,249
that's both in Arabidopsis and also in

305
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:52,100
tree species whereas supporting tissues

306
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:55,889
fibers clarified cells of deposit

307
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:58,619
esslingen but usually especially in the

308
00:13:55,889 --> 00:14:01,799
case of those cells it's when I say s

309
00:13:58,619 --> 00:14:04,470
legging it's really a GS copolymer so

310
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:12,240
the that is for your question

311
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:14,910
yep so I'm going to set that mutant down

312
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,850
for a moment and and talk about another

313
00:14:14,909 --> 00:14:20,188
of the mutants that we worked on that

314
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:22,259
we've worked on called rf4 this turns

315
00:14:20,188 --> 00:14:24,389
out to be the regulatory protein that I

316
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:27,869
that I mentioned at the beginning of my

317
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:29,399
talk although when we first identified

318
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:35,189
it we didn't understand that to be the

319
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:36,808
case so rf4 mutants also deposit Leslie

320
00:14:35,188 --> 00:14:38,789
Linden wild-type so you're getting used

321
00:14:36,808 --> 00:14:41,129
to seeing these now you can see that in

322
00:14:38,789 --> 00:14:43,469
the strong allele we have collabs eylem

323
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:46,230
compared to these cells and we have

324
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:48,269
about a 25% reduction in overall lignin

325
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,470
content and that's highly consistent

326
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:51,120
with the literature that's about the

327
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,490
extent to which you can reduce lignin

328
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:58,769
before you start seeing phenotypes like

329
00:14:53,490 --> 00:15:00,600
this these plants are also dwarfed you

330
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:03,178
can see here on on the right that so

331
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,149
this is the strong allele but once of

332
00:15:03,178 --> 00:15:09,178
course we could call the gene we could

333
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:11,339
identify knockouts for this to see

334
00:15:09,178 --> 00:15:14,938
whether they would recapitulate this

335
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:16,949
mutant phenotype and this is a knockout

336
00:15:14,938 --> 00:15:21,298
for effort and you can see that it does

337
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:24,568
not this this is actually a missense

338
00:15:21,298 --> 00:15:27,178
mutation that is semi dominant so it

339
00:15:24,568 --> 00:15:29,248
wasn't really a huge surprise that the

340
00:15:27,178 --> 00:15:33,240
knockout didn't recapitulate that

341
00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:34,920
phenotype rf4 has a paralog in the

342
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,980
rabbit offices genome that we call ref

343
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:40,860
for related one or RFR one a knockout of

344
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,420
this also doesn't phenocopy ref for

345
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:46,709
three and the double

346
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:49,559
Macha also does not so there's certainly

347
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:52,259
something special about this particular

348
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:54,149
mutant allele with this it's a very

349
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:58,139
minor change in the protein structure

350
00:15:54,149 --> 00:16:02,360
it's a glycine to serine alterations but

351
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:04,879
what it appears is that that mutation

352
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,980
causes that protein to act as a

353
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:11,338
constitutive break on phenol propria

354
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,620
metabolism so we were very relieved in

355
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:15,209
fact to find that the double knock the

356
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,339
knockouts or the double knock go

357
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:20,698
particularly gives the opposite

358
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:23,310
phenotype so here's a wild-type this is

359
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:27,509
using again cinema male levels as a

360
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:30,000
measure of phenol propanol you knockout

361
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:32,370
ref for there's really no change you

362
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,440
knockout are 4-1 you do get an increase

363
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,899
in the double knockout has an even more

364
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,240
substantial increase so the fact that

365
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:41,339
this is a great relief because the fact

366
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,339
that this gives the opposite phenotype

367
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:47,990
to this suggests that this is not a neo

368
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:50,880
morphic mutation so this is actually a

369
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:55,560
protein that's acting in the same

370
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:56,730
pathway it normally acted so again for

371
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:59,039
the students if you've not thought about

372
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,409
this before if you think about a neo

373
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:04,109
morphing tation what about a

374
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:05,970
transcription factor that has a missense

375
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:08,969
mutation that leads to a change in the

376
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:11,490
amino acids on the DNA binding domain so

377
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:14,100
now allow it to bind somewhere where it

378
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:16,818
wouldn't normally bind now you start

379
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:18,869
studying that now you're studying a

380
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:21,599
context for that transcription factor

381
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:23,369
that's not biologically relevant so here

382
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,828
the knock out of having the opposite

383
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:29,298
phenotype to the to this dominant

384
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:34,619
mutation was was a great relief to us

385
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:36,769
okay so what is what is rf4 well we

386
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:40,079
didn't know for the longest time it has

387
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:42,509
it's found in all plants it has no

388
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,220
domains that allow you to might you

389
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:48,569
there's no ATP's I mean it doesn't even

390
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:49,980
have a domain of unknown function and so

391
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:51,329
we were actually left scratching our

392
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,130
head for the longest time about what

393
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:56,369
this thing is really doing until

394
00:17:53,130 --> 00:18:00,770
somebody purified the mediator complex

395
00:17:56,369 --> 00:18:02,639
from Arabidopsis and rf4

396
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:05,549
immunoprecipitated with the rest of the

397
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:10,740
complex so what what is mediator it's a

398
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:14,369
large 30 protein transcriptional

399
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:16,829
regulatory complex that can associate

400
00:18:14,369 --> 00:18:18,779
with another another kinase module and

401
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:21,808
bring in an yet another for proteins and

402
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:23,308
what it does is that it's it's divided

403
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:27,149
into a number of modules and this

404
00:18:23,308 --> 00:18:29,879
so-called tail module interacts with

405
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:34,710
transcription factors bound to DNA both

406
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:38,429
locally and added at a distance and when

407
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:41,640
it does so the head and middle module

408
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:45,420
can recruit to the transcription start

409
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,940
site the the general transcriptional

410
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:50,039
machinery and so in doing so by making

411
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,230
contacts with a number of transcription

412
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:54,569
factors bound upstream of genes it can

413
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:57,240
generate a again can sort of interpret

414
00:18:54,569 --> 00:19:00,359
that information and lead to a court

415
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:04,200
coordinated transcriptional output so

416
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:06,479
what we had identified was med 5 a youth

417
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,569
subunit of the tail this is really

418
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,789
fairly fanciful but the if you look at

419
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:13,589
the e/m reconstructions of it they're a

420
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:15,899
little bit hard to interpret so in some

421
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:18,449
ways the schematic is more useful but

422
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:24,710
anyway meds med 5 is the protein that

423
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:26,970
we've been looking at so we now have we

424
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:28,710
understand now that we've got a protein

425
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,929
that's involved in phenol appropriate

426
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:34,140
regulation we have a missense allele

427
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:42,030
that that suppresses some appropriate

428
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:45,720
gene expression and now for reasons that

429
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:48,839
are well entirely serendipitous my lab

430
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,630
we were making multiple means my postdoc

431
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:53,849
was and we can now circle back to this

432
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:56,250
rf8 mutant that I mentioned earlier that

433
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:59,759
was blocked earlier in the pathway and

434
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:02,640
made only H lignin we made a double NIC

435
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:06,929
made a triple mutant in fact between rf8

436
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,540
this very sad plant and this knockout of

437
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:10,320
these two flavors of this mid 5

438
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:14,730
mediators

439
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:18,750
unit and found that these plants were

440
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:22,200
capable of growing again which was a big

441
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:25,589
surprise because we thought well this is

442
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:28,140
all just to do with with malformed

443
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:31,980
lignin and lack of ability to transport

444
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:34,100
water but these plants grow just fine so

445
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,539
that was that was quite a puzzle to us

446
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:38,909
but it was very exciting what we found

447
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:41,009
was but Nick sound was that that was

448
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:43,050
actually able to restore lignin

449
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:45,450
deposition so again this is a measure of

450
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:47,849
lignin content you can see in the dwarf

451
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:51,569
bean that's very much suppressed but in

452
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:54,240
when we bring in the mediator mutations

453
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:56,819
that lignin content goes back up so

454
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,490
maybe it is the fact that the case that

455
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:00,599
these plants can transport water

456
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:04,589
properly they certainly look like they

457
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:08,819
can but also the it's not the case that

458
00:21:04,589 --> 00:21:10,559
we had in any way restored normal

459
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:12,480
phenylpropanolamine sites are still

460
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,579
blocked at the same place we thought

461
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,019
that they were blocked before and what

462
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:18,299
we could really see where we could

463
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:19,920
really see that clearly was by doing the

464
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:22,909
lignin analysis and this has worked on

465
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:26,370
an John Ralph slab by Yuki Tohmatsu and

466
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:27,870
if you were if you were like really

467
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:32,009
interested in lignin you'd look at this

468
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:33,779
and go wow but you're not so let me

469
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:37,859
explain why you should be excited about

470
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:40,799
it so this is 2d NMR and lignin analysis

471
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:44,219
and the blue stands for the G subunits

472
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:47,430
the green for the s subunits and these

473
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:49,380
red residences here are for these eight

474
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:53,370
subunits that are normally just very

475
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:55,440
very minor components and so this plant

476
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:57,859
these plants that are growing normally

477
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,720
are making this this type of lignin that

478
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:02,459
people thought you plants couldn't make

479
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,220
so that we thought was pretty exciting

480
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,779
so now we've actually what I've

481
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:09,690
introduced along the way are to you our

482
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:13,319
plants that make two GS copolymer that's

483
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:15,450
the wild type pure g pure s and now pure

484
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:17,549
h Cygnet so you can see how this this

485
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:20,069
polymer can be very readily manipulated

486
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:22,470
anyway very for those questions in the

487
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:23,859
lignin community that was pretty pretty

488
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:29,169
exciting

489
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:31,509
so why why are these why is this meaning

490
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:33,788
to mutation restoring growth while we

491
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:35,500
bottom line is that we still don't know

492
00:22:33,788 --> 00:22:37,269
but I can tell you a couple things that

493
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,839
aren't going on first of all it's not

494
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:43,179
the case that the low lignin is because

495
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:45,278
subtle gene expression is federal

496
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:47,860
procurement gene expression for lignin

497
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:50,769
synthesis is down regulated in the plant

498
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:53,709
because in fact in the ref a mutant is

499
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:56,048
up regulated all of these genes required

500
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:58,149
for lignin synthesis are up regulated in

501
00:22:56,048 --> 00:23:01,119
the mutant and they are further up

502
00:22:58,148 --> 00:23:04,418
regulated in in when we knock out the

503
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:06,308
mediator subunit so it's not that we're

504
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:07,929
restoring overall gene expression it's

505
00:23:06,308 --> 00:23:10,658
certainly something more complicated

506
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:15,460
than that to try and get a handle on

507
00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:18,278
that we did an rna-seq experiment and

508
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,778
what you can see is that well there's a

509
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:21,220
number of things I guess I should point

510
00:23:19,778 --> 00:23:23,259
out so the on the left or the up

511
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:26,230
regulated genes on the right or the down

512
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:29,019
regulated genes and we're comparing the

513
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:31,210
mediator subunit double knockout the

514
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:34,000
lignin mutant and then the triple mutant

515
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:36,100
from boats so there's a few things one

516
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,308
is there's a huge number of genes that

517
00:23:36,099 --> 00:23:42,009
are miss regulated in that that vary for

518
00:23:39,308 --> 00:23:43,839
plant that's probably to be expected in

519
00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:48,908
a plant that is so developmentally

520
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:51,308
perturbed there are relatively few genes

521
00:23:48,909 --> 00:23:53,889
that are altered and expression when you

522
00:23:51,308 --> 00:23:56,259
knock out this mediator subpoena which

523
00:23:53,888 --> 00:23:58,418
and we're continuing to study this in

524
00:23:56,259 --> 00:24:00,940
love how what what is the impact of

525
00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:03,490
altering mediator on gene expression and

526
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:06,909
in many cases it's surprisingly modest

527
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:10,149
for an important what we what we always

528
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:11,350
consider to be an important component of

529
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:14,859
this transcriptional regulatory

530
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:17,558
apparatus and in the triple mutant

531
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:19,329
almost all of the genes over 90 percent

532
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:25,450
of the genes that are Mis regulated in

533
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:28,538
the mutant are returned to normal okay

534
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:31,120
so before I go to that so again we

535
00:24:28,538 --> 00:24:33,788
haven't we still haven't identified the

536
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:37,169
actual cause from all of these there's

537
00:24:33,788 --> 00:24:39,750
too big a number of genes to be able to

538
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:42,960
in on on what the actual cause of that

539
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:45,559
dwarfing is but we're almost inclined at

540
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:49,079
this point to say that it's not that

541
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:51,240
it's not that the low lignin causes the

542
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:55,730
dwarfing but perhaps it's the other way

543
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:57,960
around that we're actually altering

544
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:01,970
metabolism in such a way that we get

545
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:05,400
this massive transcriptional response

546
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:07,380
that is mediate or dependent so that's a

547
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,750
sort of a theme that I'll cure through

548
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:14,490
the rest of the talk that that perhaps

549
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:17,220
in these plants some metabolite is being

550
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:19,710
detected that accumulates because of the

551
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:22,350
the block in lignin biosynthesis and

552
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:28,680
that leads to mediate or dependent

553
00:25:22,349 --> 00:25:34,199
changes in gene expression okay so now

554
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:39,860
I'm going to go on to my next sort of

555
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:46,559
case of a little vignette about mediator

556
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:48,750
and how it may function in regulating

557
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:52,619
metabolism both within pathways in

558
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:56,009
between pathways so this is not an

559
00:25:52,619 --> 00:26:00,539
experiment it's a an anecdote it comes

560
00:25:56,009 --> 00:26:03,029
from when I was a postdoc so in the

561
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:06,059
early 1990s before some of you were born

562
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:08,490
probably and it was when I originally

563
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:10,409
identified the hall one mutant so this

564
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:12,900
is the one that makes the pure G lignin

565
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:14,759
and what you can see here is two pots of

566
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:19,230
two there's two different alleles of

567
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:20,789
file1 that and wild-type I had been

568
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,839
growing these plants under in a nice

569
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:23,639
growth chamber and I

570
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:25,769
I needed the space for something else so

571
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,060
I moved the plants to someplace I don't

572
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:29,339
remember I think it was higher light and

573
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:32,129
a bit warmer temperature and the wild

574
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:33,899
type plants did what wild type plants

575
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:35,970
are prone to do and they were upset with

576
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,040
being moved and so they accumulated a

577
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:40,980
lot of anthocyanins commonly thought of

578
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:43,529
as being stress metabolites and yet the

579
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:46,049
fall one means did not do that and I was

580
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:49,849
really perplexed for that about that for

581
00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:49,849
about 25 years

582
00:26:50,019 --> 00:27:00,079
and we decided to try and follow up on

583
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:02,180
that a little bit you can become maybe

584
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:03,379
people in the front row can see your

585
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:06,380
many of you who have worked for the

586
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:08,390
rabid OPS's know that that rabid OPS's

587
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:11,810
petioles and stems this is a little bit

588
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:14,570
of anthocyanin there that's missing in

589
00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:17,769
these fall one plans to try and get a

590
00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:21,139
clearer signal we look use this this

591
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:23,660
line called pap on D in which which is

592
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:25,280
an activation tag line that turns on

593
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:27,730
expression of a transcription factor

594
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:31,579
which is a master regulator of

595
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:33,529
anthocyanin production and you can see

596
00:27:31,579 --> 00:27:36,379
there's very dark red pigmentation in

597
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:38,059
the petals just it drives up the levels

598
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,030
that are not where they are normally

599
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:44,179
found but when you do when you cross

600
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:49,339
that into a file one background that

601
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:53,269
doesn't happen you don't get that level

602
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:57,259
of anthocyanin accumulation and this was

603
00:27:53,269 --> 00:28:00,319
really perplexing to me oh yes I can

604
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:03,559
show you this again in cross-sections of

605
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:06,379
stems where you again get a lot of

606
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:10,460
anthocyanin accumulation of Papp 1d but

607
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:13,190
in a fall one path one d-double you fail

608
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:15,440
to get anthocyanin accumulation in all

609
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:21,320
the cells that would normally Express

610
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:23,420
that that gene so it seems that there's

611
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:25,399
clear that there's some interaction here

612
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:30,039
but the perplexing thing about this is

613
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:33,830
that this enzyme of fennel propyl ISM is

614
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:37,039
not required for for the production of

615
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:40,519
anthocyanins the anthocyanins branch out

616
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:44,210
very early from the pathway the enseña

617
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:46,220
poly and s lignin very late and yet

618
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:48,799
we're seeing this interaction between

619
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:53,180
these the accumulation of these products

620
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:55,789
that was very perplexing and we can see

621
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:59,029
that if we want to do if we did HPLC

622
00:28:55,789 --> 00:29:03,089
analysis of those anthocyanins in

623
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:05,308
wild-type there's a large peak of

624
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:08,490
a couple of large peaks of anthocyanins

625
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:10,648
but when we measure by HPLC the red line

626
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:14,099
represents the levels of anthocyanins in

627
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:21,178
the following units very very low but

628
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:23,459
when we compare Med 5 the Med 5 mutant

629
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:27,330
we see anthocyanins just like in

630
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:31,558
wild-type but when we combine Med 5 a B

631
00:29:27,329 --> 00:29:35,428
and file1 we restore anthocyanin

632
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:37,710
accumulation in this case it's a little

633
00:29:35,429 --> 00:29:41,159
bit complicated it's a different

634
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:44,610
anthocyanin that accumulates because

635
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:48,990
this anthocyanin actually has a synaptic

636
00:29:44,609 --> 00:29:51,418
acid subunit on it so that decoration is

637
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:55,319
missing and so we get a different

638
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:57,389
emphasize here but when I say f5h isn't

639
00:29:55,319 --> 00:30:00,359
required for anthocyanin accumulation I

640
00:29:57,388 --> 00:30:03,329
mean the core of the anthocyanins not

641
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:06,648
the decoration so this effect of fall

642
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:12,329
one on the suppression of anthocyanin

643
00:30:06,648 --> 00:30:14,278
accumulation is mediator dependent what

644
00:30:12,329 --> 00:30:15,839
we think is happening and I'll show off

645
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:18,419
show some models a little bit later is

646
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:21,359
again I mean perhaps a metabolite

647
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:24,210
upstream of that 5h is being sensed and

648
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:26,839
by an immediate or dependent way and is

649
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:31,048
shutting down from a proton metabolism

650
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:32,490
um ok this is I think where yes this is

651
00:30:31,048 --> 00:30:34,798
where I go into the part of the talk

652
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:36,749
where my slides got corrupted so I'll

653
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:38,368
I'll do my best

654
00:30:36,749 --> 00:30:40,710
the next meet and I want to tell you

655
00:30:38,368 --> 00:30:42,720
about is this Beaton called R f2 and

656
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:45,389
another one that isn't shown in this

657
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:49,558
slide ref five for those of you who were

658
00:30:45,388 --> 00:30:52,678
here when my postdoc interviewed dr.

659
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:55,230
Jung Yun Kim this is the story that she

660
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:57,749
told so perhaps you'll be able to fill

661
00:30:55,230 --> 00:31:01,558
in the gaps that that are missing in my

662
00:30:57,749 --> 00:31:05,490
slides so these two mutants rf2 and

663
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:09,210
refine are low incentive poem ally as

664
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:11,490
that UV phenotype reveals and we can

665
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:13,288
show that by HPLC as well so again

666
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:16,650
sinop O'Malley content and then these

667
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:19,579
multiple R f2 alleles it's suppressed

668
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:24,809
we've shown a long time ago this is from

669
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:28,470
2003 that rf2 encodes a cytochrome p450

670
00:31:24,808 --> 00:31:31,589
dependent mono oxygenase known as sip 83

671
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:34,558
a 1 now the confusing thing at the time

672
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:37,949
was that these these p450 mono oxygenase

673
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:39,660
--is our hydroxylase is by and large but

674
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:40,830
all the hydroxyl lasers of an

675
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,620
appropriately pathway have been

676
00:31:40,829 --> 00:31:46,799
accounted for by that time it turns out

677
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:53,129
that this p450 functions in a different

678
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:58,109
pathway let me go back watch this this

679
00:31:53,130 --> 00:32:02,010
letter here ref 5 includes the pic

680
00:31:58,109 --> 00:32:06,629
encodes the para log of rf2 and that sip

681
00:32:02,009 --> 00:32:10,259
83 b1 I'm sorry I'm missing data off

682
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:12,330
this side so I can't show you the simple

683
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:17,609
malate levels but this is worth the

684
00:32:12,329 --> 00:32:19,139
jugging published in 2015 now this is

685
00:32:17,609 --> 00:32:21,149
where I have to do like interpretive

686
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:24,330
dance or something instead of showing

687
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:27,000
you the pathways but both of these

688
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:29,460
enzymes function in glucosinolate

689
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:34,799
metabolism most of you are probably

690
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:36,390
familiar with Lukas and lights yes but

691
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,750
for those who have not at least you have

692
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:43,290
if you like wasabi for example because

693
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:45,720
it's the horseradish or mustard those

694
00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:47,849
those books only degradation products

695
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:52,529
that give those compound products their

696
00:32:47,849 --> 00:32:55,139
flavor so sip 83 a1 and sip a t3 d1 are

697
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:58,319
enzymes of glucose in light biosynthesis

698
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:01,590
and yet a distinct pathway from tunnel

699
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:03,419
appropriate AB ilysm distinct you can

700
00:33:01,589 --> 00:33:05,308
see on the right is distinct from the

701
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:09,630
pathway on the left it isn't there

702
00:33:05,308 --> 00:33:11,490
anymore and yet it these blockages at

703
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:16,040
these point at these enzymes are

704
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:16,039
affecting subtle programs have ilysm

705
00:33:16,339 --> 00:33:22,279
what Jonghyun went on to show was that

706
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:25,799
so this is a more in-depth analysis of

707
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:30,160
this rf5 mutant what she showed was that

708
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:33,960
if you if she blocked in the rf5 mutant

709
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:35,370
baby 3 B 1 sin upon Mallett levels were

710
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:39,100
downregulated

711
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:42,549
if she blocked the enzyme before it in

712
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:47,709
the pathway simple malate levels were

713
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:49,779
actually elevated and this this genetic

714
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:53,140
Legion is actually epistatic to this one

715
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:56,500
so if you make a double mutant these

716
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:59,890
sinop O'Malley levels are elevated so

717
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:02,950
that says two things one is it looks

718
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:04,930
like it could be a compound between this

719
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:08,349
block and this enzyme and this enzyme

720
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:10,360
that's responsible for leading to the

721
00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:14,739
down regulation of phenol propanol tabal

722
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:17,410
ISM and also that this this cross talk

723
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:19,709
between glucosinolate synthesis and

724
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:22,449
found appropriately metabolism is

725
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:25,090
relevant in a wild-type context because

726
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:30,369
when you knock it out sinop O'Malley

727
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:32,620
levels actually go up so here is a

728
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:36,609
little bit of a schematic that did

729
00:34:32,619 --> 00:34:42,250
survive the slide debacle here this

730
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:45,250
morning and so the idea here that is

731
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:47,199
that there are two types of good

732
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:50,050
simulates that are made in Rab drops and

733
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:54,399
the finding driver ones in which disobey

734
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:57,610
t3 a1 functions to form an album as an

735
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:00,579
intermediate and tryptophane derive Guk

736
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:05,320
assimilates in which city 3d1

737
00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:08,349
functions again to for Maldek seems this

738
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:13,570
crosstalk appears to somehow affect

739
00:35:08,349 --> 00:35:17,589
phenylpropanolamine and jung in by doing

740
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:21,300
a suppressor screen so she took the ref

741
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:25,240
five mutants remuda Jen eyes those and

742
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:30,220
looked for plants that were blue in the

743
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:33,159
m2 generation she found in a thing which

744
00:35:30,219 --> 00:35:36,809
I a discovery which I still feel like

745
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:40,359
we're extremely lucky turns out to be

746
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:43,650
the suppressors turned out to be med

747
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:46,920
five one of the two subunits

748
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:48,778
so this crosstalk again now between two

749
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,838
pathways rather than within one pathway

750
00:35:48,778 --> 00:35:53,400
is dependent upon mediator and she also

751
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:57,659
went on to show that the same

752
00:35:53,400 --> 00:36:00,869
suppression would would be it was seen

753
00:35:57,659 --> 00:36:04,288
when she crossed the Med five mutant

754
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:06,119
into the rf2 background which is the sub

755
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:09,839
eighty-three a one involved in Metheny

756
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:13,019
derived al vaccine synthesis so that

757
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:17,730
other blockage in the previous slide

758
00:36:13,018 --> 00:36:24,618
that I mentioned this one here sub 79 B

759
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:29,849
2 and B 3 is the enzyme that converts

760
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:33,749
these these amino acids to the two there

761
00:36:29,849 --> 00:36:35,548
L dog seems so again we block here we

762
00:36:33,748 --> 00:36:38,209
get an accumulation of al vaccine it's

763
00:36:35,548 --> 00:36:42,380
perceived by Med 5 and that somehow

764
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:46,608
impinges on phenylpropanolamine tables

765
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:50,519
so they try and determine how that

766
00:36:46,608 --> 00:36:52,018
perturbation was enforced what was

767
00:36:50,518 --> 00:36:52,979
responsible what was involved in that

768
00:36:52,018 --> 00:36:56,778
crosstalk

769
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:59,880
jungnam did a rna-seq experiment and

770
00:36:56,778 --> 00:37:01,829
it's somewhat complicated because she's

771
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:06,289
comparing four different lines so she's

772
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:08,940
comparing rf5 ref - and then ref live

773
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:11,160
with mediator knockout and ref - with a

774
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,720
mediator knockout so what she was

775
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:15,268
looking for rather than explaining it

776
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:18,028
through here I'd rather use these sort

777
00:37:15,268 --> 00:37:21,268
of cartoons what she was looking for to

778
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:24,480
find genes involved in this crosstalk

779
00:37:21,268 --> 00:37:28,439
was genes that were upregulated in both

780
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,210
ref 5 and ref - who's up regulation was

781
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,700
mediate or dependent so that when we

782
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:35,489
looked at breath 5 min 5 and ref -

783
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:38,219
mid-fight they went down or the other

784
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:40,108
way around genes that were down

785
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:42,538
regulated in the meat in these mutants

786
00:37:40,108 --> 00:37:47,150
that went back up to normal in the

787
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:51,599
double and so those are represented by

788
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:55,230
53 genes at 18 genes which is a

789
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:59,400
manageable list and from

790
00:37:55,230 --> 00:38:02,280
that she was able to identify two genes

791
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,380
that uh that were a particular interest

792
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:09,300
that met beckon spectacles criteria and

793
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:13,410
these are Celts repeat F box proteins

794
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:18,300
number 39 and number 50 so these are

795
00:38:13,409 --> 00:38:21,690
upregulated in the glucosinolate mutants

796
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:24,960
and that upregulation is abolished when

797
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:28,970
we knock out med five same over here and

798
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:34,710
what do these things do these are

799
00:38:28,969 --> 00:38:37,469
proteins are components of the process

800
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:38,400
that targets proteins for degradation by

801
00:38:37,469 --> 00:38:41,368
the proteasome

802
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,250
in fact these KF d proteins are known to

803
00:38:41,369 --> 00:38:46,289
interact with pal and target it for

804
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:48,150
degradation tells the first enzyme of

805
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:51,029
some appropriate pathway and I've

806
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:53,039
represented the proteasome was it with a

807
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:54,300
garbage disposal and I apologize if

808
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,849
there's anyone here who works on the

809
00:38:54,300 --> 00:39:02,670
proteasome and I compared your work to

810
00:38:56,849 --> 00:39:07,679
that anyway so in fact when she goes and

811
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:10,079
measures a pal activity in in these

812
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:12,989
various lines she does indeed see that

813
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:15,779
in the lines that are upregulated for K

814
00:39:12,989 --> 00:39:18,750
the KF be proteins pal activity is down

815
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:21,510
and when we bring in the mediator

816
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:26,400
mutations that that the pal activity is

817
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:29,210
no longer reduced and in fact she's gone

818
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:33,510
on to knock out those KF b proteins and

819
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:36,990
to summarize a large large array of

820
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:41,100
different mutants if she takes the rest

821
00:39:36,989 --> 00:39:42,659
v mutant and which has reduced levels of

822
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:44,880
Sinope O'Mally does it of course i've

823
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:48,379
been saying and knocks out these three

824
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:51,240
KF b proteins we get restoration of

825
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:53,039
appropriate metabolism so it seems that

826
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:56,459
out of that rna-seq experiment she was

827
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:58,829
actually able to identify the least one

828
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:03,990
protein that was or two proteins that

829
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:06,750
were responsible for this crosstalk okay

830
00:40:03,989 --> 00:40:08,078
well I want to conclude with a final

831
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:10,119
story

832
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:14,769
about that goes back to the original

833
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:17,318
mutant that we identified that led us

834
00:40:14,768 --> 00:40:20,588
into this mediator story because we

835
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:23,108
thought it would be a valuable reagent

836
00:40:20,588 --> 00:40:26,259
to start I guess

837
00:40:23,108 --> 00:40:27,880
dissecting mediator function in plants

838
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:30,759
so mediator is very well studied in

839
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:33,099
humans and in yeast and are a number of

840
00:40:30,759 --> 00:40:35,199
mutants of mediator that are that that

841
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:36,940
show its relevance to a variety of

842
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:39,929
processes flowering time and whatnot

843
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:42,759
plant pathogen interactions in plants

844
00:40:39,929 --> 00:40:48,190
but we certainly are just starting to

845
00:40:42,759 --> 00:40:52,208
scrape the surface so a former graduate

846
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:55,329
student of mine did a another suppressor

847
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:59,078
screen as a way to start probing this

848
00:40:55,329 --> 00:41:02,619
and so here's Columbia wild-type and the

849
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:05,499
ref for three mutant the dwarf and and

850
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:09,450
the very the three knockouts and so my

851
00:41:05,498 --> 00:41:12,159
student did a suppressor screen looking

852
00:41:09,449 --> 00:41:15,669
remute agonizing rough for three plants

853
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:23,708
and looking for plants that were now

854
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:26,369
blue under UV or big or both and the

855
00:41:23,708 --> 00:41:30,489
idea behind it is to identify other

856
00:41:26,369 --> 00:41:34,209
proteins that are required for this

857
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:40,028
dominant form of this med five subunit

858
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:42,929
to exert its action and so we so my

859
00:41:40,028 --> 00:41:44,858
student identified this array of

860
00:41:42,929 --> 00:41:46,629
suppressor mutants and handed this

861
00:41:44,858 --> 00:41:51,880
project off to it to another grad

862
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:53,949
student and what she did was quantify

863
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,690
simple malate levels as well as lignin

864
00:41:53,949 --> 00:41:58,239
but I'll just focus on this for today

865
00:41:55,690 --> 00:42:00,880
but also sequence all of those

866
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:06,219
suppressors and identify the genes in

867
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:10,719
which they were defective so it's it's

868
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:16,420
um although each mutant has carries

869
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:19,179
about 200 EMS inducible mutations in the

870
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:21,400
open reading frames of the genome by

871
00:42:19,179 --> 00:42:22,059
looking for taking a candidate gene

872
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,150
approach and

873
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:28,360
for genes that are mutated in common

874
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:31,300
basically an in silico ilysm test we

875
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:34,269
were easily able to identify the genes

876
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:38,280
that were that were responsible

877
00:42:34,269 --> 00:42:41,530
so in these in these mutants we find a

878
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:43,900
sort of a spread of restoration of

879
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:49,750
phenol propanol metabolism the black

880
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:53,170
lines represent intragenic mutations in

881
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:55,679
med fine so if we turn this protein with

882
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:58,360
this one g2s mutation into a

883
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:03,250
constitutive a dominant break on the

884
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:05,200
pathway if we then knock it knock it out

885
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:09,010
we would expect to see a reversal of

886
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:12,699
that phenotype and indeed we do although

887
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:16,200
it's at various levels but the other

888
00:43:12,699 --> 00:43:18,909
thing that came out of the screen was

889
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:21,879
mutants in three different mediator

890
00:43:18,909 --> 00:43:24,690
subunits different one so this is med

891
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:28,900
two camed sixteen and mid twenty three

892
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:33,610
these are all in the tail of mediator

893
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:36,579
are thought to be with Med 5 and so

894
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:39,039
we're right now in the in the well you

895
00:43:36,579 --> 00:43:43,230
see it's listed as submitted here we're

896
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:45,759
understanding how these different

897
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:47,980
mediator knockouts might affect gene

898
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,620
expression on their own and how they

899
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:53,349
affect gene expression in the context of

900
00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:57,059
this rep for three mutation what I think

901
00:43:53,349 --> 00:44:01,150
is quite interesting is that for example

902
00:43:57,059 --> 00:44:03,489
these two this bill focus on this one

903
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:05,380
this suppressor restores by both the my

904
00:44:03,489 --> 00:44:08,500
trails take that back both of these

905
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:12,820
suppressors one in mid to one in intro

906
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:15,579
genic mutation restore growth but not

907
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:24,130
sound Pro Konami tablet so we can we can

908
00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:26,829
pull these apart again it's not the case

909
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:27,579
that if we just muck around with

910
00:44:26,829 --> 00:44:30,219
mediator

911
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:32,679
we will abolish the function of rough

912
00:44:30,219 --> 00:44:35,909
for three because here's a example of

913
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:35,909
two different

914
00:44:35,969 --> 00:44:44,230
mediator Knockouts PST one men 25 and

915
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:45,940
med three and when we cross those into

916
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:48,699
the ref for three background we don't

917
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:51,869
get restoration of growth so again it's

918
00:44:48,699 --> 00:44:54,179
not that these these results are

919
00:44:51,869 --> 00:44:56,799
specific they're it's not just a case of

920
00:44:54,179 --> 00:44:58,869
perturbing the tale of mediator that

921
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:04,000
restores the flocks breath for three

922
00:44:58,869 --> 00:45:07,509
function okay when you went on to do an

923
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:11,889
RNA seek experiment and found then I

924
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:14,470
guess a continuing theme in that in ref

925
00:45:11,889 --> 00:45:16,619
four three this what one of the same kfb

926
00:45:14,469 --> 00:45:19,869
proteins involved in pal degradation is

927
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:23,619
dramatically up regulated and in her

928
00:45:19,869 --> 00:45:25,989
suppressors there they are restored to

929
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:30,069
near to near normal suggesting that this

930
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:34,299
pal degradation is again in this context

931
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:38,530
responsible for the phenotypes that we

932
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:40,930
see in this view so I can just wrap up

933
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:46,080
now and say well so here's our here are

934
00:45:40,929 --> 00:45:48,849
our models then so looking at the

935
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:51,279
glucosinolate example we have a cross

936
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:54,299
talk between two pathways that is

937
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:57,519
mediator dependent where if we block

938
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:59,740
phenyl scintillate synthesis and that

939
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:00,610
leads to the accumulation of these al

940
00:45:59,739 --> 00:46:03,069
vaccines

941
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:06,880
these are perceived somehow by med

942
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:10,330
5-week and we lead to up regulation of

943
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:13,150
these kfb proteins which target pal for

944
00:46:10,329 --> 00:46:15,989
degradation and therefore we reduce the

945
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:19,329
downstream components of this pathway in

946
00:46:15,989 --> 00:46:21,159
the case of anthocyanins we think

947
00:46:19,329 --> 00:46:25,150
there's a similar thing going on where

948
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:27,909
when we block at 5h there's a buildup of

949
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:32,889
an upstream metabolite that is perceived

950
00:46:27,909 --> 00:46:37,389
by med 5 or directly or indirectly that

951
00:46:32,889 --> 00:46:38,769
also turns on kfb decreases pal and in a

952
00:46:37,389 --> 00:46:39,759
Cell probably in a cell type-specific

953
00:46:38,769 --> 00:46:44,259
way

954
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:46,300
knocks down an assignment synthesis with

955
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:49,630
rf8 it's a little bit more complicated

956
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:53,528
we do know that kfb gene expression is

957
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:55,710
chanced in this in this that very dwarf

958
00:46:53,528 --> 00:46:58,179
mutant that we had at c3 prime age

959
00:46:55,710 --> 00:47:00,548
perhaps again because of a buildup of

960
00:46:58,179 --> 00:47:04,179
some metabolite but there are there's

961
00:47:00,548 --> 00:47:06,940
another huge set of changes in gene

962
00:47:04,179 --> 00:47:09,278
expression that lead to dwarfing that

963
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:12,940
are med five dependence so it's a more

964
00:47:09,278 --> 00:47:16,179
complicated story and in the case of ref

965
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:18,759
four three we have in fact a mutant form

966
00:47:16,179 --> 00:47:20,710
of this Med 5 protein that has the

967
00:47:18,759 --> 00:47:23,829
ability to constitutively turn on this

968
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:30,849
kfb protein leading to pala beg relation

969
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:33,490
and an impact on phenol program so I

970
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:36,460
hope I've convinced you that mediator is

971
00:47:33,489 --> 00:47:40,118
involved in phenol provide homeostasis

972
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:43,298
we were we would desperately like to

973
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:45,160
know what it's perceiving and how its

974
00:47:43,298 --> 00:47:51,059
perceiving it and we have efforts going

975
00:47:45,159 --> 00:47:54,759
on in the lab to try and figure that out

976
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:57,278
the in that first example the dwarfing

977
00:47:54,759 --> 00:47:58,809
that we've seen in low lignin clamps can

978
00:47:57,278 --> 00:48:00,579
be suppressed genetically we always

979
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:03,250
thought it was a sort of a mechanical

980
00:48:00,579 --> 00:48:05,470
problem to do with water transport but

981
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:11,369
there's it's much more complicated than

982
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:15,548
that involving a mediator and AD has

983
00:48:11,369 --> 00:48:18,220
aberrations in gene expression this kfp

984
00:48:15,548 --> 00:48:20,469
net mediated degradation of pal

985
00:48:18,219 --> 00:48:23,980
seems to be a common mechanism for

986
00:48:20,469 --> 00:48:26,259
regulating this pathway previous to that

987
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:27,759
and and and I really shouldn't end this

988
00:48:26,259 --> 00:48:30,880
talk without mentioning that this was

989
00:48:27,759 --> 00:48:34,539
this whole this whole idea was first

990
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:38,470
identified by CJ Liu at Brookhaven and

991
00:48:34,539 --> 00:48:40,420
without without that knowledge that he

992
00:48:38,469 --> 00:48:42,759
contributed to the literature we still

993
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:45,278
wouldn't understand what was going on

994
00:48:42,759 --> 00:48:47,889
this seems so before that we really

995
00:48:45,278 --> 00:48:50,018
thought that it was feedback from

996
00:48:47,889 --> 00:48:52,568
cinemate the product of the enzyme so

997
00:48:50,018 --> 00:48:57,068
this is a really important new paradigm

998
00:48:52,568 --> 00:48:58,719
I think and I would also say that I

999
00:48:57,068 --> 00:49:01,028
mentioned it in passing we have these

1000
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:03,279
h.length implants we've got g ligaments

1001
00:49:01,028 --> 00:49:06,880
forget s ligaments these

1002
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:09,460
these plants with modified lignans are I

1003
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:13,390
think theory going to be could be

1004
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:15,599
valuable for biorefinery in this

1005
00:49:13,389 --> 00:49:20,049
industry if that ever really gets going

1006
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:21,759
because it's taking a important run

1007
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:23,740
abundant product in the plant cell wall

1008
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,620
and turning it into something with more

1009
00:49:23,739 --> 00:49:29,289
defined characteristics and then thereby

1010
00:49:26,619 --> 00:49:32,739
could be more easily converted to

1011
00:49:29,289 --> 00:49:35,650
downstream products of value and with

1012
00:49:32,739 --> 00:49:38,319
that I guess I would like to thank

1013
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:40,389
people who did the work

1014
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:42,039
Nicky Anderson and Nick Bono it's Nick

1015
00:49:40,389 --> 00:49:44,739
Bono it's worked on all the rough 8

1016
00:49:42,039 --> 00:49:47,079
suppression stuff Nick and Nick together

1017
00:49:44,739 --> 00:49:50,199
on the anthocyanin project jeongnam on

1018
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:52,900
the gooks inlay project and Whitney and

1019
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:55,329
Jake on the rep for three suppressor

1020
00:49:52,900 --> 00:50:00,670
project and also my collaborators John

1021
00:49:55,329 --> 00:50:04,329
did the new key who did the NMR and CJ

1022
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:07,630
and Brian delts for help with the

1023
00:50:04,329 --> 00:50:09,849
sequencing and suppressor analysis and

1024
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:13,289
with that I will say thank you very much

1025
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:13,289
for your attention in the invitation

1026
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:21,099
[Applause]

1027
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:34,539
yeah

1028
00:50:30,869 --> 00:50:38,710
so I have a question about fit work to

1029
00:50:34,539 --> 00:50:40,570
work between the so it might be slightly

1030
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:42,309
different angle from this matter but

1031
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:44,980
there's a music school division

1032
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:47,739
variances which can seriously over it's

1033
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:50,230
justa little against it and that a lot

1034
00:50:47,739 --> 00:50:53,469
of religion may be written to work and

1035
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:55,990
somehow I just think there is a link

1036
00:50:53,469 --> 00:50:59,799
between just to be good so it's like I

1037
00:50:55,989 --> 00:51:05,169
said it's also from any line io signa

1038
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:07,960
right so is there any to think micro but

1039
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:10,300
the democratic you over experienced in

1040
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:13,539
Pacifica practically matters in distance

1041
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:15,220
because all people simply argue that if

1042
00:51:13,539 --> 00:51:17,559
you have a lot of different mechanisms

1043
00:51:15,219 --> 00:51:20,799
we look like overexpression so I guess

1044
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:24,489
then the energy distribution of the plan

1045
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:27,850
would be more viable differences and of

1046
00:51:24,489 --> 00:51:31,809
course submit so I think we need another

1047
00:51:27,849 --> 00:51:35,440
one of these efficient of people that

1048
00:51:31,809 --> 00:51:37,059
are all building okay so there's a

1049
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,539
there's a lot rolled up into that

1050
00:51:37,059 --> 00:51:42,210
classic ah so let me let me tell you

1051
00:51:40,539 --> 00:51:46,210
what little I know about it

1052
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:49,240
so first of all yes there's growth

1053
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:53,349
defense trade-offs quantitatively lignin

1054
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:54,909
is vastly more abundant than than si so

1055
00:51:53,349 --> 00:51:58,239
whatever we're doing with lignin

1056
00:51:54,909 --> 00:52:00,549
although it could add to si

1057
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:03,549
I don't think how much si appliance

1058
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:07,390
makes is really closely tied to lignin

1059
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:09,160
abundance I would also say that my other

1060
00:52:07,389 --> 00:52:11,049
my one of my other grad students will be

1061
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:14,079
very happy to hear the us as question

1062
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:19,150
because I didn't have time to talk about

1063
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:21,579
it today but with when once when he had

1064
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:23,889
basically completed her rep for three

1065
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:27,219
suppressor analysis

1066
00:52:23,889 --> 00:52:30,339
my other student Candide asked whether

1067
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:31,269
the CD k-8 kinase module which is known

1068
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:32,910
to have

1069
00:52:31,269 --> 00:52:37,900
repressive effects on transcription

1070
00:52:32,909 --> 00:52:43,329
could be involved in the phenotypes that

1071
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:46,360
we see in the rough 4-3 mutant so she

1072
00:52:43,329 --> 00:52:48,299
showed that it was that knocking out see

1073
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:51,309
bk8

1074
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:55,890
reverses dwarfism but has no effect on

1075
00:52:51,309 --> 00:53:00,639
sunup Rokinon metabolism and looking at

1076
00:52:55,889 --> 00:53:06,879
her transcriptome data she saw that sa

1077
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:12,429
synthesis conjugation and response genes

1078
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:14,650
were all up regulated so she said all

1079
00:53:12,429 --> 00:53:17,529
it's it's let's test the hypothesis that

1080
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:21,940
si is involved in the dwarfing and so

1081
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:26,560
she knocked it out with by crossing in

1082
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:30,610
cid to mutation and found that sid -

1083
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:32,799
does not it reduces si si si

1084
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:38,010
accumulation is expected but it had no

1085
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:40,900
effect on growth of this mutant so I

1086
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:42,700
can't say it doesn't contribute at all

1087
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:46,900
but there are other factors that are

1088
00:53:42,699 --> 00:53:53,799
more important in that particular case I

1089
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:56,740
guess yeah just about the mediator that

1090
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:58,480
target regulation for like responsive

1091
00:53:56,739 --> 00:54:00,759
doing so many different thing

1092
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,650
are they like falls out of genus

1093
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:05,350
regulated you see related pathways it

1094
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:07,510
could be like related like you're

1095
00:54:05,349 --> 00:54:10,059
decreasing the width of them that you

1096
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:13,320
want to take James like that it's just

1097
00:54:10,059 --> 00:54:15,400
like it's regulating all types of things

1098
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:19,480
well certainly there's many different

1099
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:20,980
pathways that are that are perturbed

1100
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:23,679
when you knock of different mediator

1101
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:25,030
subunits I mean Keogh analysis will

1102
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:26,108
always tell you that right no matter

1103
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:32,109
what set of genes you look at

1104
00:54:26,108 --> 00:54:36,849
practically but with regard with regard

1105
00:54:32,108 --> 00:54:39,069
to but the glucosinolate crosstalk I'm

1106
00:54:36,849 --> 00:54:41,319
still of two minds about that that whole

1107
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:44,200
story and I we've been trying to

1108
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:46,630
actually ask the question is this

1109
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:49,029
as you sort of framed it I don't think I

1110
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:50,890
did but I think it's reasonable that you

1111
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:52,900
did that you would want to have

1112
00:54:50,889 --> 00:54:54,848
crosstalk to coordinate the two pathways

1113
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:56,500
you know there might be some situation

1114
00:54:54,849 --> 00:54:58,000
where you want to use some appropriate

1115
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:00,130
eyes for defense and other times when

1116
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:06,088
you want to use Google Sites okay that's

1117
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:08,410
that's a good model or is it kind of a

1118
00:55:06,088 --> 00:55:10,719
pharmacological effect so we know we can

1119
00:55:08,409 --> 00:55:13,179
do a chemical biology experiment and we

1120
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:16,088
can add compounds exogenous ly to yeast

1121
00:55:13,179 --> 00:55:19,779
or seedlings or whatever and see an

1122
00:55:16,088 --> 00:55:20,519
effect on a pathway on growth something

1123
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:23,859
like that

1124
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:25,300
so is this crosstalk something that

1125
00:55:23,858 --> 00:55:27,909
operates like that

1126
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:32,019
just so happens that these al doc scenes

1127
00:55:27,909 --> 00:55:34,598
have this effect or or are they is this

1128
00:55:32,019 --> 00:55:39,759
cross a truly important for biology

1129
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:43,539
I would I would think that if such a

1130
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:49,150
pharmacological effect exists it it must

1131
00:55:43,539 --> 00:55:52,838
exist sort of as a precursor to the

1132
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:54,970
evolution of important important

1133
00:55:52,838 --> 00:55:56,108
coordination between pathways if you if

1134
00:55:54,969 --> 00:55:58,629
you know it there's got to be something

1135
00:55:56,108 --> 00:56:00,489
for evolution to work on so until there

1136
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:02,619
is something like that I don't know how

1137
00:56:00,489 --> 00:56:06,338
you sieve all

1138
00:56:02,619 --> 00:56:11,710
pardon that's or teleology such an such

1139
00:56:06,338 --> 00:56:13,900
a crosstalk so I'm I'm reluctant to say

1140
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:16,838
that this is really metabolic

1141
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:18,190
coordination although it could be that

1142
00:56:16,838 --> 00:56:18,639
means I'm not sure that answers your

1143
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:23,260
question

1144
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:27,009
little bit yeah so Louis regards FIFA

1145
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:30,609
evidence that there was such specific

1146
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:33,460
variations as you're seeing for example

1147
00:56:30,608 --> 00:56:36,279
around restitution it's not not slimming

1148
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:40,210
policies compared to the example cells

1149
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:43,060
but maybe one-time work UV filter cell

1150
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:45,789
type specialization within lonely and

1151
00:56:43,059 --> 00:56:48,009
see different interactions or degrees of

1152
00:56:45,789 --> 00:56:51,068
Expressionism as I would thought this

1153
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:53,079
idea that spinkle it's pronounced

1154
00:56:51,068 --> 00:56:54,789
satellites different generations right

1155
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:55,640
so but at the same time we have that we

1156
00:56:54,789 --> 00:56:59,239
have the

1157
00:56:55,639 --> 00:57:02,480
ask whether that's coming about because

1158
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:04,309
of as a result of what mediator is doing

1159
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,710
or whether it's coming about because of

1160
00:57:04,309 --> 00:57:09,019
where just by happenstance there is an

1161
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:11,630
overlap between books and later found

1162
00:57:09,019 --> 00:57:15,769
propanol metabolism did you see any

1163
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:22,119
predominant expression with it it sounds

1164
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:26,539
like of of what we don't have that

1165
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:28,880
information it's not we don't see it at

1166
00:57:26,539 --> 00:57:32,840
very high levels and it's actually been

1167
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:35,329
a big pain to do the biochemistry you

1168
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:38,300
have to actually be looking at to go

1169
00:57:35,329 --> 00:57:40,429
back to cell cultures meristematic cells

1170
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:43,370
seem to be where it's expressed most

1171
00:57:40,429 --> 00:57:49,219
highly but we're actually trying to get

1172
00:57:43,369 --> 00:57:52,670
at this question by installing the al

1173
00:57:49,219 --> 00:57:55,459
Doc seem synthesize the enzymes of 79 in

1174
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:58,220
non glucosinolate producing plants to

1175
00:57:55,460 --> 00:58:00,019
ask do you see the same impact on film

1176
00:57:58,219 --> 00:58:02,449
program metabolism because that would

1177
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:10,250
argue that it is a pharmacological

1178
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:12,949
effect perhaps so very question Gino is

1179
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:21,590
anticipating regulation I thought for

1180
00:58:12,949 --> 00:58:25,939
the mediator uh I don't know um if you

1181
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:28,430
really see very little interesting

1182
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:30,650
things when you look at expression

1183
00:58:28,429 --> 00:58:33,259
analysis of a mediator complex and maybe

1184
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:37,550
that's because you know it's required

1185
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:40,130
for most regulated gene expression and

1186
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:42,610
so it has to be everywhere again you do

1187
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:47,510
see it as some of the subunits up in

1188
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:50,860
their stems and whether that reflects

1189
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:53,870
particular role for those subunits or

1190
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:55,190
just higher requirements for

1191
00:58:53,869 --> 00:58:57,250
transcription in those cells I don't

1192
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:57,250
know

1193
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:06,530
okay for the question space would be

1194
00:59:09,739 --> 00:59:18,019
disgusting a production of Cornell

1195
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:18,019
