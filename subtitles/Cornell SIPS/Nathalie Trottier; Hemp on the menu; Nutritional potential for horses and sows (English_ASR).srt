This is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:14,798
University. But most of you know me. I'm

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,519
Lucia Vignell. I'm organizing the annual

4
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:20,399
hemp webinar this year. I am a thirdyear

00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:23,118
PhD candidate in the Larry Smart Lab at

6
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,879
Cornell University and I'm working on

7
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:28,320
Heraldu.

8
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:30,719
Today's presenter is professor Natalie

recently an interest in the pharm

23
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,000
pharmacocinetics of canabonoids and the

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,319
nutritional application of hemp seed

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,719
meal in horse and swine diets. As a

26
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:13,839
quick reminder before we start, as we've

27
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:15,519
been doing this before, please use the

28
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,920
chat for greetings and other

29
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:21,759
communications and submit your questions

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,640
for Natalie using the Q&amp;A button. The

31
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,920
talk would last approximately 40 minutes

32
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,879
and we'll follow it with a Q&amp;A session.

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,799
We'll thank Natalie at the end and a

34
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,438
reminder that we are recording the

35
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,759
webinar and we are going to later upload

36
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:43,639
it to our school of integrative plant

37
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:47,040
sciences YouTube channel. And with that,

38
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,680
Natalie, please take the floor.

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,360
Thank you so much,

40
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,240
Lucia, for the introduction. So, I'm

41
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:57,200
going to share my slides here. All

42
00:01:54,239 --> 00:02:00,000
right. So welcome again and thank you to

43
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,079
uh the Cornell University Hemp webinar

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,319
series for hosting this session. So

45
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:09,239
today I'll be uh discussing the

46
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:12,878
nutritional opportunities

47
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:16,080
um sorry trying to get this going here

48
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:21,719
presented by Hempy Mill particularly

49
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,719
uh in the diets of horses and and s

50
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,719
uh here is what I'll cover today. Uh the

51
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,519
presentation is split into uh two parts.

52
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:36,479
Uh the first half I'll be reviewing the

53
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,840
digestive strategies of horses and pigs,

54
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:42,079
the structural carbohydrate meats, um in

55
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,920
particular the neutral detergent fiber

56
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,599
or

57
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:49,039
MDF. Um and the scenarios when

58
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:52,560
concentrate feeds are used for horses.

59
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:55,039
uh we'll also look at the unique feeding

60
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,120
behavior of gestating cells and the

61
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:02,158
growing body of evidence that support uh

62
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,640
fiber enrichments in their diets and so

63
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:07,519
how we can see really a place for hemp

64
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:10,158
seed meal in particular in pregnant

65
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,959
cells and of course horses at all stage

66
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:15,759
of their life cycle. So the second half

67
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,319
of this presentation um basically will

68
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:22,318
focus specifically on hemp seed meal.

69
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:25,518
its uh protein quality. Um the um

70
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:28,318
basically um how can it be sort of like

71
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,200
how it is that it potentially be be the

72
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,518
perfect ingredient for horses. Um just

73
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,479
presenting some of the very very few

74
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,719
findings that we have out there for

75
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:40,878
horses. Um but basically we can really

76
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:44,799
make a good case study for this. And

77
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:46,639
then finally um you know hope for s. So

78
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,879
we'll be using a little bit of data out

79
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:51,639
there from pigs, growing pigs and how we

80
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:55,039
can extrapolate that to

81
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:57,598
cells. So um you know I'm it's difficult

82
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,840
for me to really steer away from

83
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,438
nutrition and physiology completely when

84
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,158
I give a talk because that's my

85
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:07,280
expertise, right? But I think what I'd

86
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:12,000
like to do here is make the case that

87
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,560
uh pigs um and horses of course are um

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,079
relying on on fiber. Horses being an

89
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,280
obligate herbivore must have fibers uh

90
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,840
in their diet. So uh you know just here

91
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,478
a little bit of taxonomy briefly I don't

92
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,399
want to lose you or bore you to death.

93
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,639
Uh but some of them some of you might

94
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,519
find this also interesting is that here

95
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,560
we have uh ruminance bidday survey and

96
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:39,599
we have our pigs. Um so those families

97
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,360
belong to the order artactula and to the

98
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,439
right we have horses

99
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,560
rhinosier these belong to the periscula

100
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,040
order and um you know besides the fact

101
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,160
that uh those two different orders are

102
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,479
separated by the fact that here we have

103
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:01,439
uneven toes and here we have even toes.

104
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:04,079
Um, suede day or pigs differ from the

105
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:07,360
rest of these guys here in their d in

106
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,719
their digestive strategy. Um, so you

107
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,960
know, so we're looking at these guys

108
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,199
being mainly ruminants in terms of their

109
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,120
digestive strategies. They had a complex

110
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,199
stomach. They do forgot fermentation and

111
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:22,000
rumination except for hippos and pigs.

112
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,720
So pigs are really interesting because

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,279
they follow a digestive strategy

114
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,600
somewhat similar to what we have in

115
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,918
horses. They have a simple stomach. They

116
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,840
have a highly developed large intestine.

117
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:37,279
And so they do quite a bit of hind gut

118
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:40,000
fermentation. And therefore we're trying

119
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:43,038
to especially the last 10 years really

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,680
push more fibers in pig diets even in

121
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:48,478
the little guys that just got u a few

122
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,478
weeks after weaning. as we have uh

123
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,918
moving away from antibiotics and

124
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:55,918
realizing that fibers serve as

125
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:59,198
probiotics and providing those animal

126
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:02,240
with potential additional gut immunity.

127
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:05,199
So um lots of fun stuff out there. So

128
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,079
again, what I'd like to do here is uh

129
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,319
move on and just contrast quickly here

130
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:12,719
so we don't get into nitty nitty-gritty

131
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,879
of cats and dogs, but just to contrast

132
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,400
that cats and dogs um are very

133
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,800
different, right? They have simple

134
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:23,799
stomachs. Uh the stomachs is the

135
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,240
stomachs are are large. There's no

136
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,680
fermentation in the for gut, of course,

137
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,319
but in their large intestine, uh cats

138
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,240
very limited. and dogs moderate. And

139
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,720
more and more we're seeing actually some

140
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,199
fibers added in dog diets and

141
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,919
potentially hemp seed meal uh could find

142
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,000
a place in dog diets at some point

143
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:46,240
replacing in part some of the flax seed

144
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,240
meal that is actually really popular in

145
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,840
dog food but that's for another talk

146
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,879
later on potentially. Right. Um so here

147
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:58,799
let's look at um the digestive tract

148
00:06:54,879 --> 00:07:02,000
capacity again to show you convince you

149
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,319
um that um hempseed meal has a place in

150
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,879
diet for pigs uh but certainly for

151
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:11,759
horses right? So um here basically uh

152
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:15,279
this graph basically emphasizes how much

153
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:18,560
digestive capacity in horses is devoted

154
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:20,879
to the large intestine where fi fiber

155
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,319
fermentation occurs. So we have the

156
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:27,839
secum here the stomach small intestine

157
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,680
seeum and colon those together form the

158
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,399
large

159
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:35,199
intestine right. So seeum and the pig

160
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:38,079
and the horse and the dog very tiny very

161
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,960
small capacity and then basically the

162
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:45,359
colon and the horse very large capacity

163
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:48,239
followed by the pig and the dog again uh

164
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,199
not too much but some potential. The

165
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,280
point being here is that um the large

166
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,319
intestine in the horuses consists of

167
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:58,799
basically capacity wise 65% of the

168
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,360
entire GR tract which is amazing when

169
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,800
you think about this. And pigs actually

170
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,199
is 41%. So it's quite um it's quite

171
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,840
important nonetheless. And then we have

172
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,759
our dogs that where we're thinking more

173
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,878
and more that we should be increasing

174
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:19,840
fibers in their diet. But definitely uh

175
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:22,160
pigs um pregnant sves in particular

176
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:24,638
where we're uh showing more and more

177
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,520
evidence that we need to push the fibers

178
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,840
in their diets. Horses number one,

179
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:33,038
right? We always start with forage in

180
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:36,079
their diet before anything else. Right?

181
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:38,679
So again here so if we're looking at uh

182
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,120
the slides when we consider forage

183
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:44,639
quality and alignment with digestive

184
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:48,240
phys with physiology we look at MDF

185
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:51,439
right so MDF low NDF diets typically

186
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,080
under 5% will provide a minimal uh

187
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,560
fermentation

188
00:08:53,080 --> 00:09:00,080
support um typically what you'd see um

189
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:02,000
in in uh in dog diets or or carniv

190
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,639
carnivoran diets and then we're moving

191
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,480
on to a diet containing between six and

192
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,519
20%

193
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,159
uh NDF right which is the fibers uh that

194
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,720
you find in the plant cell wall so the

195
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:17,439
structural fibers not the water soluble

196
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,360
fibers or the rapidly fermentable fibers

197
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,480
so these are structural fibers that we

198
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,519
find in the plant cell wall uh in this

199
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,879
case um basically moderate diets you

200
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,919
know provide some fermented fer uh

201
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:34,720
fermentable substrate uh but it's really

202
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:38,360
the high NDF diets, you know, those

203
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,959
between 45 and 60% that best match the

204
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:46,000
fermentation capacity of fine gut

205
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:49,359
species like horses. Um, in pigs, fiber

206
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
fermentation uh plays a lesser role, but

207
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,800
still very valuable role, especially in

208
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,600
sales where fiber is increasingly being

209
00:09:54,799 --> 00:10:00,159
linked to long-term productivity and

210
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,320
improved gut health. Uh this area is

211
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:05,919
still developing. Lots of fun stuff out

212
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,200
there. Um and a lot of interest in de in

213
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:11,079
optimizing fiber for pigs. Uh is really

214
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,720
clearly

215
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:17,440
growing. So again, clearly what is this

216
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,879
picture telling you? Besides looking a

217
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:24,320
little bit scary, um horses are obligate

218
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:26,480
herbivores. They do require this um

219
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,519
carbohydrates that you find you find in

220
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:35,039
the plant cell. all number one and then

221
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:37,679
pigs um again um they uh would benefit

222
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,958
immensely especially sounds uh from a

223
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:43,278
high fiber

224
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:45,119
diet. Moving on here, uh let's look more

225
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,439
specifically at the recommended fiber

226
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,399
levels for horses. For example, for

227
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,079
optimal digestive health, horses should

228
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,360
contain a minimum of 40% MDF and ideally

229
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:59,278
up to 60%.

230
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:02,000
Um now these structural carbohydrates

231
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:05,120
are found in plant cell walls and they

232
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,200
ferment slowly in the hind gut and this

233
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,839
helps maintain a healthy microbial

234
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,560
population and reduces the risk of

235
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,200
digestive disturbances and it's why I

236
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:17,599
keep looking at hemp seed meal as a

237
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,800
really perfect feed for horses because

238
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,040
of its very low starch and water soluble

239
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:25,479
carbohydrates it's high fiber very

240
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:28,240
moderate fat content but very

241
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,600
interesting and uh relatively high

242
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:36,000
protein content. Uh we look here at what

243
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:39,759
horses are fed number one grasses and um

244
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,519
you know alalfa as a legume. Um, we're

245
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:47,838
looking here and what we see is the NDF

246
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:49,759
content of those forages which are

247
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,959
basically again the plant cell well

248
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:54,399
structural carbohydrates align with you

249
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,599
know what we're recommending those

250
00:11:54,399 --> 00:12:00,159
horses to

251
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,759
receive. Right? So if we're looking at

252
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,919
this slide here, you wonder why I have

253
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:07,360
this force picture with a large colon

254
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:09,599
here and looking at how much room it

255
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,120
takes in the abdominal cavity. Well,

256
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,920
this is no joke, right? The problem with

257
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,919
um why structural carbohydrate matters

258
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:22,958
is that nonstructural carbohydrate like

259
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:25,360
the starch and the water soluble

260
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:28,359
carbohydrates like the fruons and the

261
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,919
simple sugars for example the

262
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,720
non-alphaglucans the oligo

263
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:35,759
polyaccharides the fruons simple sugars

264
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,480
these guys ferment really rapidly in a

265
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:40,879
large intestine so what we really want

266
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,240
is we want to have a diet with

267
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:45,879
carbohydrates that are slowly

268
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,560
fermentable, not rapidly

269
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:50,639
fermentable. Um, slowly fermentable

270
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,958
carbohydrates, they help stabilize the

271
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:57,720
gut environment and our preferred energy

272
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,719
source for uh hind gut microbes.

273
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:06,320
So here as a as a practical note

274
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:08,479
um grasses in alalfa particularly when

275
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,079
harvested at a more mature stage because

276
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,839
we want to harvest forge for horses for

277
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:17,120
volume usually uh so they're going to be

278
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:20,880
closer to a mature stage. Um they will

279
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,600
naturally contain lower uh amount of

280
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:25,120
starch. So here we can see here

281
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,879
naturally speaking they're low in

282
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,919
starch. um but um they will be lower in

283
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:35,759
starch but lower in water soluble

284
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:39,759
carbohydrate when they are um harvested

285
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:43,919
um closer to a mature stage. Okay. Again

286
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:46,639
uh protein levels in grasses align uh

287
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:49,360
even especially at the lower protein

288
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,159
concentration closer to grass maturity

289
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:57,079
aligns exactly where the horse's protein

290
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:57,078
requirement is actually at maintenance.

291
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,720
So when to add a concentrate feed, this

292
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,679
is where hemp seed meal um would be

293
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,639
finding a home in horse feed. So while

294
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:10,958
forage is the foundation of a horse

295
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,120
diet, there are cases where a

296
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:16,879
concentrate feed also known as a ration

297
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:20,078
balancer is needed. Okay, it's

298
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:22,879
especially true for horses um that are

299
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:26,719
working um they have an increased energy

300
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:29,838
and protein demand. Um, and when we have

301
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,920
forges that are higher than 60% NDF,

302
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:35,279
we're going to want to have a ration

303
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:37,360
balancer in there to meet um to meet the

304
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:40,159
energy and potentially the protein

305
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,360
needs. Uh, that might not be sufficient

306
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:47,198
in just a forge. It's just a hay diet.

307
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:50,320
So, um, in that concentrate, we want our

308
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:54,078
goal is actually to to provide energy

309
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,160
but minimi mitigating starch content. So

310
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,159
we need to limit how much grain we can

311
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,879
use in those concentrate. So could we

312
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:03,600
have an ingredient that is actually

313
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:07,838
providing quite a bit of quite a bit of

314
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,399
um fat, right? Um moderate amount of

315
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,360
protein to potentially replace entirely

316
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,919
the soybean meal in those diets. Uh

317
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,759
replacing the flax seed, which is also a

318
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:21,958
very popular ingredient in in um horse

319
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:25,679
diets. Um and

320
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:28,078
um here we have to aim for 50% MDF of

321
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:30,559
the total ration. So this is where we

322
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:34,239
have a good potential

323
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:36,799
um placeholder for hemp meal. There's

324
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,799
actually a picture of a polo horse here

325
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,639
uh at

326
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:45,240
Cornell. These horses require a lot of

327
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:48,720
energy. So again when to add a

328
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:53,600
concentrate to this

329
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:56,399
um timothy hay for example. So here um

330
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,759
we have several grains and byproducts.

331
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:03,679
Uh what we would like to see in here is

332
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,600
a great proportion of hemine meal.

333
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:09,278
when to add a concentrate. A common

334
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:12,159
scenario again is a working horse that

335
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:14,559
has a limited access to uh a working

336
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:18,078
horse or scenarios where a horse has

337
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:22,399
limited access to hay um just because of

338
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:23,838
weather, season, uh price, um who knows?

339
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,120
There's all kinds of different reasons

340
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:29,759
for that. So um this is where uh we want

341
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,159
to maybe provide uh think about

342
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,560
providing um a concentrate is going to

343
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:38,719
be really high in fiber for example or

344
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:40,879
even a a balanced diet a a a pelleted or

345
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,920
extruded feed that is completely

346
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:47,679
balanced or complete for uh for a horse

347
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:50,479
um an aging horse, right? Some aging

348
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,399
horses cannot chew anymore on their hay.

349
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,759
Um so this is where we start thinking

350
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,440
about a complete diet a complete feed uh

351
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,680
that is going to be pelleted or cubes

352
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:03,279
for these guys. Even though we know

353
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:05,519
horses leak like they need the long stem

354
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:08,240
at some point they can't chew anymore

355
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:11,759
then we need to find a form of NDF

356
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:15,038
packaged differently right so again uh

357
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:18,000
when to add a concentrate so here um in

358
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:20,160
terms of let's talk numbers here so we

359
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,038
the general practice is that we want to

360
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,640
limit starch uh to two to four grams per

361
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:28,400
kilogram body weight um in some cases we

362
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,440
really want to restrict that one gram

363
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,559
per kilogram. So, you know, high-risisk

364
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:38,080
horses and ponies that tend to get fat

365
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:39,678
and have metabolic syndromes. Um, so

366
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,839
basically, if I'm just going to give you

367
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,798
an example here, if you have a balancer

368
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:47,519
that contains 45% starch and the horse

369
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:50,038
weighs 400 kilogram, you're limited to

370
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,639
feeding this horse to about 900 grams of

371
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:55,279
concentrate. If the concentrate contains

372
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,720
60% starch, then you're limited to 700

373
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,639
grams.

374
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,600
Um, so we're going to try to lower the

375
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,320
starch content 20% uh in some of the

376
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,879
projects that we did um and to really

377
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:10,639
provide a feed for horses that are high

378
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:13,840
high risk uh or simply just need a an

379
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,840
additional um set of nutrients. Good

380
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:20,639
practice is not to exceed water soluble

381
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:23,359
carbohydrate 12% or or make sure that

382
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,799
the the nonstructural carbohydrates

383
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:31,199
what's inside of the cell plant cell uh

384
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:32,639
is maximized at at 20%. Uh so the hemine

385
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,120
mill profile is actually really

386
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,400
interesting because it meets all these

387
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:40,798
requirements. A little bit about about

388
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,640
pigs uh before we dig into more

389
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:46,079
specifically about hemp seed. Um

390
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,960
anatomically you know the the cells are

391
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:50,879
hind gut fermentors. Um you know growing

392
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,919
pigs are but cells have a very large

393
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,200
hind gut. Evolutionary they have adapted

394
00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:00,559
to foraging a lifestyle constantly uh

395
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,120
eating diluted uh fibrous feed. They're

396
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:05,119
naturally active especially near the end

397
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:08,159
of gestation where they become

398
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:10,479
hyperphasic. You know they eat a lot and

399
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:14,160
they're uh building nests for their

400
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,000
piglets. Um so this natural drive plays

401
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,240
a key role in how we should think about

402
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,319
feeding strategies for SAS and we have

403
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,960
been thinking more and more about this.

404
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:26,399
Uh but there's still a lot of room um

405
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,160
here to to work with. So in contrast of

406
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,440
their evolutionary feeding behavior

407
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:35,279
modern housing system often restrict uh

408
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,600
these natural instance uh SAS in uh the

409
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:40,558
US and Canada are commonly limit fed

410
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:43,038
with relatively low fiber diets. They're

411
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:46,319
reluctively relatively inactive. They

412
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:49,359
like access to nesting behavior. Uh

413
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:51,599
combined with boredom and frustration.

414
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:54,000
Uh it results in stereotypic behaviors

415
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:56,959
which are repetitive purposeless action

416
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,038
often linked uh to poor welfare. Let's

417
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,558
admit. Um so again, limit fed, low

418
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:04,480
fiber. Um fiber is a little bit higher

419
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:06,798
than it used to be, but still a lot of

420
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,400
room, less active, no access to express

421
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:14,160
nesting behavior. Um so that is actually

422
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,720
giving us um opportunities to think

423
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,880
about increasing looking for alternative

424
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,440
ingredients to increase the feed or the

425
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,600
fiber in those diets. Of course in

426
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,200
smaller swine operations you know we

427
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:29,759
provide uh an opportunity for um you

428
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,400
know more space enrichment the use of

429
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:36,079
fiber rich feeds to support both the

430
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,798
welfare and the physiology. But as we

431
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:41,599
are considering like uh new ingredients

432
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:44,400
like hemp seed meal uh its potential to

433
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:48,000
provide bulk and nutrition to uh just

434
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,000
saving s is

435
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:56,639
undeniable. So you know for s uh so what

436
00:20:53,919 --> 00:21:00,000
does the science say? A typical corn soy

437
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,919
dd for example corn ddgs contains about

438
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,400
14% NDF. Well, that's not enough for SA

439
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,320
uh fiber inclusion. So, we've seen that

440
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,559
studies have shown that fiber inclusion

441
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:13,918
with soy halls and wheat brand improves

442
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:17,678
society and reduces cereotypic be uh

443
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:20,799
behaviors in in uh limited cells. uh

444
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,960
when we are increasing NDF to around 18

445
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:26,319
to 20%

446
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,759
um we have clear welfare benefits we

447
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:33,759
reduce oral uh stereotypes uh we improve

448
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:35,759
gut health um our current studies um

449
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,960
it's still in progress we've been

450
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:41,119
feeding 30% wheat brand during gestation

451
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:45,360
we show that it reduces constipation

452
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:47,918
rate dystocia which is difficult uh fing

453
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:51,038
or giving birth It also reduces

454
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:53,360
gestation length uh meaning that it's a

455
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:56,798
good thing we don't have to intervene uh

456
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:59,599
to induce firing by day 114 or 115

457
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:03,119
because those cells have to be timed uh

458
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:04,639
for for basically managing uh the unit.

459
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:08,000
So it's good to have all those cells

460
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,080
pharaoh in time and with the 30% wheat

461
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,839
brand we didn't have to intervene at all

462
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:15,839
and give drugs to those cells to induce

463
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:18,558
fering. Um so again here I want to

464
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:21,439
recognize a PIC nutrition guide and top

465
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:25,038
uh topics norwich feeding guidelines uh

466
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,640
in addition to the studies above. Um a

467
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:29,919
little bit more stuff here that is

468
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:33,360
really uh interesting uh to uh to

469
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,840
mention again high fiber inside diets.

470
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:38,000
Uh you can see that it really boosts the

471
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:40,798
voluntary water intake during this

472
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,200
period in late pregnancy around fering

473
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:46,639
and early lactation. you see high fiber

474
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,640
22% NDF versus half of that really

475
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,759
pushes the water intake in these cells

476
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,520
which is essential to reduce

477
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:57,759
constipation. Another really cool study

478
00:22:53,519 --> 00:23:00,720
uh that has been done looking at uh how

479
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:03,759
fiber feeding actually spikes increases

480
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,120
prolactin serum concentration during

481
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:08,879
this period around giving birth. And

482
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:11,678
prollectin in itself being a such an

483
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,960
important hormone um because it is

484
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,200
essential for initiating and maintaining

485
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,480
lactation. So the initiation of

486
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,120
lactation could have something to do

487
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,519
with the fact that with feeding wheat

488
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:26,639
brand at this high level we're able to

489
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:29,440
actually induce fering in time for those

490
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:33,440
cells to be more synchronized without to

491
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:36,400
intervene. Um, another uh really cool

492
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,038
study here looking at um feeding

493
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,640
roughage. Here we're looking at straw,

494
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:44,720
hay, clover h clover grass silage, uh

495
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,640
corn silage or may salage and

496
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:51,279
artichokes. And what we're seeing is

497
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:54,400
basically the litter weight um at day 35

498
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:58,079
um being higher uh than control. Okay,

499
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,559
for the hay, the clover grass silage and

500
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,240
the artichoke. Um, and we're looking

501
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:04,079
here a little bit something different

502
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,759
here as far as like individual pig

503
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:12,879
weight uh here uh greater um than

504
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:16,000
control um for the the hay, the clover

505
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:20,159
grass salvage and the artichoke. Right.

506
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:25,839
So again some promising um data here,

507
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:28,799
promising uh studies. Um just quickly um

508
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:31,678
this is a and I had to mention this

509
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:35,679
because to me this is this is so telling

510
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:37,720
uh fiber addition roughage reduces uh

511
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,960
basically um

512
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:44,880
lipopolysaccharides and um you know C C

513
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:48,079
reactive uh protein uh basically uh

514
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:51,440
looking at um you know and these are

515
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:54,240
endotoxins right um and so basically

516
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,159
this lower inflammatory markers in

517
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,319
colostrum of those cells that are fed

518
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,880
these roughages may help support

519
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:04,079
neonatal immune development and reduce

520
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,080
stress on the cell at

521
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:12,000
firing. So in this study here

522
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:14,559
um we what what they what Kesnol and all

523
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,880
did is that uh they're providing high

524
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:21,440
fiber feed uh to increase the NDF to um

525
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,080
basically to 32% here. So we're seeing

526
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,798
the control

527
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:28,319
32%. Um so that when you see that it's

528
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:29,839
important to mention this because when

529
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,519
we talk about hemp seed meal we're going

530
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:33,839
to have consequences as far as the

531
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:36,158
nutrient profile. So we have all these

532
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:38,480
ingredients here that are added to uh

533
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:43,039
increase the fiber content. And when you

534
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:46,400
do that, um I'm sorry about that. Uh the

535
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:49,319
ND the liysine concentration the true

536
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,759
SID refers to similar to the true

537
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:55,278
digestibility true digestible lysine

538
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:58,558
content of this diet reduces from 0.56

539
00:25:55,278 --> 00:26:00,319
to 46. But look at the feed intake.

540
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:02,158
We're also boosting the feed intake of

541
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:04,879
those cells. So at the end of the day,

542
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,760
the amount of nutrients uh daily

543
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,720
requirement is met. Uh what these people

544
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:13,480
have shown is that clearly the average

545
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:17,278
daily gain of those piglets um is

546
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:19,278
improved and the litter gain also is

547
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:21,759
improved when we start feeding those

548
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:25,359
animals at day 25 of gestation. Keep in

549
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:28,319
mind that cells gestation length is 114

550
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:31,199
115 days of gestation.

551
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:34,798
Um in this what I'd like to do here is

552
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:38,000
that um basically just mention here that

553
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:42,158
the benefits um that we just provided

554
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,319
here um are are a strong justification

555
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:48,880
for exploring novel fiber sources like

556
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:51,359
hemp seed meal and cell diets. Um we see

557
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,919
that uh we have positive influences on

558
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:56,319
lactation performance and cell welfare.

559
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:59,600
And this slide here is here because I

560
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:02,240
wanted to show you that in terms of the

561
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,839
crude protein requirement and the lysine

562
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,359
requirement again this is on a

563
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:10,038
digestible basis um we're looking at a

564
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:14,719
lizin to crude protein ratio of about

565
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:16,879
five and about five and a half to 5.4.

566
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,519
Okay. So these numbers, let's keep these

567
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,960
in mind uh when we're looking at the

568
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:25,038
lysine profile of hemp seed meal because

569
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,679
hemp seed meal with the lysine profile

570
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:30,960
could actually replace about u provide

571
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:35,679
about half of the lysine in those sal

572
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:38,480
diets because of its n uh naturally um

573
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:42,159
good amino acid profile. So what I did

574
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:45,679
here is I took this this diet um let me

575
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:50,000
go back here. Okay. and I replaced the

576
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:54,480
fiber u part uh by hemp seed meal. So

577
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,599
essentially uh having 58.5% of the diet

578
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,360
as he seed meal. Um so I couldn't

579
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,158
calculate the fermentable fiber

580
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:04,798
percentage because I do not know what

581
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,320
how fermentable those fibers are. Um

582
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:09,278
that's something else that we would have

583
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:13,839
to to look into. uh but you know when

584
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:17,599
we're looking at uh boosting NDF to 31%

585
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:20,720
right um is basically by replacing those

586
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:23,918
fibers uh we we come up with the same

587
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,079
fiber content as basically what we had

588
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:29,960
before it's about 32 in the previous

589
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:33,439
diet but look at the SID lysine right

590
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:35,919
66% so we're above requirement so we

591
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,640
could lower this hemp seed meal and and

592
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,640
put in put something else in there. Um,

593
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,559
and of course, this is just a very crude

594
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,000
estimate, right? I didn't go through,

595
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:45,519
you know, all the nitty-gritty of the

596
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,240
profile, but it's just showing you the

597
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:50,319
potential here, um, of of filling that

598
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,519
gap, providing this MDF, the little

599
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:55,278
cells, providing this bulk, uh, because,

600
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,398
you know, to reduce the society, to

601
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:59,679
reduce this hunger, and, uh, because

602
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:01,558
they're less active, they're in

603
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,320
confinement, they need to be less

604
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:07,960
hungry. Uh, that's basically uh the

605
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:09,558
bottom line, right? So 31%

606
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:14,079
3266

607
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:16,079
sidly versus 46 we're in good shape. So

608
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:18,480
let's move on into looking at the

609
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,720
protein quality of MC meal and some of

610
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,839
the work that has been done looking at

611
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,558
protein quality. So here um we're

612
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:28,639
looking at um amino acid composition.

613
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:31,119
First of all you've probably seen that

614
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,679
before but it doesn't hurt to revise

615
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:36,319
this topic. Right? So here whole seed

616
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:39,759
versus dehauled seeds versus seed seed

617
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:44,359
meal MCD meal and versus the hulls. And

618
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:45,960
what we're seeing here is that um our MC

619
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:48,879
meal

620
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:52,720
is we're going to go back to those

621
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:56,399
highlight in a second here. Uh we have a

622
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,278
uh nice uh lysine content of 1.3%

623
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:02,719
relative to the other products.

624
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:05,519
Um and also uh one that is uh really

625
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:09,200
interesting is the uh sulfur amino acid

626
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:13,119
like methionine methane plus cyine uh in

627
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,360
hens meal. Um one thing that I wanted to

628
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:18,639
uh mention here looking at this this

629
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:21,038
slide is to demonstrate the variation in

630
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,320
the coefficient of variation in those

631
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:27,519
different products uh for lysine. Right?

632
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:32,480
So we go to hemp seed meal we got 16 uh

633
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:34,519
to 20% um variation. So 22%

634
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,720
uh for crude protein

635
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:41,679
40.7 22%

636
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:44,960
variation but MC meal 16 to 28% for

637
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:47,519
lysine in particular and halls is quite

638
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,000
variable right so the more processing we

639
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:53,119
get into uh we're going to get into some

640
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,798
of the the losses as well or or the

641
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:58,239
variation right um now this is getting a

642
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:00,079
little bit more interesting here as

643
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,240
we're looking at comparing hemp seed

644
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:06,319
meal products to uh other products of

645
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:09,919
interest. Um so here we have flax seed

646
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:14,158
meal which is really popular in uh horse

647
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:18,799
uh feed. Um and so we have a soybean

648
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:20,640
meal again um very common source for

649
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:24,000
protein for horse feed and of course for

650
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,840
for pig feed here in the the states.

651
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,880
Flax seed meal or which is also called

652
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:30,879
linseed meal more so in Europe and hemp

653
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,960
seed meal. So this is the amino acid

654
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,000
profile. This is the amino acid profile

655
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:39,440
relative to the crude protein content.

656
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:43,278
And so we're looking here at 3.3 for

657
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:46,080
soybean for liysine, 1.4 and 1.4 here

658
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:50,159
for flax seed meal, hensing meal. So

659
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:53,519
similar in this study um in terms of the

660
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:56,399
uh protein quality or the profile here,

661
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:59,440
uh 6.2% of their protein is composed of

662
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:02,558
lysine. 4% of her protein is compo

663
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:06,480
composed of lysine and a flaxene or

664
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:10,398
linen meal and and um 3.2 two, right?

665
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:13,120
Um, which is actually a a really good

666
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:15,599
number where we're considering where to

667
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:18,639
use and how to use hemp milk for horse

668
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:21,759
feed, uh, which are animals that require

669
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:24,880
relatively low protein diets, uh, and

670
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:24,879
for gestating

671
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:32,158
sounds. Again here um you have your hemp

672
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,399
seed meal uh along with flax seed that

673
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,399
are

674
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:38,879
um offer great opportunities for for

675
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:42,079
sulfur amino acids more so in the

676
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,559
methane for him seed meal.

677
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:46,319
Um this is a little bit complicated but

678
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:49,440
I just wanted to mention that the study

679
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:51,278
was done uh in in rats using rodents and

680
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,480
this is more applicable to human where

681
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:57,038
we actually look at protein quality and

682
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,599
the protein digestibility

683
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:01,919
uh corrected amino acid score. Uh you

684
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:03,639
might have a a speaker that did talk

685
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,960
about that in terms of human

686
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:08,960
application. Uh again here um colex

687
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,480
expelled hempseed meal compared to

688
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,278
co-expelled

689
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:18,798
um uh linseed meal uh a little bit less

690
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:21,440
uh in terms of their um protein

691
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:24,879
digestibility corrected amino acid score

692
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:29,679
for lysine but then for methionine

693
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:31,600
um and u both in terms of the score and

694
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:35,798
the pdca

695
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:38,678
um uh superior by far for your hemp seed

696
00:33:35,798 --> 00:33:41,038
milk products or hemp products in

697
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:42,720
general. Um the variation in

698
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:45,119
digestibility and that's going to be

699
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,519
true for all uh animal species we're

700
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:50,558
going to be testing in is that you know

701
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,558
the the the more the MDF the lower the

702
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:54,558
protein digestibility but we're still

703
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:57,440
looking at really relatively high

704
00:33:54,558 --> 00:34:01,440
protein digestibility anywhere in a bird

705
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:06,240
of of 95 plus to you know over 95%. So

706
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,240
85 to 95% which is which is

707
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:11,679
excellent. If we're looking here at um

708
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:16,480
this really nice study that was done by

709
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,838
Hook Presto at all in 20 um 2011,

710
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,079
there's really not a whole lot of

711
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:24,039
studies out there uh looking at hemp

712
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:28,320
meal comparing to linseed canoline

713
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:31,838
canola meal I'm sorry and fab bean and

714
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:36,320
soybean meal. Um and um here what we're

715
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:38,039
seeing is that um very high NDF and hips

716
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,919
meal

717
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:44,878
um beautiful lysine content um little

718
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:48,158
bit lower than canola uh a little bit

719
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:50,960
lower lower than legume and soybean but

720
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:54,878
fair comparison to uh fair in comparison

721
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:59,199
to linseed meal. And of course our uh

722
00:34:54,878 --> 00:35:01,759
sulfur amino acid uh content um are way

723
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:04,960
up there. And what's even more

724
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,119
interesting is the total track and and

725
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,400
intestinal

726
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:10,200
digestibility of of pigs that are fed

727
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,800
hemp seed meal and other protein

728
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:14,239
ingredients. Again here drawing your

729
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,720
attention there's a lot of numbers

730
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:19,039
right? But if we're looking here at

731
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:24,159
apparent digestibility for hemp seed

732
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:26,719
meal um compared to flax seed, canola

733
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:29,598
um bean and and soybean what we're

734
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:32,319
seeing here is on an apparent digestive

735
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,880
basis uh hemp seed meal is doing really

736
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:39,039
well and these are inclusion rate near

737
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:41,200
25% of the diet in those pigs. Okay, so

738
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:44,239
a quarter of the diet containing hemp

739
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:46,239
seed meal. Um now we're looking in terms

740
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:48,959
of was putting this into true

741
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:51,919
digestibility values for the pigs. Uh

742
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:57,440
we're doing really well again here. Um

743
00:35:51,920 --> 00:36:01,838
you know for in terms of of uh lysine um

744
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:04,240
same as flax seed um or canola uh lower

745
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:06,239
than legume which is not surprising and

746
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:07,919
lower than and soybean meal although

747
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:09,759
soybean meal was not part of the study.

748
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,559
I added this column here so that's why

749
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,839
there are no letters for comparison.

750
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:18,159
uh really good digestibility for methane

751
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:21,199
um and really not much difference

752
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:23,279
between the other amino acids. So again,

753
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:26,239
really good quality protein, highly

754
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,240
digestible for

755
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:34,239
pigs. Now, if we're looking at um for

756
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:38,199
horses here, um I call this the perfect

757
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:41,679
feed ingredients um because of the

758
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:44,799
composition of this of this product.

759
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:48,159
looking at the approximate composition

760
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,480
uh crude protein uh you know will vary

761
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:52,639
um so here I've used the data from

762
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,519
spring at all that did a really cool

763
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:58,799
study looking at palatability of MC mill

764
00:36:55,519 --> 00:37:02,159
in in horses and we'll look at the data

765
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:06,800
right here um but you know when we look

766
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:09,358
at MDF um hemp mill is very high uh beet

767
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,839
pulp is high too but the MDF high

768
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:14,440
content of NDF and beet pulp is a lot of

769
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:17,838
it is due to um

770
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:20,960
um basically pectin, right? There's a

771
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:24,000
lot of pectin uh in beef pulp. And then

772
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,079
we have our rice brand and commercial

773
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,159
concentrate and just here as a

774
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:34,240
standalone con standard or Bermuda grass

775
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:38,239
for example. Um the crude fat uh you

776
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:41,199
know this is a 10.7% I've seen 12% crude

777
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:45,039
fat. rice brand is 17% and we like to

778
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:48,159
use that in horse feed because of its um

779
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:51,599
fat content and of course it has some

780
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:54,879
MDF of course it's it's brand but it has

781
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:57,838
a high fat content and uh but when I

782
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:01,000
look at basically comparing hemp meat to

783
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:04,239
adults other common products

784
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:09,039
um it has a nice uh a nice profile

785
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:11,118
doesn't it right um so here Um, in terms

786
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,279
of non-structural carbohydrate, which

787
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:16,200
was what we're looking for a lot of time

788
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:20,400
for some good uh feed for a horse

789
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:22,879
balancer, uh, nonfiber carbohydrate or

790
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,119
nonstructural, non-fiber, starch

791
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:29,200
content, water soluble carbohydrate, and

792
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:32,559
simple sugars. Uh, MC meal is going to

793
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:35,279
be low in olives compared to uh, common

794
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:38,880
feed stuffs in in r in horse

795
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,280
concentrates or ration balancers.

796
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,920
very low starch content among a lot of

797
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,200
them except for rice brand. You can see

798
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:50,680
more starch in there. Um so again low

799
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:54,239
starch uh low water soluble

800
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:56,239
carbohydrate low simple sugar high NDF

801
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:59,679
going back to my approximate composition

802
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:03,838
here on top. Uh relative nice uh content

803
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:06,960
of fat um and a little bit lower in

804
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:09,199
energy because of the NDF nonetheless.

805
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,079
Um I think that we have some really good

806
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:14,118
potential here again for pregnant cells

807
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,240
um and horse

808
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:17,880
concentrate here. I just wanted to

809
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:21,679
stress again

810
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:23,920
how content of starch and brains so

811
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:27,039
makes it difficult to mitigate the

812
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,800
starch uh concentration horse balancers

813
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:31,440
when we have when we want to get the

814
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,760
energy level uh and then we have all

815
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,320
this starch that we're bringing in. So

816
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,960
always uh some worries here that we need

817
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:41,200
to balance for. If we look at uh

818
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,838
acceptance of hensy mill and horses and

819
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:47,199
this is was the study done by spring at

820
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:50,000
all. We're having a six days of repeated

821
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:53,118
offering of 1 kilogram of either hemp

822
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,159
seed pellets or bermita grass. And you

823
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,079
know this this uh this acceptance study

824
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:00,000
you know those horses are giving a

825
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:03,039
limited amount of time to consume. So

826
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,838
they're not consuming the entire um

827
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:07,679
amount that you're giving them

828
00:40:04,838 --> 00:40:10,639
necessarily. But what's interesting is

829
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:12,319
that uh once these horses got used to

830
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:14,159
this hemp seed mill is a novel

831
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,240
ingredient never they never ate it

832
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:19,440
before. Um they were used to this

833
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:22,239
coastal bermuda grass um slowly but

834
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,280
surely um it's different still different

835
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:27,439
and then it start getting similar. Uh

836
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,560
and by the time these horses have

837
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:34,480
reached uh five days um they're

838
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:38,078
basically um same uh five four to five

839
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:42,159
days as as the horses as basically

840
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:45,839
preferring or consumption of grass and

841
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:48,799
then by day six um superior intake,

842
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:52,078
superior acceptance. So definitely very

843
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:55,240
palatable for those horses. Um again

844
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:59,519
here another um uh

845
00:40:55,239 --> 00:41:02,318
comparison done with um not the grass

846
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:05,119
hay this time but uh beet pulp very

847
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:07,920
common very popular ingredient soybean

848
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:10,000
meal and rice brand pellets and what

849
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,960
we're seeing here comparing to hemp seed

850
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:17,039
meal uh we have much greater

851
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:20,639
palatability of the hempseed

852
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:23,119
um greater um than soybean meal and

853
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:27,559
similar to the rice brand pellets which

854
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:31,200
is a carry a pot gradient again in horse

855
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:33,199
feed. So we did a small study um it's

856
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:35,279
still ongoing uh and this is in

857
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,919
preparation to a much larger study that

858
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,119
we're going to be beginning uh next fall

859
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,838
and next spring um that was funded by

860
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,240
the department of egg and market and

861
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:49,440
FFR. Um so this is a basically a sort of

862
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:52,318
a pilot study still ongoing um because

863
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,440
in this study by spring it all um you

864
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:58,480
know we were uh looking at um relatively

865
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,440
smaller intake. We wanted to push it um

866
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:04,079
to a 40% inclusion rate in a balancer

867
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:08,400
and see how these horses would do. Uh

868
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:12,160
also this this project was meant to um

869
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,079
look at u digestibility. So we still

870
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:18,960
have not received all the data on the

871
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:22,000
internal markers um such as lingen uh to

872
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:25,280
be able to give us um you know what we

873
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,400
need to figure out um the digestibility

874
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,720
of nutrients. But uh what we did is we

875
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,440
provided four different concentrate at

876
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:36,959
increasing inclusion rate of MC meal and

877
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:40,720
we uh offered the those concentrate um

878
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:44,519
slowly until we reach a four uh point4%

879
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:47,199
of the hor's body weight uh as a full

880
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:52,239
concentrate. So this was the ratio of

881
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:56,399
hay to um hint seed. Um and here what

882
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:59,039
we're seeing is that um again this is

883
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,680
our diet. Uh we're reducing the amount

884
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:04,800
of oats uh reducing the amount of

885
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:06,719
soybean meal to almost no soybean meal.

886
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,720
Uh increasing our hemp seed meal

887
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:13,439
percentage for this um

888
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:16,078
concentrate from 10 to 40%. We kept

889
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:20,240
smithy pellets constant, corn constant

890
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:23,599
and corn oil. And so the crude protein

891
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:25,919
um these are the analyzed values. Um

892
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:28,240
repeating this this diet here to see if

893
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,800
there was a an error with the analysis

894
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:33,358
but they were all around 20% should have

895
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,680
been all around 20% crude protein and

896
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:39,759
see the increase in NDF here. So we push

897
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:42,519
it to about 30% um that was the goal. Um

898
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:45,359
and minimizing starch you know to

899
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:49,119
22.4. And so what we did here is that we

900
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:53,119
had some uh Amish uh company that uh

901
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:55,920
build us some really cool manure um bags

902
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:58,559
so we can have clean manure collection

903
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,400
with no contamination with the ground

904
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:03,679
and so we can basically collect this

905
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,838
feces over a six-hour period or whatever

906
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:07,679
period we want to collect for as long as

907
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:10,159
we empty the bags as it gets pretty

908
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:13,759
heavy. Um so these are you know

909
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:17,039
different colorcoded um to mix um the

910
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:20,079
different uh diets here uh for the

911
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:22,719
students and uh so initial results

912
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:26,480
basically no refusal of concentrates

913
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:28,959
they consume on average 87

914
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:32,159
uh kilogram of NCI milk per day so

915
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,519
almost one kilogram of NC milk per day

916
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:38,399
uh basically uh we

917
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:40,559
were showing that we could reduce the

918
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,119
starch intake to less than one gram per

919
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:44,318
kilogram body weight with this

920
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:47,280
concentrate. The control diet was

921
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:48,960
relatively low in starch to begin with,

922
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,480
lower than what you'd find out there

923
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,240
actually because I was trying to be very

924
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,318
careful because these are, you know,

925
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:56,000
Cornell horses, research horses, want to

926
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:57,759
be careful what we do with them, what we

927
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,318
expose them to. So, I was being

928
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,200
conservative with the control diet here.

929
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:05,279
Uh, again, no change in weight and fecal

930
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:08,799
scar was normal throughout. These horses

931
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,960
did really well. Um and in conclusion uh

932
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,000
the hemine mill palatability in horses

933
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:17,519
does not differ from that of rice brand

934
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,239
um and basically uh is superior to other

935
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:22,400
common fees used to formulate

936
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:24,799
concentrate or ration balancers. I'm

937
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,680
sorry about the typo here. Inclusion

938
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:30,079
rate of 40% in horse ration balancers or

939
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:32,318
concentrate is nutritionally complete,

940
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:34,720
palatable and safe for horses at risk of

941
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:36,880
large intestinal dysfunction and

942
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:40,000
metabolic diseases.

943
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,800
So low starch, moderately high in fat,

944
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,800
high in high in MDF and adequate in

945
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:49,200
lysine to crude protein for

946
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:51,560
horses. And then for cells we have hope,

947
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:54,480
right? So here we did a very small

948
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:56,480
study, couple of small studies. This is

949
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,400
in addition with the other studies that

950
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,880
have been done looking at digestibility.

951
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,039
So in this one we did two small study.

952
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,720
One was for acceptability because we

953
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:07,599
couldn't find data on that. I could not

954
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:10,078
find data on acceptability and also

955
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:12,800
looking at whole track digestibility not

956
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:15,359
not small intestinal but whole track and

957
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:19,039
we did here is we formulated those diets

958
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:20,719
um you know to contain uh up to 15% hemp

959
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:23,119
seed meal these are growing pigs you

960
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:26,318
have to be careful how much you can add

961
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:28,160
in terms of fibrous food u because it

962
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:30,400
can limit their feed intake and their

963
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:32,078
nutrient intake and their growth rate if

964
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:35,039
you're if the aim is to grow those

965
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:38,000
animals for production right? Which is

966
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:40,400
not the case for pregnant cells. Uh but

967
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,960
nonetheless, uh basically we decreased

968
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,440
the wheat brand to zero uh and increase

969
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:48,800
the Hennessy meal. And so this way we

970
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:52,318
could have a a diet that was balanced as

971
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:55,760
close as possible for MDF. Uh that's the

972
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:59,519
best we could do uh here. Um but keeping

973
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:01,520
the SID liysine uh constant to meet the

974
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:04,000
requirement without adding crystine

975
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:06,079
amino acids. Right? So a step further

976
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,800
would actually to be working with real

977
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,720
refined diets and adding crystalline

978
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,200
amino acid to target our amino acid

979
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:16,000
level if we need to. Uh so we had

980
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:18,078
several constraints here but nonetheless

981
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,880
um if we're looking also we had a very

982
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:23,519
highfat diet uh because we had so much

983
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,440
NDF in there so in order to meet the

984
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:28,639
energy requirement and what we're seeing

985
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:32,240
here is that those pigs ate uh gobble up

986
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:37,279
the food really well um for all the

987
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:41,039
different um diets here control 10% 15%

988
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:43,760
and the daily gain um the pigs fed the

989
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:47,119
10% did Well, but they kind of crash a

990
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:49,520
little bit at the uh 15% inclusion rate

991
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:54,240
and so that the gain the gain to feed

992
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:56,800
ratio uh going to the 15% uh was lower

993
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:59,199
compared to control and the 10% hemp

994
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,280
seed or tended to be lower. And this

995
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:05,358
other study that we repeated use just

996
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:07,839
using control on 10%. Um again here uh

997
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:10,400
we didn't find difference in feed intake

998
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:13,039
and daily gain. And then we did whole

999
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,599
track protein digestibility. No

1000
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:18,400
difference between the

1001
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:20,880
two. Feed to gain again u I'm sorry gain

1002
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:23,358
to feed. Sorry if I said feed to gain

1003
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:26,400
before. Hopefully I said gain to feed.

1004
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:28,960
Um is going to again here showing that

1005
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,280
there was no difference. Right. So final

1006
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,280
conclusion here so I can wrap up a

1007
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,599
little bit later than I was hoping to.

1008
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,599
Not too bad. So MC meal amino acid

1009
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:40,480
profile is comparable to that of flax

1010
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:45,800
seed and canola meal uh which are you

1011
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:48,960
know sources of uh protein um in

1012
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:51,200
um growing pig diets uh in certain

1013
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:54,079
regions. A superior source of sulfur

1014
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:56,879
amino acids.

1015
00:48:54,079 --> 00:49:00,559
Um and again this this amino acid

1016
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:02,640
profile to me is um something that uh I

1017
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:04,559
see a lot of potential more so in

1018
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:07,598
pregnant cells that don't require as

1019
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:10,559
much lysine or amino acids compared to

1020
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:12,960
an early growing pig. Hansen meal amino

1021
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:14,880
acid digestibility does not differ in

1022
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:18,559
some cases is greater compared to other

1023
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,160
protein supplements. And then um that

1024
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:24,079
the meal could provide half of the

1025
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:26,679
lysine and gestation diets and 30% NDF.

1026
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:30,318
So that's just a really uh powerful

1027
00:49:26,679 --> 00:49:32,399
ingredient. Uh a 10% inclusion rate uh

1028
00:49:30,318 --> 00:49:35,519
we maintain growth rate, feed intake and

1029
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:38,160
gain to feed ratio. When we increase

1030
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:40,400
that inclusion rate uh we don't maintain

1031
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:42,920
feed intake and the rate of gain in

1032
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,920
those pigs. Um the total track

1033
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:48,680
digestibility uh was was the same uh

1034
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:51,838
whether we have zero hem meal or

1035
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:53,519
10%. Um the palatability of hemp seed

1036
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:56,679
meal for pigs is indicative of

1037
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:59,519
palatability for justating cells and

1038
00:49:56,679 --> 00:50:01,838
undeniably and then we really need of

1039
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:04,719
course larger and long longer term

1040
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:06,318
studies. Um and we need to looking at

1041
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:08,879
pregnant cells as well. We can't just

1042
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:11,199
use you know growing pigs as proxy for

1043
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,559
cells. uh but I think that we have

1044
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:14,399
pretty good evidence. We could

1045
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:17,480
hypothesize that those cells will do

1046
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,920
pretty well on this

1047
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,838
product. Finally, fermentability

1048
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,200
potential of NCI meal is is really

1049
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:25,838
needed. So, we need to have a better

1050
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:28,799
understanding on how fermentable um the

1051
00:50:25,838 --> 00:50:31,920
fiber enhancing meal is. Uh with that,

1052
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:34,960
I'd like to acknowledge uh and uh in

1053
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:37,200
Hemp, especially uh Trey Riddle, uh for

1054
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,039
helping me uh you know, supplying me

1055
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:41,598
with the Hempy meal I've needed to have

1056
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:43,358
for those studies we've been conducting

1057
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:46,160
and helping us actually move forward

1058
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:48,239
with a larger grant. Uh Larry Smart and

1059
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:50,399
Joel Watch Lab, which are great mentors

1060
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:54,399
to me and basically made me discover the

1061
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:56,400
wonders of uh hemp products. uh my

1062
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,720
students and of course the Cornell

1063
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,800
teaching and research moms. Thank you so

1064
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:04,399
much.

1065
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:07,839
Thank you. That was wonderful. Learned

1066
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:11,440
so much about this topic. Um I'm going

1067
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:16,239
to use my host privileges to ask the

1068
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:18,960
first question. Um so would the hemp

1069
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:21,439
seed meal be replacing another

1070
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:24,159
ingredient that is being used or it

1071
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:27,119
plays more of a role of uh complementing

1072
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:28,879
the rations.

1073
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:31,920
So the question is whether we're looking

1074
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,400
at replacing everything with with hemp

1075
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:39,519
seed meal or can we look at it that well

1076
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:41,519
it depends right. Um you know so if we

1077
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:44,079
look at the horse studies those those

1078
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:46,719
horses could be they were just offered

1079
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:49,519
hemp seed milk pellets uh without

1080
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:53,199
anything else uh in the concentrate and

1081
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:55,599
they just love them love this diet right

1082
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:59,519
love this this product. So we know that

1083
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:02,880
it could probably be used as you know um

1084
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:05,519
perhaps as as a main fiber source

1085
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,280
potentially if we have all the supply

1086
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:09,400
that we need. Right. These horses eat a

1087
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,920
lot, right?

1088
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:14,400
So the availability might be the

1089
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:17,880
constraint here, not so much the

1090
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:21,519
nutritional potential, right?

1091
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:23,119
Uh so um but as a comp as a

1092
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:25,440
complimentary ingredients of course I

1093
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:27,358
think it has to do with availability,

1094
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,760
not so much a nutritional constraint in

1095
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:32,960
my opinion, but you know more work is

1096
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:36,160
needed, right? Yeah. Yeah. No, we can

1097
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:40,838
work on the availability side. Oh, we

1098
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:40,838
can. Okay, we'll have to talk. Okay.

1099
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:47,838
And then, um, we have a couple questions

1100
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:50,000
in the chat. The first one from Tyler,

1101
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:52,880
have you looked at feeding hemp forage

1102
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,880
to SOS and horses?

1103
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,880
So, let's see here. Which uh which

1104
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,559
question is that, Lucia? I'm trying to

1105
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,280
see

1106
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:05,119
the questions from I see that the

1107
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:06,359
webinar chat. I'm sorry. And um there

1108
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:10,960
should be a

1109
00:53:06,358 --> 00:53:14,239
Q&amp;A with a red. Oh yes. Yes, I see you.

1110
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,519
Thank you so much. Okay. Sorry, I wasn't

1111
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:17,759
a good student. I should have listened

1112
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:19,759
to you better before. So basically, have

1113
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:24,240
you looked at feeding hemp forage to

1114
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:27,200
thousand horses? No. Uh but I think it

1115
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:30,078
would be it would be uh you know

1116
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:32,960
wonderful. One thing though that that we

1117
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:36,240
have to keep in mind is the canaboninoid

1118
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:40,000
profile perhaps in uh the leafy part of

1119
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:44,879
the plant. Um you know right now we're

1120
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:49,039
looking at uh the seed products. Um so

1121
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:53,440
we are I think um the constraints here

1122
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:55,199
is residues uh canabinoate profiles on

1123
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:58,318
whether or not that could be ever

1124
00:53:55,199 --> 00:54:01,358
approved by um center for veteran

1125
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:03,759
medicine or FDA and AFCO uh because of

1126
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:07,598
the concerns with cannabonoids.

1127
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:11,520
So, but I I do think that um you know,

1128
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:13,519
assuming that um they're palatable, uh

1129
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:17,599
it would be it would be great it would

1130
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:19,599
be great to to try that. Uh Michael

1131
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:22,640
asked a question. We recommend hempseed

1132
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:24,400
milk for chickens. Yes. Uh in fact, we

1133
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:27,920
have hemp seed meal has been approved

1134
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:30,240
for laying hands. Um, some of you might

1135
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:34,240
know this, um, but it's been approved.

1136
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:36,078
And also, uh, chickens, we're having a a

1137
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:40,239
brawler study here that is beginning

1138
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:43,359
this fall or spring. And, uh, looking

1139
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:47,358
at, um, inclusion rates, how much we can

1140
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:50,078
include of hemp meal and and brawlers.

1141
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:52,159
Um, looking at meat quality, uh, growth

1142
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:55,519
rate, feed intake, and all these good

1143
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:58,960
things. So we'll have a better um better

1144
00:54:55,519 --> 00:55:01,759
idea of what it looks like for roller

1145
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:04,000
chickens um I would say eight months

1146
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,000
from

1147
00:55:04,358 --> 00:55:12,480
now. So um here I see could you please

1148
00:55:09,159 --> 00:55:16,000
um share a bit about the specific hemp

1149
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:19,280
meal you're using for these studies? Um

1150
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,400
is this whole seeds pressed, sterilized,

1151
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:26,800
roasted, etc.

1152
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:29,838
Um so so my understanding is that um

1153
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:32,640
these are um basically we've been

1154
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:35,358
they've been uh expelled. So the oil has

1155
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:40,400
been removed. Uh we're back we're down

1156
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:43,119
to about 10 to 12% fat. Um so uh and

1157
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:46,800
very low starch, right? So we have low

1158
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:49,119
starch, high in DF, uh moderate amount

1159
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:51,400
of fat. So these this is basically

1160
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:57,240
they've been um

1161
00:55:51,400 --> 00:56:02,160
uh extruded I mean I'm sorry expelled um

1162
00:55:57,239 --> 00:56:04,078
and uh to remove the oil right

1163
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:09,318
um hopefully I'm answering your your

1164
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:13,599
question um TJ here

1165
00:56:09,318 --> 00:56:15,880
um Trey is on on the call maybe he could

1166
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:19,760
jump in

1167
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:22,079
Um Tom uh is the hemp seed uh used for

1168
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:26,000
the feed studies dehauled and is

1169
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:29,760
dehauling required? Uh my understanding

1170
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:33,440
is that these are not dehauled because

1171
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:36,799
the MDF content is quite high.

1172
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,960
Um, so again, uh, correct me if I'm

1173
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:43,358
wrong, uh, Trey if you're here or

1174
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,358
anybody else from in, um,

1175
00:56:44,199 --> 00:56:51,279
hemp. Denise, uh, are you noting hemp

1176
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:54,318
seed meal uh, which is from pressed oil?

1177
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:57,040
Yes, you are noting. Yes. Is that the

1178
00:56:54,318 --> 00:57:00,000
only version of hemp seed looked at? Is

1179
00:56:57,039 --> 00:57:03,599
the whole seed or ground dehold seed? is

1180
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,960
is whole seed or ground defold. So we're

1181
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:11,280
going back to uh the question before to

1182
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:17,039
some extent uh with the NDF uh content.

1183
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:21,880
Um these are likely not dehold. Um again

1184
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:25,279
I need some I have Larry here that is

1185
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:28,318
um Morgan and Trey it is expelled. Thank

1186
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:30,880
you. Press full seed. Wonderful. Yes.

1187
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:32,960
So, they're not dehold. Yeah, with that

1188
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,720
kind of NDF, I I would have been I would

1189
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:38,798
have been surprised. Thank you so much,

1190
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:40,558
Larry, for helping. Oh, Tyler. Um, thank

1191
00:57:38,798 --> 00:57:42,280
you for the insightful talk, Natalie.

1192
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:45,760
Nice studies. Well, thank you, uh,

1193
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:47,839
Tyler. Um, so Denise, uh, again,

1194
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:50,720
hopefully we've answered your question.

1195
00:57:47,838 --> 00:57:54,798
Um, also, is the only version of feed

1196
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:58,879
looked at, um, basically right now, um,

1197
00:57:54,798 --> 00:58:00,719
in terms of those studies? Yes. Um but

1198
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,720
I'm sure there's going to be lots more

1199
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:05,838
to come here in the next uh few months

1200
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:09,759
or years as this is becoming uh a really

1201
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:11,759
hot topic uh for good reason right uh

1202
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:13,839
Judson very informative and presentation

1203
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:16,960
thank you thank you Judson I I I

1204
00:58:13,838 --> 00:58:18,400
appreciate those comments oh Larry Larry

1205
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,798
here is saying that we are seeing

1206
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:23,680
adoption of high olivic soy for dairy

1207
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:26,318
feed due to increase in milk production

1208
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:29,118
is the fatty acid content of MC meal oil

1209
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:31,599
important cells and milk production. Uh

1210
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:34,559
there is a high oilic hemp line. We are

1211
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:36,640
just starting to evaluate. Well, I in

1212
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:38,720
the interest of time I decided not to

1213
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:40,639
talk about fatty acids because I felt I

1214
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:42,558
was you know I had so much to cover to

1215
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:44,318
kind of set the tone a little bit about

1216
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:47,040
what we're looking at for animals and

1217
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:51,358
what kind of digestive system they have.

1218
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:53,599
But uh in terms of fatty acid profile um

1219
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:57,440
again this is all this is something that

1220
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:59,920
in sour lactation is of great interest

1221
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:03,358
especially as we're looking at uh health

1222
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:05,039
of those figlets. Um so um I think

1223
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:08,400
there's a lot of potential here to

1224
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:12,558
looking at um hyalic and the fatty acid

1225
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:14,798
profile uh of the milk um that those

1226
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:17,680
cells uh would be fed with different

1227
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:22,159
hemp seed products definitely and the

1228
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:25,199
impact on pig like growth. Um Sarah uh

1229
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:27,118
how was uh hempseed meal stored? How

1230
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:28,798
long can it be stored without

1231
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:31,200
refrigeration?

1232
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:33,280
concern over microtoxins or rotten

1233
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:37,519
during storage. Again, I'm going to need

1234
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:41,760
the experts here. Um I think that okay,

1235
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:44,719
in in in the case of uh my studies um uh

1236
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:47,440
when we received the hem mill, we place

1237
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:51,358
the hemp seed mill uh in a facility that

1238
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:53,838
is dry um and not warm. basically it's

1239
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:57,119
der and about environmental temperature

1240
00:59:53,838 --> 01:00:00,318
uh regulated wasn't co cooled and we had

1241
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:04,079
it for about 3 months before we started

1242
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:08,000
the trials. Uh as far as like long-term

1243
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:10,680
storage um there is some potential

1244
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:14,079
issues because of the fat content and

1245
01:00:10,679 --> 01:00:17,279
rancidity. Uh again, I would uh not want

1246
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:19,119
to get into um this area because I would

1247
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:22,160
like prefer leaving that to some of

1248
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:26,000
those experts uh like Clary and and

1249
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:29,039
Morgan of course and then Trey. Um so

1250
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:34,159
but but super important question, right?

1251
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:36,000
Um we have a um we have a uh a comment

1252
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:38,239
here from Sarah, I think to everyone

1253
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,559
too, but I wanted to highlight that uh

1254
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:41,719
these are expensive trials on high value

1255
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:43,920
animals.

1256
01:00:41,719 --> 01:00:45,838
Absolutely. Thank you for being careful

1257
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,920
with them trying to improve all aspects

1258
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:49,599
of animal feed. Thank you. Thank you

1259
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,760
Sarah for the great comment. It means a

1260
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:53,400
lot to us. Um and all this stuff

1261
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,960
wouldn't be possible without our

1262
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:58,798
students. Um the hemp growers, uh my

1263
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:01,039
mentors, I call them my mentors even

1264
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:04,159
though they're not official. Uh Larry

1265
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:06,558
and and Joe, um and all the staff around

1266
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:08,000
us. So, and two more studies, right?

1267
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:10,160
We're going to have a big big trial

1268
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,280
coming up with with horses, dairy cows,

1269
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:14,719
and and chickens um this upcoming year.

1270
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:18,079
So, we're looking forward to doing all

1271
01:01:14,719 --> 01:01:19,919
that good stuff. So, the feed smells

1272
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:21,839
really good, by the way. So, when we're

1273
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,920
mixing this feed, my student always go,

1274
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:25,318
I want to taste it. I'm like, well, you

1275
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:28,480
can go, but I don't want to be

1276
01:01:25,318 --> 01:01:30,558
responsible. Right.

1277
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,318
Thank you. Thank you so much for your

1278
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:35,119
talk and these are really important

1279
01:01:32,318 --> 01:01:38,079
studies indeed. Um, I want to remind

1280
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:41,039
everyone that we've uh recorded the

1281
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:43,920
webinar and we'll be uploading it to our

1282
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:47,519
SIPs YouTube channel soon. Thank you,

1283
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:50,159
Natalie, and everyone uh for connecting,

1284
01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:52,239
for joining us today. Have a nice rest

1285
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:55,239
of your week.

1286
01:01:52,239 --> 01:01:55,239
