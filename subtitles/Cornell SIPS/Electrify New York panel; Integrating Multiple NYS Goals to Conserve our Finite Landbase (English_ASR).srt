1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,960
University so welcome everyone um I hope

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:20,278
this is recording well

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:22,960
online uh this is a conceptual panel for

5
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:26,599
the live handson energy Expo that

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,920
happens tomorrow out in the a quad um

7
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:31,160
and what we're featuring today is about

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,200
electrifying new YK York how efficiency

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,159
and electrification opportunities are

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,160
available to us today so the great thing

11
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:41,000
about efficiency electrification is it

12
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:43,159
improves air quality it reduces

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,920
greenhouse gases and it conserves New

14
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:47,640
York State's natural resources and

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,120
that's the idea behind this panel and

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,480
it's to also in conjunction with the

17
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:54,280
climate leadership and Community

18
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:58,038
protection act or the clcpa in 2019 to

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,760
reduce our emissions 40% by 2030 and 85%

20
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:01,840
by

21
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:03,439
2050 this is only an umbrella policy

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,118
right it's a goal planning policy

23
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,959
there's lots of other little policies

24
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,079
that need to be built up underneath it

25
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,239
and we all need to start thinking about

26
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:15,599
what kinds of policies we want to build

27
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:18,959
up we will hear about one such idea

28
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:21,719
later but to give us a sense on how much

29
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:24,399
we are emitting as a state the gross

30
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:27,840
emissions in 2020 well the New York

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:31,400
State emitted 350 million metric tons of

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,680
carbon dioxide equivalents in in 2020

33
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,640
but notably it was 15% lower than 1990

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,600
so part of our work is already done you

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,680
can see right here where our current

36
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:45,280
levels are we're 15% below now what I

37
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,520
want to stress here is even though my

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,478
specialty is in this orange bar for

39
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:53,158
agriculture the blue bar is what we all

40
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:56,679
need to tackle this is our energy

41
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,840
consumption in the state and most of our

42
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,960
emissions come from the building sector

43
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,680
and the transportation

44
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,959
sector and that is the theme today that

45
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,000
we're focusing on um how do we take care

46
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:12,598
of this majority of

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,919
emissions doing this in our community

48
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:17,039
means we have improved air quality right

49
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:19,679
lower asthma lower particulate matter

50
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,199
lower cancer lower greenhouse gases and

51
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,360
lower extreme weather events lower

52
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:26,799
insurance and future crises lower

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,440
instability for farmers who depend on

54
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,360
the weather and notably if we reduce our

55
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:35,159
energy demand we also reduce our Demand

56
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,360
on the rural Landscapes to support

57
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:39,000
renewable energy projects so for example

58
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,879
this morning we heard from our

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,719
colleagues Ted uh cotch and Peter

60
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:48,039
Woodberry that we need about 75 to

61
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:49,000
125,000 hectares to meet our solar goals

62
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:51,598
in

63
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,878
2050 right so everything we do to reduce

64
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,839
our energy

65
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:59,120
consumption also helps our land base so

66
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,120
I want to just talk some some words

67
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,239
because I realized I uh decarbonization

68
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,680
is very familiar to me and it just means

69
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,680
reducing or eliminating carbon from the

70
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,120
fossil fuel emissions from a sector so

71
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,799
it could be from any sector like

72
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,319
Transportation buildings or power

73
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:19,040
electrification means replacing

74
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:20,359
technologies that run on fossil fuels

75
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,120
with Alternatives that run more

76
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,000
efficiently on electricity it also means

77
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,680
generating all that electricity from

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
clean energy rather than fossil fuels

79
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,560
right and this is a key point because

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,959
whenever you think about electrification

81
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,799
right it could be made from a fossil

82
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,680
fuel so we're trying to connect that in

83
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,560
and weatherization Home Improvements

84
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,438
that reduce energy use and make homes

85
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,199
more comfortable these include things

86
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:45,280
like moisture control air sealing

87
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,719
ventilation upgrades to insulation doors

88
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,680
and

89
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:52,680
windows I now want to segue to the role

90
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,959
of extension when extension was made in

91
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,879
the 1800s 64% of our Workforce was in

92
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,239
farming today only 10% of our Workforce

93
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:03,798
is in farming

94
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,599
yet everything we do as Urban or rural

95
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:08,280
citizens to reduce our greenhouse gas

96
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:10,039
emissions helps current and Future

97
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,400
Farmers have a more stable environment

98
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:14,639
to grow our food current and future

99
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,439
citizens have less damage to homes and

100
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:20,120
shared infrastructure and our land bases

101
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:22,439
can serve for other uses reducing our

102
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,680
community emissions is defense for

103
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:26,439
Agriculture and Forestry and it's

104
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,319
something that everybody in this room

105
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:30,519
can

106
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:32,159
do so I just want us to look at the

107
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:34,799
Cooperative Extension passage of the

108
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,800
Smith lever act in 1914 and see how much

109
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,759
it resonates in

110
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,439
2024 Cooperative Agricultural Extension

111
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,280
work shall consist of the development of

112
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,478
practical applications of research

113
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:48,959
knowledge instruction and practical

114
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,959
demonstrations of existing or improved

115
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:54,439
practices and Technologies in

116
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:57,638
agriculture uses of solar energy in

117
00:04:54,439 --> 00:05:00,360
1914 with respect to agriculture home

118
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:02,879
economics and Rural energy I just think

119
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,319
this is really key right because our

120
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:10,560
landscape has changed but our mission to

121
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:13,159
work on behalf of each other um is the

122
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,079
same just for some reference I love

123
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,360
showing this rural electrification

124
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:20,000
Administration posters from

125
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,120
1937 right as we were looking to

126
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,160
Electrify then how can we make posters

127
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,840
that make these things pable

128
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,840
today same thing here

129
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:34,719
so how can we brand efficiency and

130
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:37,079
electric electrification for our

131
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,080
Century I want to just take a moment we

132
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:41,800
weren't able to get Stephen winter

133
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:44,639
Associates to come and talk about their

134
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,639
multifamily retrofit playbooks but I

135
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,280
recommend them for everyone they have

136
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,639
different typologies and I'm going to

137
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,359
focus on a post-war four to seven

138
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:55,478
stories because that's my apartment

139
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,240
building in New York City you can find

140
00:05:55,478 --> 00:06:01,360
these at be exchange.org

141
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,160
and what these do is they target several

142
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,319
areas lighting the building envelope

143
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,000
ventilation heating cooling and hot

144
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:12,560
water they then break down the

145
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,120
proportion of energy by Heating and hot

146
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,399
water right and then there are some

147
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:20,879
other smaller sources um but this helps

148
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:23,519
you start honing in on where your energy

149
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:26,759
use is and therefore probably where your

150
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,758
um greenhouse gases are and then it sets

151
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,520
recommendations these are available to

152
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,720
anyone but it helps you go from having

153
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:37,359
to retrofit your entire house and being

154
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,599
overwhelmed by it to honing in on the

155
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,319
highest priorities or the easiest things

156
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:44,279
to do first or most costeffective things

157
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,759
to do first and they have it for all

158
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,758
different kinds of building types not

159
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,598
just New York City building types and

160
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:54,639
the other point I want to stress here is

161
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:56,839
um that New York City their emissions

162
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,598
are predominantly buildings and so this

163
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:01,359
is also Rob we're not going to talk

164
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:04,598
about it today this is a huge objective

165
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,879
in New York City um and that each time

166
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:09,519
you do something you can see how you're

167
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:12,479
moving towards your goal of En energy

168
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,399
reduction and greenhouse gas mitigation

169
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:17,000
so to make this all real we have

170
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,959
coordinated an energy Expo for you all

171
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,519
tomorrow um open on the ad quad from

172
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:25,758
10:00 a. to 5:00 P pm and so far no rain

173
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:28,240
is scheduled um and also in the man

174
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,280
Library Foy year in the Foye is mostly

175
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:36,079
incentives and job opportunities and um

176
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:40,638
some displays and outside um it it's all

177
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:43,279
equipment uh to to Electrify your lives

178
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,720
you can see some Maple how to make maple

179
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:48,359
sugaring more efficient how to build

180
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,639
affordable storm windows understanding

181
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,919
window science explore electric tract

182
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,560
tractors skid steers and Sawmills learn

183
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:57,359
about Precision AG drone features find

184
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,800
incentives to weatherize your home

185
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,080
explore electric landscaping equipment

186
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,800
and understand the next generation of

187
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:06,758
greenhouse light

188
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,478
efficiency it's really real the whole

189
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:13,800
point is that it's real so come join

190
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:17,719
us okay our land is 61% forested I

191
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:22,478
always like to bring us into our space

192
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:24,319
61% forested 20% agriculture 133% idle

193
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,519
and we also need to think about how to

194
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,759
activate those idle lands right as

195
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,318
extension we work with homeowners or we

196
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:34,000
work with farmers or Foresters how many

197
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:37,080
times do we work with an idle or former

198
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,679
AG land owner we generally don't and we

199
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,519
need to activate those in order to think

200
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,359
about the big picture

201
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,560
here and the goal here is the highest

202
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,120
and best use I would argue we should

203
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:51,159
activate those Idol lands for solar so

204
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,159
that we can continue growing high

205
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:55,799
quality products on our Agland but

206
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,120
fundamentally everything we do to

207
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:00,639
conserve energy conserves both our

208
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:05,399
climate and our our land

209
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:07,439
area so here we are uh launching into

210
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:10,360
today's panelists you're first going to

211
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,880
hear from Gabriel Gurley from CCE

212
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:16,000
Tomkins about Farm Energy Efficiency

213
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:18,679
then we're going to hear from Ken about

214
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,399
electrifying landscaping equipment then

215
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:24,599
we'll hear from Josh about weatherizing

216
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:27,399
homes Danielle will then present on some

217
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,440
efficiency Pilots that she's been doing

218
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:32,480
and then uh hopefully it's all going to

219
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,720
work out but at 3:45 Moren Ley from New

220

Conservation will come in and talk about

222
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,440
the New York State cap and invest or

223
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:46,040
Nikki program that is coming forward as

224
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,040
a way to fund these kinds of projects

225
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:53,480
and more as we move this process

226
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:55,039
along okay so which piece of this pie

227
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,839
are you going to eat of because it is

228
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:01,319
