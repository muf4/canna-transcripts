1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:05,120
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,120
university

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,719
okay

4
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,239
thanks carol

5
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:14,798
sometimes they try to follow the rule

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,079
not bigger than it really is i think she

7
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:20,480
just did but uh yeah we're always

8
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,639
looking at innovative ways to try and

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,560
improve crop production and soil health

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,320
and

11
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:29,439
in my earlier years

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,118
soil health was not a big concern that

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,558
covered crops

14
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,238
that was nothing you really paid

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,238
attention to but

16
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,599
as time went on looking at what i

17
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,320
thought was

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,520
the demise or lusting of crop production

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,679
in the area that's when i started

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,359
focusing on cover crops and soil health

21
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,878
and

22
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,640
reduce tillage was a key part of it but

23
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,558
everything we've done seems to have

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,399
positive impact on our bottom line our

25
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:55,359
yields every year seem to be getting

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,799
better

27
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,799
inputs

28
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,558
seem to be going down somewhat if you

29
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,558
want to say nutrient management is

30
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,558
important part of it

31
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:05,438
focusing on banning all the nutrients we

32
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:07,840
can

33
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:10,879
our chemical dependency yes we're still

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,478
dependent on chemicals but

35
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,158
with our reduced tillage methods and

36
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,239
cover crops we finally been able to

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,719
reduce some of the herbicide application

38
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:21,039
rates instead of being on a maximum end

39
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,879
of scales be to the medium or lower in

40
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,118
the scales but

41
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:27,280
i think i've said enough

42
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:30,078
right now i'm going to introduce wally's

43
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,280
if i butcher anybody's names i apologize

44
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:35,039
but he's not even here okay

45
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,560
yeah but they're they're taping this and

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,600
recording it but

47
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,680
wally zakowski and mike zigna

48
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,559
mike's a field manager they started

49
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,200
using zone tillage about three years ago

50
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,719
they farm about 180 acres including vine

51
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,799
crops tobaccos cabbage and broccoli

52
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,798
they use zone tillage on pumpkins and

53
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,079
winter squash

54
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,920
they've been very pleased with the

55
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,000
results thus far especially the

56
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,320
spaghetti squash

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,599
planted on a heavy rye residue

58
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,758
they've shared their equipment with

59
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,239
three neighbors and have also heard

60
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,479
positive results well it doesn't look

61
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,319
like yields are different

62
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,959
which i wouldn't expect but they didn't

63
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:17,359
experience a yield drag apparently

64
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,439
there's much less wind erosion and

65
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,800
better drought tolerance in fields that

66
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,280
were zoned till

67
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,840
with this i'll turn it over to mike

68
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,159
he's going to explain the operation

69
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,159
thank you

70
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,840
how's everybody doing today

71
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,238
um my name is mike i

72
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,760
was at uh from plainville farm and

73
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,120
hadley madison down in the connecticut

74
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,079
river valley

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,840
um

76
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,000
we have uh

77
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,280
an extreme problem with soil compaction

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,280
down there

79
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,280
the reason we got it to zone till was we

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,800
grow our main one of our main crops is

81
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,640
butternut squash

82
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,400
and uh we had one year

83
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,158
where we ended up not being able to sell

84
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,480
a lot of it we also peel it but we were

85
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,158
not able to sell a lot of it due to a

86
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,878
lot of ground stain

87
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,759
so we started looking around

88
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:11,359
and

89
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,399
the zone tillage actually seemed like it

90
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,280
would be a pretty good idea to get into

91
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,239
for us for that reason

92
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,239
so the first year we ended up uh we

93
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,158
ended up finding a used machine

94
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,878
due to the price of a new one

95
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:28,158
um we made it suit our needs

96
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,639
um

97
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:33,359
most of our compaction was uh probably

98
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,759
from 15 to 19 inches down so we set the

99
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,120
machine for about 22 inches

100
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,399
so we wouldn't have a problem with

101
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,080
anything

102
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,920
and um

103
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,599
it seemed to do all right the first year

104
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,439
we tried it on a few acres about five

105
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:49,280
acres of fun or

106
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:50,560
and a couple acres of spaghetti squash

107
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,000
the real

108
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,519
the real

109
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,360
uh

110
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,879
difference we saw was more in the

111
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,720
spaghetti squash actually than in the

112
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,798
butternut

113
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,318
the spaghetti squash

114
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,840
seemed to not have anywhere near the

115
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:06,158
ground scarring

116
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,598
and was a lot cleaner

117
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:11,840
than than we had expected

118
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:11,840
the

119
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
the

120
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:18,319
cover crops weren't that great the first

121
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,959
year though

122
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:23,199
due to not previously planning on buying

123
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,399
a machine we had to work with what we

124
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,759
had from

125
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,279
from

126
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,120
the year before

127
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,799
which was the cover crops weren't as

128
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,879
thick as they should have been

129
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,160
but it was a good good trial experience

130
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,040
anyway

131
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,520
the second year that we used it

132
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,000
we increased our acreage a little bit

133
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,359
we went to uh

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,519
we went to about

135
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,040
four acres of spaghetti

136
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,399
i think it was about 10 acres of

137
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,240
butternut and

138
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:52,079
we also tried a few acres of sugar

139
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,240
pumpkins

140
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,519
the butternut once again

141
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,800
we didn't really see any yield

142
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,279
differences

143
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,280
but time wise spending instead of

144
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,279
spending a day and a half

145
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,399
longer to prep the field before we could

146
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,399
plant it

147
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:09,198
it you know if i started about 15

148
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:12,000
minutes before

149
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,439
wall-e was doing most of the planting

150
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,199
i could stay well ahead of them with the

151
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,879
machine which you know it's just better

152
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,879
ground moisture

153
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,199
less time less fuel

154
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,120
less aggravation

155
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,840
which that time of year is a good thing

156
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,840
to have less of

157
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,679
for the uh for side dressing we we

158
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,680
didn't have a uh

159
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,879
a machine

160
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,639
set up for side dressing so we ended up

161
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,478
taking one of our real estate elevators

162
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,519
with two

163
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:44,639
and we took all the rollers off of it

164
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:46,719
bought an old potato fertilizer hopper

165
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,199
with us with the transmission

166
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,880
mounted it on top of it and we had two

167
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,800
double disc openers that we put on the

168
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:57,439
side of it and we um

169
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,120
it worked out really well we

170
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,680
removed the disc openers about two

171
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,120
inches to each side of the plants

172
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,639
and we were about we were only a couple

173
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,918
inches in the ground

174
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,600
and it worked out really well it was

175
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:08,799
enough to cover this cover the dry

176
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,560
fertilizer

177
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,759
and not disturb

178
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,120
disturb the uh the soil too much so that

179
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,879
the um

180
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,759
the cover the cover crop was still there

181
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,759
before it was supposed to be

182
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:24,240
um

183
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,000
once again the quality the quality

184
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,879
was a big factor with this

185
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,840
the um

186
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:41,439
the third the third year

187
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:42,318
was uh

188
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,639
uh

189
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,479
that was 2009 that was that was an

190
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,800
extremely wet year

191
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:51,758
and uh this machine really it really

192
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,160
showed what it could do in that year

193
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,000
we had fields that uh

194
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,319
were next planted with butternut that

195
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,720
were next to another field of butternut

196
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,240
and our field had hardly any water

197
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,479
standing in it compared to the one that

198
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,439
was next to it same dip same

199
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:09,598
same knolls a lot of rolling ground

200
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,598
and

201
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:12,639
the disease pressure seemed to be a

202
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,159
little bit less

203
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,639
not a lot but

204
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,560
a lot enough enough to make a difference

205
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,639
where we actually sprayed one time less

206
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,519
than the fillet next to us

207
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,759
and the other big factor was when we

208
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,000
went through and sprayed the fields

209
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,598
we weren't sinking in up to a foot

210
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,519
foot and a half of the sprayer like the

211
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:33,038
other fella went through the fields for

212
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,399
which which makes a difference in the

213
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:35,759
end too

214
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,679
um

215
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,280
it uh the product

216
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,478
that year was

217
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,318
it was

218
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,800
it was our rate i mean nobody nobody had

219
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,560
a real good year that year where we were

220
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,960
and

221
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,240
the quality we store we store a lot of

222
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:51,839
the butter

223
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,199
the quality seemed

224
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,959
it seemed to hold up pretty good

225
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,639
it

226
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,758
it wasn't the best but like i said it

227
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,759
was it was a tough year

228
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:11,120
every year

229
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:12,478
the only thing i can say is every year

230
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,199
that we've been using the machine we're

231
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,878
finding um the more that we use it the

232
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,038
more we like it the more things we're

233
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,919
trying it on the more luck we're having

234
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,318
with it

235
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,399
and to be honest julia we really haven't

236
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,199
found anything we don't like about using

237
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,399
it

238
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,319
it's it's an easy machine to use it's

239
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,720
it's adjustable the wide variety of

240
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,720
crops

241
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,439
the one thing

242
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,360
that

243
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,200
that we noticed last year

244
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,800
this past season with it being as dry as

245
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,240
it was was wind eroding out where we are

246
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,039
there's a lot of guys that grow sweet

247
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,839
corn

248
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,559
and a lot of conventional tillage

249
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,320
and

250
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:54,719
when we were we were planting our squash

251
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,160
on the sweet corn feels very tilled and

252
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,680
there was a couple days there where

253
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,360
there looked like a sandstorm out there

254
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,719
you couldn't even you couldn't even see

255
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,399
the plant

256
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,080
but when you drove by the zone till

257
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,440
field there was hardly any sand blowing

258
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,959
there's a lot to be said for that the

259
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,920
plants the plants didn't get wind

260
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,000
whipped

261
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,838
uh not not from our field they dig in a

262
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,039
little wind whip from the other guys on

263
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,399
the other sides of us of course but

264
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,399
it was

265
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,720
it was interesting to see how we're you

266
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,159
know the way it worked that year as well

267
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,639
um

268
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,399
we did notice a difference too in the in

269
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,639
the uh

270
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,600
in the butternut that was on zone till

271
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:35,360
versus a conventional that um the plants

272
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,800
were healthier they seemed to for

273
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,399
whatever reason need to get down to the

274
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:39,838
water more or

275
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,799
i don't know what their reasoning behind

276
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,959
it was but it seemed to work out

277
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:47,120
very well for us

278
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,278
the fruit quality was excellent

279
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,879
the yields the yields were

280
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,120
where they should have been

281
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,600
they were up a little bit on our land

282
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,360
that we had the zone till on versus the

283
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,639
conventional fields only because the

284
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,560
plants seem to survive a lot better

285
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,799
the one thing that uh

286
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,119
that we're going to try this upcoming

287
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:07,120
year

288
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,560
using the zone till

289
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,519
the one thing

290
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,039
that i can't stress enough is

291
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,679
is that

292
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,879
as as much as you use is until the roll

293
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:20,719
cleaners

294
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,278
on the front of your plant are just as

295
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,000
important as the zone tilt is

296
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,838
if you're going through heavy rye

297
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,639
we actually on the spaghetti squash we

298
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,640
have

299
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,399
because it's planted a little bit later

300
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,879
the rye is usually taller and then it

301
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,120
mattes down and the zone till

302
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,159
two discs in the basket will actually

303
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,399
ride

304
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,600
over that matted ride to a certain

305
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,600
extent

306
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,959
and what happens is when the planter

307
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,399
goes through the first couple of years

308
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,759
we didn't have

309
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,759
the um

310
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:50,958
the rope cleaners on there

311
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,439
and

312
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:55,119
we ended up having to stock it over

313
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,800
and we went to a couple of meetings

314
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,000
sessions during the winter and after

315
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,439
that

316
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,839
we ended up it was brought to our

317
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,839
intention that the royal cleaners are

318
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,720
important and we ended up putting them

319
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,720
on

320
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,000
and since we've done that we haven't had

321
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,959
we haven't had this stock over or

322
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,519
or

323
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:15,119
you know restock a field that's been

324
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,519
it's been a

325
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,519
blessing

326
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,838
the thing the future coming down the

327
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,959
road what we hope to do uh this year

328
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,200
we're actually going to end up putting

329
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,719
road cleaners on on the zone till

330
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,360
machine

331
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,839
only because of

332
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,278
of the thickness of the ride

333
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,880
we don't really see

334
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,120
where it's going to affect anything else

335
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:40,000
um

336
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,360
every little bit helps

337
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,399
and

338
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,399
for we're shooting like uh

339
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,399
one of the machines at honor show

340
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,240
had a fertilizer hopper on it and we're

341
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,480
going to start uh

342
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,159
uh playing with banding bending some dry

343
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,680
fertilizers

344
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,000
only because every year the price of

345
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,159
fertilizer keeps going through the roof

346
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
um especially uh you know guys that are

347
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,719
growing corn with the potash cottage

348
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,278
here i guess it's going to be phenomenal

349
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,079
and uh any any

350
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:12,720
any little bit of money we can save you

351
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,439
know down the road is

352
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,879
is

353
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,800
money in our pocket

354
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,039
so

355
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,719
and then what we hope to really do is do

356
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,159
a one-pass tillage with mounting a

357
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,120
couple of uh

358
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:27,120
vacuum units behind the road units so

359
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,320
that one passed down the field will

360
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,240
literally take care of everything

361
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,399
that's that's what we we're striving for

362
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,440
that's probably two three years down the

363
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,759
road a little bit every year but um

364
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,160
that's that's hopefully where we uh

365
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,919
where we aim to be in a couple years and

366
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,838
like i say the more we've used it the

367
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,078
more we love it and

368
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,320
i can't uh anybody that talks to me i

369
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,799
just i can't i can't say anything bad

370
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,360
about the machine and i just i try to

371
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:57,679
encourage everybody to try it so

372
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,680
thank you

373
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,078
thank you mike anybody got any questions

374
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:09,919
for him quick

375
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:12,479
yes uh did you roll the cover cup or you

376
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:15,039
mowed it uh we just spray it and

377
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,720
go right through it yeah

378
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:19,519
you spray it plenty ahead yes we

379
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,639
usually

380
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,480
we usually

381
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,480
the cover crop we usually spray um

382
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,240
uh beginning april

383
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,159
as we're

384
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,000
we're not organic so

385
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,879
as early as we can spray it we will

386
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,639
except for the spaghetti squash because

387
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,879
it's planted a little bit later so we

388
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,079
let it let the rind stuff get a little

389
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,240
bit bigger

390
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,919
we're starting to experiment also so

391
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,639
this year we have a lot of sedan grass

392
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:46,719
in

393
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,440
so it'll be interesting to see how that

394
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,480
machine will do once a day ingress

395
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,480
after being laid down

396
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,078
and yes

397
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,560
you're not incorporating any harvest

398
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:01,359
leftovers so do you see any increase in

399
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,919
overwintering insects

400
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,399
in the after the one thing we uh we

401
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:09,198
chisel plow all our land after after we

402
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,399
go through harvest harvested crops

403
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,078
um

404
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,399
what we're what we're

405
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:17,198
aiming to do is try and get away from

406
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,759
the arrow which is you know non-vertical

407
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:22,479
tillage any vertical tillages seems to

408
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:25,120
work better for us so what we've done in

409
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,680
the past is just sew the rye and

410
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,679
run over with with a disc chisel

411
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,120
and it seems to work beautiful the ride

412
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,519
it takes a little bit longer for the

413
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,480
ride to come up but it does come up

414
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,120
decent you know it's a good stand how

415
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,920
deep do you go no with the chisel plow

416
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,919
about 12 inches

417
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:48,078
any other questions

418
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,079
all right thank you

419
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:53,838
thank you mike a couple uh while he was

420
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,519
talking a couple things he mentioned

421
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,440
wind erosion

422
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,360
up our way uh

423
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,760
on these nice winter days sometimes you

424
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,079
can drive up down the roads and

425
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,600
you can tell where conventional tillage

426
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:06,319
is done and we're reduced tillage is

427
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,079
done

428
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,839
just by the color of the snow banks on

429
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:12,319
the horizon

430
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:16,000
uh fertility he's talking about bending

431
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,760
depending more nutrients upcoming year

432
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,159
there's been you know test results

433
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,879
proven results that banning nutrients

434
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:25,519
get you a much higher efficiency rate so

435
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,198
so thus banding nutrients with a higher

436
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,480
efficiency rate you can use lesser

437
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,159
ratings

438
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,639
there's one pass

439
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:34,319
pass operation uh trying to put planted

440
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,079
units on the back

441
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,240
we do have some growers

442
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:39,439
where i'm from i'm 100 miles west of

443
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,320
here

444
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,959
20 miles outside of rochester new york

445
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,000
and there are some growers off our way

446
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,518
growing

447
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,919
corn

448
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,320
silage corn grain corn that

449
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,799
do have planters attached right behind

450
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,680
their zone builders and are doing a

451
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:59,679
one-pass operation

452
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,838
my concern is we have a lot of rock that

453
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:04,319
way and i'm afraid that planter pace

454
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,560
pays a pretty good toll sometimes uh

455
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,879
zone builder has a tendency to pull some

456
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,559
of those particles up but

457
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,559
they seem to be making it work all right

458
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,518
and it's a pretty efficient form one

459
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:15,758
pass

460
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,240
one person one tractor one passing the

461
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:21,919
crops in the ground

462
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,079
now we have joseph brightly he's gonna

463
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:26,799
give us his overview of what he's been

464
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:29,039
doing joel lives in hamlin

465
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:31,919
grew up working on his father's farm

466
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,120
dean p brightly farms growing processing

467
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:35,120
vegetables

468
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,440
cabbage and winter squash he graduated

469
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,440
from cornell in 2009

470
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,680
and enthusiastically tried his own

471
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,160
tillage in 2010

472
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,679
his father been kind of stepping on his

473
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,519
head a little bit holding him down a

474
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:50,799
little joe's pretty

475
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,560
pretty he is enthusiastic

476
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:55,919
joe's called me you know we've conversed

477
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:57,119
a few times at meetings on the phone

478
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,039
he's

479
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,639
got a real big interest in this reduced

480
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,480
tillage and trying to improve the crop

481
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,519
crop production

482
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:09,880
so far he's done a pretty good job so

483
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,879
joe turn it over to you

484
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,079
yeah as don said my day gives me enough

485
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:31,359
rope to hang myself

486
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,119
and then as i get close to dying he

487
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,839
pulls me back up so

488
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,119
i'm joe brightly from hamlet new york um

489
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:39,199
we're about

490
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:40,719
25 miles west of rochester five miles

491
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,960
north of broad port

492
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,000
we strip to about 1500 acres of mixed

493
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,440
grains

494
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,919
and vegetables

495
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,360
we use a case ih 1240 planter for just

496
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,960
about all of it

497
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:55,279
we have a 12 year old brilliant zone

498
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,279
commander and we have rtk gps

499
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:00,959
the gps is essential in my mind it helps

500
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,119
the operator see

501
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,400
where he's going even if we can't see it

502
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:06,000
allows him look back at the planter

503
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,120
there's a lot more going on whether it

504
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,279
be moving debris as you said rocks

505
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,038
and things like that

506
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,519
and at the end of the day it really does

507
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:17,119
help the operator from looking back like

508
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:18,960
this all the time and trying to focus on

509
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,359
where you're going makes your life a lot

510
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,360
easier

511
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,639
on our planter we have floating roll

512
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,558
cleaners which do whip away the debris

513
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,840
notice i say look away the degree you

514
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:31,038
don't want to be making trenches you

515
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,199
want to be just lightly moving the

516
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:34,240
debris away this allows the gauge wheels

517
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,919
to move

518
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,240
smoothly across the ground

519
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,400
which helps uniform seat depth uniform

520
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,759
seat depth is essential

521
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,600
you want to have them come up within

522
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,960
hours upon each other which will drive

523
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:46,879
you

524
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,360
we have pneumatic down pressure

525
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,360
which helps dramatically in different

526
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,359
field conditions zone till it actually

527
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:54,479
seeps a little more mellower than if you

528
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,719
go across the ground with a field

529
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,720
calibrator and a color packer if you go

530
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,400
from one section to fill the other on a

531
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,919
large field you'll be able to adjust the

532
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,840
down pressure now the best way i've

533
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,200
found to adjust down pressure is you get

534
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,038
the planter down

535
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,960
go back there you grab the gauge wheel

536
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:11,119
if you can't turn it at all you got to

537
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,798
lessen the ground the down pressure if

538
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,000
you can spin it freely

539
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:16,480
you need to increase it you should be

540
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,079
able to just turn it just a little bit

541
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,919
that's where you want to be

542
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:21,599
we have a fertilizer culture on front to

543
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,038
band fertilizer

544
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:24,639
we have a single disc

545
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,480
and you want if you have a lot of debris

546
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,600
look at non-fluid

547
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,558
coulters

548
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,959
sometimes the quilted the colder

549
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:34,399
discs will hair pin more

550
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,480
if you really have a problem with that

551
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,919
look at straight coulters

552
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,160
and in the back of this coat we have an

553
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,360
injector we have used the the knife and

554
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,919
the shank that goes right behind the

555
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,199
coulter we press it right up against it

556
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,720
even though it's compressed right up

557
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,400
against it we've still had issues with

558
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,960
corn stalks and other debris getting

559
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,640
wedged up in there creating

560
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,759
the cold air to stop turning and that's

561
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,320
a real pain

562
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,679
especially at 7 30 at night

563
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:59,918
these are the road cleaners they are

564
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,280
floating see these donuts right here

565
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,759
these are essential for these shark

566
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:06,319
teeth floating roll cleaners if not they

567
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:08,720
will do a lot of damage by moving debris

568
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:10,158
sometimes too much

569
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,759
these donuts help

570
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,760
put a uniform depth you can actually

571
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,158
also get wider donuts to help if you

572
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,839
have a really sandy ground

573
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,360
this is the medic down pressure this is

574
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,639
the airbag in there it's kind of tough

575
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,158
to see

576
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,360
and

577
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,120
there's a gauge up front with an air

578
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:26,240
compressor that you can adjust you can

579
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:28,319
actually do it from the cab on some

580
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,798
models so if you're going across the

581
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:32,480
field you can just adjust it increase it

582
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,879
or lessen it there

583
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,880
precision plane does have air force

584
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,720
which will actually increase

585
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,480
the planer so it's not pushing down as

586
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,200
hard if you have 100 pounds of seat in

587
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,519
the back you'll actually press it up

588
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,840
so it's not bulldozing as much and

589
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,839
create in lessening sidewall compaction

590
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,159
this is the fertilizer saddle

591
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,079
as you can see this is the injector

592
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,679
right here it's mounted a spring so it

593
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:01,359
moves around like a finger

594
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,720
and this is a very lightly

595
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,000
fluted coulter

596
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,279
i have not moved to straight cultures

597
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,079
yeah i've not had that big of an issue

598
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,079
i've just heard of that

599
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,038
okay our strip tiller is a 12 roll

600
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,720
brilliant can be folded up and the six

601
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,400
rows can be run as a deep ripper if you

602
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,600
want to run deep i actually told the

603
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,120
fella to go out there and take away all

604
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:20,240
the stops and he called me back and said

605
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:21,759
joe this

606
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,279
this disc won't pull it

607
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,200
i said wait it's only six rows it's a

608
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,079
425 horsepower tractor he goes it won't

609
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,600
pull it

610
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:29,599
i go out there and it thinks 34 inches

611
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:32,558
deep in the ground like well that's

612
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:34,639
probably why it's not fun

613
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:36,879
we run about 12 to 14 inches deep about

614
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,320
two inches above the plow pan and we'll

615
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,080
do this for about two or three years and

616
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:42,720
then we are going to shallow it up i see

617
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:44,798
no need and going down 12 14 inches if

618
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,480
you get rid of compaction

619
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:47,918
you can go we'll go six to eight inches

620
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,200
where we feel that we need to put down

621
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,280
our fertilizer because we are banding

622
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,360
fertilizer deep

623
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,119
we use a straight shank a lot of

624
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,639
parabolic shank in the bottom we're just

625
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,959
creating a slop to the ground to break

626
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,720
the compaction when it's wet

627
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,720
as it gets dryer you can use a probe

628
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,440
chain to kind of shatter it the power

629
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,200
pan similar to concrete

630
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,440
we use two front coulters that do help

631
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,360
size the material this can be an issue

632
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,919
if you have a lot of corn stalks 200

633
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:16,000
bushel corn heavy rod residue it will

634
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,919
plug up and shank or goes into the two

635
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,079
hilling holders

636
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,919
you need to have two front coulters the

637
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,759
size of this you might need to run them

638
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,880
pretty aggressively especially if they

639
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:29,119
will not break up how far apart

640
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,720
about four or five inches

641
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,399
and they're pretty fluted i think

642
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,798
they're an eight-wave hole there so

643
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,559
they're pretty aggressive

644
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:37,839
and fertilizer we're about eight inches

645
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:39,359
deep

646
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,759
we have tried dual placement with some

647
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,639
pnk deep i can't tell you results on

648
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:44,079
that

649
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,000
one thing i will say about fertilizer

650
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,359
going eight inches deep we did some

651
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,359
sweet corn

652
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,399
first of may we got a lot of rain and

653
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:52,079
the corn was about a foot and a half

654
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,320
tall and it was cold

655
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,439
i drive by the field and almost won the

656
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:57,439
ditch

657
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,120
it was green and yellow

658
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,200
i go out in there i cannot figure out

659
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:03,038
why

660
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,640
i actually called donny we talked about

661
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:05,919
it and he said

662
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,038
the thing you gotta realize is that

663
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,640
these roots

664
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:10,158
are about six inches deep right now

665
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,440
maybe eight inches and it's so wet

666
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,679
you're not going deep into getting that

667
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,759
fertilizer so my suggestion for all of

668
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,320
you if you're gonna band fertilizer when

669
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,079
it's early or if you have light ground

670
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:21,678
to put it six inches deep

671
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,359
that way the root will get to it we're

672
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,280
also banding fertilizer onto the planter

673
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:27,038
which is essential and i'm going to tell

674
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:29,119
you we're not side dressing any of these

675
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,720
crops anymore and you do not want them

676
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,439
to stress at any time because that will

677
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,440
reduce your yield

678
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:36,558
this is the double cultures on the front

679
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,600
you see they're pretty aggressive about

680
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:39,599
four to five inches apart

681
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:44,480
this is the shank and the closing discs

682
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,319
notice that the straight point in the

683
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,519
bottom

684
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,158
trust me it pulls hard enough without

685
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:52,480
the parabolic shank on it

686
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,720
this is our fertilizer delivery system

687
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,720
we have a two port or this is actually a

688
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,079
single port john blue piston pump right

689
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,720
off of the trimble

690
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,879
true guide system

691
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,278
goes from here in the red ball system

692
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,320
and it goes into these adjustable uh

693
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:08,319
fertilizer tubes here

694
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,159
now in the squash

695
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,480
uh what we did is we went in

696
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,840
two three weeks in advance on a failo

697
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,000
soybean field from previous year we

698
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:19,759
spread it down by phosphate let it burn

699
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,079
down and we actually did at the disc in

700
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,599
some areas of the rods

701
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:24,879
this is what it looked like directly

702
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:26,558
after planting

703
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,600
notice how there are clumps of dirt and

704
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:28,720
debris

705
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,158
looked away

706
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,000
and the seat belt looks very nice and

707
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,760
metal and flat if anything you want it

708
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,359
to be up a little bit yeah there are

709
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:36,400
times when i have had to run my fur or

710
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:38,719
my

711
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,840
rope landers deeper if it's very clumpy

712
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,679
what are you going to do you got to put

713
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:43,519
it deeper and create a trench you get

714
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,960
good seed to soil contact or you're

715
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:46,960
going to leave it up high you get poor

716
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,519
seed soil contact you're going to put it

717
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,519
down deeper

718
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,960
this is the squash after immersions

719
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,720
notice besides the doubles here

720
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,440
how uniform about

721
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,798
the

722
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,080
convergence is

723
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:02,000
that's what you want to see you don't

724
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,599
want to see some just coming up and some

725
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,278
this high you want to get them all even

726
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:07,278
as you can and there's actually no

727
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:09,599
cresting on here we got rain after this

728
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:11,119
and no crosstalk

729
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,119
for weed management it's very similar to

730
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:14,879
conventional only difference is that we

731
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:17,038
had to burn down first

732
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,360
we used command post plant

733
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:21,759
and we also used sandia where needed and

734
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:24,319
the areas that we did cultivate had

735
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:27,038
dramatically more weeds

736
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,720
and i mean to the row

737
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:30,558
in areas that we do not cultivate or

738
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,319
excuse me areas not disc we really do

739
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:34,079
not need a cultivating sometimes the

740
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,000
sandy did a very nice job

741
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:39,038
taking out the pigweed nut grass and we

742
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,720
didn't have any other um weed issues

743
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:43,839
but we did call it because daddy said

744
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,839
we're gonna

745
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:49,278
this is in the middle of july you can

746
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,400
see it's got a nice uniform canopy cover

747
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:52,880
you really can't ask for much more on

748
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,559
that in a squash field

749
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,320
for our yields you can see our strip

750
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:57,278
tilts on the left and crunches on the

751
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:00,480
right

752
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:02,240
notice there are fewer squash over here

753
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,400
there's more special here but more green

754
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,798
squash and carol just gave me this piece

755
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,360
of paper and i believe it says

756
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:11,839
in a 10 by 20 area there was fewer

757
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:13,918
squash over here on the strip till

758
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:16,079
more over here but these way more per

759
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,120
squash than these ones creating a total

760
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:18,879
yield

761
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:21,359
advantage for these wouldn't mean they

762
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,360
weighed more

763
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,558
i've just got a quick slide and snapping

764
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:29,600
don't have any nice pictures or anything

765
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:32,158
but we did do snap beans we did a piece

766
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:34,079
right after squash previous year came

767
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,240
out fine uh we were very pleased with

768
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,000
how they came up we do not deep band any

769
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,759
fertilizer

770
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,839
one thing i'll say that we learned the

771
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:42,960
hard way is you need to roll the snap

772
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,798
beans

773
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,759
especially on a lighter ground if not

774
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:48,079
you'll get

775
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:49,440
the ridges and maybe some small stones

776
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:51,199
and the guys that picked that do not

777
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,558
like that

778
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,720
after the good luck of that we did

779
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:56,639
double crop after peas and wheat when we

780
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,480
double cropped after peas if we planted

781
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,759
north and south with the peas we planted

782
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,360
east and west

783
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,599
that'll eliminate the wind rose of the

784
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:05,119
peas the pea orbisters they wind roll it

785
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:06,879
and if you go along with a row you had a

786
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:08,798
really tough time i don't care what you

787
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,919
have going through that so went the

788
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:11,759
other way

789
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,440
and we had

790
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:15,440
pretty good luck

791
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,919
very good luck um we actually one of the

792
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,960
thing there was a 40 acre piece and we

793
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,799
were gonna get three and a half inches

794
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,720
of rain or something like that i also

795
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:24,240
plant half the field

796
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,278
three days later three or four days that

797
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,880
we were planning the rest of the field

798
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:28,558
and nobody else was doing there was

799
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,080
nobody wrong we had to plant more

800
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:32,158
because we can get in there

801
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:34,079
following wheat strip towing

802
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,000
and it was amazing i think that's what

803
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:39,359
my dad finally said

804
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,359
i'm glad you went to college

805
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:46,398
and weed management is comparable to

806
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:49,278
conventional it's definitely not better

807
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:51,759
but you can handle you can deal with it

808
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:53,599
it's not the best it's not the worst and

809
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,200
i know that it beats work on the ground

810
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:58,398
four times

811
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,399
planning i can tell you that

812
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,960
now my summary is the management style

813
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,440
of reduced tillage is drastically

814
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,038
different than conventional you spend

815
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,759
less time burning diesel in your

816
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:11,359
character c more time in your office

817
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:13,919
you got to worry about the rotations

818
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,359
herbicide carryovers

819
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,038
and the fertilizer recommendations

820
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:18,959
remember you're not tilling the ground

821
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:21,599
you're not chisel plowing

822
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,480
line then or moldboard plowing lining

823
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:24,639
you got to go out there you got to

824
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,038
spread your potash in the winter let it

825
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,840
work down through natural gravity and

826
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,679
rain

827
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,759
you will get some movement from the

828
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,278
shank and the closing discs but remember

829
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:34,720
there's 15 to 20 inches that's not

830
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:37,119
getting tilted

831
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,399
so your ph will rise in that top inch

832
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:39,918
and you need to address that when you're

833
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:41,519
soil sampling that's something you got

834
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,679
to think of where am i going to soil

835
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,398
sample might get so simple every time in

836
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:49,759
the furrow or like a sporadically sample

837
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:51,119
that's something that is up for debate

838
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:52,879
who really does and you'll have to

839
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:54,398
figure it out i don't know i don't know

840
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,880
if any of you guys know i'd love to know

841
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:59,839
a lot

842
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,840
what

843
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,079
that leads to another thing start at

844
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:09,440
your own pace we do not just do 1500

845
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,439
acres at once

846
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,640
year before we did try some on sweet

847
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,720
corn

848
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,720
and that your own pace maybe five acres

849
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,558
and maybe 20 acres

850
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,960
whatever you want to do don't be pushed

851
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:23,519
into it but don't be scared about it

852
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,960
talk to others and listen talk to him he

853
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:29,359
knows a lot he's actually very very open

854
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,759
conversation as i found out

855
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:34,000
most importantly stay positive we're all

856
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:35,278
going to have issues

857
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,359
trust me there were many times i

858
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:39,679
wondered what i was doing if i should

859
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:41,759
move away find it kicked out

860
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,480
stay positive it does work out in the

861
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:44,079
end

862
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,399
that's all i have to say

863
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:49,639
i think that's all

864
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:49,639
that's it

865
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:04,558
anybody got any questions for or

866
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:05,919
say a question what do you do after

867
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:06,879
harvest

868
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,399
tillage

869
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,159
question was what does he do after

870
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:11,839
harvest from tillage we will try to

871
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,240
no-till on the cover crop

872
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:15,759
or we will spread it right not by itself

873
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,519
or we will spread it and lightly

874
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:19,200
disconnect it all right have you seen

875
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:23,480
any increase in diseases or insects

876
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,480
because of that well it's our first year

877
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:28,000
so after harvest he spreads the cover

878
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:29,839
crop and either lets it lets it

879
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,679
germinate on its own like sometimes it

880
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:33,678
will or lightly incorporates it with a

881
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,480
disc

882
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,038
the

883
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,360
couple things that joe talked about the

884
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:41,599
nitrogen deep

885
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:43,599
uh crop crop blade getting to it

886
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,678
sometimes

887
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:48,639
we did we did see that

888
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,159
early on concerned me

889
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,840
the yield results in the end on the

890
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,840
sweet corn when we were doing a deplete

891
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:55,599
nitrogen and um

892
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:57,038
it concerned me because i could see

893
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:58,879
yellow corn

894
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:00,960
the corn was yellower where the nitrogen

895
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,679
was deep but when we got all said and

896
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,360
done and harvested the yield was

897
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,519
average almost two times the acre more

898
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,639
on those deep place nitrogen plots but

899
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,720
the

900
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,120
concern concern i've been

901
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,038
aware of and awakened to i guess as of

902
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:17,759
lately is

903
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:20,398
the soil as we improve the soil

904
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:21,919
biological health with reduced tillage

905
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:23,278
and cover crops

906
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,720
the

907
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:29,278
soil biological activity microbes

908
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,519
on the surface is where they

909
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:32,640
are the most active on the top few

910
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,679
inches

911
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,480
that

912
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,000
they let they need nitrogen

913
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,679
to survive

914
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,839
so they're

915
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,640
consuming the nitrogen on the shallow

916
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:46,879
part of your soil early on until things

917
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,440
really get going so there is a

918
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,760
possibility under certain crops and

919
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,798
certain fertility programs that you

920
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:55,278
could

921
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:57,599
be starving the crop of nitrogen

922
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:58,960
somewhat if you do not apply some

923
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:01,759
nitrogen

924
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,159
in the in the seed grow area or close to

925
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:05,679
the seed but

926
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,559
we're working on that

927
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:11,278
joe don't talk about weeds weeds and

928
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:14,798
cultivating and that that a few years

929
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:17,038
ago we had a we know till our peas and

930
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:20,319
uh came time to harvest one piece of

931
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:22,640
peas an 80 acre block of peas

932
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:24,240
uh got a heavy rain

933
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,480
well when it's time to harvest peas they

934
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,558
don't care if it rained or not it's time

935
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,399
to go and they go i got a call about two

936
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:31,759
o'clock in the morning and uh

937
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:32,959
needed me to bring my four-wheel drive

938
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:34,720
tractor down because one of the few

939
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,720
machines was stuck

940
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,240
that really excited you know not the

941
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,319
fact that they called me two o'clock in

942
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,599
the morning excited me but the fact that

943
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:43,439
one of those

944
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:46,079
i don't know 30 ton machines or whatever

945
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,679
was stuck out in my field

946
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:51,359
yeah they made a pretty good mess of the

947
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:53,759
field like i say an 80 acre block and

948
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:55,918
out of that we ended up

949
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,278
doing some remedial tillage on it after

950
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,600
the fact when it dried out something

951
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:01,278
with it with a desk trying to level the

952
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:03,678
ruts out

953
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:05,599
that fall we follow with winter we

954
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,360
follow peas with winter wheat don't tell

955
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:08,959
the wheat

956
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:10,798
we have to go to obviously go out and do

957
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,558
a burn down before we plant to control

958
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:14,798
the weeds but

959
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:16,480
where we anywhere we ran the disc over

960
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:18,240
the ground to level the ground out we

961
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,919
got the ground leveled out look pretty

962
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,038
good but

963
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:27,679
that that field or that farm has a very

964
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:29,119
high seat population of lamb's quarters

965
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,720
and about the only place the lamb's

966
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:32,879
quarters grew

967
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,278
was everywhere we ran the disc it was

968
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,320
like the thickest carpet of lamb's

969
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:40,398
quarters and it was right to the line

970
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:41,678
where we ran the disc on all those spots

971
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:43,518
we went out

972
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,440
spot disc if you want to see all the

973
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:48,319
ruts but

974
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,159
it's interesting what what tillage

975
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:53,278
awakens those seeds up if you want to

976
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:57,440
say and brings them to life but

977
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:58,798
rain rain and field operations

978
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,519
it's amazing

979
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:02,319
that not working this soil tearing it up

980
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,159
that

981
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:06,158
you get a rainfall on an inch of rain

982
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,600
can disappear pretty fast on that ground

983
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,119
where field next to you that they've

984
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:10,960
been tilled up

985
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,800
you don't even want to get close to it

986
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,000
there's been several times that the

987
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,720
processor

988
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,599
has got a hold of us after a rain to

989
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:21,358
either plant some sweet corn because

990
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,079
nobody else can go

991
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:26,078
matter of fact this past spring year ago

992
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,599
i was out planting sweet corn one monday

993
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,679
morning and they called me up and said

994
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,879
you know you got 50 acres of sweet corn

995
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,720
you're supposed to plant when do you

996
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:34,559
think you can go

997
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,480
he about dropped in his seat when i told

998
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:39,679
him i'm out going now what's the matter

999
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,079
oh it rained and nobody else can go

1000
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,240
or harvesting they've called called me

1001
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,760
up different times and said uh you know

1002
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,039
we've had a lot of rain they're having

1003
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,520
trouble everywhere else what do you

1004
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:51,119
think about your blocking trade come on

1005
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:53,440
i said it shouldn't be a problem they go

1006
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,079
out and you know no problems

1007
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:00,000
tire tire tread little tire tracks lug

1008
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:02,000
marks but other than that goes good but

1009
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
joe did

1010
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,400
alert to the

1011
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,079
fact that you might not spend as much

1012
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,720
time in that tractor seat as you had

1013
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,880
before you might not burn as much fuel

1014
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:14,559
where you're going to spend more time is

1015
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,760
sitting in the chair in the office

1016
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:17,679
management

1017
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,079
that's probably one of the one of the

1018
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:23,598
biggest things or biggest

1019
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:26,800
what i want to say time time

1020
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:29,119
vacuums if you want to say is

1021
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,200
much more management goes into this

1022
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,720
conventional tillage

1023
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:33,679
you go out you plow it you fit it you

1024
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:35,118
plant it you know what you're going to

1025
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:37,759
do with this here you're always looking

1026
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,160
at new ways to improve the bottom line

1027
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,720
increase your efficiency but

1028
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:44,559
i can't stress enough that management is

1029
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:46,319
much much bigger

1030
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:50,159
part of the puzzle than

1031
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:53,440
is first is first led to be thought of

1032
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:53,440
i said enough on this

1033
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:58,559
now we're gonna have casey coons

1034
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,240
give us an overview of their operation

1035
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:02,000
casey's the operation manager at

1036
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:04,399
hamptondale farms

1037
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,880
diversified farm with approximately 3

1038
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,838
000 acres of cabbage green beans sweet

1039
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:14,880
corn vine crops field corn alfalfa and

1040
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:17,599
wheat they also operate a 700 cow dairy

1041
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,440
and i do read the country folks even

1042
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:23,838
though i'm not a dairy producer bruce

1043
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,760
melt but i always look at the production

1044
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:27,519
go through and eat every month when they

1045
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,359
put the production report in there how

1046
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:30,880
farms are going and i go through the

1047
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:32,559
counties and that people that i

1048
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,920
recognize and

1049
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:38,480
they have a very respectable production

1050
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,920
record and they also have some robotic

1051
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,000
melters there too so

1052
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,680
casey's responsibilities include

1053
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,920
coordinating day-to-day cropping

1054
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:50,559
enterprises overseeing equipment

1055
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,920
operations maintenance repair

1056
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:54,239
replacement

1057
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,079
reduced tillage is a new effort on the

1058
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:58,719
farm they've been working at it for a

1059
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,720
few years now and casey and i have had

1060
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:03,279
quite a few conversations over the years

1061
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,239
and dale hill myself but

1062
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,640
casey

1063
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:07,639
it's your turn

1064
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,358
thanks

1065
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:25,119
thanks john i want to start out by uh

1066
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:26,960
thanking you for the time and effort

1067
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,960
that you've put in and your willingness

1068
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,240
to share i know a lot of people have

1069
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,838
called and

1070
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:33,439
and it's really helpful getting someone

1071
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:36,000
else's experience has been in a long

1072
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,880
time so we really appreciate that thank

1073
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,880
you

1074
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,880
uh first

1075
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,079
slide kind of speaks about our

1076
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:46,720
philosophy and how important uh soil

1077
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,200
health is is to our farm and the crops

1078
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:51,919
and the animals that we have there

1079
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:54,480
as dad mentioned we've been at it a few

1080
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,720
years we've gradually worked into this

1081
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,280
reduced tillage

1082
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:02,319
we've kind of started by

1083
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,320
ripping in the fall again to rip up some

1084
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,320
of this compaction created from

1085
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,838
vegetable harvest because as you

1086
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,680
mentioned when it's time to harvest the

1087
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:11,920
vegetables you have to go no matter what

1088
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:13,440
the weather is and that can really

1089
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,320
destroy soil

1090
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,000
so we started out that way with um

1091
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,960
with deep ripping in the fall and then

1092
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,800
would go to just uh field cultivating in

1093
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,358
uh in the spring

1094
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,880
and um destroying the cover crop or or

1095
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:29,440
burning it down

1096
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,160
and then gradually work through that

1097
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,079
and um

1098
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:36,319
there's some points i want to want to

1099
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,480
make a lot of it i think has been

1100
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,160
reiterated here and i think it's on kind

1101
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,679
of common themes from listening to the

1102
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:44,239
rest of us

1103
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:46,639
mobile plowing we feel really addicts of

1104
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:49,199
soil to excessive tillage it kind of

1105
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:51,358
perpetuates more tillage

1106
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,879
being needed

1107
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:54,000
when you do start going to reduce

1108
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,680
tillage

1109
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,639
you got to commit fort for two to three

1110
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:59,118
years

1111
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:01,838
it takes a while to start this soil

1112
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,160
renewing process before you'll see the

1113
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:06,000
results so as joe says you got you got

1114
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:08,879
to stick with it

1115
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,960
requires more management

1116
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,440
that's the same thing don mentioned

1117
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,079
before it does take more managing cover

1118
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,358
crop the size of the cover crop when

1119
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,920
you're going to burn it down make it

1120
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:22,880
easier to work especially

1121
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,519
with with a transplanter that doesn't

1122
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,320
lend itself quite as well to

1123
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:30,159
road cleaners and that sort of thing so

1124
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,920
managing that size of the residue that

1125
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,759
you're working with

1126
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,000
is is more important

1127
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:39,440
also if you want to be planning over the

1128
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,559
slot that requires a gps which takes a

1129
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,000
little more time to get used to

1130
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:43,679
especially your first year there's

1131
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,480
there's a learning curve there

1132
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:48,719
but the soil will improve you'll see it

1133
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,280
we've seen this action on the soil we've

1134
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:53,759
seen more earthworm activity

1135
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,280
you can see that happening and i've got

1136
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,960
pictures that will show

1137
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,760
the results that we see when we're

1138
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,760
harvesting too

1139
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,519
we used to do a lot of plowing a lot of

1140
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,800
people used to do a lot of plugging

1141
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:05,679
that's how you took care of the cover

1142
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,920
crop

1143
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:08,879
back then but unless the conditions were

1144
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,960
just

1145
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,880
perfect and

1146
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,280
the moisture just right

1147
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,760
it took a lot to get that to fit back

1148
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,440
down again so that you could plant well

1149
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,359
we are still

1150
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,358
doing once in a while we'll plow bean

1151
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,598
field a new mention she hasn't she

1152
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:27,920
actually maybe seen a yield drag in

1153
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,680
beans or all the other crops the yield

1154
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,318
has stayed consistent and that's what

1155
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:33,679
we've seen with the rest of the crops

1156
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:34,719
with beans

1157
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:36,159
we

1158
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:39,039
sometimes are still getting our best

1159
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:40,559
yield with plowing we plowed one field

1160
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:42,559
last year

1161
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:44,880
same reason it was a heavy sod there was

1162
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:46,880
a running field a new field to us didn't

1163
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,160
think uh the strip tiller would work

1164
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,400
well in there

1165
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:52,239
we did have some good beans off of that

1166
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,240
but this being our first year of

1167
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:58,799
following over the zone with our planter

1168
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:00,479
our beans on the rest of our ground

1169
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,720
reduced tillage has been much better

1170
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,440
than it has been previously or we just

1171
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:07,239
were

1172
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,240
going with the field cultivator

1173
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:12,000
this shows our

1174
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:14,559
following with our field cultivator

1175
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,239
after we've made a pass with the zone

1176
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:18,639
building when we're doing cabbage we

1177
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:20,239
still feel we need the truffle and

1178
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:22,239
for weed control so we're still

1179
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:24,719
incorporating treflan after we'll make a

1180
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:27,679
pass for the zone builder to uh to put

1181
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:27,679
down the nutrients

1182
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,000
this shows a pass of zone building going

1183
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:34,639
on

1184
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,559
uh in the spring we are set up to put

1185
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:38,879
liquid down

1186
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:41,759
we're putting down uh a different amount

1187
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,760
depending on what the crop history is

1188
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,640
what our soil tests are and what our

1189
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,520
yield

1190
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:48,519
expectations are

1191
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,440
as we mentioned before it does uh it

1192
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,240
does take some more management

1193
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,039
imagining managing the residue

1194
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:58,879
and

1195
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:01,759
working with the gps but it's real

1196
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:04,160
critical to keeping that

1197
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,160
over the zone this here is actually a

1198
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:07,598
picture of what we do in the fall i've

1199
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:09,440
heard some questions of what people are

1200
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,960
doing in the fall

1201
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,720
in the fall we'll go through and that's

1202
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,760
a little bit

1203
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:17,519
we're still finding 12 to 14 inches deep

1204
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,599
in the fall to get below

1205
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:21,280
to break up a compacted layer

1206
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,200
this is our same

1207
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,680
machine that we do the

1208
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:29,039
zone building with in the spring

1209
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:30,960
in the spring it's a 12 row unit

1210
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:33,119
running more like

1211
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,480
eight to ten inches deep

1212
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,200
putting down the liquid we'll have the

1213
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,519
rolling baskets and the discs behind it

1214
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:41,199
in the fall we take off the two outside

1215
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:44,318
shanks it's a little harder to pull it

1216
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:46,318
at 14 inches deep we're taking off

1217
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:47,759
rolling baskets into this and then we're

1218
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:49,279
pulling an airway

1219
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,200
sometimes that helps incorporate the

1220
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,599
manure that we might put on in some of

1221
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:55,519
the fields and also a cover crop that

1222
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:58,240
we'll put in it'll help incorporate that

1223
00:42:55,519 --> 00:43:00,639
as well

1224
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:03,358
and that shows uh what an established

1225
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:05,598
cover crop will look like

1226
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:08,719
we like to try to

1227
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,800
destroy the cover crop when it's six

1228
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:12,879
six to nine inches tall is what seems to

1229
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,280
work well especially especially uh for

1230
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,280
cabbage

1231
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:20,318
part of the part of the

1232
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,358
overall soil management once we get

1233
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:24,559
going with

1234
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:26,799
zone tillage and resource tillage is

1235
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:28,799
then trying to manage the compaction as

1236
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,960
we go through our operations

1237
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,960
and harvest especially

1238
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,838
one of the ways that we do that to help

1239
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,880
minimize it is is with tract vehicles

1240
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:41,000
and

1241
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,000
with flotation tires

1242
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:45,759
don was mentioning

1243
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,480
it's in the harvest time especially when

1244
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,280
it's wet when you can really visually

1245
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,960
see

1246
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,240
the difference between conventionally

1247
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,720
tilled fields and in zone-tilled fields

1248
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:59,199
and we have seen for years we used to

1249
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:01,358
custom harvest beans and stuff

1250
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:04,719
and it's a world of difference between

1251
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:06,719
conventional till and and zone till

1252
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:09,679
this year it was a conventional

1253
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:12,399
tilt field of cabbage near us

1254
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:15,279
this was us operating the same day

1255
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:17,200
there is a little track there where we

1256
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,880
where we had a tram line where we'd be

1257
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:21,199
bringing back from the other end we

1258
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,519
would follow the same path back out but

1259
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:25,118
you can see all there is is just a

1260
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:28,159
little bit of the real

1261
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:31,200
wheel treads uh shown from the harvest

1262
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:34,559
and very little uh running going on we

1263
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:37,039
get much better water infiltration in

1264
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:39,759
the soil structure improves and that's

1265
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:42,318
that's one way you can measure and see

1266
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,319
the difference

1267
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:46,719
so our goal is to get away from

1268
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,000
something like that

1269
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,838
in the fall

1270
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,760
and to end up

1271
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:54,799
something like that

1272
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,000
the soil will improve it takes some time

1273
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,280
to see it when you're first

1274
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,960
transitioning

1275
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,839
but it's really uh well worth it uh

1276
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,800
at

1277
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:06,078
the end

1278
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,240
so with that

1279
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,480
take any questions if anybody has

1280
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:10,479
anything

1281
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:18,838
okay thanks thanks

1282
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:26,239
a couple couple points casey was talking

1283
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:29,358
about the you know the water

1284
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:30,639
infiltration part of it and that

1285
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:33,199
you know we've seen that in our

1286
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:35,440
operation and i guess

1287
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:36,239
what really hit the home run with me

1288
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,519
when

1289
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:39,039
i have

1290
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:42,559
landlords

1291
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:43,759
that make the comment to me that

1292
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:45,119
i don't know what you're doing but it

1293
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,119
must be right because we don't have

1294
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,640
water that ponds on our land anymore

1295
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,640
like the neighbors do across the road

1296
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:52,078
that are conventionally tilled

1297
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:53,759
or you know when they're paying

1298
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,880
attention and watching what you're doing

1299
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,599
and

1300
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,760
make positive remarks like that or

1301
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,440
my garden doesn't get flooded anymore

1302
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,359
when it rains because the water used to

1303
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,720
run out of the field prior years come

1304
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:07,199
down the edge of the road and fill my

1305
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:09,199
yard in the garden

1306
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:11,118
snow geese don't have a pond to land on

1307
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:13,039
anymore in my field because

1308
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:16,720
we don't have a pond i feel bad about

1309
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:16,719
that they went somewhere else but

1310
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,400
some of these reduced till

1311
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:23,279
tools

1312
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,358
turbo desk turbo till

1313
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,839
nrcs if you're

1314
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:28,639
in one of their

1315
00:46:26,838 --> 00:46:30,239
programs they

1316
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:31,598
some of these they don't view real

1317
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:34,078
friendly the

1318
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:36,000
case ih turbo disk i know there are some

1319
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:38,960
areas that

1320
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,280
they call it a full width tillage tool i

1321
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,920
guess even though

1322
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,800
this last fall we had our new district

1323
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,800
district manager for our county

1324
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,280
i was applying for the

1325
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,440
conservation stewardship program

1326
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,359
and we put some cover crop we put cover

1327
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,960
crops after our sweet corn we do have a

1328
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:57,838
turbo disk

1329
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,920
i

1330
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:03,440
tell people i might have to rename that

1331
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,800
just to a turbo and forget the desk

1332
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,720
but

1333
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,599
they have to come out and do it do a

1334
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:11,358
field field and farm survey to check

1335
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,599
things and i took them around some of

1336
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:16,239
these fields where we put the cover crop

1337
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,559
on after the sweet corn we air flow it

1338
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:20,639
on mix it with potatoes generally put

1339
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:22,880
potash sometimes a little ammonium

1340
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:25,358
sulfate but we'll air flow the cover

1341
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,119
crop in some fertilizer on we get even

1342
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:28,960
distribution that way

1343
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,559
and then we run over the ground with the

1344
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,838
with the

1345
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,319
turbo

1346
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:36,558
approximately two inches deep

1347
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:39,119
we've done this for two years now and

1348
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:41,119
cover crop establishment with this tool

1349
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,200
is just phenomenal

1350
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,119
and when he came out for the farm farm

1351
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:46,639
survey i took him around with some of

1352
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,079
course i had to show him all the fields

1353
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:50,239
and took him to the fields where he put

1354
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:53,039
the cover crop on and ran and ran over

1355
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:55,118
it with the turbo and he was very

1356
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:56,800
impressed with the amount of residue

1357
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:59,440
that was left on top you know we had

1358
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,280
good coverage and all that but

1359
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,318
the powers to be above them are the ones

1360
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:07,599
that really make the decision now so

1361
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:09,599
i know in uh lesser publications

1362
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:12,160
the no-till farm magazine there was an

1363
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,880
article about it that some of these

1364
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:17,519
minimum till tools and nrcs's view on

1365
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,280
them is not very favorable that

1366
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:21,599
maybe more of us need to start making

1367
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,680
noise about it and

1368
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,200
there's yeah there's places places out

1369
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:27,519
there that i could see you know very

1370
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:29,039
rolling ground hilly ground

1371
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:31,280
you know where maybe that maybe this

1372
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:32,719
tool would not be advisable to use but

1373
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,519
there's a lot of other places where they

1374
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:37,118
can be very beneficial but

1375
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:39,679
with that

1376
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:42,318
i'm turning over ron wagner from wagner

1377
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:45,039
farms in rome new york

1378
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:46,960
ron has 35 acres of mixed vegetables and

1379
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:49,119
they're known for their potatoes farm

1380
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:52,000
stand

1381
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:54,400
farmers markets greenhouse plant sales

1382
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,960
in the spring you pick currents

1383
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,519
raspberries and gooseberries homemade

1384
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,119
wreaths and christmas trees

1385
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:03,199
so around

1386
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,920
and turn the table over to you

1387
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:05,919
thank you thank you

1388
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,358
i started department about

1389
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:18,318
1998 officially i was farming for about

1390
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:21,679
five years before that involved with ffa

1391
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:21,679
many of you probably were too

1392
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:29,519
i have

1393
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:31,680
fought the system 100 all the way

1394
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:32,639
started out a couple acres here and

1395
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:34,799
there

1396
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:36,960
and a little monk farm a lot of small

1397
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,720
tractors a couple

1398
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,039
small pieces of equipment

1399
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:44,318
gradually operate i moved up in the

1400
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:45,440
world and got into a little larger scale

1401
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:48,558
and

1402
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:50,639
around 2006 we were running about 75

1403
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:53,440
acres of crops

1404
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:55,358
one running it all on one tractor

1405
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:59,838
working 18-hour days

1406
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:59,838
180 days a year at least

1407
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,519
2006 was a bad year

1408
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:08,720
as many of us know it was a very wet

1409
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:09,920
year we had many floods

1410
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:10,838
and

1411
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,519
i

1412
00:50:10,838 --> 00:50:17,199
despite having crops when no one else

1413
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:19,119
did i went bankrupt

1414
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:21,759
and

1415
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:24,240
thought that was the end of it

1416
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,960
07 was bankrupt a year i didn't do

1417
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:28,399
anything my mom took over the farm

1418
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,000
ran the farm

1419
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,760
we did all right

1420
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,358
covered the bills covered the expenses

1421
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:37,040
that year

1422
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:39,039
in 2008 i started

1423
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:42,400
with a clean slate i was able to keep

1424
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:42,400
all my equipment keep everything

1425
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:48,239
i started looking at ways of conserving

1426
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:51,039
money and

1427
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:54,078
making things more economical

1428
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:56,079
and of course around 2008 fertilizer

1429
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,760
prices started pushing almost a thousand

1430
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:00,480
dollars a ton towards the end of this

1431
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,480
growing season

1432
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:08,880
conventional tillage

1433
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:10,000
was my main tillage tool

1434
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,000
go in

1435
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,639
alright plow

1436
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,440
and of course in 2008 i had downsized my

1437
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:20,000
port i was down to 35 acres big load off

1438
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,000
the tractor

1439
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:24,719
the conventional tillage methods i was

1440
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:25,679
using that was moldboard plowing

1441
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:27,199
um

1442
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:28,480
originally i started out with big heavy

1443
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:30,399
set of discs

1444
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,838
and of course like every said this you

1445
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,280
have to go over two or three times and

1446
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:35,358
make it look good

1447
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,480
try to fit the ground

1448
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:39,039
i

1449
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,800
gradually transitioned over to to a

1450
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:43,039
effecta ii

1451
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,359
field cultivator which i love and to

1452
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:47,199
this day i use almost

1453
00:51:45,358 --> 00:51:48,880
90 of the time

1454
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:50,879
very rarely use a side discs in the

1455
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:53,920
field any longer except for him to fall

1456
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,880
off and try to chop down stubble

1457
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,760
or

1458
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,760
chew up residue

1459
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:01,598
the

1460
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,640
idea of going to a reduced tillage

1461
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:09,599
system

1462
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:10,480
back around 2005 i sort of messed around

1463
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,880
with it

1464
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:16,838
via a sub-soiler

1465
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:20,079
and trying to eliminate some compassion

1466
00:52:16,838 --> 00:52:21,519
layers i did that on a tomato crop that

1467
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,318
year

1468
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:25,280
and

1469
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:27,440
it was one of our best tomato crops ever

1470
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:29,519
it went in some sold the whole entire

1471
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,960
field laid the mulch did all everything

1472
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:33,039
we could

1473
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:35,519
it was a dry summer

1474
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:37,679
the tomatoes did phenomenal they did not

1475
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:39,599
drought stress we

1476
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:41,679
irrigated once or twice that's all we

1477
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:44,559
had to do

1478
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:47,598
by going with the subsoil or going 28 i

1479
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:50,640
went 28 inches deep with it i hit it

1480
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:52,640
really hard really deep

1481
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:56,078
i gave those roots of those plants the

1482
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:57,759
opportunity to go deep on their own

1483
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,519
to find the water source to find the

1484
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,760
moisture to find the nutrients that have

1485
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:04,079
leached down deep in the soil over the

1486
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,079
years

1487
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,960
at that point i became

1488
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,960
convinced that

1489
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,679
jointly reduced or

1490
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,760
to

1491
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:16,318
get down to get the root system down

1492
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,960
deeper in this ground was a was a

1493
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:23,880
priority

1494
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,880
and this past year in 2010

1495
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:29,760
i had the opportunity to use a

1496
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:31,599
unifirth

1497
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,640
130 zone builder

1498
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:35,119
from

1499
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:36,078
freeville

1500
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:37,680
okay

1501
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,119
a couple

1502
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:41,118
nine thousand dollar piece of equipment

1503
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,960
give them to me for free to trip demo

1504
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:44,160
and try out

1505
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,960
you know what

1506
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:46,960
sounds good to me

1507
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:49,759
what kind of heart

1508
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:55,200
i tried it on sweet corn and cucumbers

1509
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,200
first

1510
00:53:55,519 --> 00:54:01,599
the sweet corn

1511
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:05,040
i did on my white sweet corn on

1512
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:08,400
a late a second and third planting

1513
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:09,599
and i did it i did it right next to the

1514
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,280
second

1515
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:14,160
we're first planting actually white

1516
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:17,920
sweet corn on conventional tilled soil

1517
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:20,318
so i had a side by side comparison

1518
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,920
the white sweet corn that was on the

1519
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:23,519
zone build

1520
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,440
didn't lodge

1521
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:27,920
didn't fall over

1522
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:30,480
yielded just just as well as this

1523
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,480
conventional

1524
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:36,400
however the conventional lodged

1525
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:38,000
real complaint about the thicket

1526
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,920
definitely

1527
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,358
um

1528
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,680
i didn't do anything different than the

1529
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:45,519
fertilizer we just broadcast

1530
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:47,838
we use broadcast on our fertilizer

1531
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:50,159
program we do some liquid infer when we

1532
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:50,159
plant

1533
00:54:50,838 --> 00:54:54,318
and

1534
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:56,000
this at the same time i did the first

1535
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:57,838
planting was the second and third

1536
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,480
planting of white sweet corn i did the

1537
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:00,480
cucumbers

1538
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:06,639
i did not have success with that um

1539
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:09,760
i i lead that to the fact that we had

1540
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:10,960
heavy rains just after we planted

1541
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:14,400
and

1542
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:16,798
this small seed of cucumber actually

1543
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,039
wound up being washed down in the soil

1544
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:20,639
down the

1545
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,639
some soil riches

1546
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:25,279
deeper than i should have

1547
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:27,519
i also believe it also the soil crusted

1548
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:30,720
just a little on top which hindered it

1549
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:30,719
from germinating correctly

1550
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:36,960
all right

1551
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,079
later this summer this past summer i

1552
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,679
decided

1553
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:41,359
we could get this we could get this one

1554
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:43,598
going again so we've decided we're gonna

1555
00:55:41,358 --> 00:55:46,318
do our whole entire fall crop of coke

1556
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:48,798
crops broccoli cauliflower cabbage

1557
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:52,159
chinese cabbage kohlrabi

1558
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:52,159
you name it i put in a

1559
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:57,039
i went a little excessive i

1560
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:58,239
i didn't plan on the field

1561
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:00,719
and what i was going to use it for

1562
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:00,719
originally

1563
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:04,640
and i didn't go in and spray it with

1564
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:06,480
roundup i wish i had because i would

1565
00:56:04,639 --> 00:56:08,159
have saved a lot of energy in a lot of

1566
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,000
time

1567
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:11,118
instead i went up

1568
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,880
the day i

1569
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:15,680
went ahead and i

1570
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:18,559
chiseled out the field i dissed it twice

1571
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:22,480
i ran the perfecto over with a roller i

1572
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:23,920
got it all nice uniform flat weed free

1573
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,639
the following day i went over it with

1574
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,639
the zone builder

1575
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:30,639
i was all builder

1576
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,838
two rows

1577
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:33,679
and

1578
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:36,078
i was running 14 inches deep in the

1579
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:38,399
ground it was about two inches below my

1580
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:40,720
compaction layer

1581
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,960
i was running around five miles an hour

1582
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:47,279
with a 55 horse tractor

1583
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:49,920
overdrive fully loaded perforates

1584
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:52,240
a lot of equipment on the back

1585
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,680
didn't even first i sat on the ground i

1586
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:55,919
didn't even know it was there just pull

1587
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:58,000
so nice and easy in the ground

1588
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,000
the field i went with for the cold crops

1589
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,239
has a problem though

1590
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,719
conventional plowing of it

1591
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:05,598
is hard because the top end is a clay

1592
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:08,318
long

1593
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:10,318
you go down the middle of its clay

1594
00:57:08,318 --> 00:57:12,318
those two the depth control is pretty

1595
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:14,000
decent you can control it you get the

1596
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:15,519
ground get the plows on the ground even

1597
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,280
in the dry weather

1598
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:20,480
however the far end is a gravel knoll

1599
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,319
and

1600
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:25,679
because of the gravel

1601
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:27,759
the hard pan and the gravel layer

1602
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:29,358
falls right up by the ground and only

1603
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,520
maybe you get in the ground two three

1604
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:34,719
inches at the most

1605
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:37,599
the zone builder however

1606
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:41,279
we got down 14 inches we stayed at 14

1607
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:44,960
inches right through that gravel knoll

1608
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,880
cool you know what this might be good

1609
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,639
this uh

1610
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,400
this might actually transplant and

1611
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:52,159
normally conventionally all the standard

1612
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,559
transplanters

1613
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:55,920
you want your soil to be plowed

1614
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:58,160
pretty deep for the transplanter to

1615
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,920
actually work the way it's supposed to

1616
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:02,239
so on the gravel mold the transplanter

1617
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,838
was usually well okay lift it up we're

1618
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:05,358
not going to plant it here just turn

1619
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:07,039
around go back

1620
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:08,719
this year we wound up planting right

1621
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:11,119
from one end of the field to the other

1622
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:14,000
right through that gravel knoll

1623
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:16,720
with no problems

1624
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,239
day after i zone build that field

1625
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:20,480
we had

1626
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:23,598
approximately two to three inches of

1627
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,599
rain that following day

1628
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:27,920
and i was like well

1629
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:29,680
zone builder got picked up and i bet you

1630
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,280
i'm going to be

1631
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:32,879
hurting here because i can't get back in

1632
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,400
that field it's going to be all crusted

1633
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,760
over

1634
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:40,000
conventionally tilled field

1635
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,599
would have been crested over completely

1636
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,358
it would have been impossible to go in

1637
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:45,039
with transplanter and transplant on top

1638
00:58:43,358 --> 00:58:47,199
of that

1639
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:50,000
however

1640
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:53,118
taking a risk we put the transplanter on

1641
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,119
about five days after we zone billed it

1642
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:56,559
we started transplanting the cold crop

1643
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:59,838
about

1644
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,839
three o'clock in the afternoon

1645
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:02,559
by

1646
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:04,159
nightfall

1647
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:06,079
we were three quarters away done

1648
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:08,318
planting

1649
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:11,039
and we had no problems it went in the

1650
00:59:08,318 --> 00:59:13,920
ground it stayed in the ground

1651
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:16,480
the zones were nice and fluffy

1652
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,079
full width of the baskets which i think

1653
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,920
we're running about 12 inches wide on

1654
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:20,720
the baskets

1655
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,760
the

1656
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:25,199
zone itself was 14 inches took off and

1657
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,960
took a

1658
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:29,759
metal rod out with me a couple spots

1659
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:32,400
pushed it down through nice right 14 15

1660
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,960
inches deep

1661
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:37,838
transplant work perfect

1662
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:39,358
all right looking good

1663
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:41,119
we went in and

1664
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:43,358
irrigated the following day we saw

1665
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,160
irrigation on the field

1666
00:59:43,358 --> 00:59:45,920
and

1667
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:47,199
we ran about three quarters of an inch

1668
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,880
of rain

1669
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:50,399
on the field

1670
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,000
and we did this for three days we could

1671
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:56,160
move the sprinklers around it over the

1672
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,159
three day period we got it all wired in

1673
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:02,159
we did not have to irrigate again for an

1674
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,559
hour two weeks after that and this was

1675
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:09,279
when this was in the middle of a pretty

1676
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:09,280
dry spell in the end of july that we had

1677
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,960
normally i would have had to irrigate it

1678
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:16,000
two or three times probably five days

1679
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:19,119
apart i didn't have to worry about it

1680
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,880
saved me a lot of headaches

1681
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:24,720
the

1682
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:27,280
benefit to the zone building was that

1683
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:29,118
it did once that surface was sealed it

1684
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,040
kept the moisture in that it allowed the

1685
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:33,039
roots to go down deep and allowed them

1686
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:35,440
to find the moisture

1687
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:37,519
we also at the same time zone build it

1688
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,039
we had broadcasted fertilizer so the

1689
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:40,318
fertilizer was already in the ground was

1690
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:42,480
ready to go

1691
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:44,318
we did not use any liquid we didn't use

1692
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:47,358
any water or liquid fertilizer at the

1693
01:00:44,318 --> 01:00:47,358
time of transplanting

1694
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:52,880
which

1695
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:55,039
was a risk at the time but it paid off

1696
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:58,960
the

1697
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:58,960
cold crop did phenomenal this year

1698
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:02,880
about halfway through the growing season

1699
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:04,558
in ju in august we had

1700
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,400
one weekend where we got four inches of

1701
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:09,119
rain in one day

1702
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,639
normally that field can pool up you

1703
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,400
would have 12 inches of water sitting in

1704
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:14,960
the low spot

1705
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,880
okay crop is lost right

1706
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,400
we had no water standing in the field at

1707
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,838
all

1708
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,400
the

1709
01:01:19,838 --> 01:01:24,558
spot where normally the bees pulled up

1710
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:27,680
yeah the tire tracks had a little bit of

1711
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:29,440
water standing in that was it

1712
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:30,639
the roads themselves were

1713
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,639
quite muddy

1714
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:34,239
but the tire tracks you could actually

1715
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:37,639
walk on you could actually drive on them

1716
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:37,639
if you had to

1717
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:43,280
the harvest came in on about september

1718
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:45,199
we started picking uh broccoli and

1719
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:47,200
cabbage

1720
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:49,838
the broccoli heads were hauling out up

1721
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:52,159
field were 10 to 12 inch diameter

1722
01:01:49,838 --> 01:01:54,880
consistent yield

1723
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:57,838
harvesting it every three days

1724
01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:00,400
the cabbage was averaging six to eight

1725
01:01:57,838 --> 01:02:02,318
pound size

1726
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,480
we were wholesaling it we were retailing

1727
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:07,119
it farmer's market you name it we were

1728
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,119
doing it with him

1729
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,039
everyone loved the quality

1730
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,319
i loved the quality i didn't have to

1731
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:17,358
worry about being selective about

1732
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:19,358
picking it for once

1733
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:21,279
i didn't have to worry about it because

1734
01:02:19,358 --> 01:02:22,159
in the past i've had broccoli lodge on

1735
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,400
me

1736
01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:26,960
all over getting mud

1737
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:30,160
this year i didn't do it

1738
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,159
so i was fortunate there

1739
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,318
this fall i decided we'd try it again

1740
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:39,119
and

1741
01:02:36,318 --> 01:02:43,199
i did it on my garlic field actually

1742
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:43,200
i zoned build the uh garlic rose

1743
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:48,480
i believe by doing

1744
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:48,480
zone builds

1745
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,520
our area

1746
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,679
16 inches seem to be to be the correct

1747
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:58,400
number

1748
01:02:55,679 --> 01:03:00,159
harvestability of crops crop loss stuff

1749
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,880
like that

1750
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:05,759
since 1996 when we first started

1751
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:07,599
experimenting with zone till

1752
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:11,760
the only sweet corn

1753
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:14,000
that ever ever got bypassed in the field

1754
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,280
above and beyond excess

1755
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,920
yields

1756
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:19,839
was some conventional we had one year

1757
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:22,240
that the quality wasn't good enough that

1758
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:24,318
was when we were we were still

1759
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:25,358
in the transition phase if you want to

1760
01:03:24,318 --> 01:03:27,599
say

1761
01:03:25,358 --> 01:03:29,920
and part of our acreage was conventional

1762
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:31,599
and part of it was zone till because i

1763
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:33,440
wasn't quite brave enough to go all the

1764
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:35,039
way yet but

1765
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:37,039
that one particular year we had some

1766
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,880
conventional sweet corn that got

1767
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:40,559
bypassed because the

1768
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,960
quality and yield was not good enough

1769
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:44,480
but yet all of our zone tilt corn got

1770
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,920
harvested that year

1771
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,719
so i think that was year i finally

1772
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:51,760
decided that enough's enough i'm giving

1773
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:51,759
up on a conventional

1774
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:56,400
seed the soil or root the soil contact

1775
01:03:54,719 --> 01:03:58,159
is critical

1776
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,880
but whatever you do to the ground you

1777
01:03:58,159 --> 01:04:03,838
need to have good contact you know

1778
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:05,599
seatbelt preparation is important

1779
01:04:03,838 --> 01:04:07,679
now we're going to hear from jim wilson

1780
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:09,280
from wilson farms

1781
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:12,078
jim farms

1782
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,839
600 acres in new hampshire with 32 acres

1783
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:15,680
of lexington maine

1784
01:04:13,838 --> 01:04:17,199
maine is located

1785
01:04:15,679 --> 01:04:18,639
in michigan

1786
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:20,719
from boston

1787
01:04:18,639 --> 01:04:23,838
12 miles from boston he grows pumpkins

1788
01:04:20,719 --> 01:04:26,959
squash sweet corn carrots and crops on

1789
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:30,318
raised beds jim has a sub soiler

1790
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:32,318
but those pesky rocks were a problem

1791
01:04:30,318 --> 01:04:33,759
he now has a straight shank under first

1792
01:04:32,318 --> 01:04:37,838
zone builder

1793
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:37,839
he has a compaction problem and has

1794
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,039
this one's thrown a little fight taft

1795
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:43,920
for uh

1796
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:45,039
cass camp sikka

1797
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,960
okay

1798
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:49,440
i wasn't good in english

1799
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:51,519
french i never took it so

1800
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:54,559
italian or latin or whatever i've

1801
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:57,838
dreaded root crown and fruit disease

1802
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:59,920
of skelos yeah you'll have to say it for

1803
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:01,440
me because

1804
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,599
selenasia

1805
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:05,358
and curcumin crops

1806
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:06,960
he has done three years of classic zone

1807
01:05:05,358 --> 01:05:10,318
intelligent hampshire

1808
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,318
the system works well

1809
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,960
for pumpkins squash

1810
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:19,358
sweet corn

1811
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:19,358
he uses zone till on raised beds

1812
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:26,000
the farm has 75 crops

1813
01:05:22,798 --> 01:05:28,079
i guess he's diversified

1814
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,358
two years ago he lost 80 percent of his

1815
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:31,440
carrots

1816
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:32,798
this year after planting them on zone

1817
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,960
built beds

1818
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:37,838
he had to buy bigger bags because the

1819
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,838
carrots are too big

1820
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:42,639
for this turn it over to jim thank you

1821
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:45,639
jim

1822
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:45,639
thanks

1823
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:55,838
good

1824
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,920
thank you um

1825
01:05:55,838 --> 01:05:59,199
the advantage to going last here is that

1826
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,639
basically everything you wanted to say

1827
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:01,598
has already been said

1828
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:06,159
and

1829
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:08,880
we farm about 600 acres in new hampshire

1830
01:06:06,159 --> 01:06:11,038
up there we we do this the classic

1831
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:13,119
classic crops all of our largest space

1832
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:15,039
consuming crops are all up there

1833
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:16,559
and generally what what everybody else

1834
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:19,119
has spoken about today is the type of

1835
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:21,920
thing that we do

1836
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:22,798
in lexington we've been farming for 127

1837
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,200
years

1838
01:06:22,798 --> 01:06:26,480
we get three crops a season off of every

1839
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:29,279
bit of it

1840
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:31,119
and we grow a lot of quick turnover

1841
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,119
smaller crops

1842
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:34,880
and between the two crops

1843
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:37,838
excuse me between two farms we do about

1844
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:40,318
125 different crops basically raising

1845
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:42,159
everything we can for our retail stores

1846
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:43,519
at both locations

1847
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:45,199
and

1848
01:06:43,519 --> 01:06:47,280
we did we've done this this will be our

1849
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:49,439
fourth year in new hampshire it's worked

1850
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:50,640
so well up there with what we've been

1851
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,159
doing

1852
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:53,440
that we decided

1853
01:06:52,159 --> 01:06:55,598
you know we've had some serious

1854
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:57,280
compaction issues in lexington where

1855
01:06:55,599 --> 01:07:00,000
we're turning over the land three times

1856
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:01,839
a three three crops per season is an

1857
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,880
awful lot of tractor trips

1858
01:07:01,838 --> 01:07:05,679
now

1859
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:07,519
um so we you know we kind of hadn't

1860
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:08,798
heard of anybody doing this type of an

1861
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:09,679
application

1862
01:07:08,798 --> 01:07:12,400
but

1863
01:07:09,679 --> 01:07:15,679
we're we're gamblers like every farmer

1864
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:17,680
and we bought a second machine and we

1865
01:07:15,679 --> 01:07:20,000
we tossed our three uh

1866
01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:23,358
the three shanks together

1867
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,559
we can put three rips on a five foot bed

1868
01:07:23,358 --> 01:07:26,798
and

1869
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:28,640
it's it's improved drainage tremendously

1870
01:07:26,798 --> 01:07:30,000
you walk across the farm and you forget

1871
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:32,960
that

1872
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,400
you forget that after a wet period and

1873
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,159
step on that plastic before it'll

1874
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,160
disappear

1875
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:42,000
it's we've also noticed huge

1876
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:44,239
improvements in in irrigation issues

1877
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,159
i think that some of the economic

1878
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:48,318
analysis that people i've heard earlier

1879
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:50,159
today you know you've talked about total

1880
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:52,480
yields etc

1881
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:54,960
we've found that the products

1882
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:57,039
are coming off cleaner and better

1883
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:59,920
pumpkins are cleaner in new hampshire

1884
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:02,960
uh lettuce this year hot dry season we

1885
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:05,519
do them all from transplants 128 plugs

1886
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:07,679
we're throwing right into these zones

1887
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:09,358
we do them by hand we transplant them

1888
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:10,798
right behind these these

1889
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:12,558
what we would do

1890
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:14,480
in this application we haven't put

1891
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:16,640
plastic as you see here

1892
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:18,319
and what we would do is we would come

1893
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,159
down once with the better prepare the

1894
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:22,159
ground once with the better

1895
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:24,318
write down with the zone till and then

1896
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:26,399
better the opposite direction to smooth

1897
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:27,359
off the bed and then seat as we always

1898
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:28,399
would

1899
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:31,600
um

1900
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:33,519
it's uh we i did not have a single head

1901
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:36,319
of lettuce bowl this summer

1902
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:39,520
and in a hot dry year generally you

1903
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:41,679
plant a 128 plug and you grind it up

1904
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,279
after you've harvested and you see

1905
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:45,119
basically the same plug with a few

1906
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:47,359
little hair roots sticking out

1907
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:49,599
this year i got down a couple of times

1908
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:52,159
and dug out and as best i could with my

1909
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:55,039
hands and you'd find root zones that

1910
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:56,559
were beyond the canopy of the legs and i

1911
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:58,399
think that had a whole lot to do with

1912
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,560
the fact that you weren't didn't have

1913
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:02,960
anything bolt

1914
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,400
um this is just a long-term view of what

1915
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:07,520
we were doing there this is going to be

1916
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:09,838
this is all zucchini field and

1917
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:11,359
this is going to be

1918
01:09:09,838 --> 01:09:12,960
you know we run down with the plastic

1919
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:14,960
right behind the zone till we get to the

1920
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,960
end of the field turn it around and come

1921
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:20,399
back

1922
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:23,119
biggest mistake we made this year uh as

1923
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:25,679
i said as was said in the previous notes

1924
01:09:23,119 --> 01:09:28,158
a couple years ago i had a field i

1925
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:32,798
didn't have i very limited as to where i

1926
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:32,798
could plant on this 30 acres so i uh

1927
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:38,079
i put my carrots in what i knew was a

1928
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:40,000
pretty poor spot it was a heavy wet year

1929
01:09:38,079 --> 01:09:42,399
um

1930
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,838
we lost probably 80 of our carrot crop

1931
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:45,838
to fork it

1932
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:47,679
and i sent it out for analysis i was

1933
01:09:45,838 --> 01:09:48,640
sure it was nematode and they came back

1934
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,399
clean

1935
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:52,480
it was nothing but soil compaction which

1936
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:54,238
is really what prompted us to try to

1937
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:55,519
figure a solution here

1938
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:57,198
this year

1939
01:09:55,520 --> 01:10:00,080
the carrots came i've been using that

1940
01:09:57,198 --> 01:10:02,639
same bag to sell carrots in my market

1941
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:04,158
for 25 years

1942
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,760
this is the first year we could barely

1943
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:07,359
seal the bag because because of the

1944
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,119
length of the carrots

1945
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:10,479
and i think when you talk in economic

1946
01:10:09,119 --> 01:10:11,439
analysis too

1947
01:10:10,479 --> 01:10:13,039
um

1948
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:15,119
a carrot that's three inches longer is

1949
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:17,679
going to be 20 percent heavier so the

1950
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:19,840
tonnage you're taking out of a field

1951
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:22,480
it just makes sense that that would be a

1952
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,920
definite improvement

1953
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:26,479
you know you can see a close-up of the

1954
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:28,480
same type of thing it's uh it's just

1955
01:10:26,479 --> 01:10:30,399
it's phenomenal and none with that but

1956
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:32,879
these carrots they will

1957
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:34,479
that bag is 16 inches long

1958
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,400
those are 14 inches long and they're not

1959
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:40,000
horsing at all

1960
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:42,000
very very good very tender

1961
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,920
tomatoes i noticed this year with the

1962
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,119
crop wheat we did it just as we did with

1963
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,960
the zucchini they ripped right

1964
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:48,800
underneath the plastic

1965
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:51,359
when i went to first of all we had the

1966
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:53,360
best crop of tomatoes i've ever seen

1967
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:55,119
and

1968
01:10:53,359 --> 01:10:56,639
one of the things about it was you know

1969
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:57,679
it was a good tomato here it's hot it

1970
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,760
was dry

1971
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:01,440
it was they were early

1972
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:04,000
but the vigor on the plants was

1973
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:05,599
tremendous and i noticed when we finally

1974
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,840
finished the end of the season we got

1975
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:10,079
beyond frost i had to go out and chop

1976
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:12,400
them up it took me two more passes with

1977
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:13,840
the rota bear to grind up the vines

1978
01:11:12,399 --> 01:11:16,158
because they were because the root

1979
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:17,679
system was that much larger

1980
01:11:16,158 --> 01:11:20,479
now i've noticed little things in the

1981
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:22,158
field you'd walk by a field of beets and

1982
01:11:20,479 --> 01:11:24,319
at noon time in the heat of the day you

1983
01:11:22,158 --> 01:11:25,920
see it's just slightly wilted normally

1984
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:27,039
you just grab some irrigation pipes and

1985
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:29,119
run at it

1986
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:31,920
and well you got busy i was running drip

1987
01:11:29,119 --> 01:11:33,760
that day i came back at four o'clock and

1988
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,199
they were standing straight up sun just

1989
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:37,600
that little bit a little bit cooler a

1990
01:11:35,198 --> 01:11:39,279
little bit a little bit better condition

1991
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,280
and so you don't have to panic quite as

1992
01:11:39,279 --> 01:11:44,000
much we're finding

1993
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:45,279
again i think a huge huge part besides

1994
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,039
the fuel and

1995
01:11:45,279 --> 01:11:49,119
and the

1996
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:52,319
and the time savings as far as setting

1997
01:11:49,119 --> 01:11:54,238
fields up is all obviously

1998
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:56,319
also that the fact that you do not have

1999
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:58,479
to irrigate anywhere near as much of the

2000
01:11:56,319 --> 01:12:00,079
system the root systems

2001
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:03,439
justify themselves and i think the

2002
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:04,399
quality of plants is the biggest part

2003
01:12:03,439 --> 01:12:06,000
and

2004
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:07,920
really that's about all i had to say

2005
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,840
most of the most of the heavy hitter was

2006
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:11,119
uh was taken by the guys in front of me

2007
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,560
but

2008
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:15,119
there are any questions

2009
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:17,679
this is different yeah

2010
01:12:15,119 --> 01:12:20,000
it's a head it's a it's a heavy loan

2011
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:22,640
this is any loan in lexington new

2012
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,399
hampshire is a sandy one

2013
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,840
san diego in new hampshire we're down on

2014
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:26,879
the merrimack river

2015
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:29,360
just

2016
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:31,119
right on the river

2017
01:12:29,359 --> 01:12:32,799
those flatbeds are raised

2018
01:12:31,119 --> 01:12:34,079
those are going to be raised that those

2019
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:37,199
happen to be

2020
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:38,719
flatbeds for the zucchini but everything

2021
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:41,039
else is grown on raised beds now we're

2022
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:42,399
growing things like i didn't mention

2023
01:12:41,039 --> 01:12:44,640
baby spinach

2024
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:48,399
you get a 24 day turnover from seed to

2025
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:50,400
harvest and that has got to be 100 clean

2026
01:12:48,399 --> 01:12:52,479
any debris in the field you can't do it

2027
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:54,238
so that's why we're forced to be

2028
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:55,678
we've always been high tail i use no

2029
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:56,718
herbicides at all on the farm in

2030
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:59,279
lexington

2031
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:01,198
i cultivate a tremendous amount i know

2032
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:02,479
what the detriments are to that

2033
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:05,279
but

2034
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:07,439
we're bringing high value crops off and

2035
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:09,119
we feel we can we can control it we've

2036
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:11,839
kept the farm clean

2037
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:15,599
it's extremely rare to see any any weeds

2038
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:19,199
go to seed at all on the lexington farm

2039
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:21,360
we patrol it every day

2040
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:24,238
did you try one shank or did you just go

2041
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:26,238
from three we went right to three um

2042
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:27,919
we were trying to lay out i i

2043
01:13:26,238 --> 01:13:30,000
to save some money i was thinking well

2044
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:31,199
maybe maybe two's the number and we

2045
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,479
could pull it with a little bit less

2046
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:33,919
horsepower

2047
01:13:32,479 --> 01:13:36,000
but uh

2048
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:38,079
my guy who does most of my tractor work

2049
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,238
for me he said no i'm gonna do it do it

2050
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:42,880
all you know both feet in and

2051
01:13:40,238 --> 01:13:45,919
i'm glad we did

2052
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,960
how many rows of carrots do you have on

2053
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:49,119
that bed

2054
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,239
three three rows on the bed three rows

2055
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:52,158
three zones

2056
01:13:50,238 --> 01:13:56,319
40 inches at the top of the bed okay

2057
01:13:52,158 --> 01:13:56,319
three rips and three rows yep yeah

2058
01:13:56,399 --> 01:13:59,759
so when you're doing what's the sequence

2059
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:00,639
of events when you're building a raised

2060
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,400
bed

2061
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:04,800
say that again well at the beginning of

2062
01:14:02,399 --> 01:14:07,759
the season we would plow as always

2063
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:10,239
and we prepared the soil you would

2064
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,960
flatten it out with a with a power arrow

2065
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:13,599
and

2066
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:16,158
then you come down once with the better

2067
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:17,840
and then rip the bed

2068
01:14:16,158 --> 01:14:19,679
and there's it would be a little bit

2069
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:22,400
uneven because of because because of the

2070
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:24,319
ripping process and then one more pass

2071
01:14:22,399 --> 01:14:25,599
with the better and then see as normal

2072
01:14:24,319 --> 01:14:29,840
and then you put the plastic on at that

2073
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,840
point oh well plastic or bare ground

2074
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:34,480
anybody

2075
01:14:32,238 --> 01:14:36,158
and it hasn't been too soft for going in

2076
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:38,158
with like baby spinach

2077
01:14:36,158 --> 01:14:40,158
on the top it's that second pass with

2078
01:14:38,158 --> 01:14:41,679
the better that's

2079
01:14:40,158 --> 01:14:43,119
just enough

2080
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:44,719
and it does it doesn't settle no

2081
01:14:43,119 --> 01:14:46,719
surprisingly if you get a rain after

2082
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:47,760
immediately after or generally

2083
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:49,760
you know where

2084
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:51,760
it's a small scale farm i mean we're

2085
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,560
we're

2086
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:55,039
and

2087
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:57,760
you know we would normally seed and

2088
01:14:55,039 --> 01:15:00,158
honestly move the pipes in and overhead

2089
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:02,640
irrigate within within a half an hour

2090
01:15:00,158 --> 01:15:05,359
plant trying to get germination up

2091
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:09,079
and we don't see any you know nothing

2092
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:09,079
nothing falls down

2093
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:15,679
anybody

2094
01:15:13,198 --> 01:15:15,678
very good

2095
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:18,639
thank you

2096
01:15:22,319 --> 01:15:26,960
thank you is there any questions for any

2097
01:15:25,039 --> 01:15:29,119
other speakers before

2098
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:30,880
everybody bows out

2099
01:15:29,119 --> 01:15:34,399
they're here it's a good opportunity to

2100
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:34,400
ask them questions if you have any

2101
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:40,320
i guess um i'd like to know what um for

2102
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:41,119
some of you you think you might try next

2103
01:15:40,319 --> 01:15:42,719
like

2104
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:44,960
do you see changing anything or doing

2105
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,920
anything new or different this next year

2106
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:48,319
we did

2107
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:50,239
we did 100 i mean we

2108
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:52,960
we generally jump both feet when we jump

2109
01:15:50,238 --> 01:15:55,519
and um we did uh every bed on the farm

2110
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:56,960
was done done this way last year now it

2111
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:58,800
was a dry year

2112
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:00,960
next you know you almost guarantee this

2113
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:02,079
year will be a wet year so we'll go

2114
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,840
we're going to find out what the

2115
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:06,719
differences are and you make all those

2116
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:08,719
small adjustments after

2117
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:09,679
how about mike

2118
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:10,800
uh

2119
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:12,480
we're actually going to try a little bit

2120
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,960
of cabbage and some broccoli this year

2121
01:16:12,479 --> 01:16:14,959
and uh

2122
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:18,000
oh excuse me

2123
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:22,639
we're going to try some cabbage and

2124
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:24,719
broccoli this year and also uh we grow a

2125
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:26,239
couple acres of beet so we're going to

2126
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:27,279
start messing around with a few things

2127
01:16:26,238 --> 01:16:29,039
like that

2128
01:16:27,279 --> 01:16:30,800
uh only because like i say every

2129
01:16:29,039 --> 01:16:32,640
everything we've tried it on we've loved

2130
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:36,400
it on so i don't see any reason not to

2131
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:36,400
try it on everything eventually

2132
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:44,479
this will be the first year that with

2133
01:16:42,238 --> 01:16:47,519
the gps that we'll be able to follow in

2134
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:48,479
the spring the slot that we cut in the

2135
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,480
fall

2136
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:52,559
so we'll be putting on our liquid

2137
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:54,399
fertilizer and doing our zone building

2138
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:56,000
right over the same slot we cut in the

2139
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:58,238
following

2140
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,238
plant

2141
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:03,840
i want to try a bio strip with the

2142
01:17:01,439 --> 01:17:03,839
radishes

2143
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:12,639
and for all this time

2144
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:14,719
i guess the big thing we're going to do

2145
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,800
is i've got another planter coming we're

2146
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:18,560
going to do twin rows we're going to try

2147
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:20,800
twin rows and

2148
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:23,520
follow over the zone behind his own zone

2149
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:27,199
till our strip tiller

2150
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:27,199
compare that to our 30 inch rows

2151
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:30,880
they're going to be 7 7 or eight inches

2152
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,840
apart

2153
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:33,679
so

2154
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:36,159
if we drive drive right they'll be

2155
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:38,480
straddling the strip

2156
01:17:36,158 --> 01:17:41,279
gonna try to compare apples to apples as

2157
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:43,678
best we can have the planter set up so

2158
01:17:41,279 --> 01:17:46,800
that the fertility program is the same

2159
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:48,560
as our 30 inch grow planter and then

2160
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:50,800
obviously try to

2161
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:52,400
try pushing some populations above and

2162
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,000
beyond that

2163
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:57,599
on another

2164
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:00,399
replicated strip somewhere but

2165
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:02,880
i want i want to compare

2166
01:18:00,399 --> 01:18:06,000
what i'm doing now with a twin row and

2167
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:08,640
see if there's an improvement and then

2168
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:12,479
try any advancements from that but sweet

2169
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:14,880
corn sweet corn soybeans grain corn

2170
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:17,039
how far apart would the rows be between

2171
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:18,560
the twin rows like

2172
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:20,880
you have two and two are they going to

2173
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:22,719
still be at 30. there's going to be well

2174
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,480
they're going to be centered on 30 inch

2175
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:26,000
rolls centered on 30. centered so

2176
01:18:24,479 --> 01:18:27,519
there's going to be approximately 22

2177
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,039
inches between

2178
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,640
between the rows so we'll still be able

2179
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:33,519
to get down through with this with the

2180
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:35,600
row crop sprayer

2181
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,560
so

2182
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,760
okay

2183
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:39,760
always looking and trying

2184
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:49,679
well i tried a year ago to

2185
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:52,159
several equipment companies to see if we

2186
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:54,239
could get one to do i mean i call this

2187
01:18:52,158 --> 01:18:56,559
an experiment you know i got a 50 000

2188
01:18:54,238 --> 01:18:58,238
experiment going on but

2189
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,920
you know

2190
01:18:58,238 --> 01:19:02,718
god and things were good to me last year

2191
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:04,399
so i was able to justify it but

2192
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:05,840
i decided i was going to jump into it i

2193
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:07,679
wasn't out waiting i'll try and check

2194
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:11,119
the equipment companies again and see

2195
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:11,119
cef or see what and

2196
01:19:11,198 --> 01:19:16,719
then i didn't want to go to a 12 really

2197
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:18,239
deal i tried to sell my 12-row unit so

2198
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:19,840
when i buy something i want to buy

2199
01:19:18,238 --> 01:19:21,198
something for the future not something

2200
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,400
for yesterday

2201
01:19:21,198 --> 01:19:24,399
so we're looking at the newest

2202
01:19:22,399 --> 01:19:25,519
technology and

2203
01:19:24,399 --> 01:19:26,879
you know the equipment company

2204
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,400
recommends this

2205
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:30,400
what they recommend you know i kind of

2206
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:32,319
go by recommendations or

2207
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:33,759
or talking with other people that are

2208
01:19:32,319 --> 01:19:37,198
using it but

2209
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:39,119
you know back to the transition phase

2210
01:19:37,198 --> 01:19:42,158
we're transitioning for the future not

2211
01:19:39,119 --> 01:19:43,439
for not for the history behind us so

2212
01:19:42,158 --> 01:19:45,039
sometimes there's not a lot of

2213
01:19:43,439 --> 01:19:47,439
opportunity to check with check with

2214
01:19:45,039 --> 01:19:49,439
people or to find out what works what

2215
01:19:47,439 --> 01:19:51,279
doesn't work or what to buy what not to

2216
01:19:49,439 --> 01:19:52,479
buy so sometimes you have to go out on a

2217
01:19:51,279 --> 01:19:55,679
limb

2218
01:19:52,479 --> 01:19:56,718
myself i hope it works i fall in love

2219
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:58,319
with it

2220
01:19:56,719 --> 01:20:00,158
or

2221
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:02,840
the bailout i hope somebody else likes

2222
01:20:00,158 --> 01:20:05,359
it better than i do

2223
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:07,679
something fortunately for us you know

2224
01:20:05,359 --> 01:20:09,198
what we've done

2225
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:11,920
it's all worked

2226
01:20:09,198 --> 01:20:14,479
if it doesn't work find out why it

2227
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:16,158
didn't work

2228
01:20:14,479 --> 01:20:19,359
as was said here

2229
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:20,638
joe and casey and ron and jim and that

2230
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:21,679
that

2231
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:23,359
you know

2232
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:24,880
don't be afraid to talk to people that

2233
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:26,639
are doing it that's your best best

2234
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:29,199
source of information there's people out

2235
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:31,039
there that are doing that you know i go

2236
01:20:29,198 --> 01:20:32,399
to these national dome tell conferences

2237
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:34,079
and there's people actually there's

2238
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:36,238
people from around the world

2239
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:38,000
that come to these and

2240
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:39,839
you know not everything works the same

2241
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,600
everywhere but you'll find different

2242
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,800
pockets around the country around the

2243
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:45,039
world that

2244
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:47,360
go through the same same situation the

2245
01:20:45,039 --> 01:20:49,359
same circumstances that you have

2246
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:51,039
you know you go out in ohio now and you

2247
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:52,799
talk about no-till callers or row

2248
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:53,840
cleaners majority of the people out in

2249
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:55,440
ohio

2250
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,960
they certainly have god's dirt because

2251
01:20:55,439 --> 01:20:58,238
they're taking all these attachments off

2252
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,399
they're just going out with a planter

2253
01:20:58,238 --> 01:21:02,319
and planting well

2254
01:21:00,399 --> 01:21:04,158
i know from past experience

2255
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:06,158
we can't do that on airsoft here in new

2256
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:08,960
york we have to add all those options on

2257
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:10,879
there to get back to that seed to soil

2258
