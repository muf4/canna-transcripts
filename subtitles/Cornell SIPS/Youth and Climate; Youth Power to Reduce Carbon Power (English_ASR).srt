1
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,439
thanks so much James um I'm Donna nouer

2
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:21,399
I'm a Youth Development educator with

3
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:24,759
University of Illinois Extension um I

4
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:28,518
work with the 4 program and other and

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,240
youth activities in Metro communities um

6
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:33,439
so I do things that are a little bit

7
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,759
different most of my world is about stem

8
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:38,679
and I found that climate change has been

9
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:41,519
one of the things that our youth are

10
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:44,960
concerned about they're interested in

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,239
and they have been very motivated by

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,878
some of the um opportunities through 4

13
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:54,119
through the egg innovators program some

14
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:56,119
of the um stem challenges that have been

15
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,679
available and that you can get these

16
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:00,479
things through shop 4 so they are

17
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:02,439
available to you

18
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,118
um in the last year these science

19
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:07,158
ambassadors who are all um middle school

20
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:10,719
and high school so their early teens

21
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:14,118
through High School uh go out and they

22
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:16,599
do teen teaching and Outreach they work

23
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:19,799
in some of our um underserved

24
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:22,078
communities and do large walk by

25
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,040
activities down to small group

26
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:27,679
activities for smaller groups the group

27
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:32,280
I have with me today have been very

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:36,439
active in developing an app um to track

29
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:40,239
carbon outputs and give alternatives on

30
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:44,438
how to reduce your carbon outputs um I

31
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:47,519
have ashmit Gambar uh darik mapi and

32
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:50,319
Joshua George with me they are part of a

33
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:54,199
team that was working on a program

34
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:57,718
called Blast and blast was

35
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:01,320
a u oper offered rather in naville which

36
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:03,199
is one of our um communities in my unit

37
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:06,319
which serves Three Counties in the

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,598
Chicago metropolitan area and blast is

39
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,159
about building leadership around

40
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:12,799
sustainable

41
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:16,039
transformation so this was a program

42
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,519
that uh teens took their ideas their

43
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:22,318
concerns and developed a program to get

44
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:24,920
something done so um these are three of

45
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:27,479
the guys they're my coding experts

46
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:31,039
because you need that coding for it and

47
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:33,719
then I have U another larger group of

48
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:36,000
Youth who also did a lot of research to

49
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:39,560
get the information that they needed to

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,959
use to put it into the app so at this

51
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:45,400
point I'm going to turn it over to uh my

52
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,080
4H team and they're going to take over

53
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,200
and tell you a little bit about what

54
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,599
they were doing how they just got to

55
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:56,439
that point and um and about some of the

56
00:02:53,598 --> 00:03:00,959
coding that they've been teaching so uh

57
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:04,598
forh Team you can get in and do your

58
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,039
thing all right so why did we start this

59
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:09,518
project so since all of us are soon to

60
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:12,039
be computer science Majors we wanted to

61
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,519
have an app that has practical solutions

62
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:17,079
for day-to-day applications and for it

63
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,640
to be easily accessible so whether you

64
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,799
have an iPhone or an Android we want it

65
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:25,079
to be on the Apple and Google Play Store

66
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,200
so we specifically since all of us are

67
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,560
environmental activists we wanted to

68
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:32,438
have an app that promotes sustainability

69
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:35,319
so the three topics that we dove into

70
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:38,000
are carbon emissions water conservation

71
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:39,719
and food waste so later on in this

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,438
presentation we're going to get into the

73
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:45,438
specifics of why we wanted to dive into

74
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:49,280
these three topics and also of course

75
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:51,680
give our how we implemented these

76
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,438
Solutions into our app and the functions

77
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,200
of the app and we wanted to influence an

78
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:02,560
app that influences the long-term

79
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:05,759
generation so since climate change is an

80
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,878
existing problem that we have and all

81
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,878
and we need it to promote

82
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,879
sustainability yeah so here's our

83
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,238
timeline of our project uh as you can

84
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:22,079
see we started our first team meeting

85
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:24,399
and that was back in I think January of

86
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,359
2024 and like Miss nouer mentioned

87
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:29,159
before we're actually three out of eight

88
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,639
people that joined in on this project

89
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,039
and from their we actually broke off

90
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,478
into a different research group uh one

91
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:37,038
was carbon emissions one was food waste

92
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:39,240
and also water

93
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:41,079
conservation and from there we actually

94
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,519
received a grant from Apple they

95
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:47,120
provided us with iPads to actually start

96
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:49,519
on the coding processes for this project

97
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,079
and after that we developed a prototype

98
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:55,680
on figma this application where we can

99
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:57,719
kind of just um outline our uh program

100
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,759
without actually starting on the coding

101
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,680
so we actually started on figma first

102
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,360
first before presenting at blast and I

103
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,280
know Miss nouer touched upon that but we

104
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,439
were there in hopes of receiving funding

105
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:12,638
for app so yeah that was at blast and

106
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:15,038
then right now we're actually educating

107
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,519
the other uh people in our group on the

108
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:20,719
basics of Swift so we can actually start

109
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,399
on programming and our goal eventually

110
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,000
is to get this published and available

111
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,959
on the App

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,240
Store see yeah on to our first topic

113
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,399
carbon emissions I just have some stats

114
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,199
on the screen right now and as you can

115
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:37,519
see um the average US passenger car

116
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:40,000
emits about 2.7 metric tons of CO2 per

117
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,879
year so our goal is to try to you know

118
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,360
get that number down and we know we can

119
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:48,360
see that food transportation is

120
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,400
responsible for 19% of all carbon

121
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,319
emissions so along with that there's

122
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,679
also a diagram you can see up there and

123
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,840
it says that cars and bands have around

124
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,439
I think

125
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:03,119
48% um our biggest share of CO2

126
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:06,160
emissions and after that it's the

127
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,079
freight trains and trucks I

128
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,080
believe so how does our app actually

129
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:15,359
combat these problems so our app has two

130
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:18,399
functions on the carbon emissions part

131
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,800
and one of them is to input our ride

132
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:23,679
info so say if you take like a a 20

133
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,280
minute car ride it'll provide the output

134
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,598
of carbon emitted based on the time

135
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:30,119
lapsed and it also provide an alternate

136
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:32,399
route of travel

137
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,240
so that was our first uh first function

138
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,719
the second function is it'll it'll

139
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,360
provide a carbon footprint based on the

140
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,759
food packaging of any food let's say you

141
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,199
get at the grocery store it'll if you

142
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:49,000
input the brand and the type of food

143
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:51,919
it'll output uh the exact um carbon

144
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,918
footprint based on

145
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:00,279
it uh the second component of our app is

146
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:02,318
water conservation

147
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:05,559
and so what is water conservation water

148
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:08,680
conservation is using water efficiently

149
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,879
and effectively to prevent using water

150
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,840
unnecessarily and so one of the main

151
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:16,599
problem problem that stems from this is

152
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:19,279
that fresh water resources are limited

153
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:21,519
and so we want to combat that by having

154
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:24,679
healthy habits and we want to Pro we

155
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:27,359
want to promote that by using it as

156
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,360
features in our app and so as we can see

157
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,360
in the pie chart about 20%

158
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,879
of the of the water that we use comes

159
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,000
from toilets showers faucets clothes and

160
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:42,560
washer and many of these things are in

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,800
our own household and so we believe that

162
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,560
with our functions we'll be able to

163
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,639
combat this usage with our two

164
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:53,639
functions and so our two functions are

165
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,879
meaningful reminders and pro providing a

166
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:59,519
personalized list for the user and so

167
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,560
the first one the meaningful reminders

168
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:05,439
so the user will input their water usage

169
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,038
and we want to provide the user with

170
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:10,719
more information about how to cut down

171
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:15,318
their water usage like what they can do

172
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,400
and some calculations of like how how

173
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:20,080
much water they've been using and how to

174
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:22,560
prevent them from using that much water

175
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:26,158
and so our second one providing a

176
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,800
personalized list for the user so we

177
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:31,598
want to have P personalized things for

178
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,959
the user that they have inputed and

179
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,598
based off of their needs and so for

180
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:39,119
example for me one of the things that I

181
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:42,000
would do is I've been using a water

182
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,560
bucket at home to collect rain and I've

183
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,320
been just storing it in that bucket and

184
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:48,159
using it for daily tasks such as like

185
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,040
watering plants cleaning out doors and

186
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:53,199
flushing toilets and I talked to my

187
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,639
family about that and we found it very

188
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,759
beneficial and healthy for the

189
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,559
environment because we're not using as

190
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:59,879
much water and we're saving the water

191
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,078
because we're collecting it from the

192
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:04,720
rain and so some other examples are

193
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:06,599
Mulch and compost but the water bucket

194
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,000
with the rain that is what I found the

195
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,278
most beneficial and that was something

196
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,480
that worked for me and so we want to

197
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,838
have something personalized like that

198
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,079
and we want to use that as a function in

199
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,079
our

200
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:25,518
app all right so for the final topic

201
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:27,200
that we dove into is food waste so these

202
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,120
are some facts that I found really

203
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,680
interesting about food waste so I found

204
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,959
that onethird of the world's food goes

205
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:36,559
to waste so as you can see and on the

206
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:40,479
picture on the graphic on the bottom it

207
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:42,359
shows how 43% of homes is where our

208
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,200
waste comes from 40% comes from

209
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:49,240
restaurants groceries and food service

210
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,759
companies 16% comes from farms and 2%

211
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,919
comes from manufacturers so I just

212
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:57,679
really wanted to have our app combat all

213
00:09:53,919 --> 00:10:01,360
these problems and have less food being

214
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:04,559
wasted so for our app function for food

215
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,839
waste we have three specific functions

216
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:10,639
so the first one is input inputting food

217
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,040
so first the user inputs whatever food

218
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:17,078
they bought and the expiration dates of

219
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:19,719
those produce so and then during the as

220
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:21,399
it gets closer to the date of expiration

221
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,278
the app is going to constantly send

222
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,919
reminders on recently bought food so

223
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:28,360
it's going to give you a friendly

224
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,799
reminder on when the item is going to be

225
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,320
perished

226
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:35,759
and then for the second app function

227
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,879
with the expiration date being passed

228
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:41,000
for the produce the app is going to send

229
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:43,399
specific recipes that you can make with

230
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,958
the expired produce so such as for

231
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:49,958
example bananas when bananas are

232
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:53,039
parished the app would send a recipe of

233
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:54,919
a banana bread that you could make so

234
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,719
then for our third and final function of

235
00:10:54,919 --> 00:11:01,000
this app we would have location so the

236
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,879
user would input their location and then

237
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,480
a 50 mile radius would be generated to

238
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:10,278
find the nearest donation Food Center so

239
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,959
all these three functions contribute to

240
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:12,958
less food

241
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,720
waste we have many goals to promote

242
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,919
healthy environment and promote

243
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,000
sustainable habits and so we are

244
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,919
planning on promoting these healthy

245
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,759
habits through our app and so our first

246
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:29,639
goal that we have is to continue to

247
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:32,039
teach classes to other students and so

248
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:33,639
prior we have succeeded in teaching

249
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:35,919
classes as we've been going to other

250
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:38,799
schools and other offices to teach

251
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:41,479
classes using the Swift language and so

252
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:43,719
from the Grant from Apple that our for 4

253
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,360
group received we're given many

254
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:49,639
resources such as iPads Apple pencils

255
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,480
while also gting their full support

256
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:53,919
these resources were very useful for

257
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,639
teaching the students and we're able to

258
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,240
show the app that we are making with our

259
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:01,720
full timeline of events to the students

260
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,639
and this allowed the students to see

261
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:07,600
what our app was how it worked and what

262
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:10,240
we did to make it happen and so this was

263
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,440
able to inspire the other students and

264
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,079
they were inspired to make their own app

265
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,000
and it was that app that theyve wanted

266
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:20,198
to make was something similar to what

267
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,879
we've been making and so we spoke to

268
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:23,078
some of the students and they told us

269
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:25,639
that they were interested in making

270
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:28,278
their own apps about environmental

271
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:31,000
sustainability and that is a very big

272
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:33,639
progress step that we wanted to make and

273
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,159
that is like that is something that we

274
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:38,959
were very proud of as we were able to

275
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:41,000
promote a healthy change and so our

276
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:44,239
second goal is to continue working on

277
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,679
the app and to ultimately publish it and

278
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,360
so we want to have we want this app to

279
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:51,198
have a big impact and once we're done

280
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,159
with the coding we'll be able to publish

281
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:55,919
it on the App Store and Google Play

282
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:58,399
Store and this will help promote

283
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,399
positive change which is our third goal

284
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,078
and so we've been doing this throughout

285
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,519
we've been promoting positive change

286
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:06,719
throughout as I said prior by inspiring

287
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,720
other students to create their own apps

288
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,278
and so we believe that this is very

289
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,000
necessary to promote healthy

290
00:13:10,278 --> 00:13:14,000
environmental change and promote a

291
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
positive impact people will be

292
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,519
conserving water better they'll be

293
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,958
reducing carbon emissions and they'll be

294
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:23,759
wasting less food while just making

295
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:26,159
better and healthier decisions overall

296
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:28,159
and these will all ultimately assist us

297
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,958
in reducing the impact of environmental

298
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:33,000
challenges that we face today as as a

299
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:35,919
world and we hope to bring positive

300
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,919
change day by

301
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,399
day thank you for listening to our

302
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:46,278
presentation I greatly appreciate your

303
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:48,639
attention in this and I I really want to

304
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:51,639
thank and congratulate these young

305
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,720
people they um they came up with these

306
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:57,519
ideas themselves this was not uh created

307
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,160
by any adults they came to me and said

308
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,639
they wanted to take their talents and

309
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:05,480
find ways to use it to make a difference

310
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:07,159
in the world um I'm very grateful to a

311
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,639
couple of the other members who are now

312
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:13,278
off at college and they're very very

313
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,000
busy uh doing other things they were the

314
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:18,480
one who got us into blast to begin with

315
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,440
and they were people who were already

316
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,759
into environmental issues and wanted to

317
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,399
take this further and we're grateful for

318
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:29,560
all the teaching that these guys have

319
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,879
been doing because they're

320
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:33,958
providing opportunities to youth who

321
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:36,720
otherwise would not have an opportunity

322
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:38,879
at all so thanks a lot and if you have

323
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,199
any questions were here we'd be happy to

324
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,198
answer

325
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:49,000
it so I have our questions and answers

326
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:50,479
open and interestingly a lot of our

327
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,879
questions and answers are just

328
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,320
outstanding great work it's fantastic

329
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:57,879
presentation so that's a that's a fun

330
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,360
way

331
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:03,679
um um

332
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:07,560
so a few kind of direct oh David has a

333
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:11,919
question yeah just I I thought this was

334
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:14,719
fantastic as as James was just saying um

335
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:17,559
I'm just kind of wondering how you all

336
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,759
think this you know individually might

337
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:22,559
kind of

338
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:24,800
like uh help you sort of take your next

339
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,638
steps in life you're work on this you

340
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:30,399
know in terms of what you each want to

341
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:34,959
move on to do after uh

342
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:38,480
this is finished and a success let's

343
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:40,758
say so we're really looking forward to

344
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,159
publishing this app and promoting a

345
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:45,120
positive change and so that is something

346
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:47,159
like that we've been very interested in

347
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,039
we've been combining this with coding as

348
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:53,360
well and so coding is like our very big

349
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:56,120
hobby for all of us as we've been like

350
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,360
teaching classes and we're all planning

351
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,639
and hoping to be computer science Majors

352
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,120
as we apply

353
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:05,959
this coming year and so we've been

354
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,639
combining two of our interests into one

355
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:10,518
and that is just something that we're

356
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:13,198
really interested in and this positive

357
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:16,120
change that we've been promoting and

358
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:18,120
that we've seen already happen so far

359
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,720
these results that we've seen we've

360
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:24,560
found those outstanding and we just want

361
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,680
to keep seeing more and we just really

362
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:29,919
love the positive impact and change that

363
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:29,919
it has

364
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:39,240
um so we do have uh another question um

365
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,399
have they have you considered exploring

366
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,480
info about the carbon Footprints of say

367
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:45,318
larger corporations or you know

368
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,000
Transportation Industries like Airlines

369
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:50,000
and the like to provide information in

370
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
your app for that as

371
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:59,360
well I think Josh is talking but he's

372
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,360
muted

373
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,240
yeah so I believe that we would be

374
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:09,438
looking to more larger corporations like

375
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,439
Airlines and I think it said yeah larger

376
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,679
corporations Airlines Etc so right now

377
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:17,839
we just started focusing on like the

378
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:19,519
driving aspect of it because I think um

379
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:21,639
when we're looking at users right

380
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,519
they'll more they'll use this app when

381
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,280
they're driving so I believe that's like

382
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:28,199
more in their everyday life we could and

383
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:30,678
we could incorporate something with

384
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,679
Airlines or even corporations or maybe

385
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:34,120
just put like an informational article

386
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:38,400
about

387
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:41,558
that and then um from my perspective a

388
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,360
thing that I would like to hear um a lot

389
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:47,639
of our attendees in the meeting are

390
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:49,000
practitioners similar to me or Donna and

391
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,559
from your

392
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,240
perspective what do you find has been

393
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:54,918
one of the more helpful

394
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,558
aspects

395
00:17:54,919 --> 00:18:01,440
um I guess from like the the extension

396
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:03,279
or the 4 system as you've gone along in

397
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,120
this um a lot of us are trying to figure

398
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,960
out how to best support the young people

399
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,839
that we work with and so if you have any

400
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,919
specific thoughts on that I would

401
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,918
appreciate it myself at

402
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:19,960
least okay so the 4 organization really

403
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,519
supports us really well with especially

404
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:25,200
Miss nouer she's been supporting us

405
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:28,440
through all these all these different

406
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,880
activities and giving us the resources

407
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,400
that we need to better our app and even

408
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:38,320
our activities that we do with teaching

409
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:41,840
and um everything else so yeah just

410
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:43,720
supporting resources and um yes like

411
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:46,959
with the iPads we wouldn't have been

412
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:50,600
able to do all the Swift coding without

413
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:53,038
the Apple grant that we got so just like

414
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:56,240
putting our support putting your support

415
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:58,359
to us will just drive us

416
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,960
exponentially so providing that space

417
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:02,119
for you to explore your interests and

418
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,880
making sure you're

419
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:05,879
supported yeah that's

420
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:13,839
fantastic this has been a production of

421
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,840
Cornell University on the web at

422
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:16,839
