1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,799
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:16,079
University well thank you very much um

3
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:18,320
Don for that nice introduction and um

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,559
this afternoon I am going to go back to

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,760
hodon uh territory and talk about the

6
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:28,559
three sisters as a cropping system um

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:32,559
well known uh with

8
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:35,519
the with the iroy um but this is a

9
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:39,199
cropping system not only present here in

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:42,079
the Northeast um it is a a cropping

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:46,239
system all over the Western Hemisphere

12
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:49,120
and as uh Carl Sawyer um wrote in 1962

13
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:53,280
it's a symbiotic plant complex of North

14
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:56,519
America without an equal elsewhere um

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,558
for the iroy uh William Fenton has

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:03,559
indicated that it is the foundation of

17
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:08,039
ir oi subsistence um enabling them to

18
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:08,039
develop institutions of sedentary

19
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:14,640
life well the three sisters in terms of

20
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:17,840
their origins in in the Northeast uh

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,478
until quite recently um most

22
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,759
archaeologists and anthropologists uh

23
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:26,679
thought that these three crops arrived

24
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:28,920
in the Northeast as a as an intact

25
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,920
cropping system and that they came here

26
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,879
sometime between

27
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,200
1,2 1200

28
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:38,839
BP but recent work by the paleobotanist

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,680
John Hart Who works at the New York

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,799
State uh museum at Albany um has put

31
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,920
forth a much different

32
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:53,360
um um you know story first edible squash

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:58,039
has been around here since 3000 BP maze

34
00:01:53,359 --> 00:02:03,640
by 2270 BP and beans a much more recent

35
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:06,039
introduction 700 P or just um in the uh

36
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,239
you know couple of hundred years before

37
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:12,598
Europeans arrived so Hart says that the

38
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:16,080
three plants as a at the as a crop

39
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:20,598
complex were not all here at the same

40
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,959
time until around 700 BP J can you just

41
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:27,759
um mention what BP oh before present

42
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:29,319
right so it archaeologists use this I it

43
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,639
doesn't make any sense to me because

44
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:35,159
pres is was changing why would you do

45
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,119
that I don't get it but the

46
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:38,959
archaeologists have a reason for it and

47
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,640
I'm trying to be a good archaeologist

48
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:46,080
someday so I use what they use

49
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:50,039
right well the three sisters in iroa or

50
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:53,760
in hodon areas um territories um have

51
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:56,158
been Central to our cultural identity um

52
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,759
in our oral text such as the creation

53
00:02:56,158 --> 00:03:03,598
story and the words that come before all

54
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:06,158
else um um in all aspects of Social and

55
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:10,518
um you know political institutions and

56
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:13,719
in um subsistence and of course um women

57
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:17,439
were the farmers in IRA and um women

58
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:22,039
controlled most aspects of agricultural

59
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:26,719
um work um in the the top right you see

60
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:30,000
a a a watercolor painting by Ernie Smith

61
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:34,919
a Asen artist in the 1930s

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,759
um portraying a a very typical iroy view

63
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:41,119
of the plants they're portrayed as as

64
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,639
members of a family as women um and the

65
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,480
difference between the plant and the

66
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:48,158
human beings is not discernible right

67
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:50,840
they're they're they're one um we also

68
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:54,000
see another painting below by By Ernie

69
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,680
Smith um showing uh this one was called

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,039
corn gathers um another one of his

71
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,560
paintings showing women bringing corn in

72
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,000
from the field

73
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,479
and the the drawing on the left was by a

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,639
Jesuit up in the

75
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:13,078
um 1600s who was uh along the St

76
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:15,798
Lawrence with iryan um Villages and

77
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,840
Farmers up there and this was one of uh

78
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:22,358
the drawings that he made of women

79
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,358
working in the the field with handheld

80
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,280
hose in terms of the agronomic

81
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,199
characteristics of the the three sisters

82
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,758
they're typically planted on mounds and

83
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:37,120
this is a you see there is a a photo

84
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:39,879
from early 1900s um in eastern um in

85
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,240
Western Massachusetts and this was

86
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:44,879
thought to be an old Indian um Planting

87
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,960
Field the crops were usually planted as

88
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,079
a polyculture but not always there are

89
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,758
indications that there were sometimes

90
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:54,680
corn monocultures or bean monocultures

91
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,919
and sometimes I think even um pumpkin

92
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:00,000
monocultures there were no Plows in this

93
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:03,240
cropping system it was hands hand to

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,120
only it was continuously cropped meaning

95
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,759
this was a permanent agriculture not

96
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,959
shifting cultivation the primary reason

97
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,280
for that is where most of this

98
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:17,399
agriculture was taking place um which is

99
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:19,159
along the the center of New York State

100
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:22,519
present day New York State and this is a

101
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:25,199
band of ferti of Alphas sols which are

102
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:29,159
highly fertile um this is where most of

103
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,240
our best agriculture is even um now so

104
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,800
the continuously cropped means that

105
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,280
these were on very highly productive

106
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,680
fertile soils um when we think about

107
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:42,758
shifting cultivation that is a a

108
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,600
management strategy for um acid INF

109
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:48,840
fertile soils and so not applicable here

110
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,840
um at this time in terms of the

111
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:56,478
Agricultural productivity of this system

112
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:59,918
uh historic records provide uh a very um

113
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:01,879
extensive um record of firsthand

114
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:06,279
observations that date all the way back

115
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:09,000
into the 1680s even earlier um

116
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:11,799
indicating that uh IR Corin agriculture

117
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,519
was highly productive people were amazed

118
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,199
at the types of of um crops that they

119
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:22,079
were seeing but no one took any yields

120
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:25,280
so we have no measures of um corn

121
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,639
bushels of corn per acre which as a

122
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,638
agricultural scientist that's what I'm

123
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,639
always interested in so um back in the

124
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,560
middle

125
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:37,120
1990s um decided to do some field

126
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,759
research and to get some numbers so we

127
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,519
carried out some experiments at the

128
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:44,400
Musgrave research Farm up in kuga county

129
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,318
and on a private Farm in Tomkins County

130
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,038
and as much as we could we used crop

131
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,120
varieties and agronomic practices

132
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:53,279
similar to what the iroy would have used

133
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:56,000
in the 17th and 18th centuries I'm going

134
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:58,439
to show you some quick crop yields um

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,240
this was at Tomkins County averaged over

136
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:06,279
two years and these are the three

137
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,280
sisters meaning the wrong

138
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,199
way

139
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,199
no not liking

140
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,479
that

141
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:23,799
okay so these are

142
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:26,519
the the three sisters the crops corn

143
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:29,840
beans in squash corn and green bean in

144
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:32,878
in Orange and pumpkin yellow corn by

145
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:35,878
itself Bean by itself and pumpkin by

146
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:40,360
itself so that's what happened in in

147
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:43,479
Tomkins County over two years

148
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,400
um in kuga County it looked quite a bit

149
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:48,598
different the three

150
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:52,239
sisters almost no corn almost no beans

151
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:54,759
or pumpkin um higher yields the corn

152
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,319
monoculture about the same Bean

153
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:01,439
monoculture pretty Dreadful and pumpkin

154
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,439
monoculture equally Dreadful

155
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,319
all

156
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:07,560
right what agronomists do one of the

157
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:11,720
problems with yields like this trying to

158
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:14,399
compare pumpkins with corn is uh you

159
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,199
can't do it um it really doesn't make

160
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:20,120
any sense so what agronomist do we use

161
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,319
something called land equivalency ratios

162
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,079
and what we do is we simply look at the

163
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,520
ratio of each one of the crops in the

164
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:31,079
polyculture and compare it to when it

165
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:34,879
was grown in monocultures so for example

166
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:36,079
the corn yield in Tomkins County in 1993

167
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:40,240
was

168
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,919
1874 in the three sisters and

169
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,879
2231 when it was grown as a monoculture

170
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:48,360
meaning that we basically got 82% of the

171
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:50,799
yield in the three sisters compared uh

172
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,480
to when it was grown as a monoculture

173
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:56,039
we' go down and do the same thing for

174
00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:00,278
beans 132 in the in the three sisters

175
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:04,199
versus 1096 we only got 12% of the yield

176
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:07,720
if we look at the pumpkins

177
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:10,680
14,46 to over 40,000 we got about a

178
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,079
third what we do is we add up those

179
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:16,479
ratios and we get a number

180
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:19,919
1.3 that's the land equivalency ratio

181
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,079
and anytime the number is over one what

182
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:26,000
intercropping people say is that it was

183
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:28,399
an advantage to have planted it as a

184
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,958
polyculture if the number is less than

185
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,360
one it says you should have stuck with

186
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:39,639
monocultures right so we can look at

187
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:43,200
Tomkins 1994 1.08 kuga 1997

188
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:45,159
1.16 much of the um polyculture

189
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,240
intercropping you know literature will

190
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:50,120
show results like this although

191
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,560
sometimes the yields are less we get LS

192
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,720
less than one but in this particular

193
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,119
examples they're all over

194
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,920
one all right I've just been talking

195
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,639
about crop yields and

196
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:05,719
the title is what did they eat right so

197
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:08,399
I'm interested in food values and I'm

198
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,639
focusing on two things energy and

199
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:14,639
protein and the reason for this is that

200
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:16,319
subsistence farmers will first ensure

201
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,278
that they can actually feed their

202
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,839
families that their families won't

203
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:24,200
starve and so what they do is they look

204
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:25,800
to produce energy their next priority

205
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,920
after they're making sure people aren't

206
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:32,559
starving is to increase the quality of

207
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:34,559
the diet um by adding protein so as a

208
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,479
consequence of this most subsistance

209
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:41,759
farmers will plant a grain like wheat

210
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:45,278
maze rice for energy calories and a

211
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:47,480
legume like Bean Pea or lentils in order

212
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:50,000
to add

213
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,440
protein but I'm back to this question

214
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,440
again because before we go any further

215
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,959
we have to be clear about what we're

216
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,079
talking about here what did they really

217
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:02,078
eat now I've given l lots and lots of

218
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:05,599
workshops to little fourth graders all

219
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:07,919
around Tomkins County with my kids and

220
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,600
then with lots of other people's kids

221
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,799
right um and almost every time after we

222
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,639
do a workshop on the three sisters some

223
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:18,958
little kid will come up and grab my arm

224
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:23,120
and say but what did they really eat um

225
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:25,759
because they're thinking corn sweet corn

226
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,919
and green beans and pumpkins and it's

227
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,958
hard to

228
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:33,439
imagine making a real meal out of that

229
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:37,239
so always the question what did they

230
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:40,079
really eat well it is confusing because

231
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,759
corn we can Harvest it when it's

232
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:46,078
immature green you notice the socks are

233
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:49,360
green the the husks are green and if you

234
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:52,599
pull back the husk that kernel is going

235
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,039
it's if you pinch it it will squirt milk

236
00:11:52,600 --> 00:12:01,759
into your eye and we call this sweet

237
00:11:55,039 --> 00:12:04,759
corn right so that's one way corn Zam ma

238
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:09,720
but we also have Zam ma that looks like

239
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:12,120
this and this is mature corn right um

240
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,759
notice it's brown the stems are brown

241
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,159
the leaves are brown notice the ears the

242
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:20,240
hus are brown and notice how different

243
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:23,639
the kernels look right they're hard this

244
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,480
is grain corn

245
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:30,320
right we can do the same thing for beans

246
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,440
this is fasolis bulgaras kidney

247
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,240
bean we can Harvest it when it's

248
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:38,959
immature green the leaves are green the

249
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:41,440
pods are green slice open the pod right

250
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:44,278
we see a little tiny seed in there but

251
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,600
we're eating that whole pod but we could

252
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:49,000
leave the plant in the field let it

253
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,600
fully mature notice everything's turning

254
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,480
brown now we Harvest a pod but we take

255
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:59,240
out the seeds inside there and we eat

256
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,240
those no longer interested in that pot

257
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,399
well

258
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,560
the this has major effects on the

259
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:10,559
nutrient content of these Foods so for

260
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:10,559
example

261
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:19,838
sorry if we eat ma if we Harvest MAA

262
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:22,919
sweet corn 75% of it is water it has 86

263
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:25,399
calories and 3 gram of protein but if we

264
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:29,479
wait and harvest it as matured grain

265
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:32,559
it's only 10% water 3,650

266
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,440
calories and N gram of protein what

267
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,719
happens with green bean is even more

268
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:41,600
striking Harvest it when it's green 90%

269
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,440
water 31 calories 2 gram of protein wait

270
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:48,959
until it's mature we call it a kidney

271
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:51,440
bean 12% water 3370 calories and 30 g of

272
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,879
protein so you can guess if you're a

273
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,360
subsistance

274
00:13:52,879 --> 00:14:00,159
farmer when you're going to harvest your

275
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,839
crops um predominant particularly if

276
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:03,559
you're worried right maybe you don't

277
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,880
have enough you're going to be

278
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:11,319
harvesting mature grain and mature beans

279
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:14,120
so corn grain and um and dried beans all

280
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,759
right but now we want to go from a crop

281
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,278
yield to a food yield and it turns out

282
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:23,240
this is a fairly complicated process

283
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:26,078
it's not so easy so I'm bringing back

284
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:29,240
this this data from the field

285
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:32,000
experiments but now I've averaged over

286
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:35,839
sites and over

287
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,159
Years and we're looking at crop weights

288
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:42,120
at Harvest weights not dry weights more

289
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,120
or less at Harvest weights

290
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:51,120
and the Maze is at 10% water the beans

291
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:54,399
at 12% pumpkin flesh at 90 pumpkin seed

292
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,440
at 5 noticed here now I've divided the

293
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,679
pumpkin into the Flesh and the seed so

294
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:04,240
now if we look at these crop weights at

295
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:06,519
Harvest we see um the three sisters

296
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,198
these are are just weights over the the

297
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:11,120
years but look at this pumpkin right I

298
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:13,519
mean if you're just thinking about

299
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,919
weight you'd say wellow we should just

300
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,600
go with the pumpkins there's more of

301
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:20,078
that than anything else but the problem

302
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,480
is that most of that pumpkin is water

303
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:25,879
and water has neither calories nor

304
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:29,000
protein so if we're interested in its

305
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:31,198
food value we've got to figure out a way

306
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,839
to get rid of the water and fair it and

307
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:37,719
compare it more um more fairly so we

308
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,600
convert the Harvest weight to energy and

309
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,959
protein and the ways that we do this is

310
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,360
we look at the

311
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:48,318
USDA nutritional database which gives us

312
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,318
the amount of

313
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:58,359
calories in

314
00:15:54,519 --> 00:16:04,198
maze this is when it has 10% water so

315
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:07,318
we've got maze 3650 kog per calories per

316
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:12,120
kilogram and 94 g of protein per

317
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:14,679
kilogram Bean very similar to maze but a

318
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:19,600
lot more protein about the same amount

319
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:22,519
of water pumpkin flesh only 260 calories

320
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:27,278
10 gram of protein and an awful lot of

321
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:29,799
water right pumpkin seed whoa

322
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:33,559
5,590 calories

323
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:35,958
302 of uh grams of protein and only five

324
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:38,679
of water well now we're beginning to see

325
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:42,239
some differences in how we might um

326
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:44,879
begin to uh compare these different

327
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,039
systems so in in this graph what I'm

328
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:51,240
showing is the three sisters here and

329
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:55,599
this is the total calories coming from

330
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:58,159
maze the bean pumpkin seed and pumpkin

331
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:02,199
flesh and notice the amount of energy

332
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:05,078
there um it's actually more than what we

333
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:07,480
get from ma monoculture it's way more

334
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:09,720
than we get from Bean monoculture and

335
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,759
it's a lot more than what we get from

336
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:16,160
pumpkin but note also that a huge amount

337
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:19,279
of the pumpkin calories is coming from

338
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:24,079
the seed right now you might want to

339
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:26,838
remember the land equivalency ratio and

340
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:30,519
how that even with just the weights

341
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:34,119
showed us that even

342
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:36,480
with the three sisters we got an ler of

343
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:40,038
slightly over one compared to the corn

344
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,640
monoculture right um so we know that we

345
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:46,279
can we can do better and the energy

346
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,280
reflects

347
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:51,359
that I just brought this up to show you

348
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:53,439
and remind you again right we'll go on

349
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,399
we can do the same thing with protein

350
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,840
right so this one we're looking at

351
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:01,480
protein in the three

352
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:04,359
sisters in maze monoculture in Bean

353
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:07,360
monoculture and in pumpkin monoculture

354
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:09,759
right and notice the significant

355
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:13,359
contribution from the beans and the

356
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:16,839
Pumpkin both flesh and seeds and notice

357
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:20,399
that it is now quite a bit higher than

358
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:23,759
maze monoculture and still higher than

359
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,559
the bean and still higher than pumpkin

360
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:29,960
but many of you are saying but wait a

361
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:32,720
minute plant proteins are incomplete so

362
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:35,558
those how can you really be measuring

363
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:39,440
the proteins because we know that plants

364
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:42,279
don't provide all of the essential amino

365
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,320
acids that we need right so they have

366
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:49,480
different amounts and that is absolutely

367
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:51,399
true let's look at the the um the maze

368
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,120
the bean the pumpkin seed and I've put

369
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:57,320
pumpkin flesh up here too these are the

370
00:18:54,119 --> 00:19:00,199
essential amino acids and what we will

371
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:05,558
notice is that four of

372
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:10,080
these isoline lysine 309 and

373
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:14,639
tryptophan corn in particular is low in

374
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:18,119
these and bean nicely complements where

375
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,400
the maze is low and surprisingly the

376
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:23,199
pumpkin seeds are really strong in some

377
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,320
of those areas as well you probably

378
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,200
asking but these numbers on the pumpkin

379
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:30,918
flesh they're so small why why do you

380
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,840
even include include them well there's a

381
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:37,360
lot of pumpkin flesh and when you add up

382
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:40,079
all of those amino acids they can

383
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:44,359
complement the amino acids in the other

384
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:50,279
plant Foods or from other Foods whether

385
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:53,519
it's fish or or nuts or um deer they can

386
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:59,038
be part of the protein contribution even

387
00:19:53,519 --> 00:20:01,359
though the concentration is so small

388
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:04,839
I was also interested in looking at

389
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:08,279
calcium vitamins A and C and nasin and

390
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:13,480
these again are um taken from the

391
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:13,480
USDA nutrient database what we see that

392
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:19,720
sorry what we see down at the bottom is

393
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,679
a recommended daily allowance so for

394
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:25,120
example for calcium we need a th and

395
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:28,960
when we look here we see we're not

396
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:32,639
looking so good right um not very good

397
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:36,640
numbers here for any of these these

398
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:39,919
Foods if we look at Vitamin A oh ma and

399
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:44,799
beans are Dreadful but pumpkin flesh

400
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:47,559
whoa we need 5,000 and when we get 8,500

401
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:51,158
and 100 milligrams vitamin A is not

402
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:54,960
going to be a problem right vitamin C

403
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:59,440
however uh we need 60 and we're pretty

404
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:01,880
low right and niin we need 50

405
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,798
and this doesn't look so great either

406
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,400
all right we'll come back and talk a

407
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:08,679
little bit more about

408
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:12,440
this this wonderful word

409
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:15,919
nalization um it's a word that means

410
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:20,080
it's a way of preparing corn corn grain

411
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:24,759
um that it is soaked and usually cooked

412
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:29,278
in an alkaline um water a solution in

413
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:31,879
iria we cook it in hardwood Ash right

414
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:33,519
nalization does a number of really neat

415
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,278
things the very first thing is it

416
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:39,000
dramatically reduces cooking time

417
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:43,038
because the alkaline solution attacks

418
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,558
the parac carp of maze um which is very

419
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:49,278
very hard and it begins to hydrolize it

420
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:51,960
so that water can get in much more

421
00:21:49,278 --> 00:21:55,079
quickly um and so it dramatically

422
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:58,840
reduces cooking time but the other thing

423
00:21:55,079 --> 00:22:02,199
that um nalization does all of those

424
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:05,879
ashes have lots of calcium and what

425
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:09,440
happens is the calcium gets attracted to

426
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:13,120
ma starch grains and so the calcium

427
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:16,759
content of the of the corn or the maze

428
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:16,759
increases 100 to

429
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:25,199
400% the nization also improves protein

430
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:27,278
qu quality and it does this remember the

431
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,278
the amino acids and I showed you a bunch

432
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:32,200
of them that Co horn was really

433
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:36,759
deficient in that's lysine tryptophan

434
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:41,159
histadine methionine and 309

435
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:44,798
so it increases the relative amounts of

436
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:48,240
of these amino acids so the end result

437
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:52,200
is it's it makes corn a higher quality

438
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:56,880
protein meaning it doesn't have yes do

439
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:59,840
you know if um when nalization is done

440
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,400
with lime as done by the indigenous

441
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:04,278
people in Mexico and Central America

442
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,960
whether it has the same impact on

443
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:10,480
calcium content exactly the same yes

444
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,558
exactly the same it's just a difference

445
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,120
in what you're doing what you're using

446
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,798
to make the alkaline you know solution

447
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:20,119
so

448
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:23,278
um so when we nixim malize corn we

449
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:26,359
actually improve its protein quality

450
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:28,759
because we balance out some of or we

451
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:33,240
increase the amounts of some of those am

452
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:36,798
acids which are very low but it also has

453
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:39,558
another impact in that it increases

454
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:43,599
nasin which is part of the vitamin B

455
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:46,519
complex preventing pgra plra is a really

456
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:49,839
ugly terrible disease that was uh

457
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:53,400
rampant in the Southeastern Us in the

458
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:56,879
early 1900s it is still widespread in

459
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:59,080
parts of Africa and Asia and it comes

460
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,400
from um

461
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:06,079
primarily a diet that is almost

462
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,278
exclusively corn and the problem with

463
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:11,038
the corn is

464
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:14,599
that it's low in tryptophan and

465
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:19,919
tryptophan is a precursor to forming

466
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:21,719
nasin right so when you nalize you

467
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:25,840
increase the

468
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:29,480
tryptophan and that increases the nasin

469
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:32,759
right before colonization there was not

470
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,798
a single documented case of pelra in the

471
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:39,319
Western Hemisphere it was only after

472
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:40,639
that pelra came and much of it has to do

473
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:42,678
with the process of

474
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,880
nixtamalization because when the poor

475
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:47,640
folks in the southeast United States

476
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:51,360
were eating corn they were mostly just

477
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:53,799
grinding it and not nalizing it first

478
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:56,079
and they were so poor they had no beans

479
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:59,639
either and the same thing is true in

480
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:02,839
parts of Africa and Asia it's this is a

481
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:06,200
a disease of poor people who do not have

482
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:09,359
the technology the nalization um or any

483
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:12,000
kind of legume in order to um increase

484
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,558
the quality all right so we've talked

485
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,319
about all these comparisons and I've

486
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:19,359
told you how wonderful the three sisters

487
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:23,519
is compared to monocultures of of um

488
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:25,798
Maze and and bean and pumpkin although

489
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:30,079
I'm sure many of you are

490
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:34,000
noting this mayze mind on culture um in

491
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:38,558
both energy and protein maze is amazing

492
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,919
right it really is hard to beat maze out

493
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:45,398
yields every other grain crop it

494
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:49,360
is just pretty spectacular as Margaret

495
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:51,599
Smith here is nodding away um um but so

496
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:54,278
I've been I've been comparing the three

497
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:56,480
sisters with a maze monoculture a bean

498
00:25:54,278 --> 00:25:59,798
monoculture and a pumpkin monoculture

499
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:03,679
and what I am implying is

500
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:06,558
iroy Farmers would choose um to plant

501
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,278
the three sisters or no we're not going

502
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:10,278
to plant our field to the three sisters

503
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:12,679
this year we're going to plant a bean

504
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:14,720
monoculture there's no way that would

505
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:17,159
happen it's not a choice between

506
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,600
planting your field um to the three

507
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:22,039
sisters or deciding just to plant

508
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:24,158
pumpkin I mean they know that's not

509
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:27,558
going to work right I mean it doesn't

510
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:29,080
make any sense right um you're not going

511
00:26:27,558 --> 00:26:33,319
to

512
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:35,480
decide between three crops and one crop

513
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:40,119
for your entire

514
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:42,159
field right rather you're going to take

515
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:45,798
your field and I couldn't make this into

516
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:49,240
a square right so so pretend that the

517
00:26:45,798 --> 00:26:52,278
the the field is is a circle right so

518
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:55,120
instead of planting the three sisters we

519
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:58,839
might decide to plant 1/3 of the field

520
00:26:55,119 --> 00:27:00,719
to Corn 1/3 to beans and 1/3 to pumpkin

521
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:02,839
right so instead of having the three

522
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,880
sisters over the entire field we divide

523
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:07,639
it into three parts and put one crop

524
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,640
here but it's still on the same field

525
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,559
right it's still let's say one hectare

526
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,919
right so 1/3 of the hectare is corn 1/3

527
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:19,960
is Bean 13 is squash right or we could

528
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:22,679
decide seeing how productive the corn is

529
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,960
I'm going to put half of it half of the

530
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:29,759
field into corn and I'm going to put 25%

531
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:32,440
into bean and 25% into pumpkin or I

532
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:35,519
really say that corn is looking awfully

533
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:38,480
good I'm going to put 80% of the Corn of

534
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:41,639
the field into corn and only 10% into

535
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:45,240
bean and pumpkin right this is a much

536
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:47,880
more realistic comparison of what people

537
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:51,399
would actually choose the decisions that

538
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:54,000
farmers are making so now let's look at

539
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:56,199
monoculture mixtures versus the three

540
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,398
sisters so this first one and we're

541
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:02,038
looking at energy um so this first one

542
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:04,599
says we've got a third

543
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:07,640
right we've got a third of these crops

544
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:11,480
and this is how much each one of these

545
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:15,519
the maze bean and pumpkin um contribute

546
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:19,640
to the total energy

547
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:23,679
right it's looking not so great right if

548
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,799
we look at the one that's 50% corn and

549
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:30,880
then

550
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:30,879
10% um 25 and 25 being in pumpkin we can

551
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:37,919
see the we're doing better but it's

552
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:41,798
still not great when we put

553
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:44,559
80% into corn we're doing better if we

554
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:47,720
plant the whole field to Corn we're even

555
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:50,798
better right forget the pumpkin and the

556
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:53,720
Squash and the beans right just plant

557
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:57,278
corn but now look at the three sisters

558
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,839
right when we plant the corn and we add

559
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:02,038
the bean and pump

560
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:04,199
we get a jump in the amount of energy

561
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:06,278
that's the land equivalency ratio that

562
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,759
we saw in the yield as well but we see

563
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:12,359
it in energy too right we see that yeah

564
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:15,158
there's a good reason why these farmers

565
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:17,918
are planting the three sisters because

566
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:21,679
it turns out that we get more energy

567
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:24,320
from this than anything else we can

568
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:27,480
look at the same thing in terms of

569
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,839
protein but it looks different right

570
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:33,480
first of all

571
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:35,398
um we look at the 1/3 1/3 1/3 and we can

572
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,038
see we're we're getting about a third

573
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:41,199
from me from Mae a little bit more than

574
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:43,200
a a third from the pumpkin and something

575
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,798
less than that from the beans but the

576
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:49,000
total amount is still less than what we

577
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:51,440
get from the three sisters and every

578
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,240
time we increase the amount of corn we

579
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,278
increase the amount of protein right it

580
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:01,480
goes up and we get right up to there

581
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:04,440
when we go all corn but notice the

582
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:07,599
significant impact of the three sisters

583
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:10,320
on increasing protein now I would argue

584
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:14,038
that this is the major advantage of the

585
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:17,119
three sisters um not so much in terms of

586
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:19,919
energy it does give extra energy but

587
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:22,639
it's really the protein so all of these

588
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,519
are on the same piece of land right and

589
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,519
we've just varied um whether it's three

590
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,558
sisters or the others Mario and what's

591
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:33,759
the

592
00:30:29,558 --> 00:30:36,918
mixture this one oh the the mixture um I

593
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:39,879
mean these are all this is It's the

594
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:42,320
standard thing right um

595
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:46,440
I when you're asking what portion of

596
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:49,678
this um most of the yield is coming from

597
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:52,320
the corn whether it's protein or energy

598
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,240
but it the fact is that this is on one

599
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:57,000
piece of land

600
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:00,000
so exactly where it comes from doesn't

601
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,240
matter right I mean you you plant three

602
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,159
kernels of of corn in the hill and two

603
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,440
or three of beans and you plant the the

604
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,000
pumpkin in between what you're

605
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,120
interested in is what comes out right of

606
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,720
what the yield is in terms of energy and

607
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,719
protein

608
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:21,120
right all right one last question that

609
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:23,000
I'm interested in is well how many

610
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:27,439
people I and I'll tell you how I got

611
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,359
started on this I got called by the um

612
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,000
Museum of the American Indian in New

613
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:35,240
York City the national museum but not

614
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,798
the one in in in Washington it's its

615
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,519
Other Side in New York City and they're

616
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:41,519
doing a program educational program on

617
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:45,919
the three sisters and they wanted to

618
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,798
have a a a cropping game in which young

619
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,320
kids in their families would plant

620
00:31:47,798 --> 00:31:52,759
different amounts either as polycultures

621
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:54,398
of the three sisters or as monocultures

622
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:57,319
and they wanted to make it real and they

623
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:59,798
said well how many people could could it

624
00:31:57,319 --> 00:32:03,879
feed you know like an acre of the three

625
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:05,720
sisters right and I said oh well I'll

626
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,399
have to do some calculations and I did

627
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:11,278
some quick quick back ofth envelope

628
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:14,079
calculations and I I realized it was a

629
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:15,200
very interesting question about how many

630
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:19,319
people could

631
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:22,919
actually eat off of a Hector of the

632
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:25,278
three sisters right and so um in order

633
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:27,200
to make this kind of calculation you

634
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:31,000
first have to determine well what are

635
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:33,399
the um daily requirements of an active

636
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,519
adult for energy in other words how many

637
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:38,918
calories do we need and what about

638
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:42,319
protein so on a daily basis 2500

639
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:45,720
calories per day is pretty realistic 60

640
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:48,960
gram of protein realistic you just

641
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:51,200
multiply by 365 and you come up with

642
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,440
what one person would need for a year

643
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:58,960
close to a million calories right to

644
00:32:54,440 --> 00:33:02,200
provide Basics and 22 kilogram of

645
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:05,240
protein right and then I just go back to

646
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:08,120
the data that I just showed you and kind

647
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:11,558
of divide it

648
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:13,199
out so people supported by monoculture

649
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:16,119
mixtures the ones I was showing you

650
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,440
before and the Three Sisters in this

651
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:22,278
case the energy is in the lighter kind

652
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,278
of tan and the protein is in the the

653
00:33:22,278 --> 00:33:30,480
darker color and what we see is that on

654
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:33,359
the everything in a third we able to

655
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,240
feed um probably seven people per

656
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:38,638
hectare um in terms of energy Supply

657
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,759
that um in terms of protein we get over

658
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:46,000
10 right notice that is each time the

659
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:49,480
corn goes up each of these numbers

660
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,919
increases so we're up to with with the

661
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:56,798
uh monoculture of corn we're up to about

662
00:33:52,919 --> 00:34:00,840
12 and a half people fed per hectare um

663
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:03,720
in terms of of energy and about 13 and a

664
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:05,000
half in terms of protein but once again

665
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,319
the three

666
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,199
sisters in terms of energy we could

667
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:15,239
supply for about 13 people and in terms

668
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:17,799
of protein about 15 and a half um just

669
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:19,519
for comparison to think about it and I

670
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,280
have these figures and could actually do

671
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:24,320
it but I didn't think I would have time

672
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:28,560
today if we looked at European Wheat

673
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:31,919
Growers in the same time period um

674
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:35,519
wheat farmers in Europe were struggling

675
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:39,319
to feed even three or four people per

676
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:43,280
heor right and so what we see here is a

677
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:47,240
cropping system that is multiple times

678
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:49,960
more productive and able to support more

679
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:52,239
people all right so what are the

680
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,000
conclusions here first that intercropped

681
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:56,319
maze bean and pumpkin is highly

682
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,480
productive um and it certainly could

683
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:02,480
have been counted on um to largely

684
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:05,480
satisfy hodon dietary needs there are no

685
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:08,119
indication that they that they used only

686
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:11,880
these crops in fact many many other

687
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:15,039
sources of food um in in this area very

688
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,280
very productive ecosystem with all sorts

689
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:19,279
of other

690
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:23,119
plants um you know wild plants lots of

691
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:26,839
animals and fish um but certainly as the

692
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:29,800
foundation for um their diet it was

693
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:32,799
doing a a great job um one of the

694
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:34,839
reasons for this is maze um it is the

695
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,720
anchor of the system and with its very

696
00:35:34,838 --> 00:35:40,199
high crop yields it produces really

697
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:43,078
enormous amounts of energy and a lot of

698
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:45,118
protein um the three sisters as a

699
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:46,680
cropping system provides more energy and

700
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,240
protein than individual crop

701
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:52,440
monocultures and more than monoculture

702
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:55,118
mixtures of these um three

703
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:57,639
crops the pumpkin and the bean and

704
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:00,079
pumpkin seeds um increase the total am

705
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:03,480
amounts of protein and improve protein

706
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:06,920
quality the pumpkin flesh provides lots

707
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:09,519
of vitamin A and Maze nalization

708
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:13,200
decreases cooking time increases calcium

709
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:16,719
100 to 400% improves protein quality and

710
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:18,719
increases nasin preventing um pagr if

711
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:22,519
we're looking at how many people we can

712
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:26,039
support three sisters um ah and I have

713
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:29,880
to qualify this these are based

714
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:31,119
on yield from field experiments right

715
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,559
and the

716
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:36,800
amounts the maze yields I am absolutely

717
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:40,318
confident in these are very realistic

718
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,800
maze yields in either the polyculture or

719
00:36:40,318 --> 00:36:45,559
when planted as a monoculture these are

720
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,480
very realistic yields the beans and the

721
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:52,599
Pumpkin much less experience in only a

722
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,639
couple of sites and and um years so I

723
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:57,160
have much less confidence in the beans

724
00:36:54,639 --> 00:37:00,719
and pumpkin but it's pretty clear to me

725
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:04,239
that even with relatively small amounts

726
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:06,439
small yields of beans and pumpkin um the

727
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:09,000
the three sisters does a great job

728
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:11,838
because even those small amounts boost

729
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,960
things enough um to significantly

730
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:19,838
increase um energy and and protein so in

731
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:21,838
terms of energy enough for 13.4 people

732
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:25,318
per hectare per year and in terms of

733
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:31,000
protein almost um 16 people per Hector

734
00:37:25,318 --> 00:37:31,000
per year so with that I'm open to

735
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,240
questions the explanation for the

736
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,480
overyielding mostly the nitrogen from

737
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:44,919
the beans or not no I mean I would say

738
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,599
that the contribution of of beans in

739
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:50,440
terms of nitrogen to the coof system is

740
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:53,240
very minor and the reason for that is

741
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,400
that people eat the beans which are what

742
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:57,519
contains most of the nitrogen there are

743
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:00,240
small amounts of nitrogen in the stems

744
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:04,119
leaves but majority of the of the

745
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:06,199
nitrogen in the beam is in in the beam

746
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:08,119
right and once you eat it the only way

747
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:10,199
it gets back onto the field is if you

748
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:13,640
put human waste back on the field like

749
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:17,879
we do with with with cops right so the

750
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:20,199
bean contribution is is relatively

751
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,400
unimportant I think the reason for the

752
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:24,199
extra for the increase productivity at

753
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,639
least what you know literature on

754
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:29,439
intercropping tells us that it's just

755
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:31,879
increased um efficiency of the entire

756
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,760
system in other words the three crops

757
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,440
are collecting more sunlight and more

758
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,359
energy they're Gathering more water

759
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,079
their roots are gathering more water and

760
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:44,400
nutrients underneath and as a result of

761
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:48,359
that we're seeing um small efficiencies

762
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:51,358
that result in somewhat greater

763
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:54,639
y can you say anything about how these

764
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:57,639
Foods were prepared and eat in terms

765
00:38:54,639 --> 00:39:00,719
ofas

766
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:04,279
lots of different indigenous not

767
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:07,598
tortillas um the the corn and and beans

768
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:11,880
primarily in in soup and in bread um the

769
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:14,800
person to look for that um two um two

770
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:18,000
major sources one is Arthur Parker um

771
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:23,720
iry uses of Maze and other food CRS and

772
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:26,159
his contemporary wall W Au u h um and I

773
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:28,199
I think it's just called eord grps and

774
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:32,118
both of those were written in the 1900s

775
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:32,118
and get very um extensive

776
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:40,200
descriptions Jane the cucurbit that you

777
00:39:37,318 --> 00:39:44,358
spoke about was pumpkin was that the

778
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:47,318
sole cucurbit type that the H use now

779
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:50,199
there was indications um uh particularly

780
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:52,318
at the time of San's campaign that there

781
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:55,279
were lots of different types of con

782
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:58,239
curbit and con curbit are a bit of a

783
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:01,560
nightmare in terms of their complex

784
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:05,399
and I barely feel competent to even say

785
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:09,199
what I know is that um the one that I am

786
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:13,838
looking at and and the the nutrient data

787
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:13,838
that I've taken from um is

788
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:24,519
curita mar you got it right got it right

789
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:28,280
so um and those are crops um that have

790
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:31,039
brightly colored flesh um quite firm

791
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:33,640
right so it looks like a pumpkin or what

792
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:36,159
we would often think of as a winter

793
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:38,559
squash but the acorn is in a different

794
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:42,559
place right even though Acorn we think

795
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:44,920
of as a winter squash the acorn is not P

796
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:47,880
it's peopleo overa I think or something

797
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:50,599
like that anyways but there were other

798
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:54,160
cucurbit that were much more similar to

799
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:56,240
like melons um and things maybe even

800
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:59,199
cucumbers that the English might have

801
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:01,559
known about out because they seem to

802
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:04,159
during Sullivan's campaign kind of give

803
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:05,960
them names that sounded like so they

804
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:08,358
might have been growing lots of other

805
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:11,800
things too right but I focus for the

806
00:41:08,358 --> 00:41:15,838
food value on the on the pumpkin or the

807
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,839
winter squash because it is the

808
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:22,440
most in the process of

809
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:25,078
mization I'd expect some nutrients to be

810
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,519
lost in the solution but they're also

811
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:29,800
picking up calcium you have any

812
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:31,679
information of well the one thing about

813
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:35,599
nalization that I did learn which

814
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:38,118
surprised me was that the total protein

815
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:40,960
actually decreases on the corn uh the

816
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:42,519
total amount of protein of nixed corn is

817
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,639
less than

818
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:48,280
uned um but the reason but and I think

819
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:52,159
some of that may I'm not even sure how

820
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:55,160
that happens but uh the protein quality

821
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:58,239
increases substantially right so that

822
00:41:55,159 --> 00:42:00,118
more than compensates right in terms of

823
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:02,559
other things that might be lost in terms

824
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:04,400
of leeching I didn't see anything and

825
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:06,519
I've read a a number of papers on

826
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,240
nalization and I don't recall them

827
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:13,239
saying um that things were lost other

828
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:17,838
than protein went down total

829
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:21,639
protein um I know that t originates in

830
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:25,759
Central America do sashing be also come

831
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:30,279
from Central America um yes uh short

832
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:33,960
answer yes although squash was um

833
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:35,960
domesticated at two different times um

834
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:40,440
in the Eastern woodlands in North

835
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:42,960
America um and in you know Central and

836
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:46,159
South America um but the first squashes

837
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:50,480
that were domesticated were inedible ORS

838
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:55,519
and so then there the there is a

839
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:59,960
um when as far as I understand the

840
00:42:55,519 --> 00:43:03,440
edible um you know squash comes in quite

841
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:05,800
a bit later right but again

842
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,440
at I'm not sure of that the edible

843
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,640
squash may have been only domesticated

844
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:13,800
in in Central America and then moved

845
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:17,440
forward because what was domesticated in

846
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:20,400
the Eastern Woodlands was an

847
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:23,480
inevitable second part of question do

848
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:26,599
you see the three sisters

849
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:29,920
elsewhere like such in as in Mexico with

850
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:32,280
the than absolutely okay as Carl Sawyer

851
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,400
said it's across the entire Western

852
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:37,359
Hemisphere at least up into kind of

853
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:41,760
Southern Canada um and goes all the way

854
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:45,078
down I'm not sure probably not Peru yes

855
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:47,760
yes Peru too okay so it's all over

856
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:50,519
sometimes they only use two right um but

857
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:53,119
most of the time there are

858
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:55,400
three um with the same with the three

859
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:57,880
sisters being grown in the same place

860
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:00,720
year after year um did that that system

861
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:02,400
require fertility additions at any time

862
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:05,519
this is a great question and I will send

863
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,720
you an article on this it says yes I

864
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:10,639
mean they were not grown indefinitely

865
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:15,439
because IR coin Villages were moved

866
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:18,519
frequently it used to be the standard

867
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,800
um kind of rationale given was that the

868
00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:25,719
soils became completed

869
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:29,079
um that's not true the soils did not be

870
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:32,719
become depleted primarily because the

871
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:35,760
uroid did not use clouds um and they

872
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:41,439
were starting on very fertile soils

873
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:46,000
Alpha soils the major loss of fertility

874
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:50,318
in agricultural systems is not from crop

875
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,559
UPC it's from plowing which causes

876
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:55,920
oxidation of

877
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:58,760
nitrates and most of those nitrates

878
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:02,318
leave the the soil system only a few are

879
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:06,520
captured by the crow when you plow

880
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:08,800
continuously Which Europeans and US

881
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:10,759
settlers did for a couple of hundred

882
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,119
years you

883
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:17,160
will see a dramatic decline in soil

884
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:19,838
fertility it had always been assumed

885
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:22,118
that the reason for that was these crops

886
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:25,279
were just grabbing out all of that

887
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:28,000
nitrogen but that's not true the major

888
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,800
reason for the decline in fertility was

889
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,079
the continuous

890
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:38,000
plowing so the fact that the uoy were

891
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:41,960
growing crops starting with very fertile

892
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:45,760
soils alas Sals typically will have

893
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:48,760
unplowed 4 to 5% nitrogen if you don't

894
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:51,920
plow them the only thing that you are

895
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:54,760
losing then is what's taken up by the

896
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,240
crop small amounts when you're digging

897
00:45:54,760 --> 00:46:00,040
out there with your hoe don't get Capt

898
00:45:57,239 --> 00:46:04,519
by The Roots but the decrease in soil

899
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:09,719
organic matter and in nitrogen is very

900
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:15,280
very small right so from what we can see

901
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:15,279
the iroy were

902
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:20,280
not you know cutting down trees and

903
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,119
looking for new Fields every year once

904
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,480
they had cleared a field and formed

905
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:27,240
those mountains they probably stayed

906
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:30,039
there for as long as the vill Village

907
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:33,598
State and the village moved not because

908
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:38,000
of soil fertility decline but because of

909
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:40,240
trade needs of defensive needs of um the

910
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,920
long housee was infested with fleas

911
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:45,679
right I mean whatever they reasons to

912
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:48,000
move but it had nothing to do with

913
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:50,879
declining soil

914
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,440
fertility what about um like insects and

915
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,000
diseases were they all brought by

916
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:58,838
Europeans or there any any of any of the

917
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,838
major in diseases like

918
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,358
I mean certainly

919
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:08,159
European few

920
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:11,079
others or any other disas no I'm sure

921
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:14,358
that they had you know diseases would be

922
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:17,280
maybe a reason for

923
00:47:14,358 --> 00:47:19,598
one I mean I my guess is that the squash

924
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,240
plugs would will accumulate wherever the

925
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:25,400
squashes right um they don't have a hard

926
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:27,679
time finding it um I mean the the thing

927
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:32,400
that I would think would be the biggest

928
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:35,000
um pest would be weeds right um and the

929
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,079
the weeds we could never grow the three

930
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,960
sisters at the muser farm or any place

931
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:44,359
else without doing an awful lot of an

932
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:48,358
weat um the re two reasons for this one

933
00:47:44,358 --> 00:47:50,400
is because we are in we're using plows

934
00:47:48,358 --> 00:47:52,719
and so when you use plows you're

935
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:55,720
constantly bringing up the weed seeds

936
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:58,480
and encouraging weeds to you know

937
00:47:55,719 --> 00:48:00,719
germinate um um and second a lot of the

938
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:04,280
weeds that are most um you know

939
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:06,519
Troublesome now in New York state are

940
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:08,160
imports from

941
00:48:06,519 --> 00:48:12,239
Europe

942
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:12,239
so thank you so much Jane

943
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:21,119
for this has been a production of

944
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:24,118
Cornell University on the web at
