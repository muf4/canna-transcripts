1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,800
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,918 --> 00:00:11,480
University uh thank you so much for

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,039
inviting me up to New York love love New

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,719
York love Etha um before we get started

5
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:20,640
I know we've got some at least one

6
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:24,160
retailer right um how many Growers are

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,000
in the audience okay

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,759
landscapers couple Educators Master

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,119
Gardeners wow okay really good

10
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,640
okay well I'm very pleased to talk to

11
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,119
you about pollinators because it's an

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,640
extremely important topic um and we can

13
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:44,078
all we can definitely all help listening

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,039
to Carol was very helpful um to see you

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,280
know where is our gardening public going

16
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,840
and who do we need to reach out to just

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,840
coming um about three weeks ago from the

18
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,079
international pollinator conference at

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,600
Penn State I can tell you that the

20
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:02,120
pollinator crisis is very real

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,359
and it's something that we have to

22
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:07,719
address worldwide I think the good news

23
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,400
is that all of us here working in the

24
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:12,959
screen industry can be part of the

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,240
solution and again listening to Carol I

26
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,319
was thinking about the connection with

27
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:20,239
kids I mean what's a more wonderful

28
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:22,158
connection than plants butterflies bees

29
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,280
you know things that move because kids

30
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,840
love this kind of thing and food

31
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,719
gardening um it it's a perfect match so

32
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,200
what I want to do I'm going to kind of

33
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,599
take you through a quick introduction

34
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,040
for those of you who might not be

35
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,919
terribly familiar with pollinators uh

36
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,640
we're going to talk about who they are

37
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,960
going to talk about the stressors on

38
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,759
them and then the important part um what

39
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:48,679
can we do to help them with our floral

40
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,519
resources okay so most of you guys know

41
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,000
this why are pollinators important well

42
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,798
we like to eat we like to eat watermelon

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,039
we like to eat squash we like to eat

44
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,320
blueberries and apples and these are all

45
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:03,280
things that are insect pollinated so

46
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:06,239
without these our diets become very

47
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,520
Bland um we also have an economic value

48
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:12,560
going on here uh without pollinators we

49
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,200
have definitely have some economic

50
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,039
problems and then there's the ecosystem

51
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,318
without pollination of plants we have no

52
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,199
seeds we Have No Berries which means we

53
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:25,399
have no food web and everything really

54
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:28,639
does collapse um which is why we call

55
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,519
pollinators keystone species we cannot

56
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:35,399
pull these guys out and still have all

57
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,920
of us survive okay so I think when

58
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,959
you're gardening for pollinators and

59
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:40,518
you're thinking about plants for them

60
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,039
it's important to know who our

61
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:46,920
pollinators are um because it's not just

62
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:49,639
honey bees it's a very very wide range

63
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:51,919
of diversity and each of these guys use

64
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:55,279
something just a little bit

65
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:57,399
different so flies I know flies aren't a

66
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,919
big S cell to the public but some of

67
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,680
them are actually quite beautiful the

68
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:03,958
surfed fly over over here on the left

69
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,000
some sometimes also called hoverfly very

70
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,239
frequent flower visitors and they do

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,719
their share of pollination and as a

72
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,200
bonus their larvae are wonderful aphid

73
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:17,560
eaters so we've got beneficial insects

74
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:20,759
going on here too this Tac nid fly not

75
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,120
quite as pretty over on the left um or

76
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,719
excuse me on your right um this tacn fly

77
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,840
is actually very important because it's

78
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:31,438
the parasitoid of the brown marmorated

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,200
stink bug lays its eggs on on them so

80
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:36,280
these pollinators that are visiting

81
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:38,878
these plants have more benefit than just

82
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,519
moving pollen and nectar or moving

83
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,919
pollen beetles very frequent flower

84
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,719
visitors I can't tell you how many

85
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:46,518
people bring these into the office after

86
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,840
they've killed them because they've said

87
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:52,120
they're on my flowers and must be doing

88
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,438
something bad um but this soldier beetle

89
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,959
is actually another beneficial and you

90
00:03:54,438 --> 00:04:01,959
know it actually does eat some aphids um

91
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:05,759
and as a flower visitor it's moving some

92
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:08,560
pollen butterflies and moths easy cell

93
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:11,519
maybe poster child for pollinators not

94
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,400
as efficient because their legs hold

95
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,079
them above the flower so they're not

96
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,160
moving around as much pollen but they're

97
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,720
absolutely beautiful they have they

98
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,280
definitely have another role in the

99
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,160
environment and that's their

100
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:28,239
caterpillars feeding Birds which is is

101
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,680
supporting the whole food web um but

102
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,639
when we're talking to people about

103
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,840
pollinators sometimes this is the way to

104
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,800
get them into pollinator gardening

105
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:39,638
because who doesn't love

106
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,319
butterflies and of course Birds another

107
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:44,639
very beloved pollinator I I would think

108
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:47,159
that Cardinal flower and this B bomb

109
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,879
menarda would be very very very easy to

110
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,639
sell uh we find that in our in our

111
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:56,199
Master Gardener plant sales um because

112
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,918
people want to support these beautiful

113
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:02,400
birds and then we get into the hopter

114
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:04,319
the wasps and the bees and yes if you

115
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:07,159
have pollinator friendly plants you are

116
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:09,599
going to have a lot of wasps most of

117
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,280
them are solitary um they're not the

118
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,680
Yellow Jacket type social wasp they're

119
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:18,478
solitary the the female is doing all of

120
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:20,478
her work she's far too busy to even even

121
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,360
think about stinging a lot of these are

122
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:25,159
ground nesters this is actually uh one

123
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,240
we've been doing some work on at our

124
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:32,120
pator plot this is by certies um she is

125
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:36,600
a ground Nester and during her lifetime

126
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:39,120
which is very short she can kill 40 or

127
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,800
kill and take back to the nest 40 Brown

128
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,959
marmorated stink bugs so you know very

129
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,160
the they're flower visitors but they're

130
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:51,318
also um performing other functions for

131
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,039
us and then there's the bees these are

132
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:57,439
our main pollinators there's no doubt

133
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:59,159
about that all the bees are um very

134
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,639
effective at pollination because they

135
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,680
are collecting pollen these other

136
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:06,519
visitors are strictly getting nectar and

137
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,079
kind of accidentally moving things with

138
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:11,439
them these guys have to collect pollen

139
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:14,038
to take back to the nest to feed their

140
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,879
larvae to feed the young um and they're

141
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:18,719
very well adapted for it with their

142
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:20,959
bodies and pollen collectors everybody's

143
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,759
familiar with honeybees but not

144
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,560
everybody knows that honeybees are

145
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:26,720
actually a farm to be they're not

146
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,598
considered wild they were brought over

147
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,960
from Europe with the Jamestown settlers

148
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:35,959
and it's been an economic Farm product

149
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:39,359
ever since what folks aren't too

150
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:41,758
familiar with is the native feas and we

151
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,400
have a lot of them before these honey

152
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,680
bees were brought over pollination was

153
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:50,318
happening here we had a great ecosystem

154
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,560
going and there are over 20,000 species

155
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,520
worldwide right here in the Mid-Atlantic

156
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,519
region we figured in Pennsylvania we

157
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:58,680
have about

158
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:01,680
450 we're discovering new species every

159
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,038
day because until we had the problem

160
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,800
with pollinators nobody was doing a

161
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:08,918
whole lot of studying and so now with

162
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,478
everything being geared up we are

163
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:13,279
learning a

164
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:16,199
lot and these species are very very

165
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:18,478
varied um there's all kinds of bees out

166
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,800
there bumblebees most people are

167
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,519
familiar with they are a social bee the

168
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,079
queen actually has workers in a small

169
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:30,000
colony in the ground maybe 250 of them

170
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:32,680
um and then these other bees are

171
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,079
solitary again the queen is doing all of

172
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,199
her own work she might only be laying 10

173
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:41,719
12 eggs she might be laying them in the

174
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:44,439
ground um in hollow hollow stems she

175
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,759
might be using dead wood so all of these

176
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:50,038
nesting sites become extremely important

177
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,520
and these bees vary from the pretty

178
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:56,038
large carpenter bee down to the tiny

179
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:58,318
little sweat bee that is really

180
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:00,279
difficult to identify when they're on

181
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,800
the flowers but there are a lot of them

182
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,559
out

183
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,240
there we have bees that are Specialists

184
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,918
and this is important when we're

185
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,680
thinking about what we're planting um

186
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:14,719
the squash be on the on your left over

187
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,319
here actually nests underneath squash

188
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,400
plants and you don't need honey bees if

189
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:23,439
you're growing squash because you if you

190
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,799
plant it they will come if your farming

191
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,839
practices are not disturbing their nest

192
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,000
they will be there for you the males

193
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:33,199
fall asleep in the flowers very very

194
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,719
sweet um and they take care of your your

195
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:40,080
crop for you it's a native Fe um the

196
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:43,719
mining bee on the right I put in here

197
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:47,800
because there is a particular mining bee

198
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:50,000
that is a specialist on Golden Rod that

199
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:54,359
the way it collects pollen and its

200
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,879
collectors only fit one size of pollen

201
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:00,399
grain and that's from Golden Rod or

202
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:04,519
asure and so with without Golden Rod or

203
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:08,200
Aster those bees are gone so these

204
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:10,440
specialist bees are not as common but

205
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,200
they have a very important Niche and we

206
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,720
need to keep the diversity so they're

207
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,040
very

208
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,079
important um other bees have a really

209
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:21,240
wide floral range can bumblebees are

210
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:24,159
this way this wonderful little leaf

211
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:28,079
cutter bee can go from one species to

212
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:31,078
another um and and actually visit many

213
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:34,399
many different Ames of flowers and we

214
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:38,919
need we need both of these

215
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:42,120
groups the bad news is pollinators are

216
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:45,159
declining um and it's a rather steep

217
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:49,000
decline it's happening quickly we have

218
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:50,600
about 34 animals identified as

219
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,480
pollinators that are endangered or

220
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,278
threatened and then look at the number

221
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,519
of flowering species that are also

222
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:00,759
endangered or threatened and the the

223
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:03,919
relationship ship between the flowers

224
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:07,078
and their pollinators is very tight so

225
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:09,000
sometimes if you lose a flower floral

226
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:12,120
resource you're going to lose a

227
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,759
pollinator and and vice versa um so this

228
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:18,919
is a concerning

229
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:22,039
issue this last winter um honey bees

230
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:23,919
declined again these are our farmed bees

231
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:28,719
they lost

232
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:31,479
45% um 15% loss is what they normally

233
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,480
would expect and this has been going on

234
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,360
now for quite a few years ever since

235
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,680
we've heard about the colony collapse

236
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,879
disorder our wild bees are also in

237
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:44,799
trouble we might never have known this

238
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,759
if colony collapse hadn't happened with

239
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,399
the honey bees we may never have

240
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:51,200
actually started to study these other

241
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:54,600
bees but we've got at least five species

242
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,959
of our North American bumblebees um that

243
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,879
are are shrinking and range and part of

244
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:02,039
this is due to climate change there's a

245
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:05,519
lot lot of other reasons as well 13 out

246
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:07,639
of 46 species of our Bumblebees are now

247
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,679
threatened or near-threatened this is

248
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:13,360
not good news because the Bumblebee

249
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:16,799
globally is our second most important

250
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,639
pollinator of crops second only to that

251
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:21,439
that farmed honeybee that's being taken

252
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:26,278
around and then

253
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:28,399
butterflies wow um 141 different species

254
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:32,159
at risk of course the latest one that

255
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:35,639
everybody knows about is is the monarch

256
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:37,639
right so what in the world is going on

257
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:41,079
with our pollinators what is stressing

258
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:43,919
them out so much well there's no one

259
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:46,679
Smoking Gun to this it's hard to do

260
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,519
research on these wonderful um you know

261
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:51,919
wonderful creatures because there's so

262
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:54,879
many factors coming in we know that

263
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:58,559
habitat nutrition is one pesticide

264
00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:02,639
exposure we've got diseases viruses of f

265
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:05,879
fungus out there um pth genetics we know

266
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,879
that climate change is is playing a role

267
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:09,799
and when these all come together

268
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:12,198
somewhat of a recipe for

269
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:16,519
disaster I'm going to talk about these

270
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:18,240
two of the pesticides and the nutrition

271
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:20,519
because these are things we can do

272
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,480
something about the rest of this we have

273
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:23,480
to kind of leave to the

274
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,560
researchers and habitat loss is huge

275
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,440
both of nesting habitat you know they

276
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:34,078
can't nest in mulch they can't Nest um

277
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,480
in thick Turf so our gardening practices

278
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,799
are kind of against them and we've

279
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,720
fragmented our landscape so much that

280
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:45,519
some of these insects can't fly across

281
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,399
some of the um the more urban areas that

282
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,600
we've

283
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:52,519
created and uh noted ecologist down in

284
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,360
Arizona has determined over 95% of the

285
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,639
land in the lower 48 states is either in

286
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,120
agriculture or development that doesn't

287
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:03,600
leave a whole lot lot for our pollinator

288
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,879
friends and our farming practices in the

289
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,320
midwest have changed drastically and we

290
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:11,600
know this is this is a definite problem

291
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,800
for pollinators um these vast fields of

292
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,240
monocultures no hedge r no pollinator

293
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,919
ships you know uh there's just nothing

294
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,000
there for the

295
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:23,919
pollinators here in the Northeast we're

296
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,958
a little better off um because our Farms

297
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:29,479
are smaller we still do have HED tros

298
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:32,559
we've got you know Forest land in

299
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:35,959
between and so we're definitely we're

300
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:39,239
definitely better here than in the

301
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:43,599
midwest our Suburban areas are the other

302
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:46,720
part of this um as natural fields and

303
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,519
forests are plowed down or taken down

304
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,480
for development for homes and businesses

305
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:56,000
what we put back in our yards does not

306
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:59,759
begin to um to satisfy the needs of the

307
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,639
pollinators our our turf our our plants

308
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:05,079
which we're importing mostly from other

309
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:07,959
countries um just not a lot there and

310
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:10,359
even our campuses as beautiful as as our

311
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:12,958
own Penn State campus is when I walk

312
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,120
around I see a lot of places where you

313
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:17,078
know we could we could do better and we

314
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,240
could be putting in more floral

315
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:20,638
resources we could be filling this up

316
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,320
with flowers wouldn't that be wonderful

317
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,639
we filled everything with

318
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,759
flowers a lot of the natural lands that

319
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:31,278
are left um have been overrun with inv

320
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:34,199
IES and I know you have a a talk on that

321
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:37,198
a little bit later this is a n a state

322
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:39,879
state forest in Pennsylvania which is

323
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:42,838
being overrun by Japanese silk grass and

324
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:45,679
Japanese Barberry that has escaped from

325
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,160
our yards um and once you get that kind

326
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:51,799
of monoculture in the forest crowding

327
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:54,360
out a lot of the the wild flowers our

328
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:59,159
pollinators have

329
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:01,519
trouble pesticides are a tough issue and

330
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:03,439
um I'm not an expert on pesticides so

331
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,198
I'll kind of relay to you what our

332
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,920
Center for pollinator research has found

333
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:13,240
so far um we know that pesticides are

334
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:16,599
part of this whole problem we also know

335
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:20,919
that whatever we put down pollinators

336
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:24,920
pick up and in a study um back around

337
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:28,078
2007 we of pollen samples we found out

338
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:29,639
that there were 121 different pesticides

339
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:33,120
identified

340
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:35,318
in wax and pollen samples from honeybees

341
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:39,159
so if we if we put it

342
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:42,559
out they're picking it up okay so what

343
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:45,078
are those um there's a lot there were

344
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,278
very few samples that didn't have

345
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:50,599
anything in

346
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:54,360
them and of the 121 different ones here

347
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:57,120
is a list of some of the categories you

348
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,600
you see some very familiar pesticides

349
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,600
there very

350
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:07,399
s% that's a good question um I'm not

351
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:09,799
100% sure what percentage but um we can

352
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,799
find that

353
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:14,838
out oh yes I'm sorry she asked what

354
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,240
percentage of the samples did not have

355
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:20,399
any detections it says very few but I

356
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,879
don't have that actual percentage okay

357
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,120
we have systemics out there that are are

358
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:27,000
getting into pollen into nectar and

359
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,519
they're getting them the pollinators are

360
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,278
getting them that way and per pollen

361
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:36,679
sample each one had an average of six

362
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:40,519
different pesticides um so it's it's

363
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:43,078
really it was very eye openening for our

364
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:45,600
researchers um to see

365
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:48,278
this what is your

366
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,839
s oh of the of the

367
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:53,039
entire I don't know how many samples

368
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:55,680
they looked at again the center for

369
00:16:53,039 --> 00:17:00,480
pollinator research we can get that from

370
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,479
them how many samples they sampled

371
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:12,720
yeah oh per well whether whether they

372
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,240
were yeah whether they were looking at

373
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,759
pollen and wax they were looking at them

374
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,279
both together

375
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:22,439
yeah the pesticides

376
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:25,599
toed and

377
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:30,360
wax would be applied have been applied

378
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:33,439
to the plant prior to

379
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:37,519
presence of the PO there in other words

380
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,519
perhaps PRI even

381
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,079
theen for the

382
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:52,360
systemics yeah and yeah um really good

383
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,360
go ahead

384
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
words

385
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,399
right would would be present

386
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:09,000
right it's a very a very good question

387
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:13,159
and I apologize I don't have all of

388
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,119
those answers um but Maryann Frasier who

389
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:19,480
was our researcher at Penn State that

390
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:22,038
did this um she has since retired but

391
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,319
these this is all available at Penn

392
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:26,879
State and if you guys want that I can

393
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:29,558
try to get I can try to get more of the

394
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:34,840
total study for you so you'd have an

395
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:34,839
idea of what all the parameters were

396
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:45,520
okay okay that sounds good

397
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,080
okay the other thing I just wanted to

398
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:50,400
bring to your attention is um there are

399
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:53,480
different there are different modes of

400
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,960
action of these pesticides um with the

401
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:59,759
pollinators lethal means well carburo is

402
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,600
a good example seven you spray it they

403
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:05,599
die so that's lethal they immediately

404
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:09,079
die but there are sublethal effects as

405
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:12,038
well so of the four that are listed here

406
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:15,798
reduced immune function reduced lifespan

407
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:17,599
impaired foraging Behavior rep reduced

408
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:20,480
reproduction which one do you think

409
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:24,199
would be a sublethal

410
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,240
effect all of them you're right um and

411
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,080
this is a difficult thing to study but

412
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,279
there are many many studies out there on

413
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,319
this

414
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:34,319
and so often times when they're exposed

415
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:36,879
to these pesticides you don't get an

416
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:39,558
outright kill but they are impaired in

417
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,159
such a way that the colony eventually

418
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:46,038
you know is affected or the individuals

419
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:48,799
may die okay so all of the

420
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:52,558
above um just a quick word about neonix

421
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:55,558
and again I'm I my ex my expertise is in

422
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:58,558
the plants not so much in the pesticides

423
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:59,639
um but they have found sublethal effects

424
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:04,119
from the

425
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:06,520
neony and impaired foraging behavior um

426
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:08,678
you know the decreased

427
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:10,759
reproduction and so the the

428
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:12,880
recommendation that is coming out is

429
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:14,960
don't use neonx

430
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,280
prophylactically and if you're growing a

431
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,440
lot of the plants that we're going to be

432
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:21,200
talking about in a few minutes there's

433
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:26,480
no need to be using anything in them

434
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:28,558
because these plants are tough and um so

435
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,038
wherever you can especially with Ator

436
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,639
plants try to stay away from from any

437
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:34,720
kind of

438
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,480
systemic they also discovered that

439
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,120
fungicides play a role here which really

440
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,519
complicates things especially for the

441
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:45,558
orchard folks um and the fungicides can

442
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:47,918
actually synergize with some of the

443
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:52,279
insecticides particularly the three

444
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:54,000
listed here and become stronger we also

445
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:56,399
don't know what the inert ingredients of

446
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
the pesticides do and there are some

447
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,440
researchers looking at that what is in

448
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,839
those inner ingredients we need to find

449
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,919
that out and how can they affect

450
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:11,639
pollinators so with the pesticides it's

451
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:15,080
complicated it's very complicated um

452
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,720
herbicides play a role too in that by

453
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:19,558
spraying our roadsides or median strips

454
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:23,960
you know we killing off a lot of our

455
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:27,278
floral resources reducing habitat in our

456
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:30,240
Lawns um violets are a good early season

457
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:31,440
source of nectar for bees host plant for

458
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,759
the frary

459
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,679
butterfly Clover which used to be a

460
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:39,119
Mainstay in our Lawns back you know my

461
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:43,278
grandfather always seeded Clover into

462
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:45,798
his lawn um but today in this generation

463
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:48,599
Clover is a weed we've kind of made it

464
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:52,679
that way but Clover is a wonderful

465
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:55,558
source for for bees um you know so the

466
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:58,360
herbicides can can do some damage to us

467
00:21:55,558 --> 00:22:00,558
too so just in general these are some of

468
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:04,038
the recommendations that the center came

469
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:06,960
out with for protecting pollinators um

470
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:09,200
from pesticides you know know know what

471
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,278
you're using know how toxic it is

472
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,200
sometimes sometimes that's not so easy

473
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:17,159
because what's toxic to a honeybee might

474
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,919
not be toxic to a bumblebee vice versa

475
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:22,080
um it's it's complicated um but never

476
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,840
use pesticides on blooming

477
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:28,199
crops and then pre- Bloom don't use the

478
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:32,038
systemics because some of these can link

479
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,038
ER in the plant for a long

480
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:38,278
time so that's bad news but there's good

481
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:41,679
news and at this International

482
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:44,599
Conference this last uh this last month

483
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:49,240
the one theme that came through of so

484
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:52,119
many of the papers was that even in the

485
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,960
presence of diseases and in the presence

486
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:56,199
of

487
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,840
pesticides if these pollinators were

488
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,600
wellfed if they had good good

489
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:04,839
nutrition they could fight off some of

490
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:07,158
this some of these effects and it's no

491
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:09,240
different from us you know if we're run

492
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:13,278
down we don't have a good diet we don't

493
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:15,839
have a diverse diet yeah we're we we can

494
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:19,519
easily get pick pick up a cold pick up a

495
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:23,918
flu uh pick up anything and they're no

496
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:26,278
different and so we can really make a

497
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:29,278
difference even in the face of the other

498
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:32,640
things they're facing by giving them a

499
00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:35,640
diverse diet by giving them what they

500
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,640
really need um the best possible nectar

501
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:42,840
the best possible pollen we can dilute

502
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,960
some of these these compounds um and

503
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:47,720
dilute the effects of some of the

504
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,840
diseases so to me I kind of came away

505
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:54,000
from the from that conference feeling

506
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:57,558
like yes what we do and how the green

507
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,200
industry responds to this really can

508
00:23:57,558 --> 00:24:01,960
make a huge

509
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,679
difference the other good news is the

510
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,919
gardeners that I talk to are

511
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:10,400
aware they you know they're kind of tied

512
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:13,240
into this and those new gardeners that

513
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,480
Carol was talking about they want their

514
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,839
kids they want their kids to be tied in

515
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,759
they know that we have some

516
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:23,240
environmental problems going on here and

517
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,798
they're anxious for the kids to learn

518
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,919
and what a wonderful learning

519
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:30,960
opportunity that could be paired with

520
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,720
you know with our our garden centers um

521
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,840
because these guys are hungry and

522
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,960
providing food is also a very feel-good

523
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:42,199
thing for all of

524
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:45,200
us it can also be

525
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:48,000
lucrative um Michigan State just did a

526
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,480
study of on this was

527
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,679
actually on the labeling of plants

528
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:57,200
treated with

529
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:59,840
pesticides and the study found that

530
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,919
plants that were labeled be friendly as

531
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:06,639
being grown in a bee friendly way were

532
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:09,000
much preferred by the consumers so

533
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,360
people are responding to this they want

534
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,038
to

535
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:17,719
help they also found out that people are

536
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:20,759
willing to pay a little more for a plant

537
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:24,519
that was grown in a beef friendly way

538
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:28,720
fact up to a dollar more so there's an

539
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:31,720
opportunity there as well

540
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,278
and I'm I'm assuming because of how

541
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:37,240
consumers are reacting that they would

542
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:39,440
react the same way to not just plants

543
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:43,839
that were grown in a pollinator friendly

544
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:46,320
way but growing plants that are truly

545
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:49,278
really nutritious and good for

546
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:51,839
pollinators um I think the labeling of

547
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:53,640
these plants would would definitely be

548
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:56,480
helpful and there's all kinds of things

549
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,000
you could do in a garden center to you

550
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,038
know to make that

551
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,200
attractive um but the big question is

552
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:07,558
what are the best pollinator plants and

553
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,278
we are still trying to answer that

554
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:12,839
question um we're getting

555
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:14,960
closer we know that some of our modern

556
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:17,079
hybrids that are being developed

557
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,840
especially in the annual world and they

558
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:25,918
being developed for color or size or um

559
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:29,119
you know just appeal may or may not have

560
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,320
poer nectar um sometimes the nectaries

561
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:34,119
are bred out of the plant so the pollen

562
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:37,079
is bred out of it sometimes the plant

563
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:39,398
can become so complicated in structure

564
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:43,199
that the pollinator has no idea how to

565
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:46,839
get to the pollen that's there um if you

566
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:50,120
look at our Aro native plants they are

567
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:52,158
they have been they've been co-evolved

568
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:53,959
to actually attract pollinators mean

569
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,000
some have I I show you some here some

570
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,360
have guidelines I mean some are just

571
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,319
saying hey guys you pollinators may not

572
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:04,199
be too smart here this is where you come

573
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:06,439
and a plant like this it's a little

574
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,200
confusing um

575
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,880
so down at our Penn State research

576
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,000
station um near where I live in

577
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,278
Landisville where we have our flower

578
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,440
trials the center for pollinator

579
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:21,798
research has set up a row for pollinator

580
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,278
insect study and they've taken some of

581
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:28,278
the most common SE good sellers at

582
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:30,640
Garden Centers and the uh researchers

583
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:33,319
from the center are coming down and

584
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,200
evaluating them for po pollinator

585
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:37,720
visitation which I'm really glad they're

586
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,440
doing this because we need to know and

587
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,038
it's it's not nothing wrong with having

588
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,600
a plant in your garden that doesn't

589
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:46,200
attract pollinators but we also need to

590
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:47,798
be including plants that do attract

591
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:52,080
pollinators we need to know what they

592
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:54,720
are um we do know from our studies that

593
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:57,240
most native perennials are good

594
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,399
pollinator plants yeah Car checking

595
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:02,159
question are you doing uh like existing

596
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:05,839
varieties that are at garden centers in

597
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:08,720
this test that's kind of what they chose

598
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:11,038
um you know when availability was part

599
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,839
of was part of the issue too when when

600
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:17,359
they did that but um and as they go

601
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:20,000
forward they're going to Target you know

602
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,839
specific plants a little bit more and

603
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,519
and try to see what what are the best

604
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:27,879
sellers out there what are people buying

605
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:29,720
and how can we label these things um

606
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,039
most native perennial plants we know are

607
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,839
good for pollinators because they

608
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:34,879
co-evolve together without their

609
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:38,240
pollinators these plants wouldn't have

610
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:41,799
made it through but when we change them

611
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,399
and we we create cautivar from them what

612
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:48,398
happens on the left is a straight

613
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:51,319
species of of eonia or cone flower um

614
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:54,759
and boy you know pollinator Heaven on

615
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:56,759
the right is another one in our trials

616
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:58,319
and I haven't spent much time over there

617
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:01,240
looking but the few times that I've been

618
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:03,918
over I haven't seen any pollinators on

619
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,038
that guy and it's because we've we've

620
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,840
changed

621
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:11,200
it is is anything still there these are

622
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:13,678
things we need to find

623
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,038
out Mount Cuba is doing some great

624
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,840
studies down at the University of um

625
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:21,440
with with the University of

626
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:24,199
Delaware and uh Dr Delaney and one of

627
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,840
her grad students Zen Cass have been

628
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,840
looking at monardas in

629
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:31,678
copsis and trying to determine which

630
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:33,918
ones of these are attracting pollinators

631
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,919
they're even looking at the nectar

632
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,399
they're analyzing the nectar you know

633
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,519
what does it have does it have the

634
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:41,719
proteins and the lipids does it have

635
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:43,880
what pollinators really need and they're

636
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,000
looking at a lot of cultivars so if you

637
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,519
ever get down there um it's a really

638
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,119
neat place to visit and they do have

639
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:53,440
some reports out they were also just

640
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:55,398
looking at the plants themselves no

641
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,000
which ones are the most attractive which

642
00:29:55,398 --> 00:30:01,119
ones hold up the best so this pollinator

643
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,278
study is now a little addition to all of

644
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:07,199
this and these reports are online U this

645
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:09,759
is their coreopsis report um Owen should

646
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:15,038
be putting his Monarda um report out

647
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:17,798
pretty soon okay and then lastly um we

648
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:21,038
did a a trial study at our research

649
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:24,359
station 2012 to

650
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:26,519
2014 where we looked at 84 different

651
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:29,000
species of native plants and they're

652
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:33,399
cultivars and these were replicated in

653
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,720
5x5 plots three times um and we had

654
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:38,319
Master Gardeners helping us with this as

655
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,480
well as as well as our

656
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:42,398
researchers so before I go into the

657
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,960
results of that study which is what your

658
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:47,278
handout is all about um for those of you

659
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,798
that are

660
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:52,558
landscapers just wanted to mention a few

661
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:54,398
things um about how we can make some

662
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:55,480
changes in our Landscaping to help out

663
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:58,518
the

664
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,839
pollinators here are three

665
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:05,278
properties very different in size the

666
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:07,480
one on the top is about 35 Acres um got

667
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:10,440
Meadow um it's all been landscaped in

668
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:13,000
native plants done professionally done

669
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,200
and even the pool area I mean this is a

670
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,720
wonderful floral resource for

671
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,558
pollinators but down on the bottom left

672
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:23,440
is a small garden in the city of York

673
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:26,720
postage stamp size but look what she's

674
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:29,600
done um she has put a lot of wonderful

675
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,919
Floral resources in there um still has a

676
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:36,000
little bit of lawn but she has Beauty

677
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:38,200
year round well three seasons um and

678
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,480
then on the right this is a nursing home

679
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:45,000
also in New York County where they have

680
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:48,720
taken grass and they've turned it into a

681
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,558
therapeutic place for their um their

682
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,079
residents a place of beauty a place

683
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:55,319
alive with pollinators that the

684
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:58,119
residents are lining up to get into this

685
00:31:55,319 --> 00:32:00,439
nursing home because they want to be

686
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:04,199
able to look out on this this wonderful

687
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:06,960
Courtyard so Size Doesn't Matter every

688
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:10,080
space that we have can be

689
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:13,639
utilized but what all three of these

690
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:17,240
places had in have in common is they

691
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:19,959
have put Plants closer together we have

692
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,558
plants touching each other uh reduced

693
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:26,120
use of mulch and landscape fabric

694
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:27,879
because the nesting they can't nest with

695
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:32,798
landscape fabric

696
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:35,480
um and so by by packing in our plants

697
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:38,918
letting them touch letting them be a

698
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:42,720
little bit more natural um weed-free

699
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:45,240
there's no space there for weeds to grow

700
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,000
um so that's a really big help as well

701
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,720
there's still maintenance obviously but

702
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,519
it's a different different kind of

703
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,639
Maintenance so think about

704
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,720
that in really large areas landscape

705
00:32:54,638 --> 00:33:00,638
plugs can be very helpful yeah in the

706
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,639
previous Slide

707
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:06,519
whated the landscap fabric

708
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:15,879
and a

709
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:18,079
negative um couple things one is if if

710
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:21,799
you're PL spacing plants you know 2

711
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:24,199
three feet apart have a need for mulch

712
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:25,679
you don't have many floral resources you

713
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,519
have weeds you're going to have weeds

714
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,639
growing down through that that mulch

715
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:33,919
nesting sites become limited because

716
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:35,558
bees can't the ground nesters can't

717
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,480
can't go down through the mulch or the

718
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:41,319
landscape fabric yeah so and it's also a

719
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,159
costs saver um I talked to a group that

720
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:45,638
said they had spent

721
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:48,720
$15,000 for their homeowners association

722
00:33:45,638 --> 00:33:49,959
on March last year and I'm thinking but

723
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,440
they were wondering how they could get

724
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:56,120
more flowers and I said well you know

725
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,600
take that $15,000 and maybe maybe move

726
00:33:56,119 --> 00:34:00,000
it over so so yeah uh those two things

727
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:03,119
are kind of a negative when we're

728
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,440
talking about about pollinators this is

729
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:08,039
actually the front of my house

730
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,838
um so landscape plugs are a really

731
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:12,599
costeffective way to do this if you're

732
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:14,878
Landscaping they can be a dollar a piece

733
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:16,639
there are native plant wholesalers that

734
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:19,519
are growing these guys they're

735
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:23,079
struggling to keep up because there's a

736
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:27,119
demand so anybody looking for a niche

737
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:30,320
market um maybe might be a place to go

738
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,760
these plugs can also be purchased and

739
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,280
potted up into quartz and sold at Garden

740
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:38,280
Centers so there is a source for these

741
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,800
plants um there're also seed sources out

742
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,919
there a lot of people are collecting

743
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,359
local

744
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:46,598
eloyes and also when you're placing

745
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:49,598
these diversity is really key I told you

746
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:53,519
that plants um pollinators and their

747
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:56,079
plants are closely related look at this

748
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,519
penamon I mean this penin isn't letting

749
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,640
anything to chance

750
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:02,519
here's a landing pad for the

751
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:06,279
Bumblebee guidelines hey guys that's the

752
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:08,320
way to go right um and each of these

753
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,440
plants is going to attract a different

754
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,200
kind of pollinator because they all have

755
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:16,679
different Siz tongues and um different

756
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:19,039
needs so diversity is

757
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:21,358
great planting we're trying to get

758
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:23,320
people to planting groups and drifts

759
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:26,119
because one single plant isn't going to

760
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,320
help a pollinator too much and you know

761
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:30,160
they'll see them Mass much better and

762
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,599
have plants to move

763
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:36,000
between succession of Bloom plants from

764
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:38,838
Spring through fall there are different

765
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,039
kinds of bees emerging in March and the

766
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:44,119
whole way through the season until the

767
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:47,199
first really hard Frost they all need

768
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:49,079
food so picking a succession of Bloom it

769
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:51,759
also means hey we're getting more plants

770
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:53,440
out there we're selling more plants um

771
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,800
we're we're enjoying more plants we're

772
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,159
seeing more color in the

773
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:03,440
landscape so here are the results of the

774
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:06,078
84 species that we did you have the full

775
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,800
results on your on your papers I'm only

776
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,640
going to touch on a few of these plants

777
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:13,160
for the sake of

778
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:15,440
time in general we discovered that

779
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:19,799
plants with large compound

780
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:22,400
inflorescences of tiny flowers attracted

781
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,760
more different kinds of pollinators than

782
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,160
other flowers this is where we got our

783
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:31,880
diversity so think swamp milked over

784
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:33,838
here on the left um bone set in the

785
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:37,160
middle which is one of the

786
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:39,559
eupatorium The Joe pies there are many

787
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:41,838
many flowers out there that have these

788
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:45,078
kind of flower heads they're not the

789
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:47,519
only thing you should plant but you know

790
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:49,960
if you're trying to to get a plant to a

791
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:53,079
new Gardener see biggest bang for their

792
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:55,199
Buck these are the way to

793
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:59,000
go and then I'm going to start with our

794
00:36:55,199 --> 00:37:01,118
number one winner right off the top pnan

795
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,920
muticum the clustered mountain men is

796
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,880
anybody growing this you are okay lots

797
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:10,240
of

798
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:14,240
pollinators yeah yeah apple mint Apple

799
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:18,759
mint the mint family in general um the

800
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:21,919
mint family the asra family um are both

801
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:24,599
huge families for pollinators and this

802
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,358
is a native mint but yes other mints you

803
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:29,039
know will will do well too if you let

804
00:37:26,358 --> 00:37:31,559
them flower and this clustered Mountain

805
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:35,440
Min was was a plant that we felt could

806
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:39,000
be a gorgeous plant for the garden um as

807
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:42,240
well as valuable for pollinators smells

808
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,440
wonderful we had 21 different kinds of

809
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:49,519
pollinators visited from butterflies to

810
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:52,519
flies to beetles to to bees to wasps um

811
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:54,880
it seemed as though if you you could

812
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:57,519
tell where it was in the child plot

813
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,800
because there was this

814
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:03,880
over the top of it and I actually had

815
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:05,519
one educator come visit our plot and we

816
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,559
we talked about the plot before we went

817
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:11,519
in he told me later if you hadn't told

818
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:14,078
me that that was a good thing I would

819
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,800
have made a big birth around that plant

820
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:19,240
he said because there was so much stuff

821
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,960
on it but but he said now I know it's

822
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:22,559
it's a good thing it's a good thing so

823
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,079
we need some education

824
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:28,119
too um it only grows about 3 to four

825
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:31,480
feet tall does like some soil moisture

826
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:33,119
it's not not a plant for real dry soils

827
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,358
it had an advantage over the other

828
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:38,039
plants because it bloomed for 10 weeks

829
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:41,078
and so you know we were counting

830
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:43,000
pollinators for a lot longer one of the

831
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:45,160
best juices I've seen for this plant was

832
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,559
at Irvine Nature Center this is a

833
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:50,838
parking lot divider the only downside to

834
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:53,000
having that was when people were getting

835
00:38:50,838 --> 00:38:55,559
in their cars with their

836
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,559
purchases they no they would get they

837
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:59,719
would get their cameras out and they'd

838
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:01,759
be taking pictures of buck guys and all

839
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:04,679
kinds of you take them 20 minutes to get

840
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,079
out of the parking lot and I have to say

841
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:09,440
in the three years well five years now

842
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:11,400
that Master Gardeners about 20 of them

843
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:15,119
have been working in this trial plot

844
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:17,760
there's been not a single sting these

845
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,200
guys are too busy only the females can

846
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,000
sting of the wasp and the bees because

847
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:25,679
it's the osor that's the Stinger the

848
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,280
males can't sting guess who has time on

849
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:30,358
their hands

850
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,000
the males the females are doing all the

851
00:39:30,358 --> 00:39:33,559
work they've they they've got to get the

852
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,800
nectar they have a short period of time

853
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:37,480
they've got to get the Palm they've got

854
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,800
to feed the kids they could care less

855
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:42,480
about you the males are kind of hanging

856
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:46,480
around and being a little aggressive um

857
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:49,480
but they can't hurt you okay golden rods

858
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:53,039
I would like to I okay on time five

859
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:55,000
minutes okay I would love to see anybody

860
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:57,079
here growing golden

861
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,400
rods yes

862
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:01,400
not

863
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,920
wild golden rods are an extremely

864
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:06,440
important plant it really tied for

865
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,800
number one with that mountain mint this

866
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:12,079
is this is stiff Golden Rod butterflies

867
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:15,119
loved it we're doing a project with the

868
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:18,280
xeri society right now to find out what

869
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:21,960
nectar plants the Monarch is using on

870
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:23,920
its trk from Canada to Mexico and

871
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,480
they're strongly suspecting that Golden

872
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:30,920
Rod has historically always been in one

873
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:33,400
of the fuels to help them get down to

874
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:36,200
their wintering grounds um so they're

875
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,838
extremely important and we had so many

876
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:41,879
butterflies on this plant it really

877
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:44,880
stands up very tall and will withstand

878
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:48,240
some some medium to dry soils it's

879
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,838
blooming as we speak um and just

880
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:53,039
attracts so many different pollinators

881
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:56,119
would be great for back of the

882
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:59,039
Border it does seat around after 5 years

883
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:01,800
where were learning which plants stayed

884
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:04,480
in place and which ones didn't um and in

885
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:07,440
some places seaing around would be great

886
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:10,240
in the case of of a homeowner they might

887
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,559
not like it so much so hey got another

888
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:16,118
Golden Rod for you fireworks this one

889
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:18,880
just kind of grows out from a Center

890
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:21,079
patch and forms a larger patch easy to

891
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,880
take care of you divide it and you can

892
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:27,640
keep it in check it all the golden rods

893
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:30,039
were very good for pollinators

894
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:32,519
and I would love to dispel the fact that

895
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:34,800
people think that Golden Rod is is an

896
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:37,358
allergen I hear that all the time it's

897
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,079
insect pollinated pollen's heavy it does

898
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:42,880
not get carried by wind insects move it

899
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:45,000
it is not an allergen Ragweed is the is

900
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:48,119
the the corpit and when I went to

901
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,599
England last fall I saw more Golden Rod

902
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:53,318
and garden over there than I ever see

903
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:54,880
here they have a love affair with it

904
00:41:53,318 --> 00:41:57,159
they shouldn't because it's become

905
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,680
invasive for them um because they don't

906
00:41:57,159 --> 00:42:01,039
have you know they don't have the

907
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:04,358
ecosystem built around it but this is

908
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:06,759
Shakespeare's birthplace I mean just

909
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:10,159
amazing use of Golden Rod they love it

910
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:12,800
they're selling it back to us by the

911
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:14,879
way and here's their award another

912
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,119
wonderful wonderful pollinator plant

913
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,880
attracted a lot of those those uh

914
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:22,760
parasitoids or the brown marmorated

915
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:26,680
stink bug very easy to grow plant likes

916
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:29,119
likes dry soil and full sun none of

917
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:31,199
these native plants ever need fertilizer

918
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,240
ever in fact fertilizer is

919
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:36,558
counterproductive to them they are

920
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:40,239
adapted for nutrient po

921
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:42,480
soils the jie I can't say enough about

922
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:45,239
these and they all of them were

923
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,719
wonderful plants even all the cultivars

924
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:51,719
all the straight species did very very

925
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:54,480
well I singled out dubium because it was

926
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:56,879
our number one plant for attracting

927
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,079
butterflies we over three years we had

928
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,960
17 different butterflies and Skippers on

929
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:03,960
it it was the last one to bloom it's

930
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:06,960
actually it is actually a plant of the

931
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:08,760
coastal plane it's the shortest shortest

932
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,559
of all the Joe pies which is always

933
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:15,839
popular with homeowners um like all the

934
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:19,960
ji's average to moist soil and it is

935
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:22,599
just beginning to bloom now okay swamp

936
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:25,760
milked if you have a garden center

937
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:27,039
milkweeds are so popular at our plant

938
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,680
sale

939
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:31,119
um at our office we we can hardly get

940
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:32,838
them The Growers are having trouble

941
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:35,318
keeping them in stock because everybody

942
00:43:32,838 --> 00:43:38,078
knows about the Monarch and everybody

943
00:43:35,318 --> 00:43:40,719
wants to help even common milked is

944
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:44,440
flying off the shelves um the swamp

945
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:46,679
milked is a great plant for all kinds of

946
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,358
pollinators including a good nectar

947
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:53,039
plant for the Monarch and they love to

948
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:55,440
lay their eggs on this plant um so but

949
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:58,358
it does need moist soil um there are

950
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,400
other milked s that can be grown that

951
00:43:58,358 --> 00:44:01,598
need other other conditions it's a

952
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,838
milked for

953
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:08,119
everybody rattlesnake Master pretty cool

954
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:10,920
Plant um this is an is anybody growing

955
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:12,680
this one I know this one this was a bit

956
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,240
of a surprise to us I was a little

957
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:17,719
surprised to see how good it was as a

958
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:20,879
pollinator plant but all those tiny

959
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:23,759
little flowers um were attracting a lot

960
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:27,000
of different uh diversity and it's a

961
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:30,640
very cool Plant the kids love

962
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,400
it and I was interested to see that at

963
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:35,598
the new formal Garden by The Mansion at

964
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:38,358
Mount cubba Center they have

965
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:42,519
Incorporated rattlesnake Master into

966
00:44:38,358 --> 00:44:44,400
their Garden as a structural element so

967
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:46,759
it's really very

968
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,760
cool and then a few comparisons do we

969
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:51,280
have time for this or do sure okay um

970
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,040
there a lot of comparisons and you have

971
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,519
the cultivar sheet there for for all of

972
00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:58,800
them here are just a few examples

973
00:44:56,519 --> 00:45:02,599
we looked at the straight species of

974
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:05,880
menarda filosa against CLA

975
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:06,920
Grace and what we discovered is that the

976
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,760
straight

977
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:13,280
species was very much preferred don't

978
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:15,960
know what it is about CLA Grace that the

979
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,359
butterflies or the the bees didn't um

980
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:20,400
didn't prefer it but and maybe it was

981
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:24,598
just just the fact that we had so much

982
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:26,920
food available okay but this this you'll

983
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:29,720
see on your sheets is a terrific plant

984
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:33,240
for pollinators six different kinds of

985
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:35,078
bumblebees on here hummingbird moths and

986
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:37,519
you plant it with other plants so that

987
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:39,599
if it does get pwy mildew you don't

988
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:42,679
notice it you put it with its

989
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:45,280
friends here's another cultivar

990
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:48,440
comparison between the aromatic asers

991
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:51,519
three different kinds and in this case

992
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:54,559
you'll see that the ca of our October

993
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:56,719
Skies was preferred we were we were

994
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:59,240
surprised to see that

995
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:00,959
um but it it actually did better and

996
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:04,000
it's a shorter

997
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:06,880
variety um than the straight species and

998
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,239
did not seem to seed around very much um

999
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,000
which was kind of a plus to and then we

1000
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:15,519
looked at copsis um three different

1001
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:18,400
types of copsis including the straight

1002
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:21,759
species and after three years

1003
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:25,160
Zagreb had done better possibly because

1004
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:28,520
it was it was had had more flowers on it

1005
00:46:25,159 --> 00:46:32,039
than the straight species um but what

1006
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:34,599
was interesting we're 5 years into this

1007
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:36,358
we're not counting cators on these

1008
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:39,359
plants any longer but the plants are

1009
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:42,400
still in the in the trial and after five

1010
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:44,838
years Zagreb is starting to fade under

1011
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,318
the weed pressure at the farm because we

1012
00:46:44,838 --> 00:46:48,920
can you know I only have 20 Master

1013
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:51,358
Gardeners and trying to get all these

1014
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:53,920
weeds out of there is interesting so

1015
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:56,480
we've kind of left Moon Bean go it it

1016
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:59,159
just isn't it's still there but it

1017
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:02,079
doesn't have the Vigor Zagreb is fading

1018
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:04,719
a little bit but the straight species we

1019
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:06,720
don't have to do much to so it's it's

1020
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:09,519
just interesting watching what happens

1021
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:12,159
over time with these plants and I wanted

1022
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:15,519
to give a shout out to this particular

1023
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:17,838
plant um Monarda Peters fancy fuchsia

1024
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:20,119
we're not 100% sure of the parentage of

1025
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:24,318
this plant if somebody knows I I'd like

1026
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:27,880
to know what it is um but in our trials

1027
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:31,480
it was a favorite of bumblebees and they

1028
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:33,920
would hang on to it to the very last you

1029
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:36,599
know last flower till it just about was

1030
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,720
ready to fall off and in our trials has

1031
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:41,240
really held up under all this weed

1032
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:44,039
pressure so I just feel it's a really

1033
00:47:41,239 --> 00:47:45,838
good Garden plant the other thing that

1034
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:48,279
came out of this trial is a phology

1035
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:51,719
chart we kept track of the bloom for a

1036
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:55,319
couple of years um this is not in your

1037
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:57,679
handout or on the website but if you

1038
00:47:55,318 --> 00:48:00,838
wanted I can send it to you it's you

1039
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:03,159
know it prints large because it's 84

1040
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:05,440
different species but it's a really

1041
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:07,519
handy thing to have if you want to to

1042
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,200
think about planting that succession of

1043
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:12,199
Bloom and there were really I mean all

1044
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:15,358
the pl all the plants in our plot did

1045
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:17,719
pretty well if you want to see the full

1046
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:20,078
report you can go to the Center for

1047
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:22,719
pollinator research website just Google

1048
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:24,880
it go to the pollinator Garden

1049
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:27,558
certification this is a Master Gardener

1050
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:30,280
program and under step one provide food

1051
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:33,119
for pollinators there will be a link to

1052
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:35,079
bees bugs and blooms and I have a card

1053
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,079
up here with the website on it if if

1054
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:40,400
you're

1055
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:42,760
interested okay so hopefully together I

1056
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,920
mean what it's this is a feel-good thing

1057
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,160
because getting plants out there and and

1058
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,480
getting plants in the hands of people

1059
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:50,759
and kids is great wow helping

1060
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,960
pollinators at the same time is even

1061
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:56,850
better so you know collectively I think

1062
00:48:53,960 --> 00:49:02,170
we can make a real difference thank

1063
00:48:56,849 --> 00:49:02,170
