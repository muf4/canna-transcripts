1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:07,378
University

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,019
so so I I got a special treat that you

4
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:12,660
can call bonus content right bonus

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,839
content uh for the show if you want to

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,300
uh edit this out you you feel free to do

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,000
so but since we've got uh Brother Rich

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,140
here I I we have to start out with his

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,679
insight

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,800
uh on on this momentous occasion about

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,719
to take place at Cornell University uh

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,679
for those of you watching on NewsChannel

13
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:37,259
10 I'm showing the logo from the 1977

14
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:39,238
concert with the Grateful Dead that was

15
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:42,238
held here that is considered by

16
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:46,199
aficionados to be among their most

17
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:47,218
finest performances and Rich you talked

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,160
about

19
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:53,280
um how them practicing with little feet

20
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,439
uh in advance it is for a while uh got

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,539
them good and tight something they

22
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,759
weren't usually but I guess most people

23
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,100
in attendance didn't notice the

24
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,319
difference so was there just a lot of a

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,500
lot of fewer Stone people here at

26
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,419
Cornell or or they were really good I I

27
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,340
well the dead was really good and and

28
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,500
there's an argument among deadheads

29
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,439
whether Cornell is the best show ever or

30
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,379
not but it was certainly through a

31
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:21,719
period 1977 might be one of the best

32
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:24,420
years you know it depends on your taste

33
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:27,478
as in Dead music but that they were

34
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,000
tight and they had a good repertoire and

35
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:32,280
they they were uh as good as they can

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,319
get put it that way and and like you

37
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,879
know it might not just be the Cornell

38
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:41,219
show all of spring 77 even up into uh uh

39
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,719

40
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:45,239
September

41
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,219
um uh they they were great and and uh

42
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,259
there's a lot of uh you know you can

43
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:52,379

services down there at Rutgers

53
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:16,620
University and I'll just start it out

54
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:19,139
for those of you watching not listening

55

Johnny Paquette uh down at Indian Hills

57
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:26,280
on Long Island just a beautiful property

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,840
that Johnny takes a lot of pride in and

59
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,659
love when superintendents have good

60
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,939
pictures and Carl you know good BMP in

61
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:35,340
the morning is a check your irrigation

62
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:36,959
system and oh this head's sticking on

63
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,939
there and this superintendent said well

64
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,979
you know wonder why it's sticking on you

65
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:43,378
look close you can see there's a big old

66
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:45,539
rock in there uh blocking the road or

67
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:47,878
preventing it from spinning so you know

68
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:49,679
a reminder to get out there and check

69
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:51,598
those heads don't just turn them on

70
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,860
assuming they're working get out there

71
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,139
because we're going to talk more about

72
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,000
that now just uh you know what we used

73
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:59,639
to do back in the kova days is remind

74
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,979
everybody uh you know as we get going

75
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:04,679
there's other people who rely on us many

76
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:06,598
times and and also good to take some

77
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,719
time and go see a live show every once

78
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:12,479
in a while right Rich maybe 175 of them

79
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:15,300
in in a good year right at least every

80
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:18,060
two weeks it's necessary all right good

81
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,980
so okay now looking at the weather Carl

82
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,539
here's what I can tell you it's been

83
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:23,818
warmer than normal you know you didn't

84
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:26,039
need a HD to find that out it was 20

85
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:28,500
degrees above normal in the Metro New

86
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,658
York area and more so than that up in

87
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,459
the Rochester area you know you get out

88
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:34,318
into Western New York even in the

89
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:37,019
Adirondacks you're talking in that about

90
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,878
20 degrees above normal now for those of

91
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:40,140
you that use the forecast website now

92
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,840
you might not have noticed this but

93
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:44,878
we've got this timeline above all of our

94
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,158
Maps now that maybe you haven't seen it

95
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,199
sometimes we have it there for pests a

96
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:52,560
lot uh here is you know what it was like

97
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:54,959
you can see last week it was 11 14 and

98
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,719
14 degrees up above normal here in the

99
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,819
Ithaca area right and it's telling me

100
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:02,759
that the next bunch of days you can tell

101
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:05,098
are going to get a little bit cooler or

102
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:07,318
a little bit closer to normal right as

103
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:10,679
as we look at temperature departure

104
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:12,719
moving forward so most are about 10 to

105
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,659
21 days ahead of normal when you look at

106
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:18,839
Growing Degree Days the accumulated heat

107
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:20,819
uh over the LA from March 15th when we

108
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,839
try to say this is when it's happening

109
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:24,240
now there might have been some

110
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,638
accumulation at the end of February this

111
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,519
past year but for right now everybody

112
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,040
the ma the data saying the season is

113
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,019
ahead of normal now there's other things

114
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,819
that are signs of that the peak annual

115
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:38,159
bluegrass seed head flush is now

116
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:40,319
probably prominent in the metropolitan

117
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,000
New York area and South so you're going

118
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,459
to find out pretty quick how your seed

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,740
head program worked this year as the

120
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:49,799
seed heads start to come on and any

121
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:53,220
stress particularly drought will enhance

122
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,079
and amplify the seed head uh bursts that

123
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,840
you get as typical in with annual

124
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:59,639
Bluegrass so most have been dry so we're

125
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,399
setting up a little on the dry side here

126
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,439
quarter inch except Rich did you get a

127
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,299
bunch of rain last week it looks like

128
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:08,459
some of these areas got three to four

129
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,379
inches you didn't get that I didn't I

130
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:13,739
didn't see three or four inches I mean

131
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:16,199
it rained but not like that so yeah that

132
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:20,160
is some heavy rain in in Northern and

133
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,780
central western New Jersey now in the

134
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,060
last month right you look at the cumin

135
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:26,399
relative effect to about where a little

136
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,519
bit before was short of where we are now

137
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,038
there's a dry gradient in the west and

138
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:34,079
the Northwest from Buffalo Rochester the

139
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:36,659
northern part of New York really on the

140
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:39,120
Wet Side 150 to 200 percent of normal

141
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,520
and then as you get to the southeast

142
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,160
around towards Long Island the Delmarva

143
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:46,139
down where you are rich it's been dry

144
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,900
for the last month now things may be

145
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:51,300
picking up ET is certainly uh picking up

146
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:53,038
but the drought Monitor and this is the

147
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,379
one from last week we're waiting for the

148
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,060
new one for this week it comes out on

149
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:58,620
Thursday before all of this comes

150
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,500
together but we're starting to get

151
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:05,459
measurable dry weather in the Delmarva

152
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:08,360
into Philly Harrisburg PA Southern

153
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:10,978
Jersey Hudson Valley Orange County

154
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,660
across Southeastern Connecticut all the

155
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:14,099
way over to Rhode Island so you know

156
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,380
we're starting to set up to be pretty

157
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,000
dry and it you know it's sort of not

158
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:19,680
getting a signal one way or the other

159
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,839
how much rain we're going to get we got

160
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,879
a forecast from art this morning in

161
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,978
indicating maybe about an inch an inch

162
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:28,199
and a half of rain potentially passing

163
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:29,758
through almost all of it expected on

164
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:33,139
Sunday this week

165
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:36,060
dry soils means warmer soils and as we

166
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:38,340
start our conversation with Rich today

167
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:41,519
we'll start with thinking okay first off

168
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:43,258
one of our early signals for pathogen

169
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,719
control and the kinds of pathogens that

170
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:47,400
we want to talk about today Rich are are

171
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,039
these soil temperatures building right

172
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:52,799
as the soil temperature builds the

173
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:55,620
microbial activity in the soil begins to

174
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,400
increase and some of those microbes like

175
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,680
to feed on plant roots now here's some

176
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:04,679
data from your colleague at NC State Lee

177
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,918
Butler Lee puts out on his website every

178
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,860
year his samples uh stuff when he gets

179
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:15,478
them right and he looked at his 14-year

180
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:17,759
average compared to 2022 and his data

181
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:19,139
indicates on his bent Poe submissions

182
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,780
and he gets them from all over the

183
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,660
country like you do and his bent Poe

184
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:28,379
submissions last year

185
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:30,120
his Peak was lower and later than last

186
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:32,699
year and I brought this up because in

187
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,978
our casual conversation I think this has

188
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:37,680
been pretty consistent with what your

189
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:41,279
season was like last year you had fewer

190
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,259
samples uh and they were later now the

191
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,779
conversation that I'm gonna pass it to

192
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:48,360
Carl to talk about is the summer patch

193
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:50,339
and the root pathogen conversation uh

194
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,580
moving forward but how about this Rich

195
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:57,060
would this characterize your diagnostic

196
00:07:53,579 --> 00:08:00,240
sample submissions they were lower and

197
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:03,660
words was the peak later last year it

198
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:07,019
well for us we were definitely lower I

199
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:10,500
was uh down about 30 percent

200
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:14,698
um from from the year before and we were

201
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:17,879
in a Range that was close to the to the

202
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:22,259
level from 30 years ago I mean that's

203
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:24,000
how that's how few we had and ours we

204
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:27,660
had a weird pattern

205
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,839
um where it was wet early in and so we

206
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:33,000
peaked early and then we trailed off as

207
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:35,399
it dried out in in our area in the

208
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,379
Northeast and and I always think that uh

209
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,778
you know it's easier to add water when

210
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:42,000
it's droughty than it is to take it away

211
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:44,099
when it's wet and and we were kind of

212
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,200
wet May June and then we dried out and

213
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:48,360
it and it was that's how it was

214
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,720
reflected in the sample submission

215
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,700
perfect okay so as we call Venture end

216
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,700
and I pass it to you brother this is a

217
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,160
picture that Todd Lowe uh he used to be

218
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,800
with the USGA in Florida now he's with

219
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:04,199
end view or I'm gonna get in trouble I

220
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:06,899
don't one of the companies down there uh

221
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:10,140
he's still working in Florida this was a

222
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:11,820
Bermuda grass tea that these sections

223
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:15,838
were phrase mode

224
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:19,080
for Springs to plant somewhere else

225
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,959
and the large patch which I think is a

226
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:25,200
soil-borne pathogen is it rich large

227
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:28,319
patch it's a rhizoctoney it's you know a

228
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,000
famous or brown patch you know okay but

229
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,060
it's coming out of the soil but it's a

230
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,399
foliar patch yeah I mean it it survives

231
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:38,099
well in the soil and uh it makes

232
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:43,259
corrosia and but the diseases of foliar

233
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:46,019
disease yeah so only in the foliage that

234
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:49,439
got phrase mode did they see it so

235
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:51,299
really uh fascinating uh phenomenon and

236
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,880
teaches us how little we know about this

237
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,979
so Carl let me let you put talk about

238
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:57,720
this wonderful little rant you put

239
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,420
together it's really going to set up

240
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,820
rich for a lively conversation on root

241
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:03,899
pathogens today go ahead girl yeah so so

242
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,640
this is something I've heard you guys

243
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:08,039
talk about for a while Frank these root

244
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:10,740
pathogens and maybe being more of a

245
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:12,120
concern up here uh as the climate is

246
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,339
sort of changing and I've heard you guys

247
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,200
talk about this idea of you know so War

248
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:17,940
of Attrition and when we think about

249
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,680
Roots right we've got to sort of build

250
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,200
this massive Roots early in the year

251
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,778
because whether it's root pathogens

252
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,940
whether it's uh heat or drought you know

253
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:29,039
nematodes or something they're gonna get

254
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,140
uh eaten away over the course of the

255
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,240
summer right so this idea that you have

256
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:35,039
to build a solid root system early on

257
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,560
and that's going to help you get through

258
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,639
some of these pathogens even if you're

259
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:40,199
you're good or not so good at

260
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,939
controlling them with the drenches and

261
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,980
stuff like that so I decided to take a

262
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,060
look okay when is sort of the ideal root

263
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,100
growth when it comes to soil

264
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:49,859
temperatures uh you can get some stuff

265
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,778
from James Beard here in 2001. he's got

266
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,180
a cool little three-pager turf grass

267
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:55,740
root Basics and he says that the optimum

268
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:58,319
group growth temperatures for for our

269
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,419
cool season grasses are right around 50

270
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,980
to 65 degrees Fahrenheit Frank you just

271
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:03,899
showed soil temperatures in the region

272
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,060
the southern parts of our region are

273
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:07,980
getting right into their low 50s now mid

274
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:09,838
50s so we're creeping it to that Ideal

275
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,360
Time To Build The Roots right to build

276
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,339
for that war of attrition once we get to

277
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,440
80 degrees ish soil temperatures that's

278
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:18,120
when uh you know James Beard says Hey

279
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,100
critical root loss that's when we're

280
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,320
going to start to lose from sort of

281
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,879
abiotic stresses then you look at the

282
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,740
disease cycle and say okay when are the

283
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:28,259
disease is coming on well they start to

284
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:31,320
in fact at 19 to 20 degrees Celsius

285
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:33,778
that's made the upper 60s right after

286
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,760
our optimal group growth and they Peak

287
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:38,578
fungal growth Peaks at 28 degrees see

288
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,919
that's low 80s so right is the the root

289
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:42,778
growth is slowing the path engines are

290
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:44,939
coming on so so James Beard had this

291
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:46,919
little slide here he sort of Drew a

292
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,500
little line of Ideal root growth

293
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:51,240
activity and then I drew a red line uh

294
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,740
that's sort of the summer patch pathogen

295
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,079
that's when it's coming on and you see

296
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,000
for those watching that's peaking right

297
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:58,559
when root growth is waning right so this

298
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,078
idea of War of Attrition we got to build

299
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:03,539
those roots early on right now what can

300
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:05,099
we do to do that uh you can do you could

301
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:06,838
do it with nitrogen you got to find that

302
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,339
sort of a nice balance of not too much

303
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,380
not too little you can do it with

304
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:12,120
perfect but I think from a lot of

305
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:13,799
superintendents I've talked to build

306
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,419
good root systems it starts with

307
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,699
irrigation right we talk with Rick

308
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:20,278
Slattery a lot he helped us build this

309
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,200
panel in our sustainable golf handbook

310
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:24,480
that we just released right QR codes on

311
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,100
the screen there a little stress goes a

312
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,379
long way and we have these little icons

313
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,000
up here that indicate hey do this in the

314
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:31,620
shoulders of the season right when that

315
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,078
root growth is Optimum right whether

316
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,339
it's in the spring or the fall

317
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:36,838
intentionally allowing some moisture

318
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,279
stress right let's see where that

319
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,500
wilting point is early in the year

320
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:41,939
because hey it's the springtime it's not

321
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,639
going to get away from you quick right

322
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:47,100
even if we get these you plus 10 plus 12

323
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,480
Degree Days Frank takes a long time to

324
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,860
get to that maximum temperature during

325
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,959
the day we don't have all that day

326
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,300
length we've got cooler nighttime temps

327
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:55,859
to sort of buffer that so explore where

328
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:57,539
that wilting point is early in the year

329
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,639
let it dry down that's going to help

330
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:01,740
push your roots deep right so we make

331
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,839
this sort of analogy to athletes where

332
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,879
uh you've got you got to stress the the

333
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,860
turf a little bit to build that

334
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:09,778
resiliency to build that that root

335
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,759
system and we talk about deepen and

336
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:14,639
frequent irrigation right so deeper

337
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,078
Cycles wetting the soil down six inches

338
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,360
a little bit past where the roots are

339
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,219
maybe even eight inches there's data on

340
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,560
this from Peter noden uh Jim and food

341
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,360
did this down in Maryland right and for

342
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,838
those who can see there's uh deep and

343
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,399
infrequent uh irrigation how how many uh

344
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,680
basically root surface area there is

345
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,360
compared to light and frequent and in

346
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,338
all these root Zone depths there's more

347
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,500
Roots uh in the deep and infrequent

348
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:38,760
approach so that's what I think of what

349
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,740
I've heard from superintendents who

350
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:42,539
build those solid root systems get them

351
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,639
through the year right that's where it

352
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:46,620
starts to sort of give you some leeway

353
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,419
for for these root pathogens

354
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,740
stress in the turf a little bit let it

355
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:51,120
dry down and then those deep and

356
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,459
infrequent Cycles are going to help you

357
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,740
build those roots right now uh to get

358
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:59,219
you through the summer this is brilliant

359
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,959
Carl absolutely brilliant to this

360
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,060
particular chart here when you're

361
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,939
looking at this thing so rich Let's

362
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:08,879
Start here this is great

363
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:11,160
um is this when you start to get samples

364
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,659
right because we've talked about this in

365
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:13,259
the past

366
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:16,799
um

367
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:20,220
does a little stress in the summer help

368
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:22,259
or her uh a little stress in the spring

369
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,620
sorry in the spring does a little stress

370
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:29,578
in the spring stress or or does it help

371
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,899
or hurt I think it you're gonna it's

372
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:32,219
clear it's going to help you a little

373
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:35,278
bit right

374
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:37,680
um you know prepping for the summer

375
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,600
um you know it

376
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:42,000
that's if you have good plants and you

377
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,639
have good roots you know I was looking

378
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,860
at a sample yesterday and I'm like this

379
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,560
is summer patch but I shouldn't see any

380
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:52,560
dead grass here but the root system was

381
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:54,479
already so troubling that I don't think

382
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,399
this this particular superintendent is

383
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,000
going to have grass by the time it gets

384
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,799
to mid-summer you know and and so so uh

385
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,458
I I don't know how you recover if you're

386
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:07,620
already in trouble now right so so uh so

387
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:10,138
so again I think if you have healthy

388
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,179
grass and you can stress it and you know

389
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:14,399
clearly from the data that's a good

390
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:16,559
thing but if you don't you're in trouble

391
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,078
so yeah Frank that's a good question too

392
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,659
there's stress there's uh mowing stress

393
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:23,698
we're not saying hey go and Mo and mo at

394
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:24,838
100 and roll every day we're saying

395
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:27,240
stressing from the irrigation

396
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,620
perspective and Rick and Rich was just

397
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,299
saying hey last year when the spring was

398
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,679
wet when we had all that moisture in the

399
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:33,599
system when it's tough to take it out

400
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,219
okay that's when we start to see samples

401
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,259
but if you get a dry spring it's

402
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,240
interesting you know maybe we get fewer

403
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:41,299
samples in and because we're sort of

404
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,980
building that deep root system through

405
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:46,740
uh basically drought stress through

406
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,240
moisture stress not through the hammer

407
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,100
in it getting it down to height low

408
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,600
Heights and rolling right so there's a

409
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,778
distinction there I think that's

410
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:58,680
important I agree 100 and I and I think

411
00:15:54,778 --> 00:16:01,980
to to me it begs the question that you

412
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:05,578
know you're going to get feeding uh on

413
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:07,620
these roots does more Roots help or hurt

414
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:10,379
right the theory is have a more it's the

415
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:13,500
war of attrition but The Season's really

416
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:16,198
long too so let's talk about this Rich

417
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:19,019
we're getting longer periods of

418
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:21,240
infection I think Carl's Wright having a

419
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:24,480
deeper root system is there but we'll

420
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:27,299
that's not gonna just completely prevent

421
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,659
this so let's start to take this apart a

422
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:33,059
little bit from a control perspective

423
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:35,399
would you recommend instead of spraying

424
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:37,859
fungicides out of the gate on this as

425
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:40,620
well as you should start using ammonium

426
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:43,560
sulfate acidifying fertilizers in your

427
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:46,320
nutrient program is that a good first

428
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:49,859
line of defense let's assume you got

429
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,839
plants that will grow roots because you

430
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,639
know let's assume you don't have plants

431
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,820
that that stress that Carl's talking

432
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:58,919
about sets them up for anthracnose so

433
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:02,100
let's leave that aside let's leave that

434
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:05,338
aside you'll get anthracnose early if

435
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:08,099
you put on too much stress right yes and

436
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:10,379
we have seen that already you have seen

437
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:13,798
that already I have anthracnose samples

438
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:16,280
this week already so okay so early

439
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:19,500
season anthracnose is a fascinating

440
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:21,838
phenomenon right yeah it is because of

441
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,298
what we've learned about this let's I'm

442
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,938
going to stop here let's take go off uh

443
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:30,058
what do you think that's about too much

444
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:32,100
stress too dry what is going on this sir

445
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:34,500
yeah I think I think there's two things

446
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:36,959
going on one I think they had it going

447
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,000
into the winter I'm not a I'm not a

448
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,038
proponent of really really early season

449
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,720
new infections I think the soil

450
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:46,379
temperatures have to be a little higher

451
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,860
that and that low temperature threshold

452
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:52,500
for disease activity is not real well uh

453
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:56,459
uh defined but I think it's somewhere in

454
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:58,319
the 55-65 range you know so so I think

455
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,419
this the samples are coming with the

456
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:02,700
anthracnose over the winter but it's

457
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:04,500
really dry you know we we talked about

458
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,720
how we're starting to see the dry we're

459
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,400
above average temperature and it's

460
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,558
public golf courses that are getting

461
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,720
play all winter and you know you got 80

462
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,759
degree days you got 200 guys out there

463
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,380
hitting the balls and so they have to

464
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:19,440
mow there's getting traffic and there's

465
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:22,140
a lot of stress already in the system so

466
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,840
okay so that's what's a good qualifier

467
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:27,660
Carl in our case here that to really

468
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:30,859
call out moisture stress

469
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:34,380
on healthy plants

470
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:36,599
that didn't start the spring behind the

471
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,299
eight ball like Rick rich is talking

472
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:41,819
about here with with early season

473
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:45,298
anthracnose because of traffic stress

474
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:48,720
mechanical stress drought stress maybe

475
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:50,819
just cold weather and no growth stress

476
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,319
right I mean you're beating these things

477
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:54,058
up getting them ready right they're

478
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:57,659
getting traffic rich but they're not

479
00:18:54,058 --> 00:19:00,480
growing so let's get it well it's 80

480
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:03,419
degrees one day and it's 55 the next you

481
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,099
know so so you know we're growing for a

482
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:07,440
couple days and we're not growing for a

483
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:12,298
week so so you know but guys are still

484
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,820
golfing right so so so okay you when it

485
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:16,619
dried out

486
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:19,798
wouldn't you have thought last year you

487
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:21,538
would have saw more summer patch well we

488
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:24,058
did and and that's an interesting thing

489
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:27,960
because we were wet in the period of

490
00:19:24,058 --> 00:19:30,538
time in the spring when the pathogen was

491
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,220
starting to grow right and and moisture

492
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:35,160
you know I saw the slide from Eric

493
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,980
Nelson Eric always said that water is

494
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,500
the on and off switch and temperature is

495
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:45,240
the throttle right so if it's if we have

496
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:47,579
wet soils between the 62 the 62 to 80

497
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,839
degree range for soil temperatures

498
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:51,178
you're going to get more pathogen

499
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:54,240
activity and then you come to the summer

500
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:56,519
and you dry out and and you you're

501
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,558
getting that external stress on plants

502
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:00,240
that have a lot of that are carrying a

503
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:03,000
lot of pathogen then you're going to get

504
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,880
more disease and last year summer patch

505
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,740
was our number one prop it you know as a

506
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,580
diagnostic output

507
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:13,798
okay so back back on the summer patch

508
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:16,859
control train uh let's start with

509
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:20,038
ammonium sulfate do you like it as an

510
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:22,199
early season fertilizer yes I I just

511
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:24,538
just be careful not to push too much

512
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,400
growth right you know because you're

513
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:28,640
going to get top growth over root growth

514
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,798
or you know uh back to the the

515
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,020
agronomist side of it but but you know

516
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:36,779
the acidifying to the five and a half

517
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:39,418
range and ammonium sulfate seems like

518
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:42,058
one of the best choices for that

519
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:43,559
um is is a great tool it you know if

520
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:46,019
you're looking at three inch tall

521
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:48,298
Kentucky bluegrass it's almost all you

522
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:50,639
need to do you know

523
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:52,379
all right so okay so now we're coming

524
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,080
into the time with soil temperatures

525
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:58,080
based on the model that's in the Rutgers

526
00:20:55,079 --> 00:21:00,178
diagnostic uh the the contempt the thing

527
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,519
from Kentucky that everybody's

528
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:04,620
contributed to that has efficacy and the

529
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:08,220
different products in it uh we're coming

530
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:11,459
to a two inch step mid-afternoon at

531
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:13,740
least 65 degrees C for five to six 65

532
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:17,759
degrees Fahrenheit for five to six days

533
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:22,798
so we're coming to that window Rich that

534
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:24,538
window is what Peak growth or what go

535
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:26,400
ahead that's that's when it's finally

536
00:21:24,538 --> 00:21:29,400
warm enough to turn the fungus on and

537
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,740
get it to grow right so so you know the

538
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,538
the temperature ranges you know they do

539
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,798
them in a lab they grow grow at all

540
00:21:33,538 --> 00:21:37,859
different temperatures see how fast it

541
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:39,779
grows yeah you know 65 to 82. you're

542
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:42,479
you're in that window where the throttle

543
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:45,960
is down yeah okay

544
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:48,240
so so here's what here's my question is

545
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,819
it because I got a lot of notes in the

546
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,200
last few days people like it looks like

547
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:54,538
it's warming up

548
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,919
is it summer past time I'm looking at

549
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:58,500
the soils I'm like I don't think the

550
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:02,220
soils are going yet for summer patch

551
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:04,740
yeah so is it okay to be early rather

552
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,700
than late with timing let's start with

553
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:10,380
timing on these things

554
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:13,259
how much protection do you get for how

555
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:15,539
long if you had to guess I I well first

556
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:17,759
of all you're not going to get control

557
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:19,859
of a pathogen unless it's growing and it

558
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,200
can it take up the material interact

559
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:24,479
with the material and that goes back to

560
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,819
Dr Latin you know in his textbooks and

561
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,558
stuff so timing matters like there's no

562
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:30,538
reason to put it out

563
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,879
you know before the fungus is starting

564
00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:34,319
to grow which is why we have the

565
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,000
recommendations for the soil

566
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,279
temperatures because we know that's when

567
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,960
it's going to start to grow so

568
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:42,000
proceeding as close as you can to that

569
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,519
time period I think you're going to give

570
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,298
it the biggest dose you know and have

571
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:51,058
that effect okay so getting it down and

572
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:53,460
getting it in is going to take a bit of

573
00:22:51,058 --> 00:22:54,960
time right we talk a lot about the

574
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,120
amount of water we did it with Mike

575
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,100
fedonza last week on the fairy ring

576
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,739
conversation I'm I'm starting to beat

577
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:04,439
this horse dead now uh that you got to

578
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:07,019
get enough water on it are you the the

579
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:10,200
fungus only interacts with the product

580
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:13,259
when it's starting to infect the root or

581
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:16,019
is the drench designed to really impact

582
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:19,079
the fungus in the soil and all the way

583
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:21,900
through that that is a great question I

584
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:24,599
I'm I'm gonna punt that one and I I

585
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:27,179
think it would have some effect you know

586
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:31,199
like a contact you know would have some

587
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:33,298
effect but I think that you know uh you

588
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,840
know and these materials are like fungal

589
00:23:33,298 --> 00:23:39,720
growth regulators so having a steady

590
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:41,819
Source uh in the plant you know will

591
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,980
prevent it from invading the plant right

592
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:46,019
and so uh because we still see the

593
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,058
fungus even in in plants that are

594
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:50,038
healthy that are getting treated so it's

595
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:52,619
not like it's it's killing the fungus

596
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:54,839
and eradicating the pathogen just stops

597
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:58,259
it from growing for a little while you

598
00:23:54,839 --> 00:24:00,720
know so Carl's point about the war of

599
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:04,140
attrition is well taken if it is

600
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,419
basically just you use a fungicide let's

601
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:09,059
say you get it at the right time you've

602
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:11,280
stunted it let's hope Roots can keep

603
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:14,339
growing or you've got enough because

604
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,500
once it's infected early on it's just

605
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:19,740
going to keep making its way into that

606
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:22,200
root system right deeper and deeper or

607
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,519
because at some point we used to tell

608
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,200
people you don't have to treat anymore

609
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,139
the darn thing is not going to keep

610
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,720
growing right but now it's like are you

611
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:33,000
saying guys have to drench every two to

612
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,980
three weeks the whole year now because

613
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,980
of the way this thing might infect and

614
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:40,019
grow I think I think well one the fungus

615
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:43,259
doesn't disappear right so when the

616
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:45,058
protection wanes then then it's that

617
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:47,158
battle how much root system do we have

618
00:24:45,058 --> 00:24:49,798
can we keep the plants alive

619
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:52,559
and and so so because you know I've seen

620
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:54,839
guys on fungicide programs for 20 years

621
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:57,178
and the superintendent retires the new

622
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:59,399
guy doesn't know and it and it and it's

623
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:03,659
a storm of problems until they kind of

624
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:06,538
catch back up right and so so uh uh yeah

625
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:08,760
I I you have to have regular drenches to

626
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:13,859
keep that fungus you know whatever you

627
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:16,440
can do like soil PH or or manganese you

628
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:19,678
know uh uh uh additions to the fertility

629
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:22,679
program or fungicides to keep that

630
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:25,380
fungus from growing anymore than it has

631
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:26,820
to then you can you can start to win you

632
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,460
know that's the battle keep the roots

633
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:31,200
growing from an agronomic standpoint and

634
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,480
try to suppress the fungus as much as

635
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,700
you can and if you can get that balance

636
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,640
you get through the season

637
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,440
okay so listen since you brought up the

638
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,900
fungicide thing we're here now we got

639
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,179
about five more minutes let's talk a

640
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,100
little bit about a problem that seemed

641
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:48,840
to come up in a conversation with our

642
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:51,658
State Park Golf Course superintendents

643
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:54,778
there's like Frank we gotta use you know

644
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:57,419
you telling us you know rotate you're

645
00:25:54,778 --> 00:25:59,940
telling us uh you know use different

646
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:01,559
things uh we're gonna have more summer

647
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,980
patch problems

648
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:06,720
um I use a lot of Combos and Rich you

649
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,940
look at this thing which people can't

650
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,400
see or aren't watching us on NewsChannel

651
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:14,340
10 here that is a lot of 11 and threes

652
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,980
here there's a lot of 11 Track codes and

653
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:20,099
eleven a lot of Threes And I bet a lot

654
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:22,620
of guys are not always using it is this

655
00:26:20,099 --> 00:26:24,058
am I should I be worried about this this

656
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:25,678
seemed like something I wasn't paying

657
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:27,960
attention to until the superintendent

658
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,720
asked me now there are singular active

659
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,460
ingredients like a firm oh that's for

660
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,259
Fairy ring wait oh I didn't I got the

661
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,759
wrong one here's the fun this is the

662
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:38,460
thing off Wisconsin

663
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:40,500
yeah it's the same thing uh I put in a

664
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:43,200
summer patch and it gave me sevens and

665
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:45,720
elevens uh threes and elevens almost all

666
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,720
threes and elevens yeah on the mode of

667
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,940
action rating how do what do you tell

668
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,220
guys when they use this is this

669
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,140
something we need to be mindful of or

670
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,058
just get the darn thing controlled it's

671
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,880
not going to get resistant with Summer

672
00:26:57,058 --> 00:27:02,038
pass we we've never had a a situation

673
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:06,000
where we could confirm that there was a

674
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:08,519
resistance problem okay right so so I I

675
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,759
but I will caution you if you're using a

676
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:15,658
lot of uh DMI materials that dollar spot

677
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:18,419
is an issue right so so so again I I

678
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:20,940
think that you can use the you use the

679
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:24,659
materials you know but I would

680
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:27,360
definitely you know a couple of dmis and

681
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:29,700
a couple of strobies and you're good we

682
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:32,339
also know that thiophaneate methyl is a

683
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,440
pretty darn good summer patch control so

684
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:36,538
that's something you could rotate in

685
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,940
even with the restrictions that we see

686
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:41,278
coming down the pike on on how much you

687
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:43,980
can use you know a shot of that

688
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,659
is a good dollar spot control too and

689
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,640
that might you know help you use a

690
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:50,520
little bit less DMI

691
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,919
okay there you go so no confirmed

692
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:55,679
resistance of Summer patch organisms to

693
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:57,778
any facade program them so that's

694
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,480
interesting to hear the dollar spot

695
00:27:57,778 --> 00:28:02,579
thing is uh odd because you know you put

696
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,400
a DMI on and you've got to water it in

697
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:07,379
uh for summer patch but a dollar spot

698
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,600
what product you leave on the surface so

699
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:12,900
if you're using it for summer patch

700
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:14,459
water it in because that's likely to

701
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,038
help a little bit with dollar spot

702
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:19,740
resistance so you're saying we'll have

703
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:22,919
enough thiophanate methyl even with the

704
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:25,259
restrictions to get good control I think

705
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:26,820
I think so I mean you know how how many

706
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:29,960
times you're going to use it maybe once

707
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:29,960
maybe twice

708
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:36,179
the only other disease where we really

709
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:38,278
like it is gray leaf spot you know and

710
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:40,140
and so you know you save it for a gray

711
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:42,000
leaf spot app in the fall and maybe you

712
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:44,400
do one for summer patch in the spring

713
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,460
and you're probably still under the

714
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:50,460
under the threshold for use

715
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:52,740
okay last thing here is the early season

716
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:54,179
dollar spot we got a buzz about this you

717
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,058
brought it up just thank you for doing

718
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:58,679
that the dmis we use also create dollar

719
00:28:57,058 --> 00:29:00,778
spot issues

720
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:02,460
um I remember this was tested a number

721
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:05,759
of times and it looked like things like

722
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:08,100
ipra Dion and vinclasolin might have had

723
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:10,319
some benefits those products are not

724
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:14,099
widely used nor available as much as

725
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:16,859
they used to be do you like this as a

726
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:19,439
early season program uh I know you're

727
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:21,298
not a fan of early season stuff I would

728
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,058
imagine this isn't something you

729
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:26,038
necessarily support that it works either

730
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:28,319
moving forward and lowering your dollar

731
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:30,960
spot risk as you get into the season

732
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:34,859
right right so so if you know if you're

733
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,840
going to use a DMI for summer patch and

734
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:38,759
you hit in the 65 soil temperatures you

735
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:43,319
know we've had that on our turf grass

736
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:46,079
Farm around mid-may mid May 15th you

737
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:47,879
know that's about the same time if if we

738
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,558
if I think back to all my times spent

739
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,640
with James hemphilling on the on the

740
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:54,119
farm

741
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,460
um he would say 15 March or May 15th May

742
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:59,759
20th that's about when Dollar spot

743
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:02,519
always starts for us right so you know

744
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:04,500
if you have so your first shot of banner

745
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:07,079
or you know broken is all for summer

746
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,700
patch is is right in line with your

747
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:11,939
dollar spot program

748
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:14,038
right you know just you know but with

749
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:17,100
dollar spot just there's more pressure

750
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:19,140
to mix it up right and so you're gonna

751
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:21,839
come back in a couple of weeks with with

752
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:24,538
uh you know uh uh you know one of the

753
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:28,558
sdhi materials or something right right

754
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:30,898
okay you know it'll work all right Carl

755
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:32,579
we weren't lying and we got bonus

756
00:30:30,898 --> 00:30:34,979
content at the beginning of this thing

757
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:37,740
uh any burning questions otherwise we'll

758
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:39,058
get rich out of here I I think we nailed

759
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:41,099
it right on the head Frank I've got I've

760
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:42,839
got a whole list of notes I just made

761
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:44,759
people can't see this but I just make

762
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:46,558
notes I learn stuff going through this

763
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:49,200
so I got a whole page of notes that I've

764
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:51,418
got now from your conversation I was

765
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,298
writing down notes about irrigation and

766
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:56,100
Roots at the beginning too so even even

767
00:30:54,298 --> 00:30:58,440
we learn stuff from this Frank it's it's

768
00:30:56,099 --> 00:31:00,719
learning opportunity for us too and at

769
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,240
any time we're talking I I'm trying to

770
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,759
absorb something so it's all good hey

771
