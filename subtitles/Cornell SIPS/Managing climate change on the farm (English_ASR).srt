1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,800
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:04,799
university

3
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,879
we've been very lucky on fishkill farms

4
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,519
not to

5
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:21,198
have any severe effects from the big

6
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,920
storms of

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,920
last year

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,920
but our neighbors have certainly had a

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,000
lot of trouble across the river in

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,719
ulster county there was uh tremendous

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,719
damage and it's not only from

12
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,640
the irene uh

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:43,359
storm and the hurricanes it was also

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,039
there have been wind and hail events

15
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:48,159
throughout the last couple of years that

16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:51,519
have periodically caused

17
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:54,319
and the october snowstorm um knocked

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,920
over a lot of trees as well so and broke

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,840
a lot of branches

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,800
so yes there have been quite a few

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,760
events

22
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,000
um

23
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,640
that are quite severe and we're seeing

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,879
you know big swings on the

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,400
the rainfall side as well between

26
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:11,438
drought and

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,840
prolonged periods of of uh extreme

28
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,599
uh extremely heavy rainfall

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,400
i think as an orchard we're very well

30
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:21,919
vulnerable we have

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,960
our our whole livelihood is on the line

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,640
as a

33
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,438
as a fruit farm

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,439
we

35
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:32,399
have a lot of crop that is dependent on

36
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:34,798
the blossom occurring at the right time

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,159
pollination

38
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,040
not having

39
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,439
severe hail events during the

40
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,920
growth of the fruit crop and then

41
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:43,919
finally

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,320
not there not being too much wind

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,439
during the final harvest pre-harvest

44
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,599
period

45
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,000
so that the crop remains on the trees

46
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,438
until it's ripe so yes there's a

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,040
tremendous risk

48
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,039
throughout and that's not to mention

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,640
diseases and all the other

50
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:10,239
downsides we've been lucky with the

51
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,479
vegetable crop for the reason that we

52
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,759
produce multiple successions of the same

53
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:17,039
crop so

54
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:19,280
um we're marketing in the

55
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,199
farmers markets and locally here on the

56
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,439
farm and

57
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,039
planting you know every two weeks

58
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,479
there's a there's a new crop going in

59
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,079
the ground

60
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,159
that means that we're spreading our risk

61
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,599
quite dramatically

62
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:36,719
we also have some other

63
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:39,439
bed shaping and soil working

64
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,439
techniques that seem to avoid

65
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,719
us getting into a situation where we

66
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,000
can't

67
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,759
get into the

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
land and produce a crop

69
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:51,039
so far

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,159
we we are gradually planning to deal

71
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,840
with uh erratic weather events um the

72
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:56,560
biggest thing that we've done so far is

73
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,640
to

74
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,479
put in an irrigation system

75
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,878
they will

76
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,399
you can see around here

77
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,000
the

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,519
drip lines that are laid on the ground

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,519
with the small trees

80
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,280
we actually succeeded last year in

81
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,239
putting in

82
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,878
a

83
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,120
system that has the potential to

84
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:21,199
irrigate the entire farm

85
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,080
once we have all the blocks

86
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:26,959
hooked up to it and and the drip tape

87
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,440
laid down in the orchard we're also

88
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,759
gradually putting in a trellis system

89
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,680
that will help

90
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,439
support the small trees we're going to a

91
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,280
more dense

92
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,959
format for the orchard

93
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,959
we have

94
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,360
diversified water sources for our

95
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,759
irrigation

96
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,920
for the same reason that we have so much

97
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:51,840
rainfall variability

98
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:53,439
so we do draw from a small creek we have

99
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,439
several ponds

100
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,519
and

101
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,840
and a couple of wells and

102
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,039
in addition to the irrigation

103
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,200
using

104
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,438
this is now more effects the the

105
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:08,639
greenhouse the vegetable operation but

106
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:08,639
we're using greenhouses

107
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,360
to

108
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,599
balance for example with the tomatoes

109
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,400
rather than having

110
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,918
our entire tomato crop out in the field

111
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,198
we're putting a portion of it in a

112
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,358
greenhouse

113
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,520
to balance that

114
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,758
and then for the first time

115
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,719
this coming year we will

116
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,680
grow some small fruit

117
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,400
in

118
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,240
a high tunnel so high tunnel looks a lot

119
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,918
like a greenhouse

120
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,519
it's not heated this is the difference

121
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,120
it's not heated

122
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,079
and it's really

123
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,519
a

124
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,918
three season

125
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,959
or even two season but really a three

126
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:49,359
season uh cover to regulate

127
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,719
uh number one temperature variation and

128
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,520
number two

129
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,160
uh

130
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:57,039
water or rainfall

131
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,960
so that we can

132
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,280
make sure that the crop for example with

133
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,959
small fruit and cherries is a good

134
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,399
example

135
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,279
regulate

136
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,879
the

137
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,879
water the amount of water that the crop

138
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:12,240
gets and prevent

139
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,279
um in so doing prevent

140
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,038
the

141
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,918
fungus problems that one would

142
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:19,279
ordinarily have with those with those

143
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,680
cherries

144
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:24,319
so from a from a farming point of view i

145
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,000
think the most valuable information we

146
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:29,199
could get from cornell

147
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,560
is uh on varieties that will be adapted

148
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,000
for the next

149
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,360
20 years

150
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
of you know climatic variations

151
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,439
that would be best adapted as we're

152
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,639
planting new

153
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:45,839
blocks out every every season

154
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,120
an issue that is perhaps most critical

155
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,000
in the whole

156
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,439
issue of adapting to climate change and

157
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,680
that is

158
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:56,240
management and it's not just

159
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,680
what the choices of what you plant and

160
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,319
how you farm it's also

161
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,160
improving management strategies

162
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,879
and and

163
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,400
keeping a closer control on everything

164
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:13,680
that you do on the farm record keeping

165
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:15,839
being very precise apartments

166
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,478
activities

167
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,478
i think that

168
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,080
certainly our

169
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,600
our focus is how we can manage

170
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:29,038
with what we have

171
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,759
we we're producing a crop a variety of

172
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,279
crops for a fabulous market in new york

173
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,639
city there are lots of people who need

174
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,439
to eat

175
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,079
and

176
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,120
and we're lucky with our location

177
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,918
so

178
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,639
what we're interested in doing is

179
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:46,399
is adapting to whatever comes our way

180
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,439
and making sure we can manage through

181
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,879
that

182
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:54,639
we don't feel like as one

183
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:56,639
farm operation we can necessarily

184
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,560
influence the

185
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,160
the climate change itself we'd rather

186
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,879
manage

187
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,080
the effects that we're feeling

188
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,719
yeah

189
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,639
so on the question of

190
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,520
of whether

191
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,879
climate change is uh

192
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:17,519
caused by

193
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:18,319
human influence human activity or not

194
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,918
we

195
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,160
feel like it's

196
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:23,519
that's not a concern that we are going

197
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,000
to

198
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,318
address here on the farm we are very

199
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,399
much more interested in addressing the

200
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,039
effects of the climate change and

201
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:35,758
what we can do to

202
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:35,759
to deal with it

203
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:47,000
this has been a production of cornell
