1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,960
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,960
university

3
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:16,320
so um just to start i want to orient you

4
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:19,358
a little bit about where i'm from this

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,600
is washington state in the middle there

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,920
washington is a pretty diverse place

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,160
it's not just green rainy seattle

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,679
this is a landscape

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,600
shaped by volcanoes glaciers and ice age

10
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,479
floods so it's really a pretty

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,079
interesting place to drive around and

12
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,679
get out if you like to do that kind of

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,558
thing

14
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,159
this is

15
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,759
where we are in the middle here in

16
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:46,078
wenatchee

17
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:49,839
we're about halfway roughly between

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:53,198
seattle and spokane

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,320
yakima the tri-cities hood river below

20
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:59,119
us are kind of the other major centers

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,359
of the fruit industry in washington

22
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,959
state and then portland is down a little

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,400
bit closer to hood river there on the

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,400
bottom

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,159
so the the

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,320
primary areas where tree fruit are

27
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,640
produced in washington are pretty close

28
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:15,758
to the columbia river

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,239
in this area this shaded area roughly

30
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,560
and so some of these areas are up the

31
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,959
river valleys and

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,079
all of this all of the tree fruit in

33
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:28,959
washington is irrigated and so the

34
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:33,118
location of where these orchards are is

35
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:33,118
really because of access to water

36
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:39,118
ag is a big part of of washington's

37
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,840
economy particularly eastern washington

38
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:46,078
the gray counties here are the the top

39
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,759
10 as it were this is um i think 19 2010

40
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,438
data from the washington department of

41
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,319
agriculture

42
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:55,438
and and apples for probably 10 15 years

43
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,599
have been the largest value farm gate

44
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,758
value within the state

45
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,679
they passed wheat and and continued to

46
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,920
increase

47
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,200
a little bit small print up on the left

48
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,640
there but

49
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,199
one thing i want to point out here is

50
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,639
that of the about eight billion dollars

51
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:15,280
in farm gate in 2010 about half of that

52
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:18,159
is horticulture crops within the state

53
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,439
it's not just fruit

54
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,759
fruit

55
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,520
nursery greenhouse

56
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,239
there's there's a quite a diverse

57
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,400
industry there's there's bulb production

58
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,319
up in whatcom and skagit counties as

59
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,480
well

60
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:35,919
but we're going to talk about apples

61
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:38,318
today this this is the wenatchee valley

62
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:39,919
this picture actually i got from januk

63
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,119
lee who some of you

64
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:45,119
know

65
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,360
and wenatchee on the the um

66
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,640
this side of the river east went at you

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,239
on this side

68
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,399
this is the columbia going through town

69
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,719
this is a springtime photo you see the

70
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,959
lupine and the arrowroot balsam root

71
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,919
blooming here everything's really nice

72
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,959
and green

73
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,919
pretty spectacular time of year for us

74
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,199
but

75
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,878
as the summer goes on it's it's

76
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,318
basically a desert

77
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,079
where we live

78
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:13,439
and which which has some really big

79
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,040
advantages for growing fruit because the

80
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,280
humidities are low

81
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:19,679
there is access to water for irrigation

82
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,759
and so there's there's really low

83
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,840
disease pressure relative to a lot of

84
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,439
other places that grow the same crops

85
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,439
that are grown there

86
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,400
so it has some some advantages in that

87
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,079
way

88
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,920
another thing that's that's a little bit

89
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,680
curious about the wenatchee area in

90
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,598
particular

91
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,719
you'll go back here

92
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:38,719
is the

93
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,039
difference in elevation from the river

94
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,799
level up into some of these benches that

95
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,280
are around town which is

96
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,280
about

97
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,280
about roughly about 2 000 meters

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,719
indifference

99
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,719
which which means for something like

100
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,680
sweet cherries you have

101
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:58,000
the same cultivars that are grown

102
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,680
within a probably a 10-mile radius that

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,039
get harvested

104
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,560
over a month

105
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,120
just because of the difference in bloom

106
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,920
dates because of the elevation

107
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,759
so

108
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,679
a little bit of the

109
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,079
the uniqueness of that

110
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,080
a little bit about about apples in in

111
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,959
washington this is this is obviously the

112
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,040
biggest

113
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,439
single crop

114
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,199
this year is the biggest volume crop

115
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,639
that they've ever had 120 million boxes

116
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,759
almost two and a half million tons of

117
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,400
fruit

118
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,240
which so far has been relatively easy to

119
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,799
market because of what happened to you

120
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,960
all last spring

121
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,680
there's quite a bit of nervousness about

122
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,959
what happens over the next few years

123
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,879
but

124
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,959
you know a lot of different cultivars

125
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,959
delicious is still the the biggest one

126
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,279
by volume but that's down almost 20

127
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:49,680
percent in the last

128
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,758
15 20 years or so

129
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,759
which makes it actually easier to market

130
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,600
everything because there's just

131
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,840
there's more diversity

132
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,919
people don't get held hostage to all the

133
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,560
volume and delicious that the buyers

134
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:02,560
know they have

135
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,720
so

136
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,638
that's a lot of apples and

137
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,639
the big reason why there's that many

138
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,639
apples part of it is because there's a

139
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,879
world market that can

140
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,639
that has the demand but also it's

141
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,800
because of post harvest technology i

142
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,160
think we post harvest sites like the

143
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,520
claim

144
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,400
and i mean apple biology lends itself to

145
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,839
having ripening manipulation

146
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,239
be

147
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,239
ripening extended by storage in in

148
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,240
controlled atmospheres

149
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,038
particularly low oxygen

150
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,199
the low oxygen component and so there's

151
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,959
there's um

152
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,400
installations like this

153
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:46,799
in a lot of places in eastern washington

154
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,839
where you have these just massive rooms

155
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,520
that hold anywhere from 800 to 3000 of

156
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:56,399
these bins which hold roughly 20 to 25

157
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,839
um boxes 40 pound boxes equivalent of

158
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,638
apples

159
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,198
and so a lot of what what we do is is

160
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,840
really related to

161
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,759
how can you

162
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:10,318
optimize the system such that you can

163
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,639
have maximum flexibility for marketing

164
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,759
over an extended period and so this is

165
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,639
really an integra in a integral part of

166
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,120
being able to to deal with this gigantic

167
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,240
crop

168
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,280
one of the the keys to making

169
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,038
ca work is to

170
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,679
put the right

171
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:35,918
um the right thing in it

172
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,918
and that's really a key keyed to

173
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,519
fruit maturity at the time when it's

174
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:43,439
harvested

175
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:46,478
i mean ca is a fantastic technology but

176
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:48,160
it works best when you have fruit that's

177
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:51,199
at the right stage of development when

178
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,479
it goes into into storage

179
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,000
and

180
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,560
so

181
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,160
physiologically there's i think those of

182
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,879
us that work on apples

183
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,199
would say that there's a a point in the

184
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,598
development where fruit is optimum for

185
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,280
its long-term storage and that's related

186
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:08,560
to the onset of of the ethylene

187
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,879
climactic

188
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,800
but from a horticultural perspective and

189
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,839
from an industry perspective

190
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,560
that point in development doesn't always

191
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:20,719
match with what the conditions in the

192
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,680
field have provided you with any any one

193
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,720
season

194
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,959
so for example this is a a

195
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,960
series of pictures of honeycrisp

196
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,719
harvested over a

197
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,598
number of weeks

198
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,319
and what the trade wants is something

199
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,560
over here right because they're red this

200
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,000
is what they can get paid more money for

201
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,079
but you know there's times when the

202
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,199
biology says this is what you should be

203
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,038
doing

204
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,160
and so there's this compromise that

205
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,878
happens

206
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:53,120
within the industry to to balance those

207
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:55,360
two parts of of the equation

208
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,160
and early harvest you know if the

209
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,319
color's right if the fruit looks good

210
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,400
and it's at a point where the biology is

211
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,598
right great but that doesn't always

212
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,478
happen

213
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:08,959
so if you end up having to pick later

214
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,318
then there are some

215
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,918
issues that

216
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,919
the warehouse goes through to determine

217
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:15,519
how long can we hold these things and

218
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,198
and for a lot of varieties that's based

219
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,120
on how firm they are

220
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,680
and typically you're going to have a bit

221
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,879
of a shorter storage life as you move

222
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,720
across that range of development

223
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,639
now i want to talk about a specific

224
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,000
example of this here

225
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,120
um

226
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,200
predicated a bit by the the two types of

227
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,440
maturity physiological

228
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,800
which means that the fruit will ripen

229
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,120
after you pick it

230
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,199
it won't just shrivel up and and sit

231
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,720
there i mean apples are climactic they

232
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,519
go through a specific series of

233
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,680
of events that makes them get right

234
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,879
as opposed to horticultural maturity

235
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,278
which

236
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,519
certainly for a red apple

237
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,039
is dependent on how red it is what's it

238
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,240
look like

239
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,639
and

240
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,480
sometimes you these don't match up and

241
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,240
so you're you're really waiting until

242
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,200
you get to what's going to make you

243
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,959
money

244
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,040
as opposed to what you can store the

245
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:13,359
longest period of time

246
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:16,480
and for delicious in particular over the

247
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,480
last really 100 years there's been a a

248
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,839
selection process

249
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,399
where material has been vegetatively

250
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,959
selected because of how red it is

251
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,440
and it it's

252
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:31,518
being redder being better

253
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,800
as far as a marketability standpoint

254
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,039
goes but it's not just redder it's also

255
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:39,039
when it's getting red

256
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:43,519
and so if we look at an older cultivar

257
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:43,519
starkin versus a newer one scarlet spur

258
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,278
the newer ones tend to get redder

259
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,958
earlier in the year and really what that

260
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:52,799
translates into

261
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,399
from an internal qualities perspective

262
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,399
is that they're they're redder at an

263
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,720
earlier point in development

264
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,200
so that they're they're harder or more

265
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,879
firm at a point where the trade will say

266
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,839
these are these are what we want color

267
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,679
wise and this is why the strains of

268
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,880
delicious that are produced commercially

269
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:13,679
now are are not starking because if you

270
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:16,320
wait until you get to the color

271
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:18,719
level where you could be profitable

272
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,360
they're they're too soft you can't store

273
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,600
them

274
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,519
and so over the years

275
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,200
there's virtually none of these produced

276
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:29,440
commercially anymore in the northwest

277
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,440
it's all these newer newer strains

278
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,959
so now on on to the the volatile part of

279
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,759
this

280
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:40,479
so apple volatiles like

281
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,799
it is for other fruit that has aroma as

282
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,920
one of its quality components

283
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:47,559
um really are are one of the the key

284
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,919
components to

285
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:51,518
differentiating flavor and aroma among

286
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:52,479
different cultivars

287
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,278
and

288
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,000
within a cultivar this process of

289
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:00,240
generating ripening related

290
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,839
volatile compounds is developmentally

291
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,600
regulated um ethylene is is required for

292
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,120
this to happen

293
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,480
um and so it's it's very important at

294
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,320
the maturity at which the fruit is

295
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,240
harvested

296
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,160
is really important in how well the

297
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:22,240
fruit can execute this this ripening

298
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:24,319
related part of its its program

299
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,399
and also the environment in which the

300
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,920
fruit is stored has a big impact on the

301
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,919
ability of fruit to produce these

302
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:31,120
compounds and so those are those are

303
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,439
some of the things that i want to talk

304
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,560
about for the rest of my my presentation

305
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,920
here

306
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,679
i'm going to use

307
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:41,199
three different examples

308
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:44,399
related to the maturation process

309
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,079
then um the impacts of one mcp one

310
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,320
methylcyclopropane

311
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:51,278
on this process

312
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,800
as well as as storage and then also the

313
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:54,958
last part is going to be some work that

314
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,479
we've done relatively recently

315
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,719
looking at

316
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,000
volatile accumulation during storage

317
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,320
rather than

318
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,120
after storage when the fruit have are

319
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,920
taken out and and let to sit um at

320
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,039
ambient conditions

321
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:13,360
a little bit about the the analysis that

322
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,879
we use typically the the work that i've

323
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,399
been involved in

324
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,200
and that i'm going to talk about today

325
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,480
is all based on sampling from intact

326
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,759
apples

327
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,159
um

328
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,439
part of the reason we've done this is

329
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:27,679
there's there's kind of been an

330
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,560
overriding objective

331
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,599
to

332
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:34,159
develop some sort of um

333
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,440
quality assessment that the the trade

334
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,480
could use

335
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,560
and

336
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,639
seemingly the easiest way to do that for

337
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:43,119
them would be to be able to do this on

338
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:46,079
intact fruit the other reason is that

339
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,159
when you when you cut apples or or

340
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:50,638
apples in particular

341
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:53,039
there's a whole nother series of

342
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,839
compounds that tend to get produced

343
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,919
and so since we're interested primarily

344
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,760
in in fresh fruit

345
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,599
we've we've stayed with this kind of a

346
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,559
system for most of the work that we've

347
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,959
done

348
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:07,439
and and what we do is we put apples into

349
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:10,078
jars and let them equilibrate for a

350
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,200
period of time with a flowing air stream

351
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,199
through them

352
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,360
and then we we collect

353
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,440
the compounds that are coming off the

354
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,639
fruit on a

355
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,760
absorbent

356
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,600
polymer

357
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,278
in a glass trap

358
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,159
that is then

359
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,838
analyzed using gcms

360
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,480
using the system and this is this is a

361
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,760
pretty efficient process

362
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,399
there are some compromises that are made

363
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:38,240
based on the phase or the the material

364
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,078
that's used in this these traps but this

365
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,560
one 10x is actually

366
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:44,159
pretty um pre has a pretty broad

367
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,958
spectrum of

368
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:48,958
absorptivity absorptivity

369
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:51,198
and the way that we do quantification

370
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,599
based on um

371
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,278
settings using standards

372
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,560
based on the same system gives us a way

373
00:13:55,278 --> 00:14:00,799
to do good quantification of what we get

374
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:04,159
in these samples

375
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:06,159
so um to start with with maturity here a

376
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,319
little bit of background as i mentioned

377
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:11,919
maturity is really important

378
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:15,040
in determining the capacity of of apples

379
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:18,399
to produce ripening related volatiles

380
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:21,919
after harvest this this is uh some um

381
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:24,240
data from a a paper by song and banger

382
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:26,000
published in the 90s and and basically

383
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,000
what it's showing here with this was

384
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,320
with gold malicious is that

385
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,919
as harvest occurs later in the season

386
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,720
you go from

387
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,278
a

388
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,360
fruit that's really pretty unable to

389
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:40,639
produce a lot of compounds related to

390
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,600
aroma

391
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,720
to an increasing capacity

392
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,320
as

393
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,480
both initially

394
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,760
at the point of harvest and then after

395
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,440
harvest

396
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,679
one of the a couple of the key things

397
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,839
here are that in in the first harvest

398
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:57,759
here where they're they're getting

399
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,480
substantial production you see that the

400
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:03,360
peak in that production is occurring

401
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,480
relatively later than it is in the later

402
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,000
harvests

403
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,519
and so what's happened here is that the

404
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,320
fruit is matured and then started to

405
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,198
ripen on the tree it starts to have more

406
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,639
of a capacity to produce these compounds

407
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:19,120
but as as you pick later and later

408
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,159
it the production maximizes and then

409
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,799
actually falls off sooner

410
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:27,600
as it compared to the later ones and so

411
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:30,000
this is one of the things that that

412
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,240
contributes to post-harvest quality of

413
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,759
apple fruit in relation to maturity

414
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,919
because if you pick earlier you get a

415
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,159
longer storage life but you have an

416
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:40,399
inherently less capacity to produce a

417
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:42,078
lot of these compounds just because of

418
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,078
the point in development of which it's

419
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:46,719
been picked

420
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:50,719
and so with with that as background

421
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:53,120
um we were interested in in this problem

422
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,440
or this issue specifically in relation

423
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,159
to delicious cultivar

424
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,560
because delicious is is an apple that

425
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:03,039
gets picked relatively early

426
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:05,439
in its its maturation and ripening

427
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:08,078
development because it gets soft and so

428
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,160
if you pick it relatively late the

429
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:12,319
storage life is compromised quite

430
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,639
considerably and so what we were

431
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,600
interested to do was to look at the

432
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,278
really the seasonal variability

433
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,199
in

434
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,439
things that are normally measured in

435
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:25,599
relation to maturity as well as the

436
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,600
capacity to produce

437
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,320
ripening related volatiles at the point

438
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,240
of harvest to see how how consistent or

439
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,278
or inconsistent that was

440
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,799
on a year-to-year basis we use this

441
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:39,919
strain red

442
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:42,719
bisbee delicious which is um

443
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:44,479
somewhere in the middle between starking

444
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,560
and scarlet spur ii there aren't very

445
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,879
many of these around anymore either

446
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,638
because they don't get this red as early

447
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:53,519
in development compared to something

448
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,519
like scarlet spur

449
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,600
so um

450
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:00,159
three of the the maturity

451
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,839
components that were we measured were

452
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,600
internal ethylene

453
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,120
concentration

454
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,599
starch score

455
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:10,958
with a visual rating using a potassium

456
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:13,279
iodide solution and then also firmness

457
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,839
from a from an industry perspective they

458
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:19,119
don't typically have this information

459
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:23,119
this is not something that

460
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:25,678
most warehouses generate on their own

461
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:28,558
so they're relying basically on on has

462
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,960
it what's the color here and then what

463
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:36,319
are these two values telling us about

464
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,319
how how mature how ripe are these fruit

465
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,760
if if we are going to assume that

466
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,240
the fruit is fully mature physiological

467
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:48,000
mature physiologically mature when it

468
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,679
reaches uh internal ethylene

469
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,038
concentration of one microliter per

470
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,559
liter

471
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:55,599
and that for long-term ca the optimal

472
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:59,119
starch

473
00:17:55,599 --> 00:18:01,519
is just over two on a one to six scale

474
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,038
and that the firmness is just above 70

475
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,038
newtons

476
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:06,720
then these are the things that the

477
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,400
warehouse would look at at the point of

478
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,558
receiving and then make the decision as

479
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,600
to whether or not this goes into short

480
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,160
medium

481
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,519
long-term storage i mean basically how

482
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,960
what are we going to do with this fruit

483
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:23,119
to maximize our marketing flexibility

484
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:26,160
and so um in the four years of of

485
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:28,239
the study that i'm reporting here

486
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,558
there was quite a range a three week

487
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,240
range of a bloom date this is the same

488
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:34,720
trees same block

489
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,880
um over four different years

490
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,240
and um

491
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,200
i think there you know in all of the

492
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,359
years

493
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,600
ethylene started to be produced starch

494
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,959
scores went up and the fruit got

495
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:47,519
less firm

496
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,360
but when you compare across the years

497
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,359
there's there's some

498
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:54,558
differences that are

499
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:56,399
relatively important in determining the

500
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:57,678
post-harvest fade if you will of these

501
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,919
fruit

502
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:04,720
so for example in in the first two years

503
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,679
um the ethylene patterns are relatively

504
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,960
similar a bit higher in the in the first

505
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,960
year

506
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,600
by the last harvest

507
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,160
the the starches were up into the higher

508
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:18,240
twos or above three

509
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:22,160
the firmness at the point where the

510
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,319
start the starch was two was still

511
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:28,798
it was still above 70. so these are good

512
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:31,439
candidates for long-term ca storage um

513
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,359
before the end this this is one of the

514
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,200
things to keep in mind here is the last

515
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,038
two points

516
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,558
in all these years

517
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:43,038
when when we get into the last two

518
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,440
you see a couple things is that

519
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:47,759
relatively earlier in

520
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:51,279
the the harvest period

521
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:53,200
the firmness has dropped below 70

522
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:56,639
and in this year the starch went up

523
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,038
quite rapidly above that the point of um

524
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,120
acceptability for long-term ca

525
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:02,960
as opposed to last year when it was only

526
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:03,839
at the last harvest when it was was that

527
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,759
high

528
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,918
but what would happen here if you wanted

529
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,879
to say picking this year for long-term

530
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,000
ca

531
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,559
you're going to have to pick pretty

532
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,079
early starch was going to be low and and

533
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:15,599
likely these fruit were not going to be

534
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,519
red enough and so basically what's

535
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,199
happening would have happened is they

536
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:23,519
would have had to pick later

537
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,519
and and not put them into long-term ca

538
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:28,798
so um

539
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,400
the analysis of of the volatiles that

540
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,240
were being produced and this is not

541
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,120
including ethylene this is the other

542
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,960
things that are the fruit are producing

543
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,879
a

544
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,960
principle components analysis here that

545
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,280
accounted for just under 70 percent of

546
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,919
the variability you see that we've got

547
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,839
nice patterns related to the four years

548
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,280
of the study

549
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:53,599
the red one is the late bloom year

550
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:53,599
which

551
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,400
will make more sense when we get a

552
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:57,599
little bit further on here in the

553
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,600
presentation but one of the things i

554
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:00,639
want to point out is that in all of the

555
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:02,639
years the

556
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,159
the data is pretty well clustered around

557
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,880
the same points

558
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,240
early in the development period

559
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,000
and and one of the the real

560
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,798
differentiating factors between the

561
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,359
years is as you get closer to the the

562
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:16,879
later harvest dates where things are are

563
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,119
a little bit more different than they

564
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,039
are earlier

565
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:23,199
and um the loadings plot for the same

566
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:25,679
data really this is driven by

567
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,159
the onset of production of a lot of

568
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,240
ripening related esters

569
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,240
that tend to cluster in the top of this

570
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,679
plot the things down in in the lower

571
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,120
areas tend to be

572
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,000
alcohols

573
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:42,000
aldehydes there's a few esters in there

574
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,679
but really once once right maturity

575
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,519
physiological maturity has been attained

576
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,038
and ripening starts and the fruit starts

577
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:48,639
making esters that's really what

578
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,480
separates out

579
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,320
the data set

580
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,759
so this is this is

581
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,759
all the things we measured here

582
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:02,639
same arrangement same bloom dates across

583
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:05,200
this way the the plots at the the

584
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,520
five things at the top here

585
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,000
are growing degree days

586
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,839
this is starch ethylene

587
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
hours below

588
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:16,399
and then the incidence of or the

589
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,640
severity of superficial scald after six

590
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,000
months in storage because scald is

591
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:25,600
related to maturity at harvest

592
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,599
in in most years and so what what what

593
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:30,879
you see as you look across this this

594
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:33,439
plot is that in all of the years the

595
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,000
biggest change in volatile production

596
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,038
was at the last two harvest dates

597
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,480
and it was really relatively abrupt

598
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:42,879
where

599
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,200
not much was happening before we got

600
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,760
until these last two harvest aids

601
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,080
in in the year where the harvest or the

602
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:52,319
bloom was relatively later

603
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,519
there there was quite a different

604
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,439
profile

605
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:56,720
in a number of compounds which tend to

606
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,519
be

607
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,400
alcohols aldehydes which serve as

608
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,240
precursors for ester production

609
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,759
you know i don't have an explanation for

610
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,759
why this happened other than this

611
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,759
happened in a year where the fruit

612
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:12,240
really had a relatively

613
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:14,400
less days on the tree

614
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,640
and and it was also

615
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,720
its initial stages of development was

616
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,480
during a period of year where the

617
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,759
environmental conditions were were

618
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,400
somewhat different than they would have

619
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:24,640
been

620
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,880
when bloom was earlier i mean these

621
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,360
these are components of

622
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,720
um say yearly variability in in

623
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:32,798
production of these things that aren't

624
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,960
really very well understood because it's

625
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:36,798
it's difficult to do this kind of

626
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,120
research but so that i guess one of the

627
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:42,240
messages here is that these patterns are

628
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:44,000
not consistent from year to year in some

629
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,640
aspects

630
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,480
even even this the last two

631
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,559
harvest dates being the point at which

632
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,079
there was the biggest change in

633
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:54,319
volatile production

634
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:57,359
if you think back to the previous slide

635
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,879
there was the the other things that we

636
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,439
were measuring ethylene production

637
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,320
starch and firmness didn't necessarily

638
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,038
follow that same consistent pattern and

639
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:10,000
so so what's happened here

640
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:11,839
is um a couple things oh let me step

641
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,440
back here a second the

642
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:17,599
the the group within this cluster

643
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,480
which um you can't really see it as well

644
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:23,439
on here as as i can see it here

645
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,200
tends to have less of a change over this

646
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,558
period of time

647
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,120
compared to

648
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:30,079
um the bottom ones these are a group of

649
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:31,278
ethyl

650
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:34,319
esters

651
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:36,159
which um as you let delicious fruits sit

652
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:36,960
out in the bench and get ripe these tend

653
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,880
to

654
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,278
increase a bit later

655
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,919
than some of the other compounds do

656
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:46,000
and those being this the group in the

657
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,559
bottom two clusters here which tend to

658
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,440
be um

659
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:54,480
have a different alcohol moiety in the

660
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:57,278
ester butyl hexopropyl pentyl and then

661
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,200
two methyl butyl acetate and these

662
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:01,839
compounds you can make

663
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,080
if you take a bunch of these and make a

664
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:05,759
mix of of the pure standards you can

665
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:06,720
make something that smells pretty much

666
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:10,158
like a

667
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,558
you know a nice ripe red delicious apple

668
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,880
so these these tend to be produced in

669
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:16,879
volume relatively earlier

670
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,320
in the ripening process

671
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:23,520
than the ethyl group does

672
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:23,519
as as a comparison

673
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:27,599
so

674
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,159
you know what that said to us is that

675
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:32,240
like the other components of maturity

676
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,080
that we measure

677
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,679
this process is a little bit different

678
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,399
every year as well

679
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,480
and and when you think about how this

680
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,038
happened over the four years in relation

681
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,079
to the other components of of

682
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:49,519
physiological and horticultural maturity

683
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:51,599
this increase came after the point of

684
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:54,158
horticultural maturity in some years and

685
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,119
before it in others so when it comes

686
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,720
after

687
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:58,719
what that means is that this fruit is

688
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,079
off the tree before it reaches this

689
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,759
stage and it's not going to have the

690
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:02,879
capacity to produce a lot of these

691
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:04,480
things

692
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,520
meaning that they're going to taste

693
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,519
different

694
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:09,038
even though they may look the same as

695
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:11,599
they did the year before and it's one of

696
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:13,359
the things that makes delicious

697
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,839
have some people question that part of

698
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:15,839
its name

699
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:23,519
so next this is um

700
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,319
the impacts of of one mcp really the

701
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:27,759
influence of ethylene on this process

702
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:30,639
as well as

703
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:32,558
part of what storage does to the

704
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,880
capacity of fruit to produce these

705
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:36,720
compounds so for this part of the study

706
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,000
we used gala

707
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,798
they were treated with one mcp um

708
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,839
very amazing inhibitor of of ethylene

709
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:46,240
action

710
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:48,319
um highly used in the commercial trade

711
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,880
around the world anymore

712
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:55,200
and and then um they were stored either

713
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:57,440
in air or in a controlled atmosphere

714
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,798
at one

715
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:03,120
kilopascal oxygen and two co2 which is

716
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:04,960
pretty standard for the the industry in

717
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:06,558
the pacific northwest

718
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,558
so these these fruit were held in

719
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:12,319
storage and then we took them out and

720
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:14,399
let them sit for a week at 20 degrees

721
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:17,599
which is kind of a standard

722
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,038
simulation of transit and retail

723
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:22,158
for apples after they come out of

724
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:23,839
storage to see how it would impact

725
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:27,360
components of quality including

726
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:27,359
production of volatiles

727
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:30,879
so that there were a number of

728
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:33,199
treatments this is actually kind of old

729
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,760
data when we were trying to look at you

730
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,840
know how much mcp

731
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:44,158
is enough as it were and so we went from

732
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:46,959
0.1 to 10 microliters per liter

733
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,520
of 1mcp at harvest and then stored in

734
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,360
air or in ca

735
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:52,158
ca alone or

736
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,359
with

737
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,200
a treatment of mcp prior to going into

738
00:27:55,359 --> 00:28:00,158
storage

739
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,159
relatively early in the storage

740
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,399
period taken out every month for seven

741
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,000
months you see this differential really

742
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:08,479
even at one month

743
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,839
there's a difference relatable to the

744
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,079
fruit having

745
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,278
been treated with one mcp prior to

746
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:15,519
storage

747
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:17,519
and as that as the storage periods

748
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,918
extends you know basically these things

749
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:22,960
really aren't changing very much

750
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,399
the the blue circles and the purple ones

751
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,240
are the fruit that have been stored in

752
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:28,558
ca

753
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,720
after about four months

754
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,079
the group treated with mcp but then

755
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,640
stored in air

756
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:37,439
starts to change a bit and does

757
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:41,200
differentiate between the ca as but

758
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,798
still is higher than the untreated fruit

759
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,278
and the lowest

760
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:47,679
mcp treatment and it's similar for

761
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:50,798
titratable acidity which is another

762
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,600
component of quality that's important

763
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:52,720
for

764
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,678
for

765
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,558
flavor and aroma not not aroma certainly

766
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,720
for flavor

767
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,079
so

768
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,880
a

769
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:06,240
loading's plot of the volatile results

770
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,559
from this

771
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,200
and you see on the left the the

772
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:13,038
treatments progress up and out in the

773
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,679
plot

774
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:18,240
with the concentration of mcp and then

775
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:21,200
at the top the combination treatment

776
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,319
mcpca or ca alone

777
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,480
and and what tracks over here is

778
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:29,439
the bottom group here

779
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,120
um again is primarily

780
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,840
acyl esters

781
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:35,278
that are really give the the fruity

782
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:38,240
components that the ones that are

783
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:42,000
produced relatively earlier in ripening

784
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,839
for for gala and as you go up and then

785
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,558
um into the sea area

786
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:49,038
ca area these again this there's a lot

787
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,798
of these ethyl group ones that are are

788
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:53,599
present up here and really what this is

789
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:55,440
showing is that these tend to be made

790
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:58,079
much more in volume

791
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,880
in related to these treatments than to

792
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:03,038
the

793
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,039
mcp or the the ca ones

794
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,360
so um

795
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:10,079
esters alone

796
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:12,879
as under over the same period

797
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:14,720
the controls in the lowest mcp treatment

798
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,840
which didn't do much for firmness or

799
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,240
acid

800
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:21,199
you see we had this initial increase and

801
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,640
then another increase later in storage

802
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,399
the later increase was also

803
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,240
also happened in the fruit that had been

804
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:30,319
treated with the higher rates of of one

805
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,278
mcp

806
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:35,119
either group stored in ca stayed

807
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:37,759
relatively low

808
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:41,678
at the longest storage durations

809
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:44,240
compared to the other mcp treatments

810
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,399
so this this this

811
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,839
biphasic pattern if you will is a bit

812
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:51,439
unusual

813
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:53,839
and when we went in to look at what

814
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,200
individual compounds were doing

815
00:30:53,839 --> 00:31:00,319
in relation to this pattern um

816
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,360
you see that uh in the initial period

817
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:06,879
for the controls and the lowest rate of

818
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:10,398
of one mcp that there's production of a

819
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,000
number of compounds that is is higher

820
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:13,599
than it is in in

821
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,759
the treated fruit

822
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:19,199
and what these are again is this the

823
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:21,519
series of of relatively um

824
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,640
these simple acyl esters that don't

825
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,640
include the ethyl ones

826
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,759
and and so then when when you look at

827
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,480
the

828
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:34,558
five to seven month period where we

829
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,558
started to see an increase in a lot of

830
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:40,158
these other compounds

831
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:42,480
within the the checks and the low mcp

832
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,640
treatment we also saw that in all of the

833
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,599
mcp treated fruit

834
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,240
but

835
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:50,319
we didn't see

836
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,558
this group alone

837
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:54,398
once the mcp treated fruit started to

838
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:55,678
have the capacity to produce these

839
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:56,719
compounds

840
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,960
and so

841
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,038
what what appears to have happened here

842
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,960
is that the treatment with one mcp

843
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:05,359
didn't just delay

844
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,000
the onset or the the production of a lot

845
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:10,398
of these compounds it really changed the

846
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,440
pattern of how they were produced such

847
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:15,518
that you miss this initial period where

848
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,960
you're really only getting these these

849
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,000
real fruity

850
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,840
more characteristic group of compounds

851
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,079
such that when the fruit regains the

852
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:26,720
capacity to produce these it's a

853
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:29,678
different suite of compounds if you will

854
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,919
compared to this initial period

855
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,480
and so you know why this is happening

856
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,240
specifically is is something that um

857
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,399
remains to be

858
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,759
determined but it you know it's not a

859
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:41,759
simple

860
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:42,398
well the fruit is old it's starting to

861
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,720
get

862
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:46,719
senescent

863
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,319
or overripe however you want to describe

864
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,679
it because

865
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:51,359
these fruit

866
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,000
could be classified that way they're

867
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:55,759
soft they're low acid but these aren't i

868
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,440
mean these are still firm they still

869
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:59,278
have a lot of acid

870
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,519
and so what it means is that this this

871
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:02,880
whole process has been

872
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,798
um

873
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,240
altered by

874
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:08,398
having ethylene

875
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,640
action removed from the equation as it

876
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:12,558
were for a period of time such that it

877
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,640
doesn't really recover

878
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:16,079
the capacity to ripen normally i mean

879
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,480
they're getting ripe and they're doing

880
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:20,879
things that that galas do during that

881
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:25,079
process but it's not the same pattern

882
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,080
that you see in the controls

883
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:28,239
um

884
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:29,199
yeah again that's when the second

885
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,839
pattern

886
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:36,240
second production is this ethyl group

887
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:38,240
again along with a number of

888
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,399
aldehydes so it's a different group of

889
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,679
compounds as opposed to the one on the

890
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:43,678
bottom

891
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,519
so i think what this illustrates is

892
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,399
you know mcp's having a big effect on

893
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,440
this

894
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:49,038
um

895
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,200
in the trade

896
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:53,440
gals aren't stored for

897
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,919
a period of time such that they would

898
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,679
experience this increase in air because

899
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,519
if you're going to store them for a long

900
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:02,000
period they're going to be this they're

901
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,359
going to be the ones that are in ca

902
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,720
so what does that mean about what

903
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:06,079
they're going to you know what are they

904
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,440
going to taste like when you put them in

905
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:11,039
your mouth

906
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,918
and it turns out that's not as simple of

907
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:14,878
a

908
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:17,199
question as you might think it is

909
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:21,118
this is some work that

910
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:21,918
gene kupperman colleague of ours at wsu

911
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,240
and

912
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,918
anna marin from oregon state university

913
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,000
really were the drivers behind this a

914
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:30,398
few years ago and what they were the

915
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,918
question they wanted to ask is how do

916
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:34,799
people perceive

917
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,918
one mcp treated fruit versus non-treated

918
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,039
fruit

919
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:40,960
that have been um

920
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:42,960
where you've selected using a

921
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,119
non-destructive firmness technique so

922
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,199
that firmness is pretty much the same

923
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,119
it's not like you're taking controls

924
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,799
that haven't been treated that are soft

925
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,399
and comparing them with treated fruit

926
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,960
that are still hard these are all about

927
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:57,358
the same firmness

928
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,838
we did the volatile analysis for a

929
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:02,159
number of key compounds and

930
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:06,639
i hope you can see this that the bold

931
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:08,159
columns on the right which are the ca or

932
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:10,559
fruit stored in air that haven't been

933
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:12,000
treated are all significantly higher

934
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:13,920
than the fruit that have been treated

935
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,880
with one mcp and then stored either in

936
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,358
air or in ca but

937
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,519
what the folks they gave these two to

938
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:23,920
test and they basically said

939
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:26,239
can you you have a preference and what

940
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,440
is your preference

941
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:32,078
was was pretty interesting to me in that

942
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,240
when you look at the mean liking scores

943
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:38,480
for all of these groups

944
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:42,559
mcp air versus control ca mcpca control

945
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:45,039
ca or mcpca versus new crop fruit from

946
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:47,199
chile that hadn't been stored

947
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:48,719
these these scores are all pretty

948
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:50,799
similar

949
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:51,598
and um

950
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,599
the

951
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,000
the preference scores

952
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,960
in general favor the fruit that have

953
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,719
been treated with one mcp

954
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,679
so what does that mean it means that

955
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:06,159
people's preferences for apple flavor

956
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:07,838
are different you know it's not just a

957
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:09,199
matter of saying

958
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:11,119
you've got a lot of these they're going

959
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:12,480
to be better well some people may that

960
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,599
may be why they thought these were

961
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,760
better but it's not that simple

962
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,838
and so i this there's there's been a lot

963
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,480
of work like this done trying to sort

964
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:24,719
this out with with mcp on apples and

965
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,240
other crops and it really i think

966
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:28,159
depends on the questions that you're

967
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:29,039
asking i mean if you want to

968
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:31,118
say

969
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:33,920
that mcp makes something

970
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:36,880
better or worse you can do that by the

971
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,838
way you set up these consumer type tests

972
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,880
or even taste panel with with trained

973
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:43,759
panels

974
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,599
so it's not as simple of a question as

975
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,359
more is better and i think the other

976
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,760
part of that is that

977
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:51,759
as if you if you think about

978
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,480
the differential and production of

979
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,480
different groups of of esters as

980
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,838
ripening progresses

981
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,440
as the fruit starts to get older and

982
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:03,599
into the phase where it's producing a

983
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,320
lot of ethyl esters they don't taste the

984
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,519
same i mean that changes how the fruit

985
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,760
tastes

986
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:14,000
um when you combine that with softening

987
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,480
more may not be better in that that

988
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,119
instance as far as as

989
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,320
how that impacts quality

990
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:25,760
so on to the last part and this is

991
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,680
volatile production during ca storage it

992
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,320
turns out that

993
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:32,799
there's not a lot of literature about

994
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,160
what happens while fruit is stored in

995
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,359
low oxygen

996
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:39,598
or high co2 controlled atmospheres most

997
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:41,759
of the work like this has been done

998
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,519
as i described earlier where it's taken

999
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,040
out it's let's sit for a while to

1000
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:47,119
simulate

1001
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:49,199
shelf life as it were and then you do

1002
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,358
the analysis so we've been interested

1003
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:53,919
the last few years

1004
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:56,400
to try to develop information that

1005
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,920
provides additional

1006
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,119
management tools as it were to industry

1007
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,680
to

1008
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:06,000
make determinations about fruit quality

1009
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:07,838
and marketability while it's still in

1010
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,920
storage and so one of the things that we

1011
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:12,078
started to do was to

1012
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,680
set up experiments where we would

1013
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,079
actually do the volatile measurements

1014
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:17,118
while the fruit was still in ca

1015
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,599
and

1016
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,760
for for this group of stuff we we picked

1017
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,440
two situations

1018
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,680
where um

1019
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,920
the environments were set up so that

1020
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:29,118
they would cause problems but the first

1021
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,159
one being

1022
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:35,519
low oxygen where we went down to 0.3

1023
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:38,399
kilopascals oxygen to try to generate

1024
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:40,480
low oxygen injury

1025
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,400
the reason you would actually

1026
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,320
try to operate that way commercially is

1027
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,358
to try to prevent this disorder

1028
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:50,079
superficial scald which low oxygen can

1029
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:52,639
be a way to at least delay

1030
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,680
and the other one is high co2 injury of

1031
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:55,598
fuji

1032
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:57,759
which develops this really wonderful

1033
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,039
internal browning with

1034
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,200
cavities

1035
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,599
that when you look at the fruit you

1036
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:05,759
can't see that it has it

1037
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,119
so

1038
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,359
this this

1039
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,519
the way we collected the samples for

1040
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:13,838
this is we have our our chambers our

1041
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:15,199
research scale chambers they hold about

1042
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:17,358
eight of these

1043
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:18,399
fiber trays of fruit

1044
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:21,039
and

1045
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,240
same collection system here's our 10x

1046
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:24,400
trap

1047
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:27,199
a little pump where we would we would

1048
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,920
circulate the atmosphere from this these

1049
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:30,960
chambers onto the traps and then we

1050
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,639
could

1051
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,960
basically do the analysis on the traps

1052
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:36,159
the same as i described earlier

1053
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,599
and that way we don't have to take the

1054
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:40,078
fruit out we're not changing the

1055
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:42,960
atmosphere it's it's staying under the

1056
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:45,599
low oxygen or high co2 conditions while

1057
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,838
we're doing the sampling this is the

1058
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:50,559
the ports on the side of the chambers to

1059
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:53,679
to get the gas in and out

1060
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:55,759
so for for the delicious part of this

1061
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:58,078
i just want to briefly show you we've

1062
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,079
done this for three years now and

1063
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:03,280
the the first two years of this the

1064
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:05,839
fruit was relatively similar starch-wise

1065
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:08,079
a bit higher in ethylene

1066
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:09,838
the first year

1067
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,079
all three years the firmness was pretty

1068
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:14,719
consistent the last year the the fruit

1069
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:18,160
was had much higher ethylene the starch

1070
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:20,959
scores were higher the acidity was lower

1071
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:23,199
so these these are more these are fully

1072
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,079
mature and started to ripen i think a

1073
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:27,919
bit more than the first two years are

1074
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,560
all from the same orchard

1075
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,800
manage the same

1076
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:32,799
so

1077
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:38,639
the low oxygen

1078
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:41,199
concentration on the left the amount of

1079
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:44,000
time and storage on the right and these

1080
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:45,118
are not equivalent periods as you go

1081
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,400
down the

1082
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,000
the

1083
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,920
axis here they're they're weighted

1084
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,079
towards the front end

1085
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,039
such that these are all about a week

1086
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,920
apart and then it starts to get longer

1087
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:58,719
so

1088
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,280
what we saw relatively early on in the

1089
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:02,399
lowest oxygen concentration

1090
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,960
was

1091
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,480
an accumulation of of compounds that we

1092
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,119
weren't seeing

1093
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:12,159
as we increase the oxygen or

1094
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,000
as we were storing fruit in air

1095
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:15,679
and guess what these were again it's

1096
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,719
this whole series

1097
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:20,879
of ethyl esters including ethanol so not

1098
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:24,078
surprisingly

1099
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,160
apples make esters really largely based

1100
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,160
on the alcohols that are present so if

1101
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:29,759
you have a lot of ethanol there

1102
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:32,000
you tend to get

1103
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:35,280
these ethyl esters earlier than you

1104
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,440
would if um in this case because these

1105
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,359
these apples are not ripe

1106
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,358
two weeks after after harvest

1107
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:46,880
the um then there's there's other groups

1108
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:50,000
where

1109
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,800
the changes are not as affected

1110
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,318
really other than the ca compared to the

1111
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,119
air air fruit

1112
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:59,920
and then there's a whole group down here

1113
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:02,640
which are again a lot of the early

1114
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,079
ripening related compounds that are

1115
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:06,559
being produced

1116
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,960
much more in the fruit stored in air

1117
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:10,880
than they are in the ones in any of the

1118
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,358
ca environments and really one of one of

1119
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,920
the things that regardless of low oxygen

1120
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:18,159
concentration these tend to be produced

1121
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,079
less which i think you know if you eat

1122
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:22,318
fruit that comes out of ca you

1123
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,560
inherently know that there's there's a

1124
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:26,800
lot less production or you know you just

1125
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,318
don't taste these as much as you would

1126
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,800
if you're eating a ripe one that's never

1127
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:33,119
been in that same condition so low

1128
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,839
oxygen has this effect as it does with

1129
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,838
with galas

1130
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:41,759
the the different atmospheres did a a

1131
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:42,879
predictable job of managing firmness and

1132
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,040
acidity

1133
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,039
the the lower letters here are the

1134
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:49,679
differences within months

1135
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:51,519
so that the cas are higher

1136
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:53,358
all of the ca treatments are higher than

1137
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:55,920
the fruit stored in air it was only at

1138
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:57,119
eight months where the lowest oxygen in

1139
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,639
this

1140
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,519
experiment was higher than the other two

1141
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:04,480
so

1142
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:07,679
you know again we're we're restricting

1143
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,838
part of the ripening process here by by

1144
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:11,440
these treatments but the oxygen the

1145
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:14,318
differential in oxygen is having a

1146
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,079
pretty big impact on what the fruit are

1147
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:17,279
are making

1148
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,119
so

1149
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,400
one of our objectives here is okay can

1150
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,880
we use

1151
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,720
measurement of a fewer of these

1152
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,640
to provide some indication that there's

1153
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:28,959
an issue or not an issue

1154
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:31,440
and quantitatively

1155
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,679
as as you might expect ethanol ethyl

1156
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,240
acetate are the the compounds being

1157
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:38,719
produced the most

1158
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:41,919
um this is in in one year of the study

1159
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:44,399
all of this day i'm sorry was from 2011.

1160
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,720
and so if you're going to try to use one

1161
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,680
or two values or compounds to try to

1162
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:49,679
make this assessment

1163
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,920
you either need to have a pattern that's

1164
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,640
different consistently or you need to

1165
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,480
have a threshold value above which you

1166
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:59,279
would say there's a problem

1167
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,318
so

1168
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,359
here's the

1169
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:02,079
the

1170
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:03,759
the

1171
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:06,079
lines the slope of the line of

1172
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,359
accumulation in the first week

1173
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:10,640
clearly

1174
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:11,838
much more rapid in the lowest oxygen

1175
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:13,279
than

1176
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:14,559
the fruit stored in air or the other

1177
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,560
oxygens

1178
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:17,920
but if we look at

1179
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:19,199
the amounts

1180
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,358
in this year

1181
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:23,598
the only treatment that got above 10

1182
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:26,799
nanomoles per liter was the lowest

1183
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:29,280
oxygen and for ethyl acetate um

1184
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,200
somewhere between four and six

1185
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,640
so maybe though maybe that's a range

1186
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:34,239
where if you're going to try to do this

1187
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:36,400
commercially you could you could say

1188
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:38,799
this is what we want well we've done

1189
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,559
this for three years and

1190
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,200
in two of the years the patterns have

1191
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:45,039
been relatively similar

1192
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:47,919
these two where we saw this initial

1193
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:50,719
rapid a relatively rapid rise

1194
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,800
and it continued to get go up for you

1195
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:54,959
know within the first three months

1196
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,920
the kicker is is this one

1197
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,519
where

1198
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:02,240
this fruit at 0.2 was

1199
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:04,639
was anaerobic it had plenty of ethanol

1200
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:07,919
but it didn't accumulate very well

1201
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:10,239
until almost three months in storage

1202
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,318
and so if you're using you know we have

1203
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:14,159
to use

1204
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:15,119
if we're using 10

1205
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:17,598
we're not going to know there's a

1206
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:20,480
problem until we get out to here

1207
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:23,680
and that's going to maybe be too late to

1208
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,519
do something about it within the room

1209
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:29,440
that's what this

1210
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:30,400
line is is in um in this in this year

1211
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,079
once

1212
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,440
one of these groups that was stored at

1213
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:38,400
0.3 got up above 10 we raised the oxygen

1214
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,200
to 1.2 and you see that over time

1215
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,838
the

1216
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:44,719
both for ethanol and for ethyl acetate

1217
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:46,318
well not actually not as well here

1218
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:48,719
the values start to go back down meaning

1219
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:51,119
that the fruit can recover once you put

1220
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:52,318
enough oxygen back into the room

1221
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:55,358
the other

1222
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:56,400
issue here is that as opposed to

1223
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:58,719
the

1224
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,480
other year when we use 0.3

1225
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:02,639
where 0.8 percent

1226
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,318
never induced enough ethanol to get up

1227
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:06,078
but above 10

1228
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:07,199
it did in this year

1229
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,680
so i think

1230
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:11,679
you know this is this is only three

1231
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:13,358
this is three seasons with one lot so

1232
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:15,598
when you think about this in relation to

1233
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:18,400
a whole room full of fruit from

1234
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:20,240
different lots

1235
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,880
setting a threshold value to try to do

1236
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:24,479
this might be more difficult than you

1237
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,318
would think

1238
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,639
as you think about the biology of fruit

1239
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:29,920
and why this happens in the first place

1240
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:31,759
so i think that was one of the the

1241
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,000
messages or the lessons that we got of

1242
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,480
the stuff from delicious

1243
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,039
for fuji

1244
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:42,960
only the fruits start at five

1245
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:43,759
kilopascals co2 got co2 injury

1246
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,960
okay

1247
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,920
so there's there's a large group here

1248
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,720
where

1249
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,079
relatively little difference between

1250
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:55,039
the treatments

1251
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,480
and this is the fruity

1252
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:59,838
stuff that tends to get produced

1253
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,519
relatively early there's no ethyl

1254
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:03,759
esters in there

1255
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:06,480
when we look into

1256
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:10,000
this cluster

1257
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:12,639
ethyl esters and some methyl esters as

1258
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,119
well so even at

1259
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:17,679
high co2 is is causing a differential

1260
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,358
production of a bunch of these compounds

1261
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:20,558
as opposed to the fruit that are stored

1262
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:21,679
in air

1263
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,519
um

1264
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:24,480
i think one of the issues here again

1265
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:26,480
okay

1266
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,639
what could we pick that might tell us

1267
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,519
there's a problem is a bit more

1268
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:34,000
difficult because the the quantitative

1269
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:36,239
relationships between these treatments

1270
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,119
aren't really very different

1271
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:38,318
um

1272
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,920
and

1273
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:41,759
here's ethanol over here and you see

1274
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,680
that this doesn't increase to its

1275
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,760
maximum until pretty far this is six

1276
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:47,199
months into storage here

1277
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,119
and so um

1278
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:50,239
maybe not surprisingly we didn't see

1279
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,119
that happen

1280
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:55,919
but when you look at what production of

1281
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,760
a few of these did

1282
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,159
some of them um ethyl butyrate

1283
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,839
methylbutyrate early on there was an

1284
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:03,679
increase

1285
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:06,239
in all of these but but the treatment

1286
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:07,199
differential five to one and a half to a

1287
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:08,639
half

1288
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:10,639
you know that's not a big enough

1289
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:12,639
difference i think if this was something

1290
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:13,358
you would see consistently to be able to

1291
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:15,598
say

1292
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:17,519
this much is telling you have a problem

1293
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:20,240
and what we see over with ethanol is

1294
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:21,759
that fuji's just inherently make ethanol

1295
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:24,239
pretty well

1296
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,640
and so i think what happens early on

1297
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:28,799
is they can pretty efficiently take this

1298
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:30,639
and make it into esters

1299
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,000
and so

1300
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:36,400
we're not seeing as much of an

1301
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:38,239
accumulation early as we do late when

1302
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,318
this capacity to produce ethanol

1303
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:42,479
continues to be there whereas the

1304
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:43,920
capacity to produce epster's with it

1305
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,000
actually decreases the longer the

1306
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,159
fruit's been in ca

1307
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,159
so that's probably part of the reason

1308
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:53,118
why we're getting this this accumulation

1309
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:53,118
later in storage

1310
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,838
so um i think that's that's where i want

1311
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,839
to stop and

1312
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:03,679
um i guess the the things that that

1313
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:06,400
we've taken home ourselves over the

1314
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:09,039
years is that you know harvest date

1315
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,200
season are really important and it's

1316
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:12,880
it's important in ways differently for

1317
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:16,000
different cultivars just because of the

1318
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,760
way different cultivars mature and ripen

1319
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,719
before they're ready to be picked

1320
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,800
ethylene action is is is critical to

1321
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:25,039
this process

1322
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,880
control atmosphere has effects even

1323
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:27,920
within

1324
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,838
the different

1325
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,440
gases manipulations

1326
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:35,358
that we do

1327
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:38,079
and really it comes down to biology

1328
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:40,000
for what the fruit is going to do

1329
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:42,318
and the business having to make

1330
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,519
decisions based on what the biology has

1331
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:45,440
already done

1332
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:50,000
and i think that's the challenge for the

1333
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:53,280
industry and in what they do every year

1334
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,199
so um these are the folks that that did

1335
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,960
all this work dave and janie are

1336
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:59,598
technicians

1337
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,760
luis and and jutong were post-docs

1338
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:04,480
christie is a master student who just

1339
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:06,160
finished and dave riddell is

1340
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,079
one of our colleagues

1341
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:11,318
in the lab so

1342
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:11,318
thank you

1343
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:23,200
for the mcp actually for the

1344
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:26,399
the controls it wasn't it it never

1345
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:28,960
really dipped as much as the

1346
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,318
um ester production did it was it was a

1347
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,960
really i mean that i think that's the

1348
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:35,119
only time i've seen that biphasic

1349
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,039
pattern and and so we've you know we've

1350
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,720
done some um we're actually repeating

1351
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:40,880
this again this year to see if we get

1352
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:42,879
that so there wasn't as much of a change

1353
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,358
but in the mcp treated fruit stored in

1354
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,119
air that's when we saw ethylene start to

1355
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:48,239
be produced again

1356
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,240
yeah

1357
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:52,399
gosh i'd have to go back and and look at

1358
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:55,039
that that people there's a lot more in

1359
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,200
that paper than that that table but you

1360
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:58,880
know they were very careful

1361
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:01,439
um to

1362
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,880
try to minimize the impact of firmness

1363
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,639
here

1364
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:07,039
and you know these this acoustical

1365
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:08,879
method for doing this

1366
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:10,000
i think a lot of people would argue is i

1367
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,200
mean it's

1368
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,039
you you can

1369
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:16,399
you have to use that value with a little

1370
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:18,239
bit of of understanding that

1371
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,960
it's measuring something

1372
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:20,799
but

1373
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,280
if you get groups that have the same

1374
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,960
value i think

1375
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,400
my personal opinion is that you can

1376
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,559
still tell differences because the

1377
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,000
texture isn't necessarily the same

1378
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:32,160
between those

1379
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
and so that

1380
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:35,679
that's part of what

1381
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,199
people were looking at here and this was

1382
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:39,358
this was consumers these were people at

1383
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:41,039
the portland sunday or the portland

1384
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:43,440
farmers market is where they went and

1385
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:45,920
did this so it's not trained panelists

1386
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,240
it's just people who like apples

1387
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,639
people i think um that plot is from

1388
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:54,000
people who who eat a lot of galas in

1389
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:55,598
fact so even within that population

1390
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,159
there were people that

1391
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:00,000
said you know we like these even though

1392
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:01,759
it's not making this these other

1393
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,838
compounds

1394
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:08,720
i think that

1395
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:08,719
my experience certainly has been that

1396
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,400
mcp

1397
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,639
and or ca

1398
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:18,318
really don't impact

1399
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:19,598
sugar as much as they do other parts of

1400
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:21,838
ripening

1401
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:24,480
and you know that it's it's really

1402
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:26,000
determined at the point of harvest how

1403
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,159
much starch is there that's going to get

1404
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,239
broken down i mean ethylene action

1405
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:32,799
doesn't appear to have much of an effect

1406
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:36,000
once the starch degradation process has

1407
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:39,039
started it pretty much just goes

1408
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,358
and and so there's less of an impact on

1409
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:44,318
on sugar

1410
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:45,440
as opposed to a lot of the other things

1411
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:47,199
and so

1412
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,280
one of the reasons that i have acidity

1413
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:51,039
on there and for the gala example is

1414
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,519
that

1415
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:56,480
before mcp was ever around

1416
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:59,599
um one thing that we had noticed is that

1417
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:02,559
because in part of the impact that

1418
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:04,720
maturity assessment for red delicious

1419
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,800
and it's offset from the capacity to

1420
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:09,199
produce volatiles

1421
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,720
putting that into long-term ca

1422
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:12,318
where even if they could produce

1423
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:14,078
volatiles at harvest it's not going to

1424
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:15,119
be very efficient after they come out of

1425
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,440
ca

1426
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:19,680
that acidity becomes a relatively more

1427
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,920
important component of quality because

1428
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:23,598
when it gets too low

1429
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,480
and that number is different depending

1430
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:28,640
on the on the cultivar

1431
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:31,119
you know fruit just don't have much

1432
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:32,799
going for and so you better have acid

1433
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,400
left at the end

1434
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,599
because you don't have much of these

1435
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,280
other things

1436
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,000
and i think you know when when you look

1437
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,599
at

1438
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,318
the changes in

1439
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:44,000
sugar as a as opposed to harvest it

1440
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:47,358
actually goes up a little bit because

1441
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,358
starch is being metabolized but

1442
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:51,598
as a percentage change

1443
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:54,639
acidity the acidity change is

1444
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:56,400
considerably higher than it is for sugar

1445
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:57,519
as as fruit ripens and it sits in

1446
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,480
storage

1447
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:02,480
there is and it's it's different for

1448
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,639
different cultivars

1449
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,240
um in part because

1450
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:08,879
not everything

1451
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:12,959
inhibiting ethylene action isn't 100

1452
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,960
positive for all cultivars

1453
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:17,119
you know we can argue that it's not

1454
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:19,280
positive for aroma production

1455
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:22,720
but it also in some cultivars that are

1456
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:26,000
sensitive to co2 it actually

1457
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:27,759
extends the period over which they

1458
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,519
can have issues if they're exposed to

1459
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:33,119
co2 and so for fuji for example where

1460
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:35,519
we're from

1461
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:37,358
you don't want to treat them right away

1462
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:38,559
when they're harvested

1463
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:39,838
because

1464
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:42,319
it makes it more likely that you're

1465
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:45,039
going to have co2 injury as opposed to

1466
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:45,838
something like gala or delicious

1467
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:47,920
which

1468
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:49,759
have where firmness management is much

1469
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,440
more of an issue so you want to treat

1470
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,839
them as soon as you can after harvest

1471
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:56,960
because then it has the maximum impact

1472
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:59,759
on preserving firmness and minimizing

1473
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,760
firmness loss

1474
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:07,599
the longer you wait the less of an

1475
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:08,960
effect typically that you see but

1476
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:11,280
one of the first experiments that we

1477
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,760
ever did was in march

1478
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,798
with fuji's that we got from a warehouse

1479
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,319
and

1480
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:17,440
we treated them and then we let them sit

1481
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:20,239
out and

1482
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:22,000
we could detect differences even that

1483
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:22,879
late in the year i mean it wasn't

1484
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,798
something that would have been

1485
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,519
commercially significant

1486
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:27,599
but

1487
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:30,000
you know ethylene is important

1488
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:32,160
throughout that process

1489
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,440
at least for some components and so

1490
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:36,879
if you interrupt the ethylene activity

1491
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,400
there are things that happen even

1492
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:41,280
relatively late

1493
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,960
um in our example with with fuji's

1494
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,440
so um

1495
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:47,519
one mcp is a gas for for those of you

1496
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:50,240
who don't know and so the

1497
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:52,239
the the current license holder

1498
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:54,239
has developed a formulation that can be

1499
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:56,639
field applied which seems you know as a

1500
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:58,479
kind of a technological achievement at

1501
00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:00,318
least some you know

1502
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,400
and and

1503
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:05,119
whether or not there are

1504
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,280
um impacts related to disorders from

1505
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:09,119
pre-harvest treatments

1506
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,440
i'm not sure

1507
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:13,440
that that's been very well characterized

1508
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,838
i mean i haven't been involved in a lot

1509
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,200
of that work i don't know have you guys

1510
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:19,599
seen anything

1511
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:21,358
related to har vista and and disorders

1512
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:22,240
actually i take that back

1513
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:23,920
um

1514
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:25,679
jennifer diel

1515
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:30,599
has has seen and actually we've seen

1516
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:30,598
this too now i think about it that um

1517
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:34,879
some of the honey crisp disorders can

1518
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,960
actually be less

1519
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:40,079
if the fruit has been treated with mcp

1520
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:42,318
in the field and it tends to be

1521
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:43,680
those that are

1522
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:45,440
they're chilling disorders but they're

1523
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:47,358
related to maturity

1524
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:50,240
and so i think what's happening is that

1525
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:52,639
when you um treat them in the field it's

1526
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:54,479
slowing down maturation

1527
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:56,318
and so it's prolonging the period where

1528
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:59,679
they're not as sensitive

1529
00:56:56,318 --> 00:57:00,798
to low temperature um this this you know

1530
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:03,279
i think there's a lot more work that

1531
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:05,039
needs to be done in that area but um

1532
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,920
because one right now one of the things

1533
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:07,838
that

1534
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,838
the commercial business is trying to do

1535
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:11,679
is to minimize the post-harvest effect

1536
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:13,358
of this material because they don't want

1537
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:14,639
to jeopardize their post-harvest

1538
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:16,159
business

1539
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:19,118
but um i think there's a lot of

1540
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:21,679
opportunities for that for for different

1541
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:23,838
reasons other than just

1542
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:24,719
disorder management that remains to be

1543
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:27,838
seen

1544
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:27,838
at this point

1545
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:38,440
this has been a production of cornell

1546
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:38,439
university on the web at cornell.edu

1547
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:43,119
