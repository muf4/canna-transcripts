namesake and that is Liberty High Bailey

10
00:00:25,368 --> 00:00:31,129
was the very first Dean of Cornell's New

11
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:33,589
York State College of Agriculture after

12
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:37,729
that College was established by the New

those of you who would like a little

15
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:46,250
piece of trivia the iconic Bailey Hall

16
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:49,399
across the street is named after Dean

17
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:52,070
Liberty High Bailey now Liberty High

18
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:55,039
Bailey had a remarkable career the

19
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:57,978
breadth and the diversity of that career

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,460
which mirrors that of cows even to this

21
00:00:57,978 --> 00:01:04,280
day Bailey was a botanist and a plant

22
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,930
breeder who played a crucial role in the

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,228
development of the field of

24
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:11,510
horticultural science in addition to

25
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:15,859
that though he was a writer an editor a

26
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:20,630
poet a rural sociologist a philosopher a

27
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:23,450
traveler and an environmentalist in his

28
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:27,469
honor today's panel presentation is

29
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:30,920
entitled from farm to fork how cals is

30
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:33,739
leading the food revolution our College

31
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,799
is a strong leader in the food space

32
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:38,689
because as with Liberty High Bailey the

33
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,989
college has incredible breadth of

34
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:44,840
expertise our knowledge base supports

35
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:46,939
all stages of food production from basic

36
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,090
to translational research to an

37
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:51,590
extension network that puts our

38
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:54,079
groundbreaking discoveries into the

39
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:56,630
hands and the fields of growers and

40
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,359
consumers across New York State and well

41
00:01:56,629 --> 00:02:01,819
beyond whether it's breeding tastier

42
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:04,159
vegetables and disease resistant fruits

43
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:06,459
whether it's improving the quality and

44
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,259
the safety of our dairy products or

45
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:12,408
supporting new crop markets that can

46
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:15,259
thrive on the East Coast our researchers

47
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:18,489
are demonstrating just how central this

48
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:20,459
College is to the food revolution both

49
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:23,110
in New York State and around the world

50
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,450
and not to that end I would like to

51
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,850
introduce to you today's panelists and

52
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:29,799
I'll start with Thomas Bjorkman who was

53
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:31,810
a professor of horticulture and the

54
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,240

55
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:36,520
Thomas earned his bachelor's degree from

56
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:40,120
the University of California Davis and

57
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:43,120
his PhD from Cornell plant biology

58
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,099
program after conducting postdoctoral

59
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,340
studies on the west coast

60
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:50,229
Thomas returned to Cornell in 1990

61
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,729
joining the horticultural Sciences

62
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:56,500
Department on Cornell's Geneva campus

63
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:58,299
Thomas works on many aspects of plant

64
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,419
development that affect the productivity

65
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,969
the quality the sustainability and the

66
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:06,879
profitability of New York grown

67
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:09,669
vegetables he directs the eastern

68
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,579
broccoli project which seeks to create a

69
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:15,849
reliable high-quality year-round supply

70
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:19,750
of Eastern grown broccoli for East Coast

71
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:22,449
markets our next panelist is Michael

72
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:25,180
Mazurek Michael a plant breeder

73
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:27,819
is the Calvin Noyes kini professor of

74
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:31,050
plant breeding at Cornell University he

75
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:33,430
received his PhD from Cornell in 2008

76
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,530
michael's vegetable breeding program

77
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,530
uses traditional methods of cross

78
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:41,229
pollination to develop new cultivars of

79
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:44,830
squash peppers and many other vegetables

80
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:47,109
for organic farming systems his process

81
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:49,540
is informed by surveys of the natural

82
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:52,330
diversity by studies of the underlying

83
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:54,639
genetics that allow adaptation of the

84
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:58,260
plant material is naturally managed

85
00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:00,519
ecosystems he selects the traits that

86
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:03,519
that he's looking for in the plants both

87
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:06,040
by what is in demand by growers and by

88
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,020
consumers so for example the grower

89
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:11,379
driven traits that interest Michael

90
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:13,260
focus on fungal and insect resistances

91
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:16,509
that will work in regionally adapted

92
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:19,480
backgrounds to provide a reliable and a

93
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:21,789
productive harvest on the consumer side

94
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:25,450
his consumer driven traits focus on

95
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:27,610
color quality flavor and novelty to

96
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:29,229
drive the consumption of naturally

97
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,050
nutritious food

98
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:34,540

working on strawberries raspberries and

129
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:51,909
blackberries and really good stuff yeah

130
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,889
his research uses genomics and molecular

131
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,340
markers to examine genetics and the

132
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:59,439
inheritance of disease resistance

133
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:01,209
he holds patents on seven berry

134
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,100
varieties that have four strawberries

135
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:05,019
and three raspberries and he has an

136
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:08,140
eighth patent that is under preparation

137
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:10,000
for the archer strawberry which is his

138
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:13,569
newest variety which was just released

139
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
in 2016 and now finally I would like to

140
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:18,819
introduce today's moderator and that is

141
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,709
Chris smart Chris smart is the interim

142
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:23,139
director of the School of integrative

143
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:25,569
plant science and she's also a professor

144
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:28,180
of plant pathology she earned her

145
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:31,300
bachelor's and PhD from Michigan State

146
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:34,389
University her research seeks to develop

147
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:37,150
improved management strategies for

148
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:39,909
vegetable diseases by increasing our

149
00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:41,859
understanding of pathogen biology and

150
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,030
the diversity of those pathogens under

151
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,830
field condition

152
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:48,589
using this information she provides

153
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:51,769
growers with novel disease management

154
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:53,598
options while also promoting sustainable

155
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:56,029
agricultural practices

156
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:58,519
Chris's outreach efforts also involve

157
00:06:56,029 --> 00:07:00,318
developing partnerships between Cornell

158
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,448
University and elementary school

159
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,598
educators and students to help increase

160
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:07,340
student awareness of agriculture and so

161
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,889
now I would like to turn the program

162
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:18,318
over to Chris smart and our panelists

163
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:20,449
thank you well Thank You Dean Bohr it's

164

00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:25,819
Liberty high bailey panel today it's

166
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,310
really nice for me actually my daughter

167
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:30,889
Stephanie smart just completed her

168
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:33,348
freshman year here at Cornell and while

169
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:36,710
you may have noticed from my bio that I

170
00:07:33,348 --> 00:07:40,819
have no Cornell connections other than

171
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:43,968
my marriage my husband Larry Smart has a

172
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:46,370
30th reunion this year he is a professor

173
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:49,098
in plant breeding and genetics and got

174
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,978
his undergraduate bachelor's degree here

175
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:54,620
in 1987

176
00:07:50,978 --> 00:07:58,038
Larry's mom Marjorie smart got her

177
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:01,360
bachelor's degree from Cornell in 1957

178
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:05,810
so this year is her 60th reunion

179
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,360
Marjorie's mother it was pretty cool the

180
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:11,180
family I married into Florence Nelson

181
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:15,710
got her a bachelor's degree from Cornell

182
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:17,800
in 1927 so it's really cool that my

183
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:20,478
daughter can be this fourth generation

184
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,270
not just a cornelian but a strong

185
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:25,128
tradition of women and education at

186
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:27,139
Cornell and it's exciting for me to be a

187
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:31,449
part of that so this year this view

188
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:31,449
engineer is really special for us so

189
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:39,830
enough about my family history I do want

190
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,640
to say that the plant and food science

191
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:47,840
at Cornell has never been more vibrant

192
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:50,480
nor has it been more important to our

193
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:55,639
local communities and to people across

194
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:57,080
the globe excuse me as dean Bohr

195
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:59,059
mentioned I'm the interim director of

196
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,490
the school of integrative plant science

197
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:05,209
and that brings together hundreds of

198
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:08,299
scientists who are researching teaching

199
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:12,710
and extending information about plants

200
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:15,079
and the soils in which they grow our

201
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:17,300
research in sips or the School of

202
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,300
Integrative plant science spread the

203
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:22,969
breadth of topics from fundamental plant

204
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:25,519
science how our leaves forms how do

205
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:28,190
flowers form all the way to solving

206
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,370
problems for agricultural producers here

207
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:33,230
in New York and around the world today

208
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:36,950
we're going to hear about some of the

209
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:38,629
work that people faculty members in the

210
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,790
school of integrated plant science have

211
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:45,439
combined with others across cals

212
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:48,709
including Carmen to bring healthy safe

213
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,980
and nutritious foods from our farms to

214
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:55,340
our tables each of our panel members

215
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:57,620
will speak for about 10 minutes and then

216
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:00,259
we'll move on to the next panel member

217
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,179
after the fourth panel member has spoken

218
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:03,129
then we'll open up the floor for

219
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:06,079
questions

220
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:07,909
we'll begin today with Michael Mazurek

221
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,160
who is a professor in plant breeding and

222
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:13,730
genetics this has been a production of

223
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:16,629
Cornell University on the web at cornell

224
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,629
