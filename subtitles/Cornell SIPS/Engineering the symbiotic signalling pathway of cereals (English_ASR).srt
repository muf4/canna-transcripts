1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,158
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:10,599
University so it's a real pleasure to be

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,719
here at Cornell and I'm glad that Alan

4
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,798
arranged it so that the snow cleared

5
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:18,000
just before my arrival um okay so I'm

6
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:20,358
going to be talking about uh the the

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,278
nitrogen problem in food production it's

8
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:25,359
a it's a very familiar problem and this

9
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:28,320
is a very familiar site in most of our

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,720
uh food production in in both the US and

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,480
in Europe the heavy use of nitrogenous

12
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,280
fertilizers that promote crop growth and

13
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,000
really without that use of nitrogenous

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,640
fertilizers we couldn't support the

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
population that we currently support on

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,920
the planet and we certainly couldn't

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,840
support an expanding population going up

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:49,520
to 10 billion so it's very difficult to

19
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:51,440
see a uh a society that that weans

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,000
itself off this use of fertilizers I

21
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:56,238
would say we're very dependent on it's

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,960
been estimated that the natural uh

23
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,320
nitrogen cycle can support about 3

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,600
billion people on the planet so you

25
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,399
could imagine that 4 billion people are

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,118
currently dependent on Harbor Bosch and

27
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:07,599
by 2050 we'll about have about 7 billion

28
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:10,000
people dependent on the Harbor Bosch

29
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,679
process so it it's it's really hard to

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,319
imagine how we get away from this uh

31
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,280
heavy use of nitro nitrogenous

32
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,438
fertilizers now this is one of the

33
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,920
results of those nitrogenous fertilizers

34
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:26,279
this is a lake in China heavily uh utro

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,519
um heavy uh um contamination from uh

36
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,439
nitrogen uh pollution causing these

37
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:32,920
algal blooms

38
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:35,398
and certainly uh nitrogen fertilizers

39
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,280
are one of the major agricultural

40
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:40,879
pollutants that we get uh on our planet

41
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,799
uh and most of the nitrogen most of the

42
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:45,239
reactive nitrogen that is polluting both

43
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,159
our aquatic systems and also our

44
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,438
atmosphere is is originating from the

45
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,320
use of nitrogenous fertilizers but

46
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,319
actually today I'm not really going to

47
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:55,519
talk too much about the environmental

48
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:57,559
degradation that we get from our

49
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,200
nitrogen fertilizers it's it's much more

50
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,039
a focus on the inequality of the

51
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,680
availability of nitrogen fertilizers so

52
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:07,519
on this map I'm showing you the global

53
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,920
nitrogen consumption around the planet

54
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,759
and and you can see that places I don't

55
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,318
know whether this I don't think these

56
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,639
these don't work do their pointers on

57
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:18,639
the on a screen like this but the the

58
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:21,318
the dark green areas like here in the US

59
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:24,238
and Western Europe and China and India

60
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:27,958
heavy uses of nitrogen fertilizers um

61
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,878
and as I said um with all the the uh

62
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,680
consequent environmental degradation

63
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,199
but I think in some ways a tragedy on

64
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,879
this is when you look at subsaharan

65
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:39,000
Africa it's almost a blank on this slide

66
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:41,919
very very limited use of nitrogenous

67
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,519
fertilizers in in African Agriculture

68
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,479
and that's because most farmers in

69
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,800
Africa in subsaharan Africa are small

70
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,840
holder Farmers less than a hectare of of

71
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,879
land very little financial resources

72
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,039
available to them and simply not the

73
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:55,959
capability to purchase a nitrogenous

74
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:58,318
fertilizers or financial capabilities

75
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:01,080
available to purchase a nitrogenous

76
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:03,199
fertilizers and as a result of that if

77
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,319
we look at this analysis that was um

78
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,479
published in nature a few years ago here

79
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:09,199
they were asking what is limiting maze

80
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,719
productivity around the planet so this

81
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,039
is only looking at maze but if you look

82
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,280
at you can go to this paper and you can

83
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:17,400
see also all the other serial crops

84
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,479
wheat and rice um but if it's in green

85
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,599
then it's already 50% above the yield

86
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:23,039
potential so that's out of the analysis

87
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,079
so it's only the regions that are not

88
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,039
achieving a yield potential so well

89
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,480
below the 50% yield potential and the

90
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:32,000
the areas that are not achieving their

91
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:33,679
yield potential they ask is it the

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,799
availability of nutrients or is it the

93
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,438
availability of water and I think this

94
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,760
is actually a very surprising result so

95
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:41,840
blue means it's both nutrients and water

96
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,239
and red means it's just nutrients so

97
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,759
it's only parts of AR the Arid areas of

98
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,560
Eastern Africa where if you you have to

99
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,959
if you want to increase your

100
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,519
productivity you have to irrigate and

101
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:55,598
add fertilizers but most of the uh maze

102
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,519
growing areas uh in the world

103
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,839
particularly in subsaharan Africa it's

104
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,480
really not water liit limitation that's

105
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,319
restricting growth it's the availability

106
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:05,318
of nutrients and those nutrients are

107
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:07,318
nitrogen and phosphorus the the pr

108
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:10,919
dominant ingredients of

109
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:13,039
fertilizers so if we are going to

110
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:14,759
increase productivity in these areas of

111
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,439
subsaharan Africa and in particular

112
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:18,959
increase productivity for small holder

113
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:20,399
Farmers you have to tackle this issue if

114
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,519
you don't tackle this issue then you

115
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,198
cannot raise the yield potential in

116
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:27,639
those uh in those regions of subsaharan

117
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,720
Africa for where for small holder

118
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,400
farmers are suffering from the inab

119
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,520
ability to produce enough prod

120
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:35,198
productivity now I would say there's

121
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,439
really two scenarios that by which we

122
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,280
can achieve this you could follow the

123
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,360
China model and in China they

124
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:44,279
essentially subsidize fertilizer

125
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,720
production by building fertilizer

126
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:48,719
factories producing L vast amounts of

127
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,440
fertilizer that essentially brought the

128
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,240
cost of fertilizers down to the point

129
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:54,839
where small holder Farmers could afford

130
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,000
those fertilizers and and that's been a

131
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:59,879
very successful strategy in China the

132
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,199
consequences of it is massive excess use

133
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,839
of nitren fertilizers and the picture I

134
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,720
showed you is not surprisingly from

135
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:09,439
China where uh massive use of

136
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,400
fertilizers have led to huge scales of

137
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,918
putrification

138
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:15,560
I would say that scenario is very

139
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,159
unlikely at least at the moment in

140
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:22,720
Africa most governments in Africa cannot

141
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,880
afford to build uh large um f fertilizer

142
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,880
factories to support their agricultural

143
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:30,319
base and you know I would say the

144
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,319
countries that could have AFF it like

145
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,240
Nigeria they've got a lot of oil wealth

146
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,560
they're producing a lot of oil wealth

147
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,280
there seems to be very little desire to

148
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,120
use that oil wealth to support their

149
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:43,079
agricultural base so it seems I would

150
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,160
say unlikely that we're going to solve

151
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:48,038
this issue of nitrogen

152
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,240
availability um in subsaharan Africa by

153
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:51,879
just waiting for fertilizer prices to

154
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,800
come down to a point that small holder

155
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:57,199
farmers can afford them

156
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,478
so that's why the Gates Foundation is

157
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,360
funding a program uh that I had we call

158
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:03,639
it engineering the nitrogen symbiosis

159
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,080
for Africa and this is essentially

160
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:10,240
asking can we utilize biological

161
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:12,159
nitrogen fixation so plants around the

162
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,560
uh through the evolution of plants

163
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,960
they've really many organism many times

164
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,079
they've struggled with the availability

165
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,799
of nitrogen the availability of nitrogen

166
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,519
is not just a limitation in agriculture

167
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,840
it's also a limitation in some

168
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,639
environments in a number of environments

169
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,318
in the natural world and to succeed in

170
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,240
those environments the plant has to find

171
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:35,479
a way to acquire nitrogen by other means

172
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,319
and one example of that uh of of solving

173
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:40,000
that problem is shown here which is

174
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:42,319
legumes peas and beans that are able to

175
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,160
interact with nitrogen fixing bacteria

176
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,840
resulting in the formation of these

177
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,520
nitrogen fixing nodules that are

178
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,279
essentially nitrogen factories on the

179
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:54,478
roots that can deliver the full need the

180
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:57,399
full nitrogen needs of those plants now

181
00:06:54,478 --> 00:07:00,918
the question is how can we use this

182
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:03,560
nitrogen fixing availability to address

183
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:05,918
the problems in nitrogen availability in

184
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,800
subsaharan Africa certainly if we can

185
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:10,159
use biological nitrogen fixation it

186
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,840
provides a much more sustainable Avenue

187
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,160
for delivering

188
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:17,478
nitrogen but that is a hugely complex

189
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,960
process to engineer what I'm showing you

190
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:22,560
here are all the nodules on a p route

191
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:25,279
and moving that transferring that

192
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,000
capability the complexity of producing a

193
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,318
completely novel organ into a Serial

194
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,720
rout it's it's a a big Challenge and I

195
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,280
accept of it's a big challenge so just

196
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,800
to demonstrate the opportunities in this

197
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,598
area I've mocked up this graph and it's

198
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,120
a mockup of a graph but it is based on

199
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:44,598
real data so on the x-axis is looking at

200
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:48,038
nitrogen fertilizer application rates on

201
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:50,240
the y- axis we're looking at yields so

202
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:53,878
it's a familiar site as you increase

203
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,680
fertilizer use you increase yields um

204
00:07:53,879 --> 00:08:00,960
and the uh World average for fertilizer

205
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,879
uses around 130 kg of nitren per hectare

206
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,799
um here in the US you're somewhat above

207
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,039
that and in China we're actually off the

208
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,960
graph it's around 220 kg of nitrogen per

209
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:12,719
Hector the in contrast small holder

210
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,478
farmers are right at the Other Extreme

211
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,039
here small holder farmers in subsaharan

212
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:19,478
Africa using 3 to 5 kilog of nitrogen

213
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,878
per Hector extraordinarily low levels

214
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:22,359
and that includes not that's not just

215
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,560
nitrogen fertilizers that includes all

216
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,280
the manures that they have access to as

217
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,918
well so they're putting very very small

218
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,519
levels of nitrogen onto their fields and

219
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:34,838
as a result they're getting these

220
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:36,598
extremely low levels and I in this graph

221
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:39,240
I'm showing you the region that's

222
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,759
highlighted in blue I would say is a

223
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,759
region of greatest opportunity so

224
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:47,360
legumes actually fix nitrogen around 110

225
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:49,480
around 110 kilogram of nitrogen per

226
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,680
hectare so that's that's pretty well at

227
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,680
the top of this graph uh where where

228
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:56,759
you're getting pretty well getting close

229
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:59,958
to the maximum potential yields so if I

230
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:01,919
want to replace nitrogen fertilizers

231
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:04,399
here in the US or anywhere else in the

232
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:07,319
developing World agriculture I need to

233
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,919
move in totality the complexity of a

234
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:13,200
nitrogen fixing P nodule to a Serial

235
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:15,199
route but in in a context of small

236
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,040
holder Farmers there they're at the

237
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,278
Other Extreme of this graph and in fact

238
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:23,639
relatively modest levels of nitrogen

239
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:26,120
fixation in small holder farming systems

240
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:30,278
can double or triple yields so in that

241
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:32,759
blue window of just around 25 to kog of

242
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:34,958
nitrogen if we can get 25 to 50 kg of

243
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:36,759
fixed nitrogen into the crops of small

244
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,958
holder Farmers then we're looking at

245
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:41,319
doubling or tripling the yields real

246
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,039
great opportunities there and in that

247
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,920
regard getting to that level of fixed

248
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:48,958
nitrogen I think is much more

249
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:52,240
achievable so the process of making a

250
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:54,599
nodule is pretty complex definitely

251
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,000
we've got the um it's a bit dark on here

252
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,800
but the uh on the left you're seeing the

253
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,360
mechanisms by which the bacteria infect

254
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:05,399
The legum Roots so they do so through uh

255
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,200
root hair Cur root hairs that curl

256
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:11,839
around the bacteria the ATT bacteria

257
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,759
that attached to the root air um and uh

258
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,079
they form infection threads that grow

259
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:18,879
down into the root air and you can see

260
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:21,199
the blue staining as the bacteria inside

261
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,439
the root hair uh which will ultimately

262
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,278
grow down all the way in on the right

263
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,320
you see a the nodule that's been

264
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,399
initiated and the light blue staining at

265
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,480
the top is the infection thread growing

266
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:34,679
down into the nodule and ultimately the

267
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:37,680
bacteria released into as infection

268
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:40,159
droplets into uh compartments within the

269
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,199
cells where they fix nitrogen so a lot

270
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,559
of complexity there and transferring all

271
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,480
of that complexity I would say is pretty

272
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:50,239
challenging but when you look in the

273
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,360
legume uh diversity of legumes you see

274
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,079
actually see a the degree of diversity

275
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,800
in the complexity of these nodule

276
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,559
structures so on the right is a a nodule

277
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,919
in medic cargot trun catula which I

278
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,359
would say is the iCal of this

279
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,399
evolutionary process but we see much

280
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,240
simpler modes of bacterial infection so

281
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,078
on the left here is a a crack entry is a

282
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,278
it's a different mode it's not it's not

283
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:13,078
going through root airs much simpler

284
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,439
mode of bacterial infection that goes

285
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:17,719
through where root where where lateral

286
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,000
Roots break through the epidermis and

287
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,480
allow the invasion of the bacteria and

288
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,159
in the middle are stem nodules on Asom

289
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,800
and those if you actually look at these

290
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:31,480
on a surface of a of an Asom SHO

291
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:33,199
you would never say they're nodules

292
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,920
they're swellings on the surface that

293
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,360
have leg hemoglobin present in them they

294
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,599
they certainly do not reflect the

295
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,000
complexity that we see say in medic

296
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,440
cargo trun capsula and I think while the

297
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,320
complexity that we see in say P or medic

298
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,680
cargo supports the high levels of

299
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,720
nitrogen fixation much of that

300
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,919
complexity is really about increasing

301
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,399
efficiency increasing the efficiency of

302
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,399
the nitrogen fixation process and if

303
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,320
we're really talking about trying to get

304
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:04,078
lower levels of nitrogen fixation so say

305
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,040
in a 25 to 50 kg of fixed nitrogen into

306
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,838
small holder farming systems I think we

307
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:10,599
don't need all of that complexity we can

308
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,480
get away with some of the much more

309
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,040
simpler processes that we see say in

310
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,480
Asom or in Tania and they will deliver

311
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:19,198
they won't deliver I don't think we'll

312
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,639
be able to replace nitrogen fertilizers

313
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:23,919
in totality with those kind of systems

314
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:26,959
but we can certainly deliver very useful

315
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:29,278
levels of fixed nitrogen to uh to small

316
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:32,119
holder farmers in Africa and in time

317
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:34,720
time I would say in time we will get to

318
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,759
the point I think it's just a matter I I

319
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,879
truly believe we can move nitrogen

320
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:40,519
fixing nodules into cereals the problem

321
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,879
is just the complexity of the process to

322
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:45,639
deal with 20 years ago I I would have

323
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:47,879
shocked you if IID said we can I can

324
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:50,639
sequence your genome in a couple of days

325
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:53,078
time for a mere1 or

326
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,240
$2,000 and that's become possible just

327
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:57,439
in the last sort of 10 or 15 years

328
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,639
technology is advancing it's advancing

329
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,800
very quickly what we can't do now we

330
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:05,440
will be able to do in the future so I

331
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:06,919
hope that over time we can be providing

332
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,240
some level of fixed nitrogen that's

333
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:11,039
useful in a small holder farming system

334
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,959
and gradually getting to the level of

335
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,519
complexity that we see in say a p or

336
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,759
metac cargo nodule to really deliver

337
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,159
truly replacing nitrogenous fertilizers

338
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,600
also here in the developed world but in

339
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:23,198
the shorter stage I think we can

340
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,240
actually probably deliver something much

341
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:27,479
more useful in the developing world than

342
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,680
perhaps what we might Envision as in

343
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,639
replacing fertilizers here in the US

344
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:34,399
okay so in order to achieve that I I've

345
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,079
broken it down into I think there's four

346
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,399
main steps that we have to transfer into

347
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:41,439
cereals or four main processes that we

348
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:43,480
have to transfer into cereals to get

349
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,000
nitrogen fixing nodules into a seral

350
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,120
crop one is to engineer the recognition

351
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,759
of the RIS obial bacteria that's the

352
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,320
very first step that happens when a

353
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:54,679
legume uh legum perceives the nitrogen

354
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,639
fixing bacteria and then initiates the

355
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:59,559
processes associated with accommodating

356
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,639
those bacteria second stage is initiate

357
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:03,838
the formation of a nodule so transfer

358
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:06,320
the nodul organogenesis the capability

359
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,560
to make this new structure third process

360
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,360
and probably I think one of the most

361
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:12,758
complex is engineering the bacterial

362
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,480
infection processes and lastly uh but

363
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:16,159
not least is engineering within the

364
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,480
context of the nodule and the back where

365
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:22,039
the bacteria present the suitable

366
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,039
environment for nitrogen fixation so I

367
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:26,078
would say that those those four steps

368
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:28,000
there four quite different steps four

369
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:31,000
quite different processes that we need

370
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,240
to consider and in the in the the gates

371
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,799
funded program that we're initiating

372
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,120
it's really at this stage a proof of

373
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:39,519
concept I'm certainly not expecting to

374
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,919
deliver nitrogen fixing Cals in two and

375
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,879
a half years which will be the end of

376
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:44,759
the first round of funding what we're

377
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:46,759
focusing on is a very first step

378
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,278
engineering Ryobi recognition into

379
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:51,360
serials and putting aside at the moment

380
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:53,360
the second third and fourth steps

381
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,480
something to worry about for the future

382
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,480
rounds in the first round we need to

383
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,079
something that's achievable which is

384
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,519
engineering roval recognition in Cals

385
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:04,559
and we know that that Rial recognition

386
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,639
sorry it's so dark but we know that that

387
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:09,799
Rial recognition is really the key step

388
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:13,039
I wonder if I can just if I increase the

389
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:14,919
brightness on my computer no I'm at the

390
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:18,240
max on my computer so it's not my comp

391
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:20,319
not me okay so the um the processes of

392
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,879
recognition that are the way the means

393
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,199
by which a a plant recognizes Ryobi

394
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,120
bacteria every time a seed germinates it

395
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:29,039
has to find the rise ofial bacteria in

396
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,519
the soil and it does so through this

397
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,278
chemical communication it's been known

398
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:34,078
for a number of years the plant is

399
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:36,480
releasing flavonoids those are

400
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:39,278
recognized by the Ryobi bacteria and

401
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,000
that in turn uh initiates the production

402
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:43,639
of Nod factors which are diffusible

403
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,480
signals coming from the roval bacteria

404
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:48,839
that are perceived by the plant and Nod

405
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,000
factors are the structure of Nod factors

406
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,240
has been very well uh characterized has

407
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,799
been known for almost 20 years now it's

408
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:58,240
a kiteen backbone with an asile tail and

409
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,958
then we have a number of other

410
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:05,560
decorations around the molecules so this

411
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:08,439
is the noao Cobian meloi and um which is

412
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:10,599
the symb of medicago species and it's

413
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,880
sulfated on the reducing terminal sugar

414
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,720
and it's

415
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:17,639
isolated on the non-reducing terminal

416
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,079
sugar um and those modifications that

417
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:20,759
differ between the different roral

418
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:22,399
species and that to a degree defines The

419
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:25,199
Host range and in fact when you look

420
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,159
across the diversity of Ria we see quite

421
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,198
a wide diversity in these signaling

422
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:31,719
molecules they always have the k in

423
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:34,919
backbone they always have the asile tail

424
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:38,000
but they have a variety of modifications

425
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:40,719
sulfation carbom fuc cellation

426
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,159
acetalation Etc around this basic

427
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,920
structure and the other thing that

428
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:47,039
differs is the length and degree of

429
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:49,078
saturation of the asile tail and those

430
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,318
absolutely Define The Host range of the

431
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:54,239
different Rial bacteria which roval

432
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:57,318
bacteria interacts with which uh legume

433
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,399
species so in order to understand how

434
00:16:57,318 --> 00:17:01,479
the plant was perceiving those

435
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,919
uh that no Factor signaling molecule we

436
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,919
undertook a relative a pretty

437
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:07,399
straightforward genetic screen where we

438
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:09,720
were just simply asking for mutants of

439
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,600
medic cargo that were incapable to

440
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,919
activate nodu formation in the response

441
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,438
to Ryobi bacteria and this is

442
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,280
essentially the basis of the screen so

443
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,199
the dark spot on the roote indicates a

444
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,959
place where the Ryobi were inoculated on

445
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,959
the root and you can see in a wild Tye

446
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,919
plant you get nodules forming at that

447
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:29,279
site and in a mutant in this case an np2

448
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:32,200
mutant you the plant is completely blind

449
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:35,160
to to the Ryobi bacteria and does is

450
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,440
completely unable to initiate nodule

451
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,759
formation as a result of that genetic

452
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,320
screen we identified a signal signal

453
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,879
transduction pathway that was

454
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:47,000
responsible for perception of Nod factor

455
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,760
and transmission of that signal down to

456
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,640
uh the a suite of transcription factors

457
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:54,400
that are involved in uh coordinating

458
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,480
gene expression associated with

459
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,880
nodulation now at the core of the

460
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,599
signaling pathway oscillations in

461
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,720
calcium and I'll just I can just play

462
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:05,119
you this movie so this is a root air

463
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,240
cell of medarot truncatula that we've

464
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,279
micro injected with a calcium responsive

465
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,440
dye and then what you're seeing at the

466
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,558
moment is just the dye relocalizing

467
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,919
around the cell but once we treat this

468
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:18,000
root with nod Factor you can see that

469
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,759
the region of the nucleus begins to

470
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,480
oscillate its calcium those oscillations

471
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:24,200
are always in the are predominantly in

472
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,360
the nucleoplasm but they're also

473
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,600
occurring in the nuclear Associated

474
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:32,319
cytoplasm we know that the store of the

475
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:33,759
calcium is the is the Endo reticulum but

476
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,519
particularly the region around the

477
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:38,839
nuclear envelope where the channels and

478
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:41,480
pumps associated with this response are

479
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:43,720
localized and that calcium oscillations

480
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,679
will continue for up to 24 hours while

481
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,519
over no factor is present and it's

482
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,720
essentially transmitting the signal

483
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,440
saying that nod factor is recognized at

484
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,400
the plasma membrane and transmitting

485
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,720
that signal into the nucleus to activate

486
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,240
the the the ultimately activate the

487
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,720
production of the transcription factors

488
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,599
in the nuc

489
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,558
now uh the molecular view of that

490
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:08,119
pathway essentially we've got three main

491
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:10,359
complexes associated with this signaling

492
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:11,959
process firstly we've got the receptor

493
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:13,599
like kinases that are involved in

494
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,679
perceiving the no factor and there's a

495
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:18,798
suite of receptor like kinases that form

496
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,679
a complex on the plasma membrane that we

497
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,759
are now known to actually bind the no

498
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:26,400
Factor molecule Downstream of that there

499
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,879
are a suite of channels and pumps on the

500
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,440
nuclear membranes that are associated

501
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,000
with producing the calcium oscillations

502
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,480
and then Downstream with the calcium

503
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,558
oscillations we have the calcium

504
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,679
decoding complexes this protein calci

505
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:41,960
cam K calls calcium and Cal modu

506
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,038
independent protein cyas and it

507
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,679
interacts with a transcription factor

508
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:47,879
and in conjunction with a suite of other

509
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,960
transcription factors or ultimately

510
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,840
coordinate the gene expression that's

511
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:56,880
necessary to initiate this Pro the

512
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:56,879
processes of nodulation and bacterial

513
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,000
infection so we know that those calcium

514
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,400
oscillations are Central not only is a

515
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,038
signaling pathway Central but the

516
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,320
calcium oscillations themselves are

517
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,038
Central and we know that because the

518
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:12,158
gain of fun because gain of functions in

519
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:14,158
the protein cam k um which is the

520
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,679
decoding the calcium oscillation so this

521
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,880
is a protein that sits immediately

522
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,880
Downstream with the calcium oscillations

523
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,880
it's a it's a it's a kise with the

524
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,880
capability to bind both calcium on its

525
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,200
own and then calcium in complex with

526
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,679
calmodulin almost certainly we know is

527
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,240
the Protein that's decoding those

528
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:33,480
calcium oscillations we can create gain

529
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,319
of functions in that protein and when we

530
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,599
transform those gain of functions into

531
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:39,839
the legume Roots we get spontaneous

532
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:42,240
induction of nodules in the absence of

533
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,240
rise obia or nod Factor so we know that

534
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,798
just switching on this protein alone is

535
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,599
sufficient to coordinate the whole

536
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:51,158
process of generating a nodule and uh uh

537
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:52,639
the whole developmental process is

538
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:54,919
associated with the formation of a

539
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,520
nodule so that's telling us that the

540
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:58,759
calcium oscillations alone are

541
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:00,400
sufficient to to activate those those

542
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:02,679
processes and once you turn on this

543
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,600
signaling pathway it can coordinate all

544
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,798
of the complexity of development that's

545
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:08,240
necessary to produce this new structure

546
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,599
of the

547
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,679
nodule now if we look at the evolution

548
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:15,519
of this process nodulation we most

549
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,120
people think of nodulation in legumes

550
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:20,278
and that's very familiar there is most

551
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:22,479
legumes the majority of legumes can

552
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:25,359
nodulate but nodulation is not actually

553
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,319
restricted to legumes uh it's evolved

554
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:30,839
multiple times so the red indicates that

555
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:33,158
s of groups where nodulation has evolved

556
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:35,000
and all there's multiple origins of the

557
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:37,240
evolution of nodulation but all

558
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,839
nodulating species are restricted to the

559
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,120
to the R osds so there there's a

560
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:43,720
suggestion that a predisposition event

561
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:46,599
facilitated the emergence or the

562
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,600
evolution of nodulation but but

563
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:51,000
importantly nodulation has emerged

564
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:53,079
multiple times and not only that

565
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,480
nodulation has emerged multiple times in

566
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:58,158
the legume species so there is not a

567
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,278
single as far as we can tell either

568
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,720
there's many many thousands of plants

569
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:06,679
that have lost the capability to

570
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:09,240
nodulate or more simply probably a few

571
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:12,240
upwards of 10 12 origins of nodul the

572
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,400
emergence of nodulation in the osds so

573
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,440
one question we had was is this

574
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,720
signaling process and the capability to

575
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,440
activate calcium oscillations is that

576
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,720
limited to legumes or is it more broadly

577
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,960
and broadly occurring in the uh in also

578
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,960
non nodulating um sorry non- legum

579
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,360
nodulating species and these are the

580
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:35,480
actin arisal species like older trees

581
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:37,879
that form nodules not with Rial bacteria

582
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,440
but with frankia a filamentous nitrogen

583
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,120
fixing bacteria so for that we wanted to

584
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,960
look to at a number of different species

585
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:46,319
not only in the legumes so all the work

586
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,360
that have been done in the past on

587
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:49,720
calcium and and the signaling pathway

588
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:53,199
have been restricted essentially to

589
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:55,960
medic cargo truncatula um and Lotus

590
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,960
japonicas which are the main uh uh model

591
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,319
legumes and very not no work have been

592
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,000
done on the more s much more primitive

593
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:05,558
legumes like cers like Ci Christa which

594
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,798
is a nodulating species or looking for

595
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:12,399
instance at cers which is a non-

596
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:15,038
nodulating legume uh that that diverged

597
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,038
before the evolution of nodulation also

598
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:20,679
we wanted to ask in the the non the

599
00:23:18,038 --> 00:23:24,158
nodulating non legumes such as in the

600
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:26,038
canabas the parasponia and is is a a

601
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,640
tree a tropical tree that can interact

602
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:31,599
with rise obia and form nodules or for

603
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,200
instance older alus glutinosa which is a

604
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,918
non- legume that can interact with

605
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,880
frankia bacteria so how common was this

606
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,759
capability to coordin to respond to

607
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,679
nitrogen fixing bacteria and activate

608
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:44,720
calcium oscillations and for that we

609
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:46,640
chose this diversity of species and

610
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,240
looked at their capability to activate

611
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,278
calcium spiking and what we found

612
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,480
perhaps not surprisingly in all the

613
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:57,038
legumes that the capability to activate

614
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:59,319
nodulation is is is Broad within the

615
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:00,759
legumes it doesn't occur as far as we

616
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:03,359
can tell in cus which is a

617
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:05,519
non-nodulating legume importantly

618
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,879
parasponia which is the only non- legum

619
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,960
that can interact with ryia is also

620
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,480
activating calcium oscillations in

621
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:15,278
response to its rise obial symbion and

622
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,640
similarly older species which interact

623
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:19,359
not with ryia with with a frankia and we

624
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,919
know that these frankia bacteria not

625
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,079
producing nod Factor molecules they're

626
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:24,080
producing a completely different

627
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,439
signaling molecule they are also

628
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:28,879
activating calcium oscillation so it's

629
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,519
telling us that even though ulation

630
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,679
evolved multiple times as far as we can

631
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,879
tell as as far as we've looked in all

632
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,038
the times where nodulation evolved it's

633
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,799
recruited this signaling pathway and

634
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:43,759
utilize the same signaling mechanisms to

635
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:45,359
activate the processes so it's clear

636
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:47,919
that if we want to transfer this

637
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,798
capability into serials this signaling

638
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,159
pathway is Central to that process

639
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:54,639
because it's been Central to every case

640
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,278
where nodulation has evolved I can't say

641
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,000
every case because there's some

642
00:24:56,278 --> 00:25:00,519
cucurbits where we haven't been able to

643
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,240
look at yet but all the cases that we've

644
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:06,359
been able to look at the the capability

645
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,200
to uh perceive the rise obial bacteria

646
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:10,558
and activate the symbiosis signaling

647
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,000
pathway is a common feature and so

648
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:15,599
clearly we need to be able to transfer

649
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,038
this signaling capability into Cals if

650
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,480
we're going to be able to transfer

651
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:22,919
nitrogen fixing

652
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,480
nodulation so if so so I would say I

653
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:27,679
have to recapitulate the signaling

654
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,558
pathway in Cals now that is a daunting

655
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,278
challenge especially if you think of the

656
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:34,798
complexity of activating an oscillatory

657
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:36,798
calcium behavior in your nucleus I would

658
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:39,679
not like to be able to have to engineer

659
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:41,759
that thankfully I don't have to do that

660
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,080
and the reason is because actually the

661
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:45,839
signaling pathway that we had

662
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:47,480
genetically dissected in medic cargo was

663
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:49,558
actually not really a nodulation

664
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,679
signaling pathway it's actually a micro

665
00:25:49,558 --> 00:25:53,119
isal signaling pathway at the core of

666
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,519
this signaling path the core of the

667
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,839
signaling pathway is what we call the

668
00:25:54,519 --> 00:26:00,679
common symbiosis signaling pathway it's

669
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:03,079
duly required not only for uh the the

670
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:06,519
perception of Ryobi bacteria but it's

671
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:10,199
also required for recognition of our

672
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:12,038
vascular micro isal fungi now the

673
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:16,278
capability to perceive our vascular

674
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:18,079
micro isal fungi goes L goes way back um

675
00:26:16,278 --> 00:26:20,558
and sorry I'm a little bit ahead of

676
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:23,558
myself so if we look at the molecular

677
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:25,879
Viewpoint the the common signaling

678
00:26:23,558 --> 00:26:27,839
components are all shaded in in blue

679
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,278
here or the components that we know are

680
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,359
common to the to nodulation and micro

681
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:35,480
isal signaling and the red components

682
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:38,439
are the unique components so so the the

683
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:41,000
the receptor complexes it's only the nod

684
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,240
Factor receptors that are specific to

685
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,558
the Ryobi recognition there is a

686
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,038
co-receptor called simar that's already

687
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:50,480
duly required for nodulation and Rise

688
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:52,000
obial recognition all of the components

689
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,720
that are required for the generation of

690
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,919
the calcium oscillations and the

691
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,200
components that are required for the

692
00:26:54,919 --> 00:27:00,240
perception of calcium oscillations are

693
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,640
duly required for micis and nodulation

694
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,519
and it's only really when we start to

695
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,440
get to the transcription factors where

696
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:08,119
we get the specificity uh in this uh

697
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,519
process where the the transcription

698
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:12,239
factors have specific functions in

699
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:15,158
nodulation and do not appear to be

700
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,599
predominantly involved in the micro isal

701
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:20,200
Association so the micro isal

702
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:23,079
Association has many parallels to to

703
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,960
nodulation the signaling processes

704
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:27,038
similar regard to nodulation the

705
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,919
perception of RIS obial bacteria the

706
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:32,480
plant is releas in signaling molecules

707
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,120
in this case stacton and they activate

708
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,640
the production of diffusible signaling

709
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:38,398
molecules coming from the micro isal

710
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:41,038
fungi we call MC factors very similar

711
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:44,479
parallels to how Ryobi bacteria are

712
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:47,200
perceived and those parallels go uh even

713
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,519
greater but if we look at how this these

714
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:53,120
processes are evolved well nodulation

715
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:55,278
emerged around 60 million years ago and

716
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:58,359
was restricted to a number of groups of

717
00:27:55,278 --> 00:28:00,720
uh uh plants in the uroid arbuscular

718
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:03,199
mization is much more ancient it dates

719
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,679
back at least 450 million years ago

720
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,120
right to the root of the plant kingdom

721
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,320
so all plants this is what the blue is

722
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:12,038
indicating all plants at least at one

723
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,480
time had the capability to form a

724
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:16,759
vascular micro isal fungi and we know

725
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,480
that at least about 80% of higher plants

726
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:20,720
can form the oscular micro isal

727
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,880
symbiosis the plants that can't like

728
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,360
arabidopsis have lost that capability

729
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,679
but their ancestors their pre pre their

730
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:31,079
ancestors certainly had that capability

731
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:33,120
so importantly all the monocots that are

732
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:35,000
the targets for our Engineering Process

733
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:37,199
have the capability to form the oscular

734
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,278
micro isal Association and therefore we

735
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,759
would predict have the symbiosis

736
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:45,720
signaling pathway so therefore this

737
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:47,640
signaling pathway should in theory be in

738
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,600
serial crops and I don't actually have

739
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,759
to re-engineer all of that complexity of

740
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:55,199
of producing and decoding calcium

741
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:56,759
oscillations I simply have to follow the

742
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,679
evolutionary trajectory that's happened

743
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:00,798
in legumes that is essentially has

744
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:02,798
converted what is a monofunctional

745
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:04,679
siging pathway into a bifunctional

746
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:06,079
signaling pathway where we got one

747
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:09,080
signaling pathway involved in the

748
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:11,079
recognition of micro isal fungi and ryia

749
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:13,240
whereas in serials it's only the the

750
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:14,839
recognition of micro isal fungi where

751
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:17,558
this pathway is

752
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:19,439
functioning okay so um work from utap

753
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:21,319
Paskowski lab has shown that this

754
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,320
signaling pathway is indeed present in

755
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:25,798
serials and that's shown here with

756
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:28,200
genetics so on the top is a wild type

757
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:30,519
rice root that's been colonized by micro

758
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,558
or fungi and all the dark blue staining

759
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:34,519
is the fungus it gets very heavily The

760
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:37,000
Roots get very heavily colonized by the

761
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:38,599
fungus and if we make mutations in any

762
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,038
components of the common symbiosis

763
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:42,959
signaling pathway in rice then the

764
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:44,720
fungus can form the initial infection

765
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,960
structures on the surface but it's

766
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,679
unable to colonize the root so and

767
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,159
that's exactly the same phenotypes that

768
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:53,360
we see in legumes so we can recapitulate

769
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:55,320
the mutant phenotypes in cereals that we

770
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,240
see in legumes indicating that this

771
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:58,759
signaling pathway is certainly present

772
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,640
not only present but it's fulfilling

773
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:03,398
equivalent role in the recognition of

774
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,440
micro isal fungi but more than that we

775
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:08,479
can actually do uh the the parallels

776
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,480
between the signaling pathway go go more

777
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,960
significant than that because we can

778
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,839
take the genes from rice and trans

779
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,079
complement them in a meta into the metac

780
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:19,839
cargo mutants and on the bottom panel

781
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:22,158
here is a metac cargo mutant of ccam K

782
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:24,599
it's a calcium decoder that mutant

783
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:28,120
cannot normally form nodules but when we

784
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:30,398
transform it with Cam K from Rice then

785
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:33,000
complements not only for mization but it

786
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:35,639
also complements for nodulation

787
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,119
indicating that this signaling pathway

788
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,120
in the evolution of this siging pathway

789
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:42,798
there's nothing that's changed in the

790
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:44,439
core processes of the siging pathway

791
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:46,720
that has allowed the siging pathway to

792
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,320
be bifunctional the common simus

793
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,960
signaling pathway is there and

794
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:53,278
functional as functional in in cereals

795
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,278
as it is in legumes so I would argue

796
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:58,079
then that serials have the innate but as

797
00:30:55,278 --> 00:31:01,119
yet unrecognized capability to perceive

798
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:03,038
even respond to rise obial bacteria and

799
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:05,239
Engineering that process is actually

800
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:07,480
because of these evolutionary history is

801
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:10,798
much simpler than perhaps we would have

802
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:13,599
thought a decade ago and therefore for

803
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:15,558
the engineering components of our grant

804
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,719
we're really focusing just on the

805
00:31:15,558 --> 00:31:19,879
receptor complexes what we really need

806
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,639
to do is to get the receptor complexes

807
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,480
present and functional and then the

808
00:31:21,638 --> 00:31:26,879
transcription Factor comp transcription

809
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,000
Factor complexes present and functional

810
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,399
to transfer the cap capability for this

811
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,319
this signaling pathway to be

812
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:34,278
bifunctional it doesn't tell us we're

813
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:36,759
going to make a nodule I accept there's

814
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:38,480
a long Arrow going to not to generating

815
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:41,119
the complexity of a nitrogen fixing

816
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,960
nodule but as I said at the moment I've

817
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:44,719
parked all that complexity at the moment

818
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,200
all we're trying to do is transfer

819
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,120
recognition of r obia as a first step

820
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,798
towards engineering nitrogen fixing

821
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:54,759
cials okay so if we really want to

822
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:57,398
understand this the signaling pathway in

823
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:59,879
serials in fact what we need to do is to

824
00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:02,479
understand it's context as shown here

825
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,919
where the the this is a plant root in a

826
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,240
so in close proximity to micro isal

827
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:09,240
fungi and it's at this early stages

828
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,159
where the fungus is growing down towards

829
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,960
the root where this signaling pathway is

830
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:13,960
functioning or at least the first stages

831
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,840
where the signaling pathway is

832
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,038
functioning where diffusible signaling

833
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:20,638
molecules produced by the the micro isal

834
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:22,798
fungus are being recognized by the root

835
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:25,359
activating that symbiosis signaling and

836
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:27,158
then promoting the the processes that

837
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:28,479
are necessary to accommodate the micro

838
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:30,200
isal fungi

839
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,759
and the first one of the first steps

840
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,639
that we've taken in the gates funded

841
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:36,839
program is to understand what cials are

842
00:32:34,638 --> 00:32:39,918
actually recognizing from micro isal

843
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:42,918
fungi to activate that that signaling

844
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:46,000
pathway so in the last few years it was

845
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:48,840
shown that micro isal fungi produce

846
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,319
lipooa acarid that are structurally very

847
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:53,720
similar to Ryobi nod factors so it's

848
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:55,839
very clear that the parallels going of

849
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,720
signaling and the signaling processes

850
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:59,278
are going continuously all the way from

851
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,000
the the signaling molecule through to

852
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:04,440
the the signaling Pathways and probably

853
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,759
all the way through to the colonization

854
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,519
of the root by the by the rise obial

855
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:11,679
bacteria so micro isal fundi producing

856
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,839
lipo keolo saccharides structurally very

857
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,519
similar to rise obial nod factors and it

858
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:17,599
was proposed that those were the mick

859
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,200
factors that were being recognized by

860
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:22,278
the plant but a second group also from

861
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,240
too was arguing an alternative

862
00:33:22,278 --> 00:33:27,000
hypothesis which was that micro isal

863
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,440
fungi produce also much simpler Kito

864
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,319
oligosaccharides are completely

865
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:34,120
undecorated so no atal tail none of the

866
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:36,558
sulfation or acetalation that you see uh

867
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:38,918
in in some of the lcos and that it was

868
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:40,879
actually those short chain kyos

869
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:43,679
sacharidy molecules those were the

870
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,880
things that were activating the the the

871
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:50,200
the the symbiosis signaling pathway uh

872
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,320
implants so we took both of these

873
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,240
classes of signaling molecules and ask

874
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:56,558
what what are serials recognizing and

875
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,798
what is activating the syus at signaling

876
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:00,638
pathway so for that we generated rice

877
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:02,839
lines that had calcium reporters the

878
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:05,000
chameleon uh which allows us to measure

879
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:07,839
calcium and tested an array of different

880
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,800
signaling molecules different lcos both

881
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:12,960
at the top is the micro isal produced

882
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:15,720
lcos and then we're testing lcos from

883
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,358
broad spectrum risia that produce a

884
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:19,439
whole spectrum of different lco

885
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:21,398
signaling molecules and you can see that

886
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,838
we really do not see any responses to

887
00:34:21,398 --> 00:34:26,799
the LC signaling molecules but we do see

888
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:28,878
responses to the to the the kit ola

889
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,839
saccharides and that's just shown here

890
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:32,319
just in graph form where we're looking

891
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:33,960
at the percentage of cells that can

892
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,320
activate calcium oscillations and you

893
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,599
can see really no response whatsoever to

894
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,119
the lcos but very good responses to the

895
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:42,280
kittool acarid I want to highlight here

896
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,838
that we're looking at very high

897
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,320
concentrations of these sigal molecules

898
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:49,159
10 to the5 molar that's very high

899
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,039
concentration so uh we re re chose those

900
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:53,240
concentrations simply so that if we got

901
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:54,918
a negative result we can be very very

902
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:56,239
confident that the plant is not

903
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:59,319
responding to those

904
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:01,679
lcos so if we compare on the top here

905
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,280
are two different species of legumes

906
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:06,559
medac cargo and Lotus that are showing

907
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,519
their responses to lcos and cosos and

908
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:10,838
the bottom are two non- legumes tomato

909
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:12,639
and rice and really the main differences

910
00:35:10,838 --> 00:35:14,639
that we see between legumes and

911
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:17,118
non-legumes is a capability to respond

912
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:19,598
to lco signaling molecules so both

913
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,920
non-legumes and legumes can respond to

914
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,920
kyos acarid and activate the symbios a

915
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,159
signaling pathway but the ability to

916
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,200
perceive L seems to be an innovation

917
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:30,519
that's happened in in the leg

918
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:32,679
and probably strongly associated with

919
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:34,880
the capability to respond to rise obial

920
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:36,480
bacteria so I would argue that this

921
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,720
Innovation that's happened in legumes

922
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,679
it's clearly important for the cap for

923
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:44,118
the for the for the uh capability to

924
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:45,639
activate nitrogen fixing uh nodulation

925
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:49,160
and something that we really need to be

926
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:52,559
able to transfer into non- legumes uh to

927
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:54,838
allow recognition of roval bacteria so

928
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:58,279
in our project we have as I said two two

929
00:35:54,838 --> 00:36:00,279
main focuses firstly um the engineering

930
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,440
the perception of the no factor which is

931
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:06,359
the uh transferring The receptors from

932
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,800
legumes into Cals uh to allow nod Factor

933
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:10,480
recognition and in the second half we're

934
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,599
using the gain of functions I showed you

935
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,400
we have gain of functions in our ccam K

936
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:16,640
there's also gain of functions in its

937
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,280
interacting partner Cyclops those gain

938
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,559
of functions can coordinate the whole

939
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,079
processes of nodulation in legumes so

940
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:23,599
using those gain of functions in

941
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,640
combination with the transcription

942
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:29,599
factors to activate reporters and I I

943
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:31,719
it's very modest my expectations at this

944
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,079
stage are very very modest can we

945
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:36,358
transfer no Factor activation of calcium

946
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,640
spiking into cials and can using the

947
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:40,119
gain of functions in ccam K in

948
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:43,118
combination with the transcription

949
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:45,358
factors activate reporters simply legume

950
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,680
reporters that are reporters nodulation

951
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:49,960
specific reporters simp it's a very

952
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:52,598
simple question can we recapitulate the

953
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,119
signaling capability in serials and it's

954
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:56,440
important I think at this stage that we

955
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,400
keep our expectations modest I don't

956
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,960
expect to be able to trans transer this

957
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,079
this process and get a nodule but I do

958
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,960
keep a relatively open mind about what

959
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:07,039
will happen if we transfer the

960
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,760
capability for serials to recognize rise

961
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:11,838
obial bacteria and importantly activate

962
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,400
the symbiosa signaling pathway that

963
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:16,519
coordinates the processes that are

964
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,920
necessary for a mutualistic symbiosis

965
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:20,358
with a with a microorganism it might be

966
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,680
that it will facilitate improved

967
00:37:20,358 --> 00:37:25,598
colonization of seral roots by Rise

968
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:28,118
obial bacteria but I doubt we'll get

969
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,920
nodules now unfortunately Ely it's just

970
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:31,559
the nature of having to go and give

971
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,800
seminars I wish I could wait a couple of

972
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:36,000
years and give this seminar because it's

973
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,800
too early to say what what the results

974
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,559
are we're doing a lot of transformation

975
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,359
at the moment we've got an awful lot of

976
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:43,480
transgenic lines coming from barley we

977
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:45,159
have some promising preliminary results

978
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,960
but it's just too early to really say

979
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:48,598
definitively whether this approach has

980
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,599
been successful so I just wanted to

981
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:52,599
highlight some of the challenges that we

982
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:54,760
have in engine in this Engineering

983
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:56,640
Process this is really one of the most

984
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:59,599
complex engineering processes that there

985
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:01,118
is in in the uh in in the public sector

986
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,680
it's certainly comparable to

987
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:06,000
transferring C4 photosynthesis which is

988
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:07,799
another of the gates funded programs so

989
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
what are the challenges that we face in

990
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:13,119
in in in engineering something of this

991
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,800
level of complexity so so firstly I I

992
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,880
just want to reiterate we we're working

993
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,839
on the different complexes so one of the

994
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,519
complexes is The receptors and I just

995
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:24,159
want to highlight again that the

996
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:26,079
co-receptor simr which we know is

997
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:27,960
involved in transmitting the signal to

998
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,240
activation of the nuclear calcium

999
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,318
oscillations that co-receptor is already

1000
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:33,838
present in Cals it's already there

1001
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:35,960
because it's a micro isal specific

1002
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:37,679
component presumably it's a co-receptor

1003
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,079
with mfactor receptors which

1004
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,440
unfortunately we currently still don't

1005
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:43,000
know what they are but all we really

1006
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,720
need to do is to get the no Factor

1007
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,079
receptors in a stable form we presume

1008
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:48,959
they'll form a complex with that

1009
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:50,440
co-receptor and therefore they should

1010
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,318
activate the nuclear calcium

1011
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,519
oscillations and the other signaling

1012
00:38:52,318 --> 00:38:55,838
processes that we need to transfer not

1013
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:57,440
with the gain of function we can just

1014
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:59,440
use the gain of functions to autoa

1015
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,639
activate the pathway serials already

1016
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,200
have ccam K but we we can use the gain

1017
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,799
of functions as a way to switch on the

1018
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:06,078
pathway and the important thing is

1019
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,318
whether we can get these different

1020
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:11,318
transcription Factor complexes to

1021
00:39:08,318 --> 00:39:14,519
activate their appropriate uh promoters

1022
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:16,440
in serial Roots okay so one of the

1023
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:18,318
biggest challenges in transferring those

1024
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,119
processes I would say is what promoters

1025
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:23,159
you

1026
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:25,318
use so do we just use 35s we can't use

1027
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:27,759
we've got many genes to transfer we

1028
00:39:25,318 --> 00:39:30,079
can't really just keep using the same PR

1029
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,520
again and again we need multiple

1030
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,920
promoters to drive the different

1031
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:35,920
proteins and exactly when we look at

1032
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,599
this we've got quite a few proteins to

1033
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:41,519
get stably present in the serial route

1034
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:43,119
what level of expression of say ccam k

1035
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:45,280
relative to the transcription factors

1036
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,838
into necessary should we just put them

1037
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,560
all on constitutive promoters and pray

1038
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:51,960
it's a it's a a difficult thing and

1039
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:53,920
especially when you don't know what the

1040
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,400
out if if we get a negative result is

1041
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,119
that because the promoters we're not got

1042
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,800
the right level of expression or is it

1043
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,240
because there's assumptions in our

1044
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,720
process are that there's actually

1045
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:04,439
missing components that we don't know

1046
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:05,679
about in the legume system so it's very

1047
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,000
important particularly when you're

1048
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:10,118
setting up a large serial transformation

1049
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,760
process that if you get a negative

1050
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:14,480
result that that negative result can be

1051
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,440
informative you've at least try we I

1052
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,838
feel like we have to stack our cards as

1053
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,240
much as possible to get a positive

1054
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:23,039
outcome and we can overcome any

1055
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:24,479
technological difficulties so uh I would

1056
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:27,880
say this is just looking at the

1057
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:30,318
expression of ccam K it's expression is

1058
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,599
normally restricted to epidermal cells

1059
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:34,440
but then when you get Ryobi colonization

1060
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:36,599
and the arrow indicates the point where

1061
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,838
Ryobi colonizing the root that you can

1062
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:41,318
see that CM K is expressed in a region

1063
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:43,960
of the root around that rise obial

1064
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:45,880
colonization so how do we recapitulate

1065
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,838
that because serials they've never seen

1066
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,640
rise obia before they don't have a the

1067
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:51,719
transcription factors that coordinate

1068
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:54,078
this expression pattern when we're

1069
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:55,519
moving if you want to just change root

1070
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,280
development obviously you just use a

1071
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,960
root promoter but here we're trans

1072
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,400
transferring a new capability into

1073
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,720
serials a capability they never had

1074
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,920
before so there aren't any serial

1075
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:07,519
promoters that will do that for us so

1076
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,639
what promoters should we use and I think

1077
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:11,199
that this is one of our biggest

1078
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:13,440
challenges at this stage and you know we

1079
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:15,559
can do something like this and this is a

1080
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,039
whole panel of different promoters we've

1081
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:21,078
hooked up to Gus and then expressed in

1082
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:23,079
Roots and perhaps should I just use the

1083
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:25,920
strongest expresses is that the right

1084
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:27,640
thing to do I don't know what level of

1085
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,760
expression should a transcription Factor

1086
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:32,679
B to give us the relative to other

1087
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,760
transcription factors so I find

1088
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:36,799
personally find this sort of analysis

1089
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,160
really uninformative it's how we started

1090
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,519
this process it's like okay we just need

1091
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:42,480
to make a lot of promoter gust reporters

1092
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:43,719
put them into serial roots and the ones

1093
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,800
that are blue are the ones we're going

1094
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:47,719
to

1095
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:51,039
use yeah it's not I find that very

1096
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:53,439
dissatisfying and not particularly

1097
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:54,800
informative we've done it but all we

1098
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,240
have is some roots that are blue and

1099
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,640
some roots that

1100
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:01,639
aren't so um I would say this is

1101
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:03,759
probably the most informative analysis

1102
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:06,719
we can get on telling us which promoters

1103
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:09,520
we use and here we've text with these

1104
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,118
are mostly serial promoters we've used a

1105
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:13,358
variety of different serial promoters

1106
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,760
constitutive promoters root specific

1107
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:18,279
promoters and then promoters that drive

1108
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,480
serial promoters that drive say ccam k

1109
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:23,000
or Cyclops so they should be already

1110
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,519
symbiotically relevant promoters and

1111
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,679
what we've done is we've driven the ccam

1112
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:31,519
K protein but with these promoters and

1113
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:33,879
transform those into the ccamk mutant

1114
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:37,480
and ask how well we can complement a

1115
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:42,358
medic cargo ccamk mutant using serial

1116
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:44,519
promoters and uh right here is the

1117
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:47,358
control because that's the medic cargo

1118
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:49,559
Gene driven by its native promoter so

1119
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:52,558
that's a level of complementation that

1120
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:54,079
we can get just from the Native promoter

1121
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:57,440
and you can see there's actually quite a

1122
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,760
few serial promoters that do just as

1123
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,400
well if not better than the native

1124
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,880
promoter and those are promoter were

1125
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,639
actually taken from cials which

1126
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,280
transform them into a a legume and they

1127
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:09,719
are activating the appropriate

1128
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,480
expression of ccam K so I would say that

1129
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:14,719
that's as good as we can get we now also

1130
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,880
recapitulating this by trans using those

1131
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:20,159
same promoters to test complementation

1132
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,920
of the rice mutants for mization so at

1133
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:24,159
least it tells us that those promoters

1134
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,039
work in a in a symbiotically relevant

1135
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:27,679
context and they're expressing these

1136
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:29,079
genes and I think I think we we're

1137
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:31,919
currently doing this for all of the

1138
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:34,839
genes that we're engineering testing

1139
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:38,599
finding out which promoters are best for

1140
00:43:34,838 --> 00:43:40,279
which genes at least in a legum context

1141
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:42,039
which will then I think at least stack

1142
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,480
our cards we can't guarantee we're going

1143
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:46,440
to get exactly the same expression when

1144
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,119
we go back into a seral but at least

1145
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,880
we're starting with serial promoters and

1146
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:51,838
if they work in a legum in a symbiotic

1147
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,358
context I'm optimistic that they'll work

1148
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,358
in a serial in a symbiotic context but I

1149
00:43:54,358 --> 00:43:59,239
think we're still shooting in the dark a

1150
00:43:56,358 --> 00:44:01,598
little bit and um I I don't think that

1151
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:03,439
this is really I think we're still in a

1152
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:06,400
somewhat imperfect

1153
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,280
scenario so the in an from an

1154
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,318
engineering perspective this is a very

1155
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,839
familiar cycle from an engineering

1156
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:15,119
perspective if you want to design a jet

1157
00:44:12,838 --> 00:44:17,558
engine you go through this process of

1158
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:20,280
design build test and then use the test

1159
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:22,440
to inform the next design and then build

1160
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,559
and always improving and that's how we

1161
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,440
get these perfect jet engines that can

1162
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:29,000
FES across the Atlantic and this is a

1163
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,599
sort of process in this sort of

1164
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,639
essentially it's a synthetic biology

1165
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:35,599
approach we have to move something new

1166
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:37,799
from from legumes into cereals and and

1167
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:41,800
create a new functionality in Cals that

1168
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:44,160
cereals do not yet have so the on the

1169
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:46,640
left hand end the design end essentially

1170
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:48,960
if we in an engineering perspective you

1171
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:51,078
move through this cycle many times

1172
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,000
before you release a jet engine that you

1173
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:55,920
sell to Boeing and I think we have to do

1174
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,599
exactly the same I can't just go through

1175
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,519
this cycle once and while hour I'm going

1176
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,240
to have a nitrogen fixing cereal it's

1177
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:04,480
not how it's going to work I need to

1178
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:06,159
move through this process many times we

1179
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,318
we might in this first round of

1180
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:10,039
Transformations get nothing it might all

1181
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:11,440
be negative results in which case we

1182
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:14,000
have to scratch our heads and say okay

1183
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:17,760
what does that tell us go back redesign

1184
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:20,000
rebuild retest so the left hand side

1185
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,280
which is of the design and build side

1186
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,039
we've really tackled that very well we

1187
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,800
got um sorry we've got Golden Gate

1188
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:28,800
cloning which is a modular mode of

1189
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,800
cloning you you synthesize the modules

1190
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,240
you stit stitch them together to make

1191
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,720
Gene modules those themselves became

1192
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:37,838
modules that you can stitch together

1193
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:39,759
into complex binary vectors and using

1194
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:41,920
Golden Gate cloning we can produce

1195
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,760
hundreds of constructs within a week

1196
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,639
it's trivialized the production of

1197
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,400
constructs so we can make many

1198
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:49,239
constructs and this modularity is

1199
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,639
actually very important because we're

1200
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:52,879
testing different promoters with

1201
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:55,000
different genes even what we're finding

1202
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,000
when we do the same promoter testing if

1203
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,440
we do the same with Terminators we find

1204
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,838
some Terminators work and some

1205
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,039
Terminators don't work for

1206
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:04,078
complementation so you really need to

1207
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:06,679
mix and match promoters open reading

1208
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:09,318
frames and Terminators and then mix and

1209
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:12,239
Max the genes that go into your binary

1210
00:46:09,318 --> 00:46:14,239
vectors in order to uh test as many

1211
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:16,719
iterations and many possibilities as you

1212
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:19,118
can in this engineering strategy so the

1213
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:21,519
Golden Gate modularity has really

1214
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:24,079
trivialized the production of the

1215
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:27,759
constructs but getting those constructs

1216
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:30,359
into serials is a huge headache so we

1217
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,839
have maximized our throughput into

1218
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:34,679
cereals and we putting 150 constructs

1219
00:46:32,838 --> 00:46:36,599
into cereals this year and we'll do the

1220
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:38,759
same again next year another 150

1221
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:40,680
constructs that's actually pretty good

1222
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,319
in the public sector in a couple of

1223
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:44,318
years getting 300 constructs into

1224
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:47,639
cereals but when you look at what's been

1225
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:49,519
done in synthetic biology in bacteria so

1226
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:53,118
I take an example Chris voy just down

1227
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:55,880
the road at MIT he's moved nitrogenase

1228
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:58,160
from uh nitrogen fixing bacteria into

1229
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,680
non- nitrogen fixing bacteria and to do

1230
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:01,679
so he removed all the regulatory

1231
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:04,759
elements he created his own regulatory

1232
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:08,159
circuits and then he transformed that

1233
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:10,200
into uh into non non nitrogen fixing

1234
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:13,078
bacteria and looked for the capability

1235
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:15,318
to trans to initiate nitrogen fixation

1236
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:17,519
to optimize to get to a level where he's

1237
00:47:15,318 --> 00:47:19,558
getting back to the original levels of

1238
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:21,679
nitrogen fixation that the starting the

1239
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:24,240
starting bacteria had he had to test

1240
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:24,239
880,000

1241
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:30,318
constructs and so to do that he

1242
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,838
roboticize the whole process he he made

1243
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:33,519
liquid handling robots that make the

1244
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:35,400
constructs liquid handling robots that

1245
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:36,920
do the transformation liquid handeling

1246
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,039
mod dos that do the measurements of the

1247
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:41,240
nitrogenase there's no point when any

1248
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:43,480
person is actually doing any of that the

1249
00:47:41,239 --> 00:47:45,479
person is the one the person is doing is

1250
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:47,199
is feeding it into a computer and it's

1251
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,920
designing all the constructs or

1252
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:51,480
designing the principles that then the

1253
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:53,599
computer designed the constructs 880,000

1254
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,280
constructs and I'm doing something much

1255
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,359
more complex than moving nitrogenate

1256
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,640
from one bacteria to another I think

1257
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:03,598
moving nitrogen fixation from legs to

1258
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:05,519
Cals is pretty damn complex so I am not

1259
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:07,039
tackling this at anything close to the

1260
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:09,119
level of complexity that we currently

1261
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:11,480
need to do and the ability to move

1262
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,720
through this cycle I can do it at 150

1263
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:17,240
constructs a year oh that's pretty

1264
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:19,239
painful going so I think that one of the

1265
00:48:17,239 --> 00:48:21,399
big problems for us in dealing with this

1266
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:23,558
complexity is that synthetic biology

1267
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:26,519
plant synthetic biology is just not good

1268
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:27,960
enough yet we don't yet have the tools

1269
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:30,639
and one of the biggest bottlenecks for

1270
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:33,880
us is transformation so one area that I

1271
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:37,159
think can be useful for us and is an

1272
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:39,240
area we're now putting into place I said

1273
00:48:37,159 --> 00:48:41,199
micro isal the micro isal symbiosis is

1274
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:43,078
ubiquitous in the plank Kingdom and that

1275
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:45,480
means even mosses and liver WS do the

1276
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:49,318
micro isal symbiosis so this guy which

1277
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:52,039
is a liver work mtia it's a organism

1278
00:48:49,318 --> 00:48:54,719
that's hloy very simple genetics you can

1279
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:57,400
transform it just by grinding it up in a

1280
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:59,519
t in a tube putting it in a liid with

1281
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:02,119
agrobacterium you plate it out two weeks

1282
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:05,639
later you have a fully functional liver

1283
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:07,318
work so this is sort of as close as I

1284
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:09,679
think we're ever going to get imp plants

1285
00:49:07,318 --> 00:49:11,440
to synthetic biology and the sort of

1286
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:13,798
capability where we can start to

1287
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,200
roboticize the processes and get

1288
00:49:13,798 --> 00:49:17,920
probably not 80,000 constructs but at

1289
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:20,199
least in the thousands of constructs

1290
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:23,159
that we can test in a reasonable amount

1291
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:25,439
of time to actually test the complexity

1292
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:26,598
problem is manania doesn't have Roots so

1293
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,440
the likelihood that I'm ever going to

1294
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:30,798
get get a nitrogen fixing nodule onto

1295
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:33,400
manania is very low but it does have the

1296
00:49:30,798 --> 00:49:36,119
symbiosis signaling pathway so at least

1297
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:38,440
a framework for engineering symbiosis

1298
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:40,559
signaling I think manania is a very good

1299
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,440
framework at least for this first stage

1300
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,640
and so we're now in the process of

1301
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:47,000
putting manania as a complement to the

1302
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:49,358
work that we do in cials to really start

1303
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,199
to make this throughput much greater and

1304
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:53,440
to to tackle it I think at the level

1305
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:55,679
that we really need to do but I I think

1306
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,200
just just ending here on the on I just

1307
00:49:55,679 --> 00:50:00,118
want to reiterate that we're really just

1308
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:02,679
tackling the first stages here and while

1309
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:04,318
the this evolutionary trajectory and The

1310
00:50:02,679 --> 00:50:06,798
evolutionary trajectory makes the first

1311
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:09,199
stages much simpler it actually probably

1312
00:50:06,798 --> 00:50:11,679
is also very clear that bacterial

1313
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:14,519
infection is also reusing the same

1314
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:16,558
processes that mical fungi use so I

1315
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:19,280
think it's very clear that the whole

1316
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:21,760
process of nitrogen fixation has assured

1317
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:24,440
has piggybacked on the micro isal

1318
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,240
symbiosis and that evolutionary

1319
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:29,079
trajectory means that I think it's much

1320
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:31,679
simpler for us to engineer nitrogen

1321
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:33,559
fixation into cereals because we're not

1322
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:36,000
having to really re-engineer anything

1323
00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:39,440
new in Cals we assert the existing

1324
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,798
biology that's present there even so the

1325
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,119
complexity of the process is such that I

1326
00:50:41,798 --> 00:50:45,318
think we need much better plant

1327
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,838
synthetic biology tools and in some ways

1328
00:50:45,318 --> 00:50:49,358
I think I have to build the bridge in

1329
00:50:46,838 --> 00:50:51,400
plant synthetic biology before we can

1330
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:53,239
truly tackle this and that's for me

1331
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:55,480
that's the what the next round of gates

1332
00:50:53,239 --> 00:50:57,919
funding is going to be about not just

1333
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,480
pushing into these other four areas but

1334
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,280
also putting in place a synthetic

1335
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,400
biology tools that allow us to really

1336
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,200
tackle something of this

1337
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,400
complexity okay I'd just like to

1338
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:08,199
acknowledge the people involved in the

1339
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,680
work this is an international program of

1340
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:13,118
research my collaborators Jean Den

1341
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:15,118
Aria's group in too were have been

1342
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:17,200
working on the lcos and cosos and

1343
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:20,880
helping us to understand what what

1344
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:25,078
signaling molecules serials recognize um

1345
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:27,519
the um Joyce Van who's at bti here in

1346
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:28,318
here in Etha is helping us with some of

1347
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:30,519
the

1348
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:33,159
transformation um Tom brutnell is also

1349
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:36,079
helping us with the Maze and the serial

1350
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:38,318
and Ma and teria work and then both

1351
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:40,240
myself and Yen star are the real

1352
00:51:38,318 --> 00:51:43,558
engineering Labs who are pushing the

1353
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:45,679
production of the uh receptors and uh

1354
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:47,000
the the downstream calcium decoding

1355
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:48,960
complex and these are just the members

1356
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,199
of my own group who are part of the ENA

1357
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,440
program and I would also just like

1358
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:53,358
before I finished just really

1359
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,159
acknowledge the Gates Foundation because

1360
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:57,199
nobody else has been willing to take the

1361
00:51:55,159 --> 00:51:58,838
risk it's a high risk High reward

1362
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:00,879
project there's no way I'm going to be

1363
00:51:58,838 --> 00:52:02,759
delivering nitren fixing cereals anytime

1364
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,720
soon Gates Foundation absolutely

1365
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,200
recognizes a long-term program and are

1366
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:08,199
willing to put the funds up in the

1367
00:52:06,199 --> 00:52:09,759
beginning uh and I think a lot of people

1368
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:11,719
will say it's not possible it's too

1369
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,240
complex you can't possibly do it and my

1370
00:52:11,719 --> 00:52:14,838
answer is if you don't start now you

1371
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:16,318
certainly will never achieve it if you

1372
00:52:14,838 --> 00:52:18,639
start now maybe there's a chance of

1373
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:20,079
achieving it so I I really acknowledge

1374
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:24,078
the Gates Foundation for taking that

1375
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:24,079
risk thank you

1376
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,240
yes I can repeat the question yes so the

1377
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:34,159
question is can you do it a different

1378
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:37,078
way are simpler ways like can for

1379
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:38,639
instance put a nitrogen fixing plastic

1380
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:40,798
create a nitrogen fixing plaster and the

1381
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:44,318
obvious thing is to move nitrogenase

1382
00:52:40,798 --> 00:52:46,920
from bacteria into a plased uh where

1383
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:50,119
it's functioning already as a provide

1384
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,920
nit fixation in in a plant cell and

1385
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:55,519
there is actually a second Gates fund

1386
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:57,400
program that's run by L gubio in Madrid

1387
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:59,000
doing exactly that so they're trying to

1388
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,720
move nitrogenate actually into the

1389
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,559
mitochondria the reason they're doing

1390
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,919
the mitochondria is it's a low oxygen

1391
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,200
environment already because of

1392
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,680
respiration means that oxygen is being

1393
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:10,598
utilized um it's also has a lot of

1394
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:13,358
reductive power is very important for

1395
00:53:10,599 --> 00:53:15,200
nitrogen B and in the first instance of

1396
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:17,920
just trying to get that into the the

1397
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:19,239
yeast mitochondria as a stepping stone

1398
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,680
into

1399
00:53:19,239 --> 00:53:23,959
plants that there I would say there's a

1400
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:25,598
perception that that's simpler I would

1401
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:28,440
argue with that perception that that's

1402
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:30,200
simpler nitrogenases a hugely complex

1403
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,519
enzyme probably the most complex enzyme

1404
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:37,318
on the planet it has these unique

1405
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:39,079
co-actors I Sul centers and co-actors

1406
00:53:37,318 --> 00:53:41,558
that are unique to nitrogen so you're

1407
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:43,079
not just got to get the components of

1408
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:45,359
nitrogenase there but you also need to

1409
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:47,039
get those co-actors produced as well so

1410
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:49,880
it's not straightforward just to move

1411
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:53,079
nitrogen over and I I argue that I have

1412
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:55,119
the Prototype I know it works leing are

1413
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:57,640
beautiful they fix all their nitrogen

1414
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,838
themselves not only but many different

1415
00:53:57,639 --> 00:54:01,400
species of plants that this capability

1416
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:03,679
and works beautifully completely

1417
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,318
independent mat fertilizes so I would

1418
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:07,440
argue that I have the advantage I have

1419
00:54:05,318 --> 00:54:09,639
the Prototype and it's a matter I know

1420
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:13,838
it works and I know if I transfer that

1421
00:54:09,639 --> 00:54:16,239
to serials it works it transferring

1422
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:18,838
nitrogen it's a viable approach but I

1423
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:20,318
wouldn't say it's simpler or less highis

1424
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:22,599
it's just as much

1425
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:24,880
RIS but I think it's a legitimate the

1426
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:27,400
nitrogen problem is a huge problem and I

1427
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:30,160
think it's totally legitimate multiple

1428
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:33,280
multiple Avenues to try to

1429
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:36,358
solve yes so so that's a big that's very

1430
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:38,200
important question and um sorry I I

1431
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:40,598
repeat the question so um the question

1432
00:54:38,199 --> 00:54:42,960
is on specificity so we have a b

1433
00:54:40,599 --> 00:54:44,760
functional signaling pathway yet

1434
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:47,599
specific output and I actually showed

1435
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:50,599
you that the gain of function in cam K

1436
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:53,280
alone can activate a modle And yet when

1437
00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:56,559
Miz come along they activate the same

1438
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:59,920
protein with ulations and you don't get

1439
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:03,200
clearly specificity is there in the

1440
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:06,519
leing context that the leing must know

1441
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:10,439
it's recognizing not Factor even though

1442
00:55:06,519 --> 00:55:11,960
it's activating the signal so um we I

1443
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,480
say we've been working on specificity

1444
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,920
for years and I really thought it was

1445
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:17,358
encoded in the structure of the

1446
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:20,079
oscillations because we saw initially

1447
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:21,358
with the micro isal fungi we saw what

1448
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:23,480
looked like different calcium

1449
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:25,078
oscillations but actually now when we're

1450
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:27,760
working with the signaling molecules and

1451
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:29,039
cells there exactly the same the

1452
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,400
structure of the oscillations is

1453
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:34,640
identical between non factor signals and

1454
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:37,599
the signals coming from micis fun um

1455
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:40,838
even so we do see different gene

1456
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:43,200
expression patterns to n factor and

1457
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:44,960
micro bungi that are dependent on

1458
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:48,078
components of the symbiotic signaling

1459
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,760
paway so it's clear that it's not the

1460
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:52,720
specificity is not because there's other

1461
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:55,640
signaling molecules being produced by

1462
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:59,439
the micro organs that my argument at the

1463
00:55:55,639 --> 00:56:01,679
moment it's still that the signals

1464
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,318
themselves are being recognized and the

1465
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:05,279
specificities in the recognition of

1466
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:09,279
those signals so I would say there's

1467
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:11,798
probably some parallel signaling just go

1468
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,798
back to the

1469
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,240
pathway okay I would say that it's

1470
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:22,038
there's probably not much more than this

1471
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:23,759
but there might very well be parallel

1472
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:25,960
signaling if you notice the grass

1473
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,720
proteins which are nsp1 and nsp2 and r

1474
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,358
one those are grass proteins that we

1475
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:30,959
know are important for this we actually

1476
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:32,719
don't know how they're activated and

1477
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,240
possibly one possibility is that there's

1478
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:38,118
parallel sign go sectors straight to

1479
00:56:35,239 --> 00:56:40,279
those grass proteins and the combination

1480
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:42,640
of the activation of those proteins in

1481
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:44,519
combination with sinus is Sign Factory

1482
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:47,598
that means that you only get ulation in

1483
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:50,318
one context or infection but

1484
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:52,119
mechanistics yes yes so that's a very

1485
00:56:50,318 --> 00:56:54,558
legitimate question so the question is

1486
00:56:52,119 --> 00:56:56,680
can we can we just get R living theing

1487
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:58,400
molecules that micro and Fung producing

1488
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:59,598
that is actually part of our strategy we

1489
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,079
have that in that's one of the main

1490
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,599
reasons for working out exactly what

1491
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:05,400
cials are recognizing because and the

1492
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:09,240
fact that the C2 recognizing just a

1493
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:12,119
simpler version of the no Factor I'm a

1494
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:14,439
little wary to say it's just kit saiz

1495
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:16,680
it's clear that K sa will activate

1496
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:18,838
signal inact way but we still have to

1497
00:57:16,679 --> 00:57:20,879
use quite high concentrations of those

1498
00:57:18,838 --> 00:57:23,358
molecules to get a response much higher

1499
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,280
concentrations that used there and we're

1500
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:28,119
currently testing we have some evidence

1501
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:30,039
that it might be de at K sa not

1502
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:32,760
decorated with a asile tail but perhaps

1503
00:57:30,039 --> 00:57:33,760
decorated with sulfation or carbonation

1504
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,440
or whatever some of the other

1505
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,799
decorations that you see

1506
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:42,200
on so we have evidence it might be a

1507
00:57:37,798 --> 00:57:44,318
decorated K sa opponent tested now so

1508
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:45,639
that's very much part of the reason for

1509
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:48,038
understanding exactly what it is that

1510
00:57:45,639 --> 00:57:49,639
Cals recognized for micro Rizal fungi

1511
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:51,839
because a much simpler strategy would be

1512
00:57:49,639 --> 00:57:54,480
to ENT near only just to make a lot of

1513
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:57,000
that signal and therefore presumably be

1514
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:59,240
able to colonize the

1515
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,199
do you have

1516
00:57:59,239 --> 00:58:04,078
any actually I have two sort of related

1517
00:58:02,199 --> 00:58:06,598
questions if you had a guess at a

1518
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:08,240
timeline as to how long you think this

1519
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:10,760
might take you I'd be curious to know

1520
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:13,919
and the second question is do you

1521
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:17,359
envision that you would have to co-

1522
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:20,480
inoculate with a rodium species or do

1523
00:58:17,358 --> 00:58:23,960
you think the engineered uh cereals

1524
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,639
could make use of the natural Rovia in

1525
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:27,480
the soil yeah both both very good

1526
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:30,159
questions I I I think everybody heard

1527
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:32,119
those questions right repe um so the

1528
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:34,399
first question i' say I hate that first

1529
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:35,880
question and I get it all the time how

1530
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,119
long is when are we going to get n fix

1531
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:41,200
and cereal and that is an incredibly

1532
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:43,000
difficult question to answer because

1533
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:44,838
we're really moving into the Unown we

1534
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,760
don't quite know how much of the

1535
00:58:44,838 --> 00:58:49,000
complexity that's present in L we need

1536
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:51,520
to transfer into Cals and exactly

1537
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,559
whether we can do that so it's very

1538
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:56,280
difficult to judge but but my point for

1539
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:57,519
highlighting in the beginning I think

1540
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:02,200
there's

1541
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:04,519
opportunities in um in the along the

1542
00:59:02,199 --> 00:59:06,318
process that perhaps we can deliver

1543
00:59:04,519 --> 00:59:08,440
useful levels of fixed nitrogen that

1544
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:10,199
could be hugely beneficial to smallhold

1545
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:11,760
Farmers well before we're kind of

1546
00:59:10,199 --> 00:59:14,038
replacing fertilizers here in the

1547
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:16,280
develop world so I'm optimistic that we

1548
00:59:14,039 --> 00:59:19,200
can be there at least within my career I

1549
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:21,400
hope it's not M I'm waiting for many

1550
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:23,598
future generations to solve this problem

1551
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:25,760
but I'm optimistic that we can at least

1552
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:28,519
be delivering some level of useful fixed

1553
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,480
night within the next 20 years whether

1554
00:59:28,519 --> 00:59:32,880
that's in the context of having a fully

1555
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,480
functional P nodule on a Serial rout I

1556
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,440
think that that's optimistic to say we

1557
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:40,400
can do that in 20 years but I also would

1558
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:42,079
say technolog is moving very quickly and

1559
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,798
particularly in synthetic biology

1560
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,240
synthetic biolog tools are coming into

1561
00:59:43,798 --> 00:59:46,838
place that I think make it much more

1562
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:48,358
feasible so I think we have to be

1563
00:59:46,838 --> 00:59:50,000
reasonably open mind how long this is

1564
00:59:48,358 --> 00:59:51,358
really going to take and the second

1565
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,079
question is would we have to go in I

1566
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:55,798
guess within a nocular or can we just

1567
00:59:53,079 --> 00:59:58,400
get them to use the native risod I would

1568
00:59:55,798 --> 01:00:00,199
be very hard to imagine how we could

1569
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,798
engineer it for the native R over

1570
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:04,118
present of a serial at least at this

1571
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:07,119
stage I think we'd have to know what the

1572
01:00:04,119 --> 01:00:09,079
sing molecules are produced by the ryia

1573
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:12,119
and probably in the first instance it

1574
01:00:09,079 --> 01:00:14,119
would probably require theum I would say

1575
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:15,798
because at least then you've got control

1576
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:17,200
both on the plant side and the bacterial

1577
01:00:15,798 --> 01:00:18,318
side that you know the bacteria are

1578
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:20,439
producing the signal that you've

1579
01:00:18,318 --> 01:00:23,798
engineered the plant to

1580
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:26,920
perceive I I I don't think problem so

1581
01:00:23,798 --> 01:00:28,719
the question is that do

1582
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:30,760
this a little bit so I just hold it um

1583
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:32,239
the question is do we have is there

1584
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:34,599
something intrinsic to syrial that stops

1585
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:36,959
them from being able to be invol in that

1586
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:39,359
process and why do Cal not have this

1587
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:41,119
capability I I think it's not that I

1588
01:00:39,358 --> 01:00:44,598
mean if you look at the evolution Cals

1589
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:46,160
are just diverged well before modulation

1590
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:48,079
emerged I think that's the simplest

1591
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:50,838
reason to say why seral don't have the

1592
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:55,599
capability they weren't didn't evolve

1593
01:00:50,838 --> 01:00:58,639
early enough um and I think the the we

1594
01:00:55,599 --> 01:01:00,838
in agriculture we've created a situation

1595
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:01,798
where plant productivity is highly

1596
01:01:00,838 --> 01:01:05,078
dependent

1597
01:01:01,798 --> 01:01:07,079
on and is an annual system where we

1598
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:09,599
strip everything all the plant material

1599
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:11,559
off the soil and then come back the next

1600
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:12,640
year and plant new seeds and expect to

1601
01:01:11,559 --> 01:01:15,160
get high

1602
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:16,838
productivity there's there's no system

1603
01:01:15,159 --> 01:01:18,759
natural systems that are like that so

1604
01:01:16,838 --> 01:01:21,759
we've created a system that's hugely

1605
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:24,359
dependent on on always adding back the

1606
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,920
nutrients a natural system has a much

1607
01:01:24,358 --> 01:01:28,920
more natural nutrient cyes so in many

1608
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:30,960
many environments fixing nitrogen is not

1609
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:33,079
the v and end there not the competitive

1610
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:36,000
Advantage so in fact when you look at

1611
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:38,119
Lees where they succeed are tend to be

1612
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,079
the places where nitrogen is limited so

1613
01:01:38,119 --> 01:01:42,680
chalk grasslands uh acidic soils

1614
01:01:41,079 --> 01:01:45,519
tropical soils that are very low

1615
01:01:42,679 --> 01:01:48,639
nutrients so I think I would say that in

1616
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:50,920
the natural world nitrogen in some

1617
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:53,679
context is is the major factor but in

1618
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:55,440
many contexts it's not so so you don't

1619
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:58,358
necessarily have to solve that problem

1620
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:00,720
and there are and there across the pl

1621
01:01:58,358 --> 01:02:02,199
Kingdom many different examples where

1622
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:03,879
different plants have found different

1623
01:02:02,199 --> 01:02:05,919
ways of solving this problem and I think

1624
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:08,200
for cereals probably in a natural

1625
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:10,358
context it's not to be all an end for a

1626
01:02:08,199 --> 01:02:13,159
competitive Advantage cereals tend to

1627
01:02:10,358 --> 01:02:16,679
grow in areas where nitrogen is not that

1628
01:02:13,159 --> 01:02:18,278
Li so I I would say it's not that

1629
01:02:16,679 --> 01:02:22,078
there's something intrinsic to seral of

1630
01:02:18,278 --> 01:02:23,838
sof being able to modulate just that it

1631
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:26,480
just didn't happen in their lifestyle

1632
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:30,038
but we've created a false environment

1633
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:32,119
where nitrogen is the key factor

1634
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:33,520
to I think if I was going to work on

1635
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:37,318
anything if I had the choice i' work on

1636
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:38,440
caronia because it's probably the most

1637
01:02:37,318 --> 01:02:41,519
recently

1638
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:43,920
evolved example of neration and it's

1639
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:47,000
also probably the most simple it's crack

1640
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:48,720
entry infection the bacteria get in by

1641
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,119
infection threads they don't get

1642
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:53,000
released into they stay in infection

1643
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:56,278
threads they fix nitrogen inside the

1644
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,639
infection threads so it's as as far as I

1645
01:02:56,278 --> 01:03:02,199
can it's also very clearly a modified

1646
01:02:58,639 --> 01:03:03,558
Lal root it's not a complex molecule so

1647
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:06,759
I would say if I was going to try to

1648
01:03:03,559 --> 01:03:09,440
recate anything in ponia but genetic

1649
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:13,039
bsection modulation piston a tropical

1650
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:15,679
tree that takes years to it's just not

1651
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:18,039
realistic so I think I have to work with

1652
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:20,679
a system by which I can genetically

1653
01:03:18,039 --> 01:03:23,720
prect this process and that is the model

1654
01:03:20,679 --> 01:03:27,239
Ling there is yet to be an aiz species

1655
01:03:23,719 --> 01:03:28,798
that's been developed where you can by

1656
01:03:27,239 --> 01:03:32,639
although it is not an

1657
01:03:28,798 --> 01:03:35,519
area trying to develop a model species

1658
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:37,879
but I think I'm too far away I can't

1659
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:39,679
wait for that to start the enging

1660
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:42,079
process I think we can we've got enough

1661
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:44,558
information right now and it's clear at

1662
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:46,559
least for the signaling pathway it's the

1663
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:48,278
same signaling pathway I think we can

1664
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:54,480
pretty well say probably similar things

1665
01:03:48,278 --> 01:03:54,480
that happen intive species Happ allow do

1666
01:03:54,719 --> 01:03:59,239
function so that's a very good question

1667
01:03:57,199 --> 01:04:00,759
and I would say that that that so the

1668
01:03:59,239 --> 01:04:02,719
question is how is there is there a

1669
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:05,359
yield penalty when you get nitr fixing

1670
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:07,078
seral and that is a really easy answer

1671
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:08,400
for small holder Farmers they're right

1672
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:10,880
at the bottom of that curtain if you

1673
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:13,559
look at a field of Base in Africa it's

1674
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:16,119
yellow most of the time so their

1675
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:18,720
photosynthetic capacity is being limited

1676
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:22,119
by the availability of nutrients so I

1677
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:24,679
think that there they so far down on the

1678
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:26,240
levels of nitrogen that are available

1679
01:04:24,679 --> 01:04:27,919
that there's no way

1680
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:30,959
even if you're having to fix your own

1681
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:32,440
nitrogen you are pushing productivity up

1682
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:35,480
significantly because you're starting

1683
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:37,720
from such a low L that argument becomes

1684
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:40,240
important when you're starting to can we

1685
01:04:37,719 --> 01:04:43,199
totally replace nitrogen fertilizers

1686
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:45,838
with biological nit fixation and in that

1687
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:48,239
regard yes I'm I'm sure there is a yield

1688
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:50,558
penalty but you have to think about both

1689
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:52,358
the environmental sustainability and the

1690
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:54,640
economic sustainability of the current

1691
01:04:52,358 --> 01:04:57,038
model where we're using vast amount of

1692
01:04:54,639 --> 01:04:59,759
fertilizers and the average farmer is

1693
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:01,960
spending certainly in the UK about 40%

1694
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,839
weak production costs are the the

1695
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:05,960
purchase and application of nitr

1696
01:05:03,838 --> 01:05:07,599
fertilizers so I would argue you take a

1697
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:09,400
40% yield penalty and it's still

1698
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:12,519
economically viable and it's a lot more

1699
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:14,079
sustainable so yes there is a yield

1700
01:05:12,519 --> 01:05:15,880
penalty there will I suspect there will

1701
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:17,318
be a Yi penalty but you're probably not

1702
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:20,920
going to get that yield penalty until

1703
01:05:17,318 --> 01:05:23,400
you get upwards of 70 80 kg of fixed

1704
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:26,798
nitrogen rather than the sort of more

1705
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:28,278
modest 25 50 kg that that would be my

1706
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:30,159
arum certainly in a situation where you

1707
01:05:28,278 --> 01:05:33,960
find

1708
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:37,199
first oh it's wonderful there's three L

1709
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:40,079
receptor oh sorry two Lys receptores all

1710
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:42,239
of back here only two yes there's

1711
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:44,278
there's a few other Lys proteins that

1712
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:46,719
have just but

1713
01:05:44,278 --> 01:05:49,400
not so we're in the process of getting

1714
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:53,919
generating mutant there's

1715
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:53,920
two I'm guessing they're

1716
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:02,199
well it took us a while to actually get

1717
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:04,199
unfortunately MTI poly which is the

1718
01:06:02,199 --> 01:06:05,519
model that's being developed is a non

1719
01:06:04,199 --> 01:06:07,919
mized

1720
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:09,679
species some some Trend everybody

1721
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,079
developed a model plant seems to manag

1722
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:14,358
to find

1723
01:06:11,079 --> 01:06:15,839
one one of the few 20% plants that don't

1724
01:06:14,358 --> 01:06:19,798
mic

1725
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:23,199
sy so um the we had to develop a new

1726
01:06:19,798 --> 01:06:25,719
micro mean model which we've chosen that

1727
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:26,919
hcia which is a close relative for micro

1728
01:06:25,719 --> 01:06:29,759
and then we have to set up all the

1729
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:31,079
transformation Tools in that so we now

1730
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,920
transformation working so we're now

1731
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:36,599
getting chis working that in order to

1732
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:38,318
them to start but the S pathway is all

1733
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:40,318
there we have it all synthesized we're

1734
01:06:38,318 --> 01:06:43,000
in the process of testing transation

1735
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:46,000
with cargo I'm guessing it's going to be

1736
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:49,159
the same all the other we already know

1737
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:52,159
that the sway coming from this

1738
01:06:49,159 --> 01:06:55,078
Trail at

1739
01:06:52,159 --> 01:06:58,159
least so let's continue discussion over

1740
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:58,160
refresh and

1741
01:07:03,159 --> 01:07:08,679
thanks this has been a production of
