00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:13,240
good afternoon thank you very much for

4
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:15,129
the invitation it's a real joy to be

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,189
here to actually feel like I'm coming

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:22,660
home at least to my scientific home

7
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:24,849
where I started and I wanted to sort of

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,579
begin would sort of tribute to my

9
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:30,070
inspirations and science things interior

10
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:32,320
of my eyes to have the gentleman here

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,909
today in the audience that I was an

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,409
ethic of college student I thought it

13
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:37,389
would wanted to get physical therapist

14
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:39,518
and I went there but I was working in

15
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:42,189
the biology department part of my job

16
00:00:39,518 --> 00:00:45,339
was actually clean test tubes and clean

17
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:46,869
fly traps and such and I realized I

18
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,579
really love chemistry more than in love

19
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:51,939
biology and I thought I really mixed up

20
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:54,189
my physical therapy ye biology and and

21
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:55,899
then I met was in ski and he

22
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:58,299
really sort of inspired me to think

23
00:00:55,899 --> 00:01:00,429
about biochemistry didn't think about

24
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:03,488
how cells were working in a biochemical

25
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:06,129
way and so I started doing research

26
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:07,719
really early on in his laboratory and he

27
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:10,359
was a tough guy and think really

28
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:12,939
critically and was very you know

29
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:15,129
attention to detail make sure you can

30
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:17,140
communicate your spine as well and he's

31
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:20,229
to hang out with this guy who I learned

32
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:22,060
a lot about Steve beer and I used to

33
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:24,160
walk across the hill and come through

34
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,960
the gorge and come to the lab and meet

35
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,539
up with scientists and go out to lunch

36
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:31,750
and learn about Chinese cuisine as well

37
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,850
well Christian seems share this vision

38
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,980
of chinese food and also getting

39
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:38,439
together to talk science and remember

40
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,930
over many hot sour soup that we would be

41
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:43,299
talking about what erwinia was doing and

42
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,220
so i didn't understand that at all at

43
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:46,959
the time and so really started my

44
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:49,310
research spark was really studying fire

45
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,289
of life and this is me back

46
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,879
eighteen eighty eight Richard lab we're

47
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,000
hanging out with another student and

48
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,859
really taught me the essentials of

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,390
microbiology and biochemistry to think

50
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:01,519
about at that time what we are most

51
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,950
interested in it was not necessarily

52
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:06,228
what how Armenia was causing disease a

53
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,149
fire blight but really what were the

54
00:02:06,228 --> 00:02:10,580
antibiotics produced by another closely

55
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:12,919
related straining so my research project

56
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,390
is actually how are antibiotics

57
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:16,969
inhibiting the group that we're winning

58
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:18,679
and love are pathogen and so doing

59
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:20,330
simple biochemistry we were able to

60
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,090
actually show that it was inhibiting

61
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,219
amino acid biosynthesis and so for me

62
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,080
that was a real spark you know the walk

63
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:29,000
away with an answer that was so

64
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,310
satisfying at the time it really gave

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,469
you the inspiration to think bigger to

66
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:36,620
go on and do biochemistry in some other

67
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:38,629
areas and what I really came back to

68
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,819
after graduate school was thinking about

69
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:42,530
really then how are the pathogens

70
00:02:40,818 --> 00:02:45,109
manipulating these hosts to cause

71
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:47,568
disease so I don't have a plant

72
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:49,250
pathology card but I do have the great

73
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:51,348
inspiration and plant pathology

74
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:55,219
background and biochemistry they kind of

75
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:57,048
launched me to my career so when I went

76
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:58,879
after i went to brian stas quinces lab

77
00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:00,620
you know I was working on type 3

78
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,229
secretion and try to come up with a

79
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,140
biochemical evidence that that they were

80
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:08,328
secreted molecules into plant cells I

81
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:10,219
spent a lot of time as a postdoc trying

82
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:12,409
to come up with that evidence and when I

83
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:13,909
left his lab there was still sir the

84
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:16,099
uncertainty of really one of those

85
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:18,500
molecules doing how are they causing

86
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:20,840
disease and so I chose to use a system

87
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,000
that he was using in the lab and

88
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,960
essentially because there was a genetics

89
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,330
on both the a pathogen side end

90
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,909
side so looking at xanthomonas you've

91
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:33,730
escritorio i will just use it this

92
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:36,099
strain name mostly in my top was 85 10

93
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:38,169
this was at the time the genome sequence

94
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:40,539
train so we had some information about

95
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:42,399
what was going on but we didn't know

96
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:44,889
what the effectors were or how the

97
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,230
virulence factors were controlling what

98
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:49,179
we call bacterial spot disease in tomato

99
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:50,949
where you see these nice lesions and the

100
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,500
chlorotic out-breath that which is

101
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:55,179
mostly due to ethylene production and

102
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,699
salicylic acids reduction in these

103
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,500
infected leads and so I thought this

104
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:02,049
would be a good launch pad to start

105
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,180
thinking about what is effector biology

106
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:06,760
and I think you all are aware of type

107
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,520
free secretion and that bacteria are are

108
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:11,919
pumping proteins into plant cells by the

109
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,110
type through secretion system and so

110
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,539
when I started my lab there was a great

111
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:19,060
enthusiasm about genetic screenings to

112
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,340
find this whole repertoire of proteins

113
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,670
that are being injected into plant cells

114
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:26,799
and so we use some cool genetic screens

115
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:29,620
using type 3 signal peptides which I

116
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,500
won't go into but also the work here of

117
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,720
Alan comer and Greg Martin they have

118
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,209
also used whole genome sequencing

119
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,850
bioinformatics and more recently from

120
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:42,039
Pluto cesses lab using machine learning

121
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,680
approaches to find some you know factors

122
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,170
so using this information we kind of

123
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,720
have a nice collection of the modish

124
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:52,300
proteins that we calls offs and we

125
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,680
essentially have about 40 plus or minus

126
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,230
I don't look at a lot of different

127
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,660
strains I'm really interested in trying

128
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:01,569
to get at specific post targets and

129
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,910
understand the mechanisms of action but

130
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:06,199
also how those targets are playing out

131
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,300
in plant biology what

132
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,909
why are they sensitive nodes of the

133
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,680
packages so what I've been focusing on

134
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,870
are those stands and Mona's proteins

135
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,850
that we call the core group that seem to

136
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:19,189
be highly conserved among strains and

137
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:22,160
then I'm also because I'm interested in

138
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:23,930
signaling and how properties of

139
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,150
virulence can be shared amongst many

140
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:29,389
diverse pathogens try to focus on a few

141
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:33,829
of these that have vectors that are in

142
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:36,349
both animal and plant pathogens so when

143
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:38,870
we look out in the field for tomato when

144
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:41,390
we find the isolates through jeff jones

145
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,009
work in florida as well as Brian's task

146
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:44,629
wits and you look at the collection of

147
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:47,149
these strains and you've sequence what

148
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:49,189
the effector what repertoires are one

149
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:50,599
thing I just wanted to say was that even

150
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:52,850
if you're looking at some that we have

151
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,070
known about for a while and collected or

152
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:57,379
ones that are emerging as being real

153
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:59,659
problematic in the field they had seemed

154
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:01,189
to have a conserved set and this is just

155
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,930
a subset of them that I'm just

156
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:05,089
highlighting the names are kind of

157
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,769
irrelevant but the ones that are shown

158
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:08,689
in orange here are ones that my

159
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:10,699
laboratory has been working on and

160
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:13,550
primarily because when you make gene

161
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:15,649
deletions they have significant effects

162
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,750
on the ability of the bacteria to grow

163
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:20,659
in the leaves but also their ability to

164
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,550
either produce symptoms or suppress

165
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,800
symptoms so they gave us a good handle

166
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,750
of a starting point of those that seem

167
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,970
to be quite important in the genomes of

168
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,129
these pathogens irregardless where

169
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:35,960
they're being isolated from in

170
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:39,139
California or Florida so I wanted to put

171
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:40,339
this up this is a lot many talks but I

172
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:42,919
wanted to kind of give it as a

173
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:44,299
motivation of where I started up and the

174
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,129
types of things that I've been thinking

175
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,848
about so when we think about the

176
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:49,610
evolution

177
00:06:46,848 --> 00:06:51,259
pathogen interactions we know that a lot

178
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,658
more recently about what are the

179
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:56,059
receptors that are recognizing the

180
00:06:53,658 --> 00:06:58,098
conserved features on microbes we know a

181
00:06:56,059 --> 00:07:00,229
bit about the signaling pathways for

182
00:06:58,098 --> 00:07:02,598
these basal immune responses or we call

183
00:07:00,228 --> 00:07:05,778
these camp triggers a new responses and

184
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:06,949
we know that the effectors now some 20

185
00:07:05,778 --> 00:07:08,808
years later or many of these are

186
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:10,999
suppressing these pathways but we still

187
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:12,800
don't have a good understanding of what

188
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:15,409
are all the targets and what are the

189
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,838
activities and then there's plenty of

190
00:07:15,408 --> 00:07:19,218
recognition by resistance genes or NL

191
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:21,949
ours that are recognizing these

192
00:07:19,218 --> 00:07:24,769
molecules and turning out of our robust

193
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:26,749
immune system but where I wanted to sort

194
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:28,309
of add my contribution to the field was

195
00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:31,129
I was not necessarily interested in

196
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:32,899
identifying initially these are genes I

197
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:35,718
kind of wanted to ask what we're sort of

198
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:37,939
those susceptibility knows what was

199
00:07:35,718 --> 00:07:40,368
really the pathogen doing this effector

200
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:42,439
at this layer so essentially how is it

201
00:07:40,369 --> 00:07:46,159
giving those initial signaling events

202
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:48,740
for camp triggered immunity and this is

203
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:50,240
just an overview of a snapshot in case

204
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,788
people who are interested in talking

205
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,158
more deeply about these and in future

206
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:56,360
talks today but my group is has been

207
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:58,998
working on a number of these different

208
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:02,149
effectors i'll tell you about to here

209
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:04,519
today but i also talked up at geneva

210
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:06,168
about the natural product discovery

211
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:08,538
pathway that we've been working on with

212
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:11,198
a collaborator that's regularly good at

213
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:13,968
trying to find antimicrobial compounds

214
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,490
implants and then i'm not going to talk

215
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:20,360
about if you are BST which is one that

216
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:22,848
appears to be accelerating many proteins

217
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,939
within the cytoplasm and triggering a

218
00:08:22,848 --> 00:08:27,949
very eti or effector trigger response

219
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:30,259
that i still can't figure out with the

220
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:32,060
our genius board so i'd love to figure

221
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,918
out how I could find that in tomato and

222
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:36,500
pepper if I can find some new

223
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:38,718
collaborators to do so and then this one

224
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,000
is a molecule that I still can't figure

225
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,740
out what its enzymatic function is but

226
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,620
I'm comer road

227
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,960
somewhere yes in this default defense

228
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,730
idea where many times you're hitting it

229
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,769
with a sledge hammer of an effector if

230
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:56,019
you have too many in there essentially

231
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:58,329
it's a default of defense and maybe it's

232
00:08:56,019 --> 00:09:00,699
a highly conserved process within the

233
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,259
plant cell that's an under attack and we

234
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,360
have some ideas that we can get probably

235
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:07,569
paying translation so we're trying to

236
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,339
explore that Avenue okay so I want to

237
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,350
tell you a couple stories today about

238
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:13,660
two proteins that we've been working on

239
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,370
for a long time the motivation here was

240
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:17,769
to give the students an idea of how we

241
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:19,330
get to these targets and then once we

242
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:22,000
have the hosts target how we're thinking

243
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,800
about studying them and so when we look

244
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,870
at the time course of infection for this

245
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:27,909
we can either did leaves or we can

246
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:30,039
infiltrate them and with our bacterium

247
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:31,719
and what we're looking at is sort of

248
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,088
what's happening over a two-week period

249
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,830
we're looking at symptom development to

250
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:38,830
the point where we can see spots about

251
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:41,110
in between days and they 11 we start to

252
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:43,900
see the lees becoming chlorotic and then

253
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:46,230
they start to fall apart and this way is

254
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:49,209
correlating with high bacterial load and

255
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,889
what we were missing early on because a

256
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:54,129
lot of the work was being done in

257
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:56,199
arabidopsis looking within a few days to

258
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:57,669
see how effectors were working we

259
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,470
actually had to stretch that out a

260
00:09:57,669 --> 00:10:01,088
little bit to see our phenotypes and

261
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:04,029
that's why I point out we're actually

262
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:06,520
looking in this day 1 day 2 day 8 window

263
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:08,439
to get the readout of what the signaling

264
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:10,838
effect was of each molecule that we were

265
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,610
tested and so what I want to point out

266
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:14,830
is it's a pin although I'm not showing

267
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:17,139
you the growth curves it's working early

268
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:19,900
at about date for today six where we can

269
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:22,419
see the outcome of its effect in

270
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:24,429
symptoms and zabdiel with a little bit

271
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:25,789
later downstream in this symptom

272
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:28,849
development so into

273
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:32,209
signaling if we go back to that overview

274
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:34,310
if we think about xanthomonas turning on

275
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:35,780
Pam triggered immunity we were

276
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:38,000
essentially thinking that sought then

277
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:40,879
was probably working early at the early

278
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,549
stages of infection and then top D is

279
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,990
working a bit later what I want to tell

280
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:48,559
you about today is that we think thats

281
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:52,549
often has a protein scaffolding activity

282
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:54,500
that is suppressing pti and zap t is a

283
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:56,449
really interesting enzyme mimic that

284
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,909
works in the nucleus to repress

285
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:00,770
transcription I'd like to show you those

286
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:05,209
data and then the projects that are

287
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:07,639
coming out of that ok so let's start

288
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:09,590
with up then we started working on this

289
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:12,049
with my first graduate student and it

290
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:13,280
was an unusual protein highly conserved

291
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:15,349
in almost every day at the motor

292
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,409
straining that we've looked at it seems

293
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:20,330
to be a core a vector molecule we've

294
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:22,879
tried to crystallize this protein for

295
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:25,370
years it seems to have a very fun in a

296
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:28,189
structured motif it looks like it forms

297
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:29,990
alpha helical coils and our predictions

298
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:33,380
and so we predicted maybe it was a

299
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:35,659
scaffold anchoring on to two proteins we

300
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:38,299
know it is suppresses PT i will show you

301
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:40,159
those data but what we found is it forms

302
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:42,199
of complex with two proteins in the

303
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:45,049
plant cell and that's schematically

304
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,940
shown here as this receptor like kinase

305
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:48,709
that although this is a dead kinase it

306
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:52,100
doesn't have an active site of cosmic

307
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:54,800
building has a very short lr region

308
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,649
that's extracellular thought Ben seems

309
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:59,689
to be binding to it very tightly to my

310
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:01,909
region of this protein at one end and

311
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:05,510
the other region of this effectors point

312
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:09,319
binding to a 14-3 three molecule called

313
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:12,929
TFT one so tomato the 14 three threes

314
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,370
are called tomato 14 threes or two

315
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:17,309
you may know that from Greg Martin's

316
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:19,560
work and what we really noticed was that

317
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:21,778
both of these players if we knock them

318
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:25,319
out of tomato they're more susceptible

319
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:27,210
to xanthomonas infection so we see that

320
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,028
this is suppressing it probably by

321
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:32,519
trapping it in an inactive complex this

322
00:12:30,028 --> 00:12:35,039
is a prediction and we actually want to

323
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,079
test this more carefully and so I won't

324
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,629
go into preliminary data but I just want

325
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,970
to give an overview of the project that

326
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:44,009
we have a new project in the lab with a

327
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,528
graduate student in drew dustman which

328
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:48,600
is to actually find this complex at the

329
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:51,059
plant plasma membrane and so the

330
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,940
prediction is is that if the protein is

331
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:56,219
trapping this receptor complex who is it

332
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,140
normally interacting with and we don't

333
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,180
believe that this is a receptor that's

334
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:02,220
recognizing xanthomonas but maybe it's

335
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:05,129
working with a pattern recognition

336
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,690
receptor we have some phosphatases we

337
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:09,149
have 14 three threes and we have some

338
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,310
other scaffolds here actually Zoey had

339
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:13,320
pulled out a protein that had a very

340
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:15,869
interesting schematic like this and we

341
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,560
were tantalizing it to be 0 PR are but

342
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:21,480
we have yet to determine if that's true

343
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,759
okay so this essentially we want to

344
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,980
understand what this complexes but it

345
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:28,740
also opened up the dirt of thinking why

346
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,899
is it trapping 14 three threes because

347
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,240
14 three threes are really important

348
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:36,629
signaling molecules in organizing

349
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,700
protein complexes also for organizing

350
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:41,669
and activating or repressing enzyme

351
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:44,339
activity and so 14 three three proteins

352
00:13:41,669 --> 00:13:46,588
are actually dimers they can be homo

353
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:48,180
dimers so you can see two molecules here

354
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:49,180
and they're binding phosphate groups

355
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:51,489
generally on

356
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:53,259
cartoons and you'll find that these in

357
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:55,960
many data sets that people have been

358
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:58,090
publishing seem to be nodes or targets

359
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,250
of effector proteins and so we got

360
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,470
really inspired by this so thinking one

361
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,330
we don't know very much about 14 three

362
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:06,730
threes in plant biology or eukaryotic

363
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:09,100
signaling in general and we don't really

364
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,620
understand why effector molecules with

365
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:14,980
positive so we'll think about how your

366
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,960
mole proteins on 243 three themselves

367
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:20,110
and so if you take a look at this

368
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:22,090
schematic you have 14 33 divers here you

369
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,310
have a client essentially can come in

370
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:27,430
here often the clients get

371
00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:29,409
phosphorylated by kindnesses 14 three

372
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:31,299
threes like to bind to phosphorylated

373
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:33,939
residue so you can see they'll anchor in

374
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:36,159
here nicely and then what can have

375
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:38,650
different outcomes of these interactions

376
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:41,169
one that can bring proteins together and

377
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:43,090
assemble them for signaling or they can

378
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:46,059
turn her on and off an enzymatic

379
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:48,790
activity so we thought hmm this could be

380
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:51,099
very powerful for a pathogen if you can

381
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:53,349
rewire how these guys are talking to

382
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:58,029
host proteins you could affect the main

383
00:14:53,350 --> 00:15:00,580
responses or other pathways so we asked

384
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:03,069
a simple question our effectors clients

385
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:05,950
are they actually being you know bound

386
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:09,370
into the biggest 14 33 complexes to

387
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:11,980
become activated or are they antagonists

388
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:14,230
by trying to disrupt their function it

389
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,899
was just a simple question and what we

390
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:18,670
see from the literature excuse me is

391
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:21,399
that at least in animal pathogens

392
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:23,139
pseudomonas aeruginosa there's evidence

393
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:25,750
that they are actually clients and

394
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:29,500
here's an example for the effector

395
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:31,960
called xos this protein actually has a

396
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,600
DP red-hot fossil transferase activity

397
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,639
the detail of that is not important but

398
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,500
it's very important for having cytotoxic

399
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,259
effects in

400
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,179
mice and what it does is it needs to bar

401
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:44,970
into this complex to become enzymatic

402
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:47,099
attractive so there's a client sounds

403
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:50,670
like a chaperone or scaffold for

404
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,290
activation in our work it seems that

405
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:54,539
it's out then seems to be the antagonist

406
00:15:52,289 --> 00:15:57,779
it's interfering with its activity

407
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:59,909
because we've shown that T of T 11 of

408
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:02,909
the isoforms and tomato is required for

409
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:07,709
pti so we're a conflict which way to go

410
00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:10,110
how are these 14 33 is being co-opted so

411
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:11,610
we then looked into the literature and I

412
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,470
brought up some of the nice work that's

413
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,330
been done in Greg Martin slab because

414
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:18,600
he's been actually looking at the 14th

415
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:20,550
we please in a UTI so my group was

416
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,399
focusing a lot trying to understand how

417
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:24,419
pti signaling was being abrogated but

418
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,000
then when you take a look at the

419
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:30,419
Pseudomonas tomato model Greg's nicely

420
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,500
shown the AVR pto in PT oprf signaling

421
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:36,629
actually requires TFT seven and so it's

422
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,879
requiring the scaffolding protein to

423
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:40,710
organize my creamy signaling which is

424
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,919
leading to program cell death or

425
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:45,210
resistance activation and he also showed

426
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,729
that that was required for other

427
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:50,339
effector out protein combinations so

428
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:52,980
they seem to be important molecules in

429
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:54,810
signaling and then we see from other

430
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,240
Arab adopts asst tobacco and rice

431
00:16:54,809 --> 00:17:00,959
systems that you'll find other our genes

432
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:05,250
like our pw a means to form a scaffold

433
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:07,860
with a 14 33 tmv the virus is also

434
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,990
requiring 14 33 interactions for

435
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:12,389
signaling and then Jim leeches group

436
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:15,660
shown that another isoform actually is

437
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:18,030
required to turn off resistance and that

438
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,029
was shown in rice so there's a lot of

439
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:22,680
different ways of these molecules to be

440
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:24,420
contributing to immunity until we set

441
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,029
out to try to figure this out a little

442
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:29,340
bit more detail and so this was a

443
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:31,329
collaboration that we actually did with

444
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:33,129
greg martin and

445
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:36,158
and it seems I've been tel aviv

446
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:38,409
university and zoe so that graduation

447
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:42,240
day conditions embarrassed but i'm like

448
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:47,230
her mother i have to embarrass it Oh

449
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:50,109
Jessie great mark sorry he's there sorry

450
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:53,019
we know is in figs valve you know call a

451
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:54,579
connection okay so and then I also

452
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:57,429
talked about the work that this young

453
00:17:54,579 --> 00:18:00,699
gun Kim has contributed to this project

454
00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:03,460
and so we simply set out for really just

455
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,409
simple aims which was to ask you know

456
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,210
elucidating the roles of these fourteen

457
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:09,760
three threes in both Heather and Ricky

458
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:12,450
immunity but also affect your trigger

459
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:15,398
community we have the hypothesis that

460
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:18,308
Adam xanthomonas if you had 40 affect

461
00:18:15,398 --> 00:18:20,678
your genes how many of those all a few

462
00:18:18,308 --> 00:18:23,230
are targeting 14 three threes as a new

463
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:25,179
and so that was a brute force screen to

464
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:26,919
actually determine if it's just a few is

465
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:28,899
this an exception or is this actually a

466
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:30,788
hotspot and then we look at the

467
00:18:28,898 --> 00:18:32,829
phosphorylation state of these affect

468
00:18:30,788 --> 00:18:35,200
your complexes to see it's a

469
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:37,599
phosphorylation required for binding and

470
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,298
then also what is the requirement of

471
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,888
these complexes during event it's all

472
00:18:40,298 --> 00:18:43,480
just highlight some of this work moving

473
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:46,209
forward this is something that we're

474
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,130
getting ready to submit and the first

475
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:50,889
thing that we ask because there's 12

476
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:53,440
isoforms of 14 three threes and tomato

477
00:18:50,888 --> 00:18:56,229
and they're listed here TFT 1 through 12

478
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,538
and we simply wanted to ask you know

479
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:00,940
when are these TF cheese express during

480
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:03,269
infection are some of them induced and

481
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,889
turned on only during immune responses

482
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:08,200
can we knock them down either using

483
00:19:05,888 --> 00:19:10,479
viruses or stable knock downs and see

484
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,150
what their phenotypes are drink

485
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:17,740
this tomato interaction and then we also

486
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:20,710
monitor eti of ethylene responses to see

487
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:22,960
how this is important in the pathogen

488
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,150
interaction now I should know what we

489
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,660
use a particular strain here this is

490
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:31,480
different than 85 10 this is a t3 race

491
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:34,058
of xanthomonas it has this effect regime

492
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,679
avrx game three and the reason why we

493
00:19:34,058 --> 00:19:38,230
use this strain because we have strains

494
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,570
with it and without we want to study the

495
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:43,720
ability to turn on resistance and if xp3

496
00:19:40,569 --> 00:19:46,210
Hawaii tomato background so turning on

497
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,160
our gene resistance we also have strains

498
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:53,860
of lack this effective so we can look at

499
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:55,929
the susceptible interaction okay so what

500
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:58,029
we see here is that if you look at we

501
00:19:55,929 --> 00:20:01,179
looked at eleven isoforms shown at the

502
00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:03,759
bottom TMT 1 through 11 we're looking

503
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:05,980
simply at the induction of the mRNA

504
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:08,679
abundance for these isoforms over time

505
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:10,900
in tomato and I just wanted to show you

506
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:13,750
that if you look at Mach and gray I'll

507
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:16,090
just use this as an example 40ft one if

508
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:19,839
you have x EV that's turning out pti you

509
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:21,759
see the 50 expression faces too old and

510
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:24,129
then you see now you have a larger

511
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:26,200
induction when you have eti and so

512
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,179
you'll see that where i have it starred

513
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,190
these are showing that we can see

514
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:33,190
significant increase or induction of

515
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:36,370
these tMT's gene expression in response

516
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:38,740
to etim pti but more robust through an

517
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:40,298
immediate response we were a little bit

518
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,190
happy with this because it kind of

519
00:20:40,298 --> 00:20:43,900
suggested that maybe only some of these

520
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:46,660
isoforms are involved in the immune

521
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:49,030
response but actually when we went in

522
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:52,090
silence them or Staveley knock them down

523
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:54,099
they all seem to be contributing at some

524
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:57,009
level to resistance and that that's

525
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:58,689
unexpected and so you can see this here

526
00:20:57,009 --> 00:20:59,869
it's a little busy but what we're

527
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,600
looking if you folk

528
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:04,489
day 8 this was a viral knockdown so we

529
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:07,159
use the TRV vector so this is vector

530
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:09,319
control to consume the pathogen is not

531
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,779
growing very well here and then all of

532
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:13,879
the isoforms that we had silenced

533
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:16,039
actually had at least a log or almost

534
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,720
two logs increase of bacterial tighter

535
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:19,879
so you can see that they're more

536
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:23,058
susceptible and they were as susceptible

537
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:26,120
as other maidens that we know are highly

538
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:27,829
susceptible or knocked out so that was a

539
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:30,079
little bit surprising so that means are

540
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:32,359
all contributing at some level to

541
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:33,919
resistance and then if you take a look

542
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:36,019
at the phenotypes in terms of the

543
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,870
pathology what you see in the better

544
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:41,900
control over time these are over several

545
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:44,299
days we'll see no symptom development

546
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:47,210
here or few symptoms at this time point

547
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:50,178
this is like day four or six but you had

548
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:51,860
been seen with TFT one now you see when

549
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:53,690
you knock down this gene you start to

550
00:21:51,859 --> 00:22:00,169
see spot coming up and you can see

551
00:21:53,690 --> 00:22:02,029
various disease symptoms here okay so

552
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:04,460
the take-home so far for this is really

553
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:06,829
that all of these TFT isoforms seem to

554
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:10,100
be contributing to eti and are not

555
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:11,928
showing you the pti data set so what

556
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:14,269
we've decided to do is actually try to

557
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:16,340
construct stable lines where we can

558
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:18,170
actually knock out a subset of things

559
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:20,029
and really say can we figure out which

560
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:23,840
combination of these genes are really

561
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:25,369
critical for for immunity and the other

562
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:26,990
thing that we're interested in doing is

563
00:22:25,369 --> 00:22:29,058
we have many tag the lines of these

564
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:31,609
tMT's because we want to actually purify

565
00:22:29,058 --> 00:22:33,470
the complexes and not do a candidate

566
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:35,149
approach but actually let the plant tell

567
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:37,100
you who they are interacting with and

568
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:39,620
understand how the pathogen are

569
00:22:37,099 --> 00:22:43,058
targeting these TFC protein complexes

570
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:43,058
and that's future work

571
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:48,009
so the next question that we try to get

572
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:51,750
at was which the damn Pomona's effectors

573
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:51,750
are actually being targeted for

574
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:57,130
targeting TFT s within the plant cell so

575
00:22:55,509 --> 00:23:00,400
that we did a simple experiment which

576
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:03,220
was just a complete profile of the 40

577
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,290
effectors that we had we took the 11

578
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,059
isoforms of TF TS and we did

579
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:10,299
protein-protein interactions and asked

580
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:12,639
who comes out of that what we found was

581
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:15,789
it was only a subset but a significant

582
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,580
subset so we found 8 abductors that seem

583
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:20,740
to mind too many different 14 33

584
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:22,509
proteins I thought I'd just give you an

585
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:25,059
example of what that looks like we did

586
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:27,069
this multiple times but so that's always

587
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:29,559
kind of surprising because for example

588
00:23:27,069 --> 00:23:31,509
this one protein called a 1 if you look

589
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:32,889
at the different isoforms in a

590
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:35,410
two-hybrid you're looking for either

591
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:37,330
growth or the turning on the blue color

592
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:39,460
you can see that actually it seems to

593
00:23:37,329 --> 00:23:42,309
have significant finding too many of the

594
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:44,650
isoforms so not really good specificity

595
00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:47,139
but that might also tell us why many of

596
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:51,640
these isoforms are required for the

597
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:53,470
infection condition so we went back we

598
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,000
looked at this list again these are

599
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:57,430
names you don't have to worry about the

600
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,430
names but what was important was our

601
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:02,140
initial candidate that interacts with 14

602
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:04,570
three trees came out so that was a

603
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,759
positive control we also found another

604
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:09,730
protein if we assess it we have been

605
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:11,680
working on sup q and then guido has also

606
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:13,150
found this other protein called zap a

607
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,549
view and keep your eyes peeled for that

608
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:18,100
because this is the first identification

609
00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:19,690
is shown that this is a kinase its first

610
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:22,809
bacterial effector kindness that we've

611
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:25,509
seen it's working in plants and it seems

612
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:28,519
to be targeting 14 33 complexes that are

613
00:24:25,509 --> 00:24:31,669
required you think for UTI and pti

614
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:33,378
he has a very nice story on that what we

615
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:36,200
actually they wanted to do is say do

616
00:24:33,378 --> 00:24:38,329
these things actually interact in planta

617
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:41,149
this is a lot of yeast interaction

618
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:43,608
studies so here's where Zoey came in on

619
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:45,918
the project where she actually was

620
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:49,428
testing how these proteins were

621
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,229
interacting with tMT's in planta and we

622
00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:53,389
added one more to the list because this

623
00:24:51,229 --> 00:24:56,179
auto activates ed system but it's very

624
00:24:53,388 --> 00:24:58,728
similar in sequences out the one so we

625
00:24:56,179 --> 00:25:00,320
included that in our study and off that

626
00:24:58,729 --> 00:25:03,200
will be the focus over for the rest of

627
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:06,588
the work so it's only do that she

628
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,899
started out doing a by fluorescence

629
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:11,450
complementation she took the effector

630
00:25:08,898 --> 00:25:14,148
with a half of the gfp-tagged teach of

631
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:17,209
the TFT s all of them and with a half of

632
00:25:14,148 --> 00:25:19,548
TFT our gfp-tagged and acid they come

633
00:25:17,209 --> 00:25:20,989
together to get fluorescence and she did

634
00:25:19,548 --> 00:25:23,658
that with all of the effectors we had

635
00:25:20,989 --> 00:25:25,009
identified and all of the 11 I supports

636
00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:27,109
and that's why I think she's a super

637
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:29,929
graduate soon she actually went to a

638
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:31,489
group for us and did all of that and but

639
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:34,309
you can see here is it with the positive

640
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:36,588
control we have safa and tia to one you

641
00:25:34,308 --> 00:25:39,398
see in these medical cells epidermal

642
00:25:36,588 --> 00:25:42,048
layers you can see that nice cytoplasmic

643
00:25:39,398 --> 00:25:43,848
localization we know that it's off n is

644
00:25:42,048 --> 00:25:46,459
actually interacting near the membrane

645
00:25:43,848 --> 00:25:48,918
so that pattern looks okay what we would

646
00:25:46,459 --> 00:25:50,808
expect give a negative control for

647
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:53,269
zombie too so it should be dark and we

648
00:25:50,808 --> 00:25:55,940
actually see some fluorescence but not

649
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:58,069
much and then here's one isoform to ft

650
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,778
10 she could see nicely that it also

651
00:25:58,069 --> 00:26:02,049
looked like it was more membrane

652
00:25:59,778 --> 00:26:05,349
cytoplasmic localized but not

653
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:07,569
necessarily in the nucleus we have a BRB

654
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:09,759
s2 which is a protease that France at

655
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:11,740
scotts is been working a long time on it

656
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:14,710
came out of our screen but actually it

657
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:17,799
didn't just show up be validated in

658
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:19,720
planta and so Zoey being a good student

659
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:21,490
said I don't really buy this by fact

660
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,710
data I think that maybe you should try

661
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:26,589
something else to actually confirm these

662
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:30,299
interactions and so went about it doing

663
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:34,809
another assay which is doing you may

664
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:37,299
affinity purification assays so out of

665
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:40,480
this screen we sort of dropping out a VR

666
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:42,250
ps2 maybe that's a false positive we

667
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,160
think that these three are definitely

668
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:47,710
and unfortunately these proteins were

669
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:49,810
not being very well expressed in our

670
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:52,120
bypass that seems to be a complication

671
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:54,369
of the audacity but also probably

672
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:55,750
because they're unstable proteins and we

673
00:26:54,369 --> 00:26:58,839
haven't figured out a way to get around

674
00:26:55,750 --> 00:27:00,670
that so we tried it a little bit harder

675
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:03,519
to do the pull downs and see if we keep

676
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:06,220
yer off' I them so this is taking the

677
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:08,230
effector putting his tag on it doing

678
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:10,630
nipple affinity purification so we're

679
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:13,930
pulling out the effector and asking does

680
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:15,700
it come along with it TFT and just focus

681
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:18,100
your eyes here I can walk you through

682
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,710
this we can use a negative control desk

683
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:23,169
we can purify gusts really well and you

684
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:26,799
can see that there's no TFT that is hope

685
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:29,560
you're fine with it AVR bs2 was the one

686
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,329
that we had we could purify it came out

687
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:33,669
of our screen but we still don't have

688
00:27:31,329 --> 00:27:38,619
any evidence that it interacts with TFG

689
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:40,450
so again false positive zap need one we

690
00:27:38,619 --> 00:27:42,309
can enrich for it a bit but we can also

691
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:45,819
pull out that TFT so it's a positive

692
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:47,440
case e to actually compute Phi that well

693
00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:48,269
and that kind of compliments that by

694
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,849
fact in Dallas

695
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:54,149
to detect it there you can see it's

696
00:27:50,848 --> 00:27:57,118
purifying tf2 10 here and then zap oh

697
00:27:54,148 --> 00:27:59,338
also poorly Express we can purify some

698
00:27:57,118 --> 00:28:01,168
of it and then see its interactive and

699
00:27:59,338 --> 00:28:03,108
so we were quite satisfied we could at

700
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:06,299
least see in these pull downs that

701
00:28:03,108 --> 00:28:09,269
application and code precipitation with

702
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:13,288
tMT's militia one isoform but we have

703
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:14,700
others that shoots also looked at so the

704
00:28:13,288 --> 00:28:16,288
other thing you can know is every time

705
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,659
she was doing these pull downs we'd see

706
00:28:16,288 --> 00:28:20,848
these hydraulic ulor wage blade species

707
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:22,649
and it was quite suspicious that maybe

708
00:28:20,848 --> 00:28:24,358
these could be your dick when aidan

709
00:28:22,648 --> 00:28:26,788
molecules that might each of their

710
00:28:24,358 --> 00:28:28,769
instability now we were trying to sort

711
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:30,388
through what they were and what she

712
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:33,149
showed was that if you actually take a

713
00:28:30,388 --> 00:28:35,338
look at these you probe with anti

714
00:28:33,148 --> 00:28:37,408
ubiquitin you can see that these TFT

715
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:40,138
molecules are highly duplicated in the

716
00:28:37,409 --> 00:28:42,799
presence of these effectors and so she

717
00:28:40,138 --> 00:28:45,118
set up the model thinking about perhaps

718
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:48,239
interaction with the effectors is

719
00:28:45,118 --> 00:28:50,338
promoting them to being liquidated or to

720
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:52,858
stay adequan ated and that leads

721
00:28:50,338 --> 00:28:54,658
eventually to their degradation and so

722
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:59,489
one way to shut off the systems just to

723
00:28:54,659 --> 00:29:01,409
get rid of that mold and so what she

724
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:03,179
then went on to do is then ask well

725
00:29:01,409 --> 00:29:05,028
we're hoping that with any evidence

726
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:06,959
we're driving sir are they

727
00:29:05,028 --> 00:29:08,940
phosphorylated its phosphorylation

728
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:11,459
really the mechanism because everything

729
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:14,909
something together so she purified his

730
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:17,820
tagged proteins she digested them up and

731
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:20,940
looked for phosphopeptides did mass spec

732
00:29:17,819 --> 00:29:23,458
and then we actually did a site-directed

733
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:26,999
mutagenesis to show whether or not it

734
00:29:23,459 --> 00:29:30,450
matters so here's the schematic for

735
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:33,569
zoffie to zoe nicely mapped and using

736
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:35,969
some software what might be potential 14

737
00:29:33,569 --> 00:29:38,249
33 phosphorylation sites these are

738
00:29:35,969 --> 00:29:39,910
called 31 sites and the reason why is

739
00:29:38,249 --> 00:29:41,890
because they have a

740
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:44,080
a serine residue that could be

741
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:46,060
phosphorylated and what actually she

742
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,769
showed in her mass spec profile was that

743
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:50,710
she had a number of phosphorylated

744
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:53,529
residues syrian here for you here etc

745
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:55,509
but the major hotspots that seemed to be

746
00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:58,480
coming out with the majority of them

747
00:29:55,509 --> 00:30:00,579
with this site as well as your site so

748
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,950
time is running out she wanted to do all

749
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:04,960
the combinations but she just said I'll

750
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:06,700
just take a double meeting before I go I

751
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,650
think she was probably interviewing at

752
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,720
that time and so she made this mutation

753
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:14,080
and this mutation and asked because it

754
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,390
still bind and what she found was

755
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:19,089
introduced binding significantly ending

756
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:23,080
completely prevented from binding to the

757
00:30:19,089 --> 00:30:24,939
TFT so here's wild-type effector binding

758
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:27,579
to this TFT so you can see the nice

759
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:29,470
biofluorescence complementation and then

760
00:30:27,579 --> 00:30:31,389
you can see here the double mutant it's

761
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,940
not completely gone and can see Reggie's

762
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:36,009
fluorescence so it appears that

763
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:41,980
phosphorylation is important to get this

764
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:44,109
complex together all right so we're left

765
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,569
with this model we have some ideas about

766
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:48,490
the enzymatic activity of YouTube's I'm

767
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:50,799
waiting for a student to try those out

768
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:52,779
but at least from Zoe's work what she

769
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,700
was able to show is that when zoffi to

770
00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:56,819
gets into the plant cell it's

771
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:59,830
phosphorylated on a number of sites that

772
00:30:56,819 --> 00:31:04,480
allows physical association with at

773
00:30:59,829 --> 00:31:07,449
least one or two isoforms of TF teas and

774
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,849
particularly TFT 10 then we see you

775
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:11,600
think when a shin of this molecule this

776
00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:14,549
leads to what we believe is

777
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:16,799
predation but still what we're lefted

778
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:18,899
know what are the substrates that

779
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:21,419
natural substrates for these 14 greece

780
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:24,420
rates so now we have the plants in intel

781
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:26,279
where we're actually purifying these TFT

782
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:33,330
complexes to get at the other push

783
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:35,308
signaling proteins okay then at the end

784
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:38,159
of the day what's the role of these 14

785
00:31:35,308 --> 00:31:39,899
through these fries in the interaction

786
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:42,630
and we've had a little bit of trouble

787
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:44,880
with this because it seems like deleting

788
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:46,890
one of these 14 three please doesn't

789
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,920
really just seem to inhibit bacterial

790
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:51,780
throat or enhance bacterial growth

791
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:54,330
significantly but we did see it a change

792
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:57,629
in symptom development so we make hole

793
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:59,159
punches to sample our leaves and what

794
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:01,530
you can see here hopefully through these

795
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,630
hole punches of sampling this is wild

796
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:05,519
type gives you this nice chlorosis of

797
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,650
believe we know that the bacteria are

798
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,779
growing really well but what we see is

799
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:12,179
when we start taking out combinations of

800
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:15,210
these effector molecules especially in

801
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:17,820
82 we see that the symptom development

802
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:19,710
comes much faster and it's within maybe

803
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:22,349
a day sometimes and you see the leaves

804
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:24,690
become very erotic it's a sign of

805
00:32:22,349 --> 00:32:27,000
ethylene that we observed or salicylic

806
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:28,830
acid building up from the leaves and so

807
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,569
we're now looking at how perhaps these

808
00:32:28,829 --> 00:32:32,490
effectors are suppressing the hormone

809
00:32:30,569 --> 00:32:34,169
signaling in the leaf maybe not

810
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:36,679
affecting tighter so much but def

811
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:41,190
definitely disease symptom development

812
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:43,830
and that's ongoing work ok so just to

813
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:45,750
summarize this part what would I showed

814
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:48,089
you is that we have a handle a little

815
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:50,549
bit on some of the host proteins the TFT

816
00:32:48,089 --> 00:32:53,399
isoforms they're required for both pti

817
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:54,839
and eti there's a small group so not

818
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,700
every effectors target

819
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:58,349
this node but we condensing

820
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,480
commonalities of these and other

821
00:32:58,349 --> 00:33:03,500
pathogens that have similar orthologues

822
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:06,420
or homologs and we see that

823
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:08,940
phosphorylation is important so being

824
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:10,980
able to anchor into these scaffolding

825
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:13,590
proteins as a key prerequisite to

826
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:15,120
suppress their function and now we're

827
00:33:13,589 --> 00:33:18,349
looking at how they're being turned over

828
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:18,349
in the host cell

829
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:26,380
so that's sort of a foray into looking

830
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:28,990
at the early steps of how this protein

831
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:32,380
is working that's why being a scaffold

832
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:34,690
but we also discovered the top D working

833
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:36,370
very late is an enzyme minute and so I

834
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:39,009
became super fascinated with this

835
00:33:36,369 --> 00:33:41,829
molecule because of the fact when you

836
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:45,069
take a look at its structure it has what

837
00:33:41,829 --> 00:33:46,869
appears to be eukaryotic features and so

838
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:48,789
back in the early days in the early

839
00:33:46,869 --> 00:33:51,189
2000s we really didn't understand what

840
00:33:48,789 --> 00:33:53,859
effectors were doing at all and what we

841
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:55,720
realized right away was that if you take

842
00:33:53,859 --> 00:33:58,990
a look at some interest to see terminus

843
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,420
the c-terminus of this molecule is this

844
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:03,339
sumo protease and that is a protease

845
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:06,009
that's working on the ubiquitin path

846
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:08,559
length specifically the small

847
00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:12,309
ubiquitin-like modifier called sumo and

848
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:14,440
this modification is often on proteins

849
00:34:12,309 --> 00:34:16,570
and get some dragged into the nucleus or

850
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:19,300
on transcription factors that control

851
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:21,970
their activity and so we thought right

852
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:24,100
away hmm this pathogen molecules not

853
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:26,139
even clear how about that domain because

854
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:28,659
bacteria don't have this but somehow

855
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:30,940
it's wreath using that domain to

856
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:33,219
manipulate signaling and actually we

857
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:35,440
could see that it was localized infant

858
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:37,959
nuclear flow side using benthamiana

859
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,630
assays or stable transgenics and

860
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,300
actually we determine the structure this

861
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:46,179
was work done in Kinross group to show

862
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:48,160
that we predicted it to look like this

863
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:49,630
and actually in fact here's the true

864
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,969
crystal structure of the cysteine

865
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:54,640
protease so you can see that fold is

866
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:56,409
really highly identical and what we also

867
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,259
realized is that they had an internal

868
00:34:56,409 --> 00:35:02,019
DNA binding domain and also an ear

869
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:03,369
repressor motif and this is a repressor

870
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:05,528
motif it you only find

871
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:07,650
plant transcriptional repressors you

872
00:35:05,528 --> 00:35:09,998
don't find it in other bacterial

873
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:12,759
transcription factors and these are

874
00:35:09,998 --> 00:35:14,679
ethylene associated repressor motifs so

875
00:35:12,759 --> 00:35:17,048
we thought perhaps has had all the

876
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:19,028
equipment to get into the nucleus to

877
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:21,909
bind DNA there specifically or

878
00:35:19,028 --> 00:35:24,818
nonspecifically maybe interfere with

879
00:35:21,909 --> 00:35:27,578
some repressor complexes and then maybe

880
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:29,380
work on transcription factors and so

881
00:35:27,579 --> 00:35:31,210
what we set up was really the idea that

882
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,460
it's going in to manipulate host

883
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:35,740
transcription hitting into the nucleus

884
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:38,170
cutting off these modifications and

885
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:40,419
turning over transcription factors at

886
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:42,309
least that was our dream and it took us

887
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:44,920
a long time to find those transcription

888
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:46,660
factors and to show that for one way

889
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,088
they did it was actually going back to

890
00:35:46,659 --> 00:35:51,009
the pathology the timing and the

891
00:35:49,088 --> 00:35:53,230
symptoms were really critical for

892
00:35:51,009 --> 00:35:55,929
getting us there and so what we found

893
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:57,759
early on when we deleted this molecule

894
00:35:55,929 --> 00:36:00,608
from xanthomonas was that there was a

895
00:35:57,759 --> 00:36:02,858
very interesting phenotype so if you

896
00:36:00,608 --> 00:36:05,440
look at wild-type infection I told you

897
00:36:02,858 --> 00:36:09,098
that ELC xanthomonas will grow to high

898
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:11,559
titers form these spots and chlorosis if

899
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:14,289
you just take out this one protein by

900
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:15,970
day eight or so you see the bacteria are

901
00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:18,180
not growing too high titers but the

902
00:36:15,969 --> 00:36:20,768
leaves really look like they are

903
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:23,108
symptomatic right but in a sense are

904
00:36:20,768 --> 00:36:24,848
dying and so we were confused by that

905
00:36:23,108 --> 00:36:27,159
for a while because this is not disease

906
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:29,680
this is actually the host trying to

907
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:33,609
fight off the pathogen this is

908
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:36,369
this is the pti and so what we know from

909
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:38,769
our work we could think perhaps that was

910
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:40,960
ethylene or hormone signaling and we

911
00:36:38,769 --> 00:36:42,759
quantified epling in these levels to see

912
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,800
in these ladies to see if there was

913
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:48,550
higher concentration here than there and

914
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,930
it is so when you quantify over a time

915
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:52,000
course and what you're looking at here

916
00:36:49,929 --> 00:36:55,089
is just leaves that are infected with

917
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,030
magnesium chloride wild-type pathogen or

918
00:36:55,090 --> 00:37:00,670
job you leave and what you're looking

919
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:02,740
for is over time remember that six to

920
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:04,690
eight hour window what we see is that

921
00:37:02,739 --> 00:37:06,939
the wild-type pathogen is growing but

922
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:08,710
it's suppressing epping levels it

923
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:10,450
continues to keep those ethylene levels

924
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:13,059
down and they start to creep up around

925
00:37:10,449 --> 00:37:14,859
eight ten but in this OP team you can

926
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:16,809
you start to see the appearance of

927
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:18,970
accumulation of ethylene much earlier

928
00:37:16,809 --> 00:37:21,579
and so it really seems that that symptom

929
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:23,589
development the pathogen is just trying

930
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:28,059
to keep this down so that it can

931
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:29,559
maintain replication and spread but

932
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:31,329
which transcription factors are

933
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:33,730
controlling this f'ing response there

934
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:35,679
was not much known about that and so we

935
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:38,380
went to the leaves and we said let's see

936
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:40,149
if we can profile for rnas it would give

937
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:43,180
us an indicator of which transcription

938
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:44,410
factors might be a potential target and

939
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:46,419
i won't go through all the detail of

940
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:48,609
this but we looked at some Martin's

941
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:50,349
group who is looking at and we looked at

942
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:52,930
four things that will be the reduced by

943
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:54,789
xanthomonas or not and so here was one

944
00:37:52,929 --> 00:37:57,250
in particular that I'll point out your

945
00:37:54,789 --> 00:38:00,130
attention to so this is called earth for

946
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:03,280
we saw that wounding will induce you

947
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:05,890
cumulation of this transcript and see

948
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,720
the xanthomonas highly induces it and so

949
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:09,400
the softy mutants so it doesn't really

950
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:12,579
matter if you have this effect or not

951
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,889
but this is responding to infection or

952
00:38:12,579 --> 00:38:16,159
two

953
00:38:12,889 --> 00:38:18,319
me and we went on to show that that was

954
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:19,699
in fact a direct target and I won't walk

955
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,250
through this because this is a few years

956
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:25,699
old but the idea was we actually had a

957
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:28,760
new target it does clip off sumo off a

958
00:38:25,699 --> 00:38:30,379
particular lie scene by scene 53 and

959
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,930
that simple removal of this molecule

960
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:35,420
leads to destabilization of this

961
00:38:32,929 --> 00:38:38,569
transcription factor now complete loss

962
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:40,849
with a reduction enough of a reduction

963
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:43,970
that it dampens ethylene synthesis and

964
00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:47,269
then athletes and synthesis of earthly

965
00:38:43,969 --> 00:38:50,059
mediated defense gene expression so we

966
00:38:47,269 --> 00:38:51,530
were quite excited about that and at the

967
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:53,000
same time there were lots of other

968
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:55,100
people that were interested in other

969
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,320
post targets and so we weren't the only

970
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:59,539
one that was finding transcription

971
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:02,269
factors that were being regulated we can

972
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:04,579
see that there was a myth in arabidopsis

973
00:39:02,269 --> 00:39:06,469
that was under the potential control of

974
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:08,719
xanthomonas campestris and passengers

975
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:11,959
and then we also see that there was a

976
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:14,719
dela transcription factor involved in GA

977
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,159
hormone signaling and iraq offices so

978
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:19,009
it's hard for me to put my head around

979
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:20,690
which ones are the key targets and in

980
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:24,850
those other systems they didn't show

981
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:26,920
that sumoylation was really tied to the

982
00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:29,210
destabilization or the altering of these

983
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,700
transcription factors so it's possible

984
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:33,650
that zop d has multiple activities and

985
00:39:31,699 --> 00:39:35,689
multiple targets but at least in the

986
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:37,970
tomato interaction it seems to be quite

987
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:42,559
important for suppressing athlean and

988
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:43,939
suppressing si si but then how do plants

989
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:45,980
respond to that you know you're putting

990
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:48,980
something in the in the nucleus to

991
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:50,840
altered gene expression and so we were

992
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:53,510
thinking we really want to find

993
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:55,730
resistances update to understand loads

994
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:58,550
of actions of how to prepare against it

995
00:39:55,730 --> 00:40:01,340
and we also thought perhaps even though

996
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:04,070
it's repressing transcription factors it

997
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:06,809
might also be activated

998
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:09,180
because you could essentially activate

999
00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:11,610
things to promote infection and we've

1000
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:13,949
seen this in other xanthomonas pepper

1001
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:16,800
interactions where tala factors are

1002
00:40:13,949 --> 00:40:18,899
really important for self expansion only

1003
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,210
pustules and the symptom development and

1004
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:23,849
pepper and so we've started to think

1005
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:25,590
about how to profile for transcription

1006
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:27,480
factors novel ones and no one had

1007
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:31,140
studied before that might be dynamically

1008
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:34,500
regulated so we found a subset and we

1009
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:37,230
call these D H resulting post induced

1010
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:39,480
jeans and these turn out to be a

1011
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:42,780
particular class of transcription

1012
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:45,420
factors call vhl ages so basic

1013
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:48,720
helix-loop-helix transcription factors

1014
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:50,550
so up here and what we realize these

1015
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:53,149
types of transcription factors are

1016
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:56,160
mostly linked to development and

1017
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:58,380
developmental regulation and so we were

1018
00:40:56,159 --> 00:41:00,449
fascinated by that because when you take

1019
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:02,400
a look at this one we see that this one

1020
00:41:00,449 --> 00:41:05,219
is increase a thousandfold during

1021
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:08,670
infection and is happening within hours

1022
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:11,459
6 to 12 hours receiving this ramp up

1023
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:13,320
this is for wild-type streams and if you

1024
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:15,210
give rid of all the effectors you see

1025
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:18,150
that it is not induced so this is a

1026
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:20,519
factor to pick you can see another

1027
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:22,829
example the opposite where wild type is

1028
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:25,500
keeping the expression of this gene down

1029
00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:28,440
tightly and then you see that this one

1030
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:30,510
is without effectors it is highly

1031
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,309
expressed and I won't talk about this

1032
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:34,170
one today but when you knock this one

1033
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:37,829
out we see that it's a negative

1034
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:40,920
regulator of immunity so when plants

1035
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:43,469
laughing dh4 are actually more resistant

1036
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:45,570
to xanthomonas infection so we were

1037
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:46,709
really interested in studying these and

1038
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,539
I want to tell you a little bit about

1039
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:51,300
our early work on this there's still

1040
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:52,769
lots of work ahead but getting at close

1041
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:57,330
targets and trying to understand what

1042
00:41:52,769 --> 00:41:59,670
they do in the plant cell so why be HLHS

1043
00:41:57,329 --> 00:42:01,469
in the literature where we realize more

1044
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:04,320
and more that there's crosstalk between

1045
00:42:01,469 --> 00:42:06,480
different pathways whether you're

1046
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:08,130
looking at multiple hormone pathways how

1047
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,230
they control each other or if you're

1048
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:12,210
looking at post pathogen interactions

1049
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:14,929
and in the last few years with a hot

1050
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:18,059
topic is really looking at how flagyl in

1051
00:42:14,929 --> 00:42:20,789
signaling through fls to cross talks

1052
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:22,799
with the brass misteri pathway and the

1053
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:24,659
point of showing you is that part of the

1054
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,150
cross stock is down here in the nucleus

1055
00:42:24,659 --> 00:42:29,879
and that's being mediated by pH other

1056
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:32,010
transcription factors and so there was

1057
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,630
one question that was left open if

1058
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:36,180
xanthomonas is inducing these

1059
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:38,309
differentially put these be regulators

1060
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:41,419
mediating crosstalk between Brooklyn

1061
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:44,759
development so we explored that idea and

1062
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:46,170
what we found was that we were going to

1063
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,140
focus on this one that is highly

1064
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:51,269
conduced and highly regulated in the

1065
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:56,099
direction of up regulation and see what

1066
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:57,809
happens when we knock it down so what we

1067
00:42:56,099 --> 00:43:00,119
see here and I wanted to point out the

1068
00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:02,579
importance of ZAP d in this process is

1069
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:04,230
that if you actually look early at three

1070
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:06,239
hours we see that this gene is not

1071
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:08,909
turned on if you look at six hours

1072
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:11,729
notice this is mock this is magnesium

1073
00:43:08,909 --> 00:43:14,369
chloride transcript is highly induced by

1074
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:17,559
example notice and if you get rid of zop

1075
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:19,359
do you reduce that almost down to 300

1076
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:21,820
this is still a lot this relative

1077
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:23,530
expression still is an induced gene but

1078
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:26,650
most of that induction is do this often

1079
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:29,590
and if you actually get rid of effectors

1080
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:32,260
you see almost about the same result so

1081
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:35,200
this looks like it's a ptin use gene but

1082
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:37,150
also zotti induced and we actually have

1083
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:38,829
developed in a body's field to recognize

1084
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:40,930
this protein and you can see that this

1085
00:43:38,829 --> 00:43:43,389
transcript abundance actually correlated

1086
00:43:40,929 --> 00:43:45,069
to a protein accumulation so we actually

1087
00:43:43,389 --> 00:43:47,049
want to be able to study this protein

1088
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:49,960
and look where what transcripts it's

1089
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:52,810
being regulating within the host cell

1090
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:55,000
and this is relieved you don't see as

1091
00:43:52,809 --> 00:43:59,590
much induction of this protein when you

1092
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:02,440
get rid of something so does this matter

1093
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:04,780
do the plants use this dh1 via chili

1094
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:07,630
transcription factor for defense program

1095
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:09,790
or growth program are they an odds are

1096
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:12,400
they working together and what you can

1097
00:44:09,789 --> 00:44:16,059
see here is we can silence either stable

1098
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:18,789
eat with digs or Susan E we do them digs

1099
00:44:16,059 --> 00:44:21,070
we've done hair pins we've been crisper

1100
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:23,739
all the phenotypes are the same when you

1101
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:25,690
knock out this gene what you can see and

1102
00:44:23,739 --> 00:44:28,569
not a closely related one that's not

1103
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:30,670
affected by that that knockout you can

1104
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:33,370
see that the pathogen is able to grow

1105
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:35,079
more so here is Dan Thelonious normal

1106
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:36,940
gets up to 10 to eight we can see

1107
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:39,340
increased growth of the pathogen when we

1108
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:41,079
get rid of this transcription factor we

1109
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:44,110
can also see increased growth of

1110
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:47,739
xanthomonas FD also a log increase of

1111
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:49,570
growth when you get rid of this seems to

1112
00:44:47,739 --> 00:44:51,219
be involved in the community it also

1113
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:53,170
seems to be involved in symptom

1114
00:44:51,219 --> 00:44:55,699
development because if you look at nine

1115
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:59,470
days before we can see the differential

1116
00:44:55,699 --> 00:45:02,088
symptoms rnai lines shown more symptoms

1117
00:44:59,469 --> 00:45:05,719
so we were intrigued by that seems to be

1118
00:45:02,088 --> 00:45:08,750
a pup involved in immunity but it's also

1119
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:10,759
seemingly involved in growth and so

1120
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:13,880
that's at odds because usually these are

1121
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:15,260
trade-offs so we weren't sure how to

1122
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,119
think about it but actually if you look

1123
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:19,130
at it while tech plants are growing

1124
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:21,530
really well these are definitely stunted

1125
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:24,410
you see shorter Internode's we see

1126
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:26,180
increased branching see broader leaves

1127
00:45:24,409 --> 00:45:28,639
all right you don't see as much

1128
00:45:26,179 --> 00:45:30,588
serration and the symptom development is

1129
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:34,250
quite different on some of these needs

1130
00:45:30,588 --> 00:45:36,469
so we also thought well what about below

1131
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:38,239
ground put the blow ground structure of

1132
00:45:36,469 --> 00:45:40,819
the roof to be impacted the above ground

1133
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:42,889
vegetation and what we see is really

1134
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:46,250
that's where this transcription factor

1135
00:45:42,889 --> 00:45:48,500
seems to be working potentially it's not

1136
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:52,099
really expressed only it's not that much

1137
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:54,380
in stems but highly envious tumors okay

1138
00:45:52,099 --> 00:45:57,619
or hide express in words and canoe just

1139
00:45:54,380 --> 00:46:00,019
further so what we were thinking about

1140
00:45:57,619 --> 00:46:02,539
is maybe this is a root specific

1141
00:46:00,019 --> 00:46:05,690
transcription factor playing a role and

1142
00:46:02,539 --> 00:46:08,300
the pathogen is reprogramming this in

1143
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:09,740
the leaf and we are really interested in

1144
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:12,140
understanding how is it being

1145
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:14,149
reprogrammed in the leaves and what is

1146
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:17,000
that benefit to the host pathogen your

1147
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:19,220
action and one in sight when we were

1148
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,219
looking at increase this route

1149
00:46:19,219 --> 00:46:23,480
phenomenal is that being some new

1150
00:46:22,219 --> 00:46:24,089
graduate student in my lab has been

1151
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,420
actually

1152
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:29,400
below what she had seen is that if you

1153
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:31,680
just sort of quickly put tomato on

1154
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:34,440
filter paper and she does the mass of

1155
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,599
these roots versus the amounts here show

1156
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:38,820
them to the silence fine she can see

1157
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:41,610
really a significant reduction in dry

1158
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:43,559
wave of these these roots and she did an

1159
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:45,480
interesting sort of experiment where she

1160
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:47,369
wasn't known if there's an experiment

1161
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,920
that she forgot to fertilizer plants and

1162
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:52,170
so if you had helped leaf fertilize

1163
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,880
plants you can see a real good growth

1164
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:56,369
differential between the Simon's lines

1165
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:59,340
but when they were not fertilized you

1166
00:46:56,369 --> 00:47:01,889
lost them so it suggested it's perhaps

1167
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:04,200
maybe if there is root acquisition of

1168
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:05,639
nutrients you don't see it too much if

1169
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:08,009
you let's say it was a nutrient

1170
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:09,929
transporter right the nutrients are

1171
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:12,240
plentiful wild-type will beat out

1172
00:47:09,929 --> 00:47:14,489
silence want but if there's not much

1173
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:16,199
nutrients around the growth differential

1174
00:47:14,489 --> 00:47:18,329
would not be the same so we're exploring

1175
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:21,480
the idea that maybe there could be some

1176
00:47:18,329 --> 00:47:23,159
sort of nutrient acquisition difference

1177
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,769
between these silent linings and those

1178
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:30,779
and then how that is impacted in the

1179
00:47:25,769 --> 00:47:32,340
leaves okay so an overview of this is we

1180
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:34,500
kind of have this new transcription

1181
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:36,390
factor family we're looking at we have

1182
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:39,000
pretty good data that shows that this is

1183
00:47:36,389 --> 00:47:40,920
triggered in response to heighten the

1184
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,690
gellin doesn't matter if you use anthem

1185
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:46,260
owners or pseudomonas so it seems to be

1186
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:48,300
a ptin just jeans and leaves we know

1187
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:49,830
that is out d seems to be turning this

1188
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,900
on and you think it's because it's in

1189
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:54,179
the nucleus and it's messing up the

1190
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:57,960
transcription of dh1 and we want to

1191
00:47:54,179 --> 00:48:01,619
score the mechanisms of how and look at

1192
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:03,240
night okay all right I just want a

1193
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:04,799
couple more slides and the reason why I

1194
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:05,679
brought this substance might be useful

1195
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,630
to the two

1196
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:09,569
community here which was we really

1197
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:12,070
wanted to understand really how these

1198
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:14,830
genes are being expressed and what we

1199
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:17,140
found in the promoter of da chuan was

1200
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:19,869
there some interesting boxes here so

1201
00:48:17,139 --> 00:48:21,789
these cysts regulatory elements G boxes

1202
00:48:19,869 --> 00:48:25,210
are more linked to developmental

1203
00:48:21,789 --> 00:48:27,250
transcription binding sites w boxes are

1204
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:28,869
working boxes and you find the working

1205
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:31,690
transcription factors are sitting there

1206
00:48:28,869 --> 00:48:33,639
so it seemed to be a hotspot potentially

1207
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:37,030
whereas Abdi could be altering those

1208
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:38,710
transcription complexes and so what Jean

1209
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:40,960
gan kim did in the lab was he made

1210
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:43,210
transgenic plants with different regions

1211
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:46,150
of this promoter and he nicely showed

1212
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:48,220
that this 1.5 region is really important

1213
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:50,170
for xanthomonas and off the induction

1214
00:48:48,219 --> 00:48:52,299
and so it really looks like Jesus

1215
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:55,000
regulatory elements I really the the

1216
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:58,269
link to activation of this gene is

1217
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,489
opting dependent manner and importantly

1218
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:02,800
we can show that this is also a protease

1219
00:49:00,489 --> 00:49:05,349
dependent which is really important the

1220
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,780
simulation system because if you have a

1221
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:11,049
protease dead mutant you can no longer

1222
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:13,480
induce this team so it seems to be that

1223
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:15,310
whatever transcription factors or Co

1224
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,619
regulators that are at this promoter are

1225
00:49:15,309 --> 00:49:21,969
most likely going to be simulated and

1226
00:49:17,619 --> 00:49:24,039
the targets of softie so we set out to

1227
00:49:21,969 --> 00:49:26,049
actually do a screen and so part of a

1228
00:49:24,039 --> 00:49:27,969
new NSF proposal is actually to look at

1229
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:30,070
all the work piece of tomato to clone

1230
00:49:27,969 --> 00:49:31,899
them out to provide the resources so

1231
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:35,590
that you can then use them there's a

1232
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:37,150
hundred 50 or 80 of them those young gun

1233
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:39,370
has pretty much got all of them now

1234
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:41,200
we're going through and testing in a

1235
00:49:39,369 --> 00:49:43,630
screen to see which ones are sitting in

1236
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:44,980
the hot spots in these promoters and to

1237
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:47,420
see if they're the target of our

1238
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:50,510
effectors or multiple effectors that

1239
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:52,250
laughs so if those could be resources to

1240
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:55,359
anybody in the lab please contact us

1241
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:57,619
we'd be happy to share those with you

1242
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:59,480
okay so just like the finish for this

1243
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:01,280
part which is that they initially got

1244
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,829
into studying zop day because it's a

1245
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,780
potent suppressor ethylene had an

1246
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:07,430
interesting new carry out of feature so

1247
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:09,430
it's mimicking host enzymes that

1248
00:50:07,429 --> 00:50:12,469
normally regulate processes that control

1249
00:50:09,429 --> 00:50:14,509
transcription factors stability we then

1250
00:50:12,469 --> 00:50:16,250
use that as a tool to ask what other

1251
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:18,290
things could zop do you be regulating

1252
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:20,358
during the infection and this brought us

1253
00:50:18,289 --> 00:50:22,068
to some developmental genes that we

1254
00:50:20,358 --> 00:50:24,019
think are playing a role in different

1255
00:50:22,068 --> 00:50:25,849
parts of the plan some that are being

1256
00:50:24,019 --> 00:50:27,588
controlled by the pathogen and some that

1257
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:31,750
are normally being controlled simply by

1258
00:50:27,588 --> 00:50:31,750
development that benefits the growth I

1259
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:38,239
don't think I'll go through that so if I

1260
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:39,919
just said the conclusions and I just

1261
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:41,838
like to finish by just about our

1262
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,639
contribution this far was really trying

1263
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:45,798
to understand how gent the mones

1264
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:48,679
effectors like that then use different

1265
00:50:45,798 --> 00:50:51,619
fold or enzymatic acid or enzymatic

1266
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:53,480
mimics to regulate the initial immune

1267
00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:55,849
responses but now we're very interested

1268
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:58,219
in identifying resistance to both

1269
00:50:55,849 --> 00:51:01,849
Southlands opti in different tomato

1270
00:50:58,219 --> 00:51:03,919
lines or cup of life I'd like to

1271
00:51:01,849 --> 00:51:06,260
acknowledge my group most of this work

1272
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,539
was done in collaboration with a number

1273
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:10,880
of books in the lab so Jean King is a

1274
00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:13,250
senior research associate in my lab runs

1275
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:15,680
pretty much all of the projects that has

1276
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:18,909
worked now the maida students and Zoe

1277
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:21,578
did all the effector and

1278
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:24,088
and yangsun is working on the th1 in the

1279
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:24,089
root story

1280
00:51:39,289 --> 00:51:43,289
using

1281
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:47,230
what's the entering going on take out

1282
00:51:43,289 --> 00:51:49,608
the warranty and

1283
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:54,349
yeah that's a French market tomato

1284
00:51:49,608 --> 00:51:57,529
branch DF 36 I don't is now process it

1285
00:51:54,349 --> 00:52:00,500
right well that's interesting if that

1286
00:51:57,530 --> 00:52:05,740
control is the 36th interesting because

1287
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:07,969
processing tomato they don't have a

1288
00:52:05,739 --> 00:52:10,250
proponents of fresh markets there that

1289
00:52:07,969 --> 00:52:11,899
looks like a friend one we are the

1290
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:14,599
timing it's that tall it should have

1291
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:17,750
black holes and then oh you mean lateral

1292
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:19,338
roots there are our branches what you

1293
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:21,619
find when you girl like entity to

1294
00:52:19,338 --> 00:52:24,380
something like that it's explanted this

1295
00:52:21,619 --> 00:52:26,720
big out of the pot yeah beside Rachel do

1296
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:28,910
this break what you're seeing in your

1297
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:31,879
sub you plant is actually more of a

1298
00:52:28,909 --> 00:52:33,858
typical processing tomato growth habit I

1299
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,019
wouldn't consider it so much as Sun tea

1300
00:52:33,858 --> 00:52:39,170
as a different form of development with

1301
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:41,509
the processing to okay stated get sum of

1302
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:43,250
any two as long as you know today right

1303
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:45,380
bratz get some of that and while and

1304
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:47,949
grow it and see what happens but most

1305
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:51,050
processing tomatoes are like that and

1306
00:52:47,949 --> 00:52:53,210
there is a lot that's known about the

1307
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:56,950
regulation of apical dominance so great

1308
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:56,949
for okay and so if you get that

1309
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:01,019
but a fresh market

1310
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:08,190
you'll see that they will get to

1311
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:10,619
multiple weeks or how to eat before you

1312
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:12,269
get for your plans okay that's a great

1313
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:14,280
suggestion because what we've seen when

1314
00:53:12,269 --> 00:53:18,750
we may transgenic arabidopsis is and we

1315
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:21,720
see an effect on the stem formation and

1316
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:24,389
also the emergence of the lateral but

1317
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:25,889
there's also quite a few genes that are

1318
00:53:24,389 --> 00:53:28,699
known to affect the way through the

1319
00:53:25,889 --> 00:53:35,099
Narrows let's define things like that

1320
00:53:28,699 --> 00:53:39,169
eat tomato and so that's three that what

1321
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:39,170
you're doing is affecting development

1322
00:53:40,858 --> 00:53:45,159
yeah that's an area that I don't know

1323
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:48,939
much about so appreciate your comments

1324
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:53,108
thank you yeah so I have a lot of softy

1325
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:56,048
questions but good ones I hope so it

1326
00:53:53,108 --> 00:53:58,900
sounds like the th th kind of tree my

1327
00:53:56,048 --> 00:54:01,538
pops is you have now is that ours off d

1328
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:04,210
is interacting with the transcriptional

1329
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:08,319
factors that are driving this da gama is

1330
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:10,750
not certain of is that it's repressing a

1331
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:13,480
repressor that has all these kind of in

1332
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:14,769
common and it's kind of secondary these

1333
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,240
are all kind of secondary genes that are

1334
00:54:14,769 --> 00:54:19,900
coming up as you repress that Professor

1335
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:22,149
yeah so the question is sort of which is

1336
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:24,849
the target which is a consequence of

1337
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:27,039
action right and least for the timing of

1338
00:54:24,849 --> 00:54:31,210
this this gene comes up very quickly

1339
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:33,369
within three to six hours in terms of at

1340
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:34,900
least that's the earliest transcript

1341
00:54:33,369 --> 00:54:37,030
that we can see coming up a thousandfold

1342
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:40,210
so we can't say that that's a primary

1343
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:42,069
event but one of the things I can tell

1344
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:44,889
you is that we look for the alternative

1345
00:54:42,068 --> 00:54:47,019
hypothesis which is often times you'll

1346
00:54:44,889 --> 00:54:51,250
see upregulation of a transcript if it's

1347
00:54:47,019 --> 00:54:54,519
the target so if th one is a target is

1348
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:57,489
off to eat right and you remove that

1349
00:54:54,519 --> 00:54:59,798
from the system you essentially could

1350
00:54:57,489 --> 00:55:02,108
positively activate transcription of da

1351
00:54:59,798 --> 00:55:04,750
chuan to get more of it so we're

1352
00:55:02,108 --> 00:55:08,558
exploring that possibility right that it

1353
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:12,219
is the Charlie a target where dh1 is

1354
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:14,410
functioning at multiple times so I think

1355
00:55:12,219 --> 00:55:17,199
that's a likely scenario and kind of

1356
00:55:14,409 --> 00:55:19,239
deals with this idea that maybe that you

1357
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:21,219
know it's just a reporter for us telling

1358
00:55:19,239 --> 00:55:23,669
us which genes are

1359
00:55:21,219 --> 00:55:23,669
anyway

1360
00:55:53,068 --> 00:55:56,068
news

1361
00:56:00,929 --> 00:56:04,919
right so the question is what's

1362
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:07,809
happening to the tighter of xanthomonas

1363
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:10,840
when you look at wild type versus a fee

1364
00:56:07,809 --> 00:56:13,119
so if you look in the early stages with

1365
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:15,100
xanthomonas we see a rapid increase two

1366
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:17,099
to four days and then it kind of comes

1367
00:56:15,099 --> 00:56:19,900
up to aid levels off where you

1368
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:21,940
saturation if you look at the Abdi it

1369
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:23,769
kind of two to four days it's exactly

1370
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:26,110
the same then when we start to see

1371
00:56:23,769 --> 00:56:29,110
things where ethylene is being produced

1372
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:31,480
in salicylic acid that's when we start

1373
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:34,019
to see these Abdi you can't grow anymore

1374
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:37,900
and wild-type keeps going so that

1375
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:40,659
phenotype correlates with reporters that

1376
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:42,280
we are seeing at the portrait stage we

1377
00:56:40,659 --> 00:56:45,250
haven't seen bacterial growth

1378
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:47,350
differences for xanthomonas affect our

1379
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:49,059
Moon's earlier than that actually

1380
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:50,650
something that I'm highly interested in

1381
00:56:49,059 --> 00:56:53,139
because I can't find a meeting that

1382
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:55,920
breaks that down to say day two and I

1383
00:56:53,139 --> 00:56:55,920
don't know what that means

1384
00:56:59,269 --> 00:57:10,230
don't drop the g1w 20 the UTB pachinko

1385
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:13,470
TV that can kind of develop that the DZ

1386
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:16,320
is that right so it looks like when you

1387
00:57:13,469 --> 00:57:18,419
delete one or more of those we see

1388
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:20,730
chlorosis in the leaf occurring but

1389
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:25,440
vectorial tighter stays the same of

1390
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:30,840
adenosine equate over express that each

1391
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:33,389
left how about the result so I hadn't

1392
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:35,640
done those experiments from we could

1393
00:57:33,389 --> 00:57:38,400
certainly do that just putting them in a

1394
00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:40,679
more juice promoter in Xanth amonos and

1395
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,570
I haven't done those experiments so the

1396
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:45,179
idea to thinking about how that might

1397
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:46,890
suppress symptom development more

1398
00:57:45,179 --> 00:57:49,440
effectively during infection is that

1399
00:57:46,889 --> 00:57:53,809
what you're thinking about if we use it

1400
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:56,150
although what if mole faster all the way

1401
00:57:53,809 --> 00:58:00,909
yes

1402
00:57:56,150 --> 00:58:06,860
another person you want have married

1403
00:58:00,909 --> 00:58:10,369
there's correlation less than that of

1404
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:14,019
no that's correct that writer I present

1405
00:58:10,369 --> 00:58:18,710
itself it's a Lochte when have defect

1406
00:58:14,019 --> 00:58:21,650
under the fourteenth we know according

1407
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:24,530
your resources the postings recently

1408
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:30,820
ever have a modifying a multiplier

1409
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:30,820
effect impacted mortifying

1410
00:58:31,108 --> 00:58:37,469
so the question is really who's

1411
00:58:33,568 --> 00:58:39,298
manipulating who right so you brought up

1412
00:58:37,469 --> 00:58:41,338
a nice point that some of these effector

1413
00:58:39,298 --> 00:58:43,230
molecules have lipids on them and the

1414
00:58:41,338 --> 00:58:45,748
tether them to different compartments

1415
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:48,150
the two that I had talked about one

1416
00:58:45,748 --> 00:58:50,639
seems to tether to the memorator one is

1417
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:53,220
not they both seem to be interacting

1418
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:56,940
with 14 three threes in the cytoplasm

1419
00:58:53,219 --> 00:58:59,518
and we don't know at this stage who's

1420
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:01,619
controlling because all I can say is

1421
00:58:59,518 --> 00:59:04,979
that the 14 three threes are required to

1422
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:07,440
signal for pti and DTI so it suggests

1423
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:10,710
that the effectors are trying to

1424
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:14,028
interfere with the complexes that those

1425
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:14,028
molecules are interacting

1426
00:59:25,289 --> 00:59:33,209
