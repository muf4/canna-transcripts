1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:10,819
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:13,888
University and this is also my extra

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:16,079
owners to be here in Cornell I would

4
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:19,079
explain you later on in one slide why

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:22,528
please wait for it and I like to start

6
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:25,889
my presentation with contents online I

7
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:28,349
will go through short introduction which

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,839
is mainly be will be few slide about key

9
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,450
SS because I think not a lot although

10
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:36,179
you familiar with this company and one

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,790
slide about myself then I will go very

12
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:41,340
shortly because I think you all all of

13
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:44,128
you aware about the global trends in

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,469
agriculture changes them I will take the

15
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:48,479
specific example in our very strong

16
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,850
program breeding program in which in

17
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,159
Germany I will talk about modern

18
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,980
printing technology and I will give you

19
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,828
example of successful application for

20
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:03,898
all three crops I'm book started whiskey

21
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:07,049
SS we are quite old company 162 years

22
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:11,909
and the history started here in small

23
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:14,220
village named Magdeburg Magdeburg have

24
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,170
excellent soils this is a best soil and

25
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:18,569
the story was following one part of the

26
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,900
family both the sugar beet Factory and

27
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:23,669
second mentioned if we are start to make

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,680
sugar big business we need to start the

29
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,109
selection and selection was started

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,009
before Mendell describes a law I will

31
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:36,299
show you later on them was Concord and

32
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:39,769
news 39 date-y 1945 somebody know what

33
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:43,470
is the date 1945

34
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:45,868
exactly and because transfer sleeping

35
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:48,118
became on the Russian part and the

36
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:51,509
British bond was involved in company

37
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:53,700
they decide to take part of gym plus for

38
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,909
stoppage M plus to west part of Germany

39
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,640
and to have new start in 90 I will show

40
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,530
you a one slide in iambic I'm BIC is not

41
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,659
only the company's this is one of the

42
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,019
oldest grew very in generally it's about

43
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:10,170
900 years history because the name of

44
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:12,449
Anvik middle age was ein book and both

45
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,119
beer is very very familiar at least in

46
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:15,848
Europe

47
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,709
Sam is we have type of changes today is

48
00:02:15,848 --> 00:02:20,669
one of leading company in plant breeding

49
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:23,680
and we are about 70 tons of old pipe

50
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:25,389
here where we are operated this is an

51
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,730
big orange everything which is our

52
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:32,529
breeding station and green where we make

53
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:35,859
the testing we have three now is for

54
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:38,318
business units I was twenty years here

55
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:41,080
in see Rose working with wheat rye and

56
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:43,419
barley we have sugar beet and potato

57
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:47,110
I make always a joke everything what is

58
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:49,750
growing underground business units and a

59
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:52,150
sugar beet is historical our home and we

60
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:54,489
have made and sold everything to pursue

61
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,730
research in development and to be very

62
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:59,709
clear for us research and development

63
00:02:56,729 --> 00:03:02,259
also including breeding breeding our

64
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:04,449
main innovative research and development

65
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:07,239
but we are also supporting our breed

66
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:10,048
increased old new technology and later

67
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:13,629
on I will tell you exactly what I mean

68
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:16,120
our help what here here we are in an big

69
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:18,609
old facility you could see here is the

70
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,730
catabolized facility and we put it

71
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:25,390
always change our coke now-famous is our

72
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:27,159
key the blaze logo I already mentioned

73
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:29,828
to you I will give one slide about

74
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:34,750
myself mark already mentioned I did my

75
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:37,269
PhD in geology in Belarus then I moved

76
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,430
to Lebanon Institute plant genetics and

77
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:42,219
crop research in indicate this is quite

78
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:45,129
unique Institute because they keep after

79
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:47,289
reunification on Germany and this is

80
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:48,759
unique of Institute because this is one

81
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:51,489
of the strongest and one has the biggest

82
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:53,739
gene bank but also five different other

83
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:55,900
department including molecular biology

84
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:58,420
including plant breeding above us a

85
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:01,060
really unique place a lot of research

86
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:02,798
going say in Germany then my second

87
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,229
scientific home and I am really proud

88
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,299
John Innes we have very very healthy

89
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:09,429
competition mark always is Cornell

90
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:13,629
University and later on I show you

91
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:16,389
because I was is my Gael and Sam as my

92
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:18,189
mark already mentioned I was for 20

93
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:20,288
years the head of reading technology not

94
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:23,519
head reading head of reading technology

95
00:04:20,288 --> 00:04:26,279
or t SS and I moved from me it goes to

96
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,349
globally

97
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:31,709
this is document I promise to show you

98
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:35,220
because if you look it's 1997 and this

99
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:37,769
is was invitation by Suzanne I think he

100
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,170
was assistant professor in this time for

101
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:43,469
my first seminar here that's mean for me

102
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:45,750
I have really Muslim 20 euro relation to

103
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,060
Cornell and this is a relation is very

104
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:52,019
very positive and I really proud to be

105
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:55,430
again here in your facility going very

106
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:58,469
shortly on the global trends and I

107
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:00,540
divided here on population growth and

108
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:03,480
food security climate change and after

109
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:07,319
local condition ends instability more

110
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:09,810
with less here I think all of you know

111
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,909
about this situation for me is in

112
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:15,168
general this is very important because

113
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:18,810
we expected to have the reduction of

114
00:05:15,168 --> 00:05:19,680
agriculture area per capita about 0.2

115
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,930
hectare

116
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,269
this mean we need to produce not only

117
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,610
the best quality but also amount of

118
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:30,629
product we put say Fitzie grow involved

119
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:33,660
and what is around of us because the

120
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:36,149
difference between animals breeding and

121
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,040
plant breeding is very obvious we are

122
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:40,799
working on plant breeding always is

123
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:43,890
different in Burma and what you could

124
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,770
learn from this slide you see this we

125
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:52,110
have surprisely increasing of

126
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:53,939
participation by five 7% until 2100 but

127
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,550
the distribution is became very

128
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:59,219
different for example probably not all

129
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:02,220
of you a veces Europe and specifically

130
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:06,000
Germany have very horrible here this

131
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:08,070
year drought I never expected such kind

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,680
of drought as we have this year in

133
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:13,620
Germany and some farmers specifically on

134
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,590
Lysol in East part of Germany not sent

135
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:20,220
combined to harvest canola herbs because

136
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:24,869
the yield was just 30 percent of

137
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:27,780
expected yield and going to the next

138
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:31,259
factor which is a global warming again

139
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:34,799
here we expected to have increased 2.5

140
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:36,870
or 4.1 and what is will be mean for us

141
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,000
depending of the different region of the

142
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,069
wall and looking on that says one per

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,889
one sin

144
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:45,019
degree of global warming to mean to ship

145
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:48,469
off the zone of climatic from hundred to

146
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:52,189
500 kilometers pool Ford's wishes would

147
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:55,420
mean again for South of France more

148
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:58,610
droughts more water use efficiency

149
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:02,390
variety should be all potential good

150
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:05,629
situation for East Europe Russian

151
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:10,189
Siberia where is a potential for for the

152
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:13,040
and last one third one here is and I

153
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:16,040
think it's not only row but everywhere

154
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:19,370
in the world we need to loop on that and

155
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:25,189
this is produced the same amount at

156
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:28,129
least with less nitrogen less and only

157
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:33,439
the solution for us to keep biodiversity

158
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:35,839
I try to put here the factory wishes we

159
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:39,560
expect it to target as essentials and

160
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:41,539
from right side our response from

161
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,490
breeding point and you could look by

162
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,310
herself for example for temperature

163
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:49,400
areas of course Hitler runs and you will

164
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:52,399
found here is for example root system we

165
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:54,679
are looking now I have 20 years ago a

166
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,839
nice interaction with breeder one of the

167
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,000
famous our body breeders and he

168
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:01,849
mentioned I not cases came from Rousseau

169
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,360
from Leafs as photosynthesis I measure

170
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:08,510
as float and I measure the Leafs sorry

171
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,550
yield but now he came in back and

172
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:13,039
mentioned you was right we need now to

173
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:16,040
dissect we need to know this from

174
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:18,470
variety a I have 5% more yield because

175
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:21,350
it's a good root system and I know from

176
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:24,380
variety be I have 5% more yield because

177
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:30,020
nice photosynthesis because then I could

178
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:31,759
combine in more precise in Bay talking

179
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:34,039
about current breeding targets in

180
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:37,250
example of our German wheat breeding

181
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:40,218
program and here is in one slide a lot

182
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:44,240
of information but most important for

183
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:46,640
you the area of growth of 3.2 if I am

184
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,259
talking about vesti of Rob the biggest

185
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,149
wheat winter wheat and I am talking

186
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:53,659
about mainly about winter wheat

187
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:56,149
era is in France with 5 million all

188
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:56,809
Biderman is 3.2 and about 2 billion in

189
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:58,519
UK

190
00:08:56,809 --> 00:09:01,698
this is make totally in West Europe

191
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:03,500
about 10 million over winter with 9 we

192
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:05,778
are talking about number of listed

193
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:09,259
variety because the difference between

194
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:11,259
United States and Europe for example we

195
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:14,500
need to have official registration

196
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:17,269
currently a farmers have say choice from

197
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,850
140 different varieties it's also not

198
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:21,860
easy choice if your farmers how it is

199
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:25,970
selected the best but what has happened

200
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:29,959
in 91 we have 61 in 1970 we have only 38

201
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:34,180
varieties them if you look here is quite

202
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:37,609
interesting 5 biggest variety have in

203
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:41,508
1970 about 80% of acreage now it's only

204
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:44,329
33 if you look the percentage of

205
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:47,778
certified seeds and this is important

206
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:51,138
for us as invest is 48 percent which is

207
00:09:47,778 --> 00:09:52,639
mean only second farmers buy certify

208
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:55,188
seeds

209
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,778
some farmers pushing us and mentioned we

210
00:09:55,188 --> 00:10:00,558
need to increase the you need to

211
00:09:56,778 --> 00:10:02,629
increase the resistance and if I if we

212
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:04,818
ask are you buying certify seeds they

213
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:07,699
mentioned not every year then the next

214
00:10:04,818 --> 00:10:09,948
how we could to create new innovation

215
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:12,979
without to heaven money because in some

216
00:10:09,948 --> 00:10:15,019
East European country the situation is

217
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,949
completely different in form some

218
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:21,860
farmers have petitioned by lessons is

219
00:10:17,948 --> 00:10:24,889
sufficient to buy the seeds once in your

220
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,688
professional life and this is also some

221
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:29,659
part of motivation probably for you

222
00:10:26,688 --> 00:10:31,219
understanding why as a company thinking

223
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:33,860
about to have hybrid we do have a

224
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,509
hyperbolic to have potential to return

225
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,369
the money but it also could be a

226
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:39,289
political solution for example in a

227
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:41,689
neighbor country of Germany in Germany

228
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:44,838
stills of a 50% white neighbor country

229
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:47,208
Denmark have about 62% of because

230
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:51,019
farmers believe there's good quality of

231
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:53,208
this is this is at one look on this

232
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:54,798
graph and this is nice hair for

233
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:56,568
discussion because some people mentioned

234
00:10:54,798 --> 00:11:00,318
we have fully stagnation of the yield

235
00:10:56,568 --> 00:11:03,558
this is the graph show in 1980 till 2008

236
00:11:00,318 --> 00:11:06,349
it's not good as a yields this year will

237
00:11:03,558 --> 00:11:08,629
be somewhere here because extremely and

238
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:11,269
almost no but if you look on the graph

239
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:13,879
is increasing of the we are talking

240
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:17,298
about the yield about seven to eight ton

241
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:20,720
of and this is industrial way of

242
00:11:17,298 --> 00:11:23,178
producing of it in Europe but if you

243
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,309
look on the map of the Germany I'm from

244
00:11:23,178 --> 00:11:28,938
lost our Sony another our capital is

245
00:11:25,308 --> 00:11:31,578
Berlin you will recognize is over a

246
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:33,769
shield is here showing on different

247
00:11:31,578 --> 00:11:36,078
countryside you will found some of the

248
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:38,298
ambitious very high about nineteen but

249
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:41,058
you will have eight and you will hear

250
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:44,509
here this is East most oil more light

251
00:11:41,058 --> 00:11:46,909
soil again here is south and south heat

252
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:50,079
because hit by flowering and if I

253
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:53,539
talking about the heat is a different

254
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:56,539
house called interpretation from

255
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:59,448
different growing region because heat

256
00:11:56,539 --> 00:12:02,028
here meaning the difference about 10

257
00:11:59,448 --> 00:12:04,008
percent of the yield because during

258
00:12:02,028 --> 00:12:05,929
flowering time here is much higher

259
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:07,730
temperature which is half negative

260
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:10,669
influence on the year and knowing that

261
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:13,580
we could increase now I move to very

262
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:15,709
basic breeding and I think most of you

263
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,649
very familiar visit because we need to

264
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:20,240
have two crucial point variation if you

265
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:22,820
don't have variation in one owes as a

266
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,990
way we could close our activity and then

267
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:29,660
selection and here genetic resources is

268
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:31,730
our basis in my couple of example of

269
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:34,250
excellent application I will show you is

270
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:37,310
a very positive example of using genetic

271
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:40,879
resources for improving quality or yield

272
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:43,429
of but be aware majority of the breeder

273
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:45,588
also not use genetic resources every

274
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:50,419
year because it's really hard to cross

275
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:53,600
from genetic resources to to achieve

276
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:56,509
them the same level of yield specificity

277
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,540
and quality and one in my example for

278
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:02,259
wheat I will show you what's the reason

279
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:05,389
here we have the crossing evaluation a

280
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:07,610
couple of years at least places

281
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:09,769
replication and if I am talking about

282
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:12,320
the place this is also very different I

283
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:14,778
already mentioned in in Europe we have

284
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,510
three program UK France and Germany for

285
00:13:14,778 --> 00:13:21,320
example in UK we testing material in

286
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:24,259
only two location anyone know the reason

287
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:29,420
for and in Germany on 70 location

288
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:32,809
any idea why even in traumatic condition

289
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:36,259
in in in UK the major area of redrawing

290
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:38,479
is closely to Cambridge Norfolk and this

291
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:40,730
is ways our two testing locations

292
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,830
tension in location in Germany you have

293
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,750
seen the map and the conditioned

294
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:48,050
environment condition is very different

295
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:49,879
to be able to provide for official

296
00:13:48,049 --> 00:13:52,370
testing and specifically for farmers

297
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:55,759
verify information we need to have more

298
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:58,278
location in continuum and them is

299
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,049
replication I think is with help of John

300
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:01,759
Luke and many other statisticians very

301
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:04,328
move three replication we are happy now

302
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,588
is to because the tools help us with

303
00:14:04,328 --> 00:14:08,929
resistance yield and quality I will came

304
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:11,450
back to that official testing three

305
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:13,879
years in Germany two in Denmark and this

306
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:16,300
take again six to eight years and this

307
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:18,740
is eight to twelve years cost and

308
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:19,458
sometimes I mention this is like a

309
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,149
Russian roulette

310
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:28,128
you play gamble and you hope you have

311
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:30,318
the biggest right this is will be like

312
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:35,028
examination because this is a formula

313
00:14:30,318 --> 00:14:38,349
you should know whole time if this is a

314
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:40,938
genetic game which is selection in

315
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:44,329
genetic standard if ignition engineer

316
00:14:40,938 --> 00:14:46,099
generation to interpret very in simple

317
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:49,428
word to make the interpretation

318
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,439
intensivity bigger is better but you

319
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:54,139
know they because also costly if you

320
00:14:51,438 --> 00:14:57,409
increase your program double you will be

321
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:59,409
half double possibility for success but

322
00:14:57,409 --> 00:15:03,230
it will be double expensive you need to

323
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:05,688
accuracy is very good positive regulate

324
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:08,149
variance as well and also what

325
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:11,748
specifically I like to point it in this

326
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:13,669
case is interval time to be quicker you

327
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:16,610
are successful and this is not only rule

328
00:15:13,669 --> 00:15:20,058
8 it is one breeding but also related

329
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,769
with as a type of industry but to relax

330
00:15:20,058 --> 00:15:24,499
you a little bit I will explain here a

331
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:27,019
joke about the interval time because

332
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:30,170
board of some other company which is

333
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:30,589
mainly related with chemistry ask plant

334
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:33,740
breeder

335
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:38,899
with for example mark how long has taken

336
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:44,778
for you to develop the variety for

337
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:46,999
example if we double the budget for you

338
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:50,568
to make mm of the money would you able

339
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:52,639
to do it five year as this was exactly

340
00:15:50,568 --> 00:15:54,558
the answer but in some chemistry if

341
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,869
you're a developer pharmacy you could do

342
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:58,730
that you put more money in beginning you

343
00:15:56,869 --> 00:16:00,619
expect to have shot but this is plant

344
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:03,048
breeding and we are really proud because

345
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:05,540
our board still understood and understoo

346
00:16:03,048 --> 00:16:07,938
in positive sense plant breeding and

347
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:11,568
this is really good to have looking on

348
00:16:07,938 --> 00:16:13,730
that I give you a little bit about with

349
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:15,139
what we are targeted for and of course

350
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:17,659
you'll yield yield

351
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:19,579
but also quality or resistance agronomic

352
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:22,068
traits specifically yell stability

353
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:24,649
because farmers like to have not every

354
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:25,789
year as a high they like not only one

355
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:28,188
yield the highest yield

356
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:30,620
stable you and what we are looking also

357
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:33,110
nitrogen because you may know in you we

358
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:37,259
have special directive for application

359
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:40,230
reduction of nitrogen but if you compare

360
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:42,840
with breeding program is iceberg this is

361
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:45,060
only upper part of iceberg if you hope

362
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,370
good deeply this is what we are

363
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:49,379
selecting for and this is Mike

364
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,360
at least my opinion John Luke please

365
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:53,639
confirm is the difference between maize

366
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,610
breeding because in mainstream give us

367
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:59,279
always yield yield yield and yield now

368
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:01,740
it's became some disease important

369
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:05,549
nitrogen is important but looking on

370
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:08,640
wheat really future mount of trace value

371
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:11,339
and this is very very different

372
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,190
okay between different country later on

373
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:16,740
I show you why but before to give

374
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:19,140
because probably not all of you have

375
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:22,049
been inside already mark with breeding

376
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,570
program or at least Bali Pro I have here

377
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:27,149
couple of slides to give you to bring

378
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:33,240
you a little bit in the fuel side this

379
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:37,140
is a crossing this is a crossing some of

380
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:39,720
them very happy and I could omit I out I

381
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,210
also could cross wheat but I have my

382
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,650
difficulty to cross sugar bit because

383
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:47,400
this is really small

384
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:49,650
and next one you could see this as they

385
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,900
started this is probably you don't know

386
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:54,360
we use this is for cow elusive inter for

387
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,250
the age because the age is still quite

388
00:17:54,359 --> 00:18:00,599
expensive but this is a really really

389
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:02,700
powerful tool very and then they started

390
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:04,559
selection you will see small plots as

391
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,480
breeders some breeders used only couple

392
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:10,259
of second to go to make say is this

393
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,630
election a long road and some disease

394
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:15,599
and you know the rules breeder will be

395
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:19,140
unhappy if it is no disease on the

396
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:23,069
breeders side because this gives

397
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:24,860
possibility for selection and secondly

398
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:27,659
sometimes I'm sorry mark in

399
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:29,639
misunderstand interpret as a job of the

400
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,490
breed success of breeder meaning such

401
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,620
job of the breeders to remove 90% of the

402
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,599
material from one generation to the

403
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:38,309
other deviation but what's the

404
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:40,740
difference between successful breeder

405
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:43,579
and unsuccessful successful breathe'

406
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,809
remove keep hand presence best

407
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:46,639
unsuccessful generator removes the

408
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:50,240
templates and

409
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,890
part of them and this is most important

410
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,779
for us because here we'll be combined

411
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:56,360
and combined will be measure everything

412
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:58,789
but you make mistake or not make because

413
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:02,149
here side-by-side comparison of the you

414
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:03,950
and I mentioned in Germany we have 17

415
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:07,610
location to test a yield because the

416
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:09,980
condition is I think is this life will

417
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:12,529
be interesting for you because look on a

418
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:15,620
farmer's field and this is one hectare

419
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:18,379
here is also one hectare farmer's field

420
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:22,399
farmers use about 8 hours for wheat

421
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:23,390
field for breeding field we used 600

422
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,798
working hours

423
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:29,600
let's make big difference I mentioned

424
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:33,650
that I would explain you a little bit

425
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:37,459
about the os3 program in Europe and here

426
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:39,860
we are in Germany here is our UK program

427
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:42,798
based in Cambridge of three positive

428
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:46,819
amperage and here we are in France again

429
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:48,970
a German is 3.2 france 5.1 UK flows it

430
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,970
2-1

431
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:56,659
this relate but they not overlapping we

432
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:59,269
could not make breeding from UK for

433
00:19:56,659 --> 00:20:00,980
Fujian money we could make partly and

434
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:04,489
you see here overlapping for North of

435
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:06,950
German because the condition and target

436
00:20:04,489 --> 00:20:09,649
is a new cable to have very short plant

437
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:12,798
type HT one example yellow frost or a

438
00:20:09,648 --> 00:20:15,439
while so in Windows in UK we could so in

439
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:18,079
December shortly before Christmas winter

440
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,028
with still and in Germany we could do

441
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:22,278
not that but in Germany we need to have

442
00:20:20,028 --> 00:20:25,429
at least a little bit winter Hodder's

443
00:20:22,278 --> 00:20:28,878
and for France is extremely important to

444
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:31,309
have PBS quality and I would explain you

445
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:34,608
in next one because against the country

446
00:20:31,308 --> 00:20:36,288
you have seen before in UK I think some

447
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:38,898
of you know the quality of the bread I

448
00:20:36,288 --> 00:20:41,599
would not have commented it in Germany

449
00:20:38,898 --> 00:20:43,729
we have different type of bread and in

450
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,528
France you should have at least baguette

451
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:48,378
quality as a case you're pissed

452
00:20:45,528 --> 00:20:50,808
successful variety will be not work you

453
00:20:48,378 --> 00:20:53,148
need so have say quality in France and

454
00:20:50,808 --> 00:20:58,009
you see the different for exampie P is

455
00:20:53,148 --> 00:21:00,558
25 EPS bread 69% in UK divided through

456
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:02,538
this width type and mix type of type

457
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:05,658
here is a you see the majority is going

458
00:21:02,538 --> 00:21:07,940
to fit type in Germany a is export which

459
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:10,999
is a highest level of protein about 8%

460
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:13,609
the most famously 49 plots and here is a

461
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:16,399
quality this mean all breeders like to

462
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:19,999
fit the best variety in a because as

463
00:21:16,398 --> 00:21:22,428
give mother breeding technologic I

464
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:24,889
already mentioned to you that his

465
00:21:22,429 --> 00:21:27,409
company started here k SS foundation

466
00:21:24,888 --> 00:21:30,019
this is was crossbreeding and them con

467
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:32,929
breeding is breeding hybrid breed sorted

468
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:34,940
here later on we have the same on rye

469
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:36,889
hybrid breeding can be a really proud of

470
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:40,340
that and I specifically show you a

471
00:21:36,888 --> 00:21:42,888
little bit in Highbury Highbury so in

472
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:45,918
tissue culture here is molecular marker

473
00:21:42,888 --> 00:21:49,608
area I think Susan you was pioneer on

474
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:53,629
rice first map I was pioneer honor first

475
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:55,849
ecology earlier I map and this is was 30

476
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:58,398
years ago the hope this is molecular

477
00:21:55,849 --> 00:22:01,329
marker we will help we make the help

478
00:21:58,398 --> 00:22:03,349
really and we still have big potential

479
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:05,089
smart breeding you could

480
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:08,269
on different way genomic research and

481
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:10,159
here also genomic slave and cannot type

482
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:11,900
in genome editing I will be put it also

483
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,910
somewhere here and here is stills

484
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:16,190
equation what will be the next and I

485
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,660
will be really happy to have from you

486
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:20,630
specifically from the younger generation

487
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:23,690
what PBS and our next step on one

488
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:25,850
breeding but going here tabloid cell

489
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:28,429
culture and we are really really happy

490
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:30,288
and we are happy on two different level

491
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:33,620
for example is this is not a secret

492
00:22:30,288 --> 00:22:36,740
all our ballet program and not only all

493
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:38,899
majority of breeders operated based on

494
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:41,599
micro sport culture because it's very

495
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:44,390
easy is really efficient methodologies

496
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:47,509
from micro sport culture to make not

497
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,200
expensive - and this is make easy for

498
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:50,569
selection

499
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,058
unfortunately microspore culture till

500
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:56,450
now not perfectly walking on a weed is

501
00:22:53,058 --> 00:22:58,428
still very high independence but we are

502
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:00,019
very lucky to use unser culture for

503
00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:04,400
example if good potential

504
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:08,298
but both micro sport culture and and the

505
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:10,250
culture doesn't before I at all I mean I

506
00:23:08,298 --> 00:23:12,798
have couple of ideas this relative is

507
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:15,619
open pollinated bees let out gene behind

508
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:17,418
of because homozygote e4i properties

509
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:21,168
this is a kill but this is a hippo test

510
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:23,419
we need them is marker-assisted

511
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:25,788
selection I already mentioned as this is

512
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:29,360
not bout that marker is helped us a lot

513
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:34,490
or specifically for targeted of very

514
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:36,439
important genes or allegory and genomic

515
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:38,750
selection I don't need to go in any

516
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,360
details here because I think you are one

517
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:44,089
of the pioneer for application and I'm

518
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:46,129
really very simple for you mark specific

519
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:49,459
page and look for you specifically to

520
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:53,120
help us to create idea to help us with

521
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:55,190
implementation I specifically put here

522
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:58,069
the slide is new breeding technology

523
00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:00,650
meaning genetic and you I not use bit

524
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:05,149
specifically I put sunflower here I like

525
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:07,690
as picture and secondly you read here

526
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:11,000
the possibility to a gray eight

527
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:13,970
alternative a linear variation for sale

528
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,909
and this was big hope for us in

529
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:19,269
worldwide but also in Europe but what

530
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:19,270
happened

531
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:30,700
he is staying for high-level European

532
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,279
Court and the problem what is all this

533
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:36,039
old decision was was made not only Chris

534
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:40,089
Barker's gene adding technology consider

535
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:43,379
remain delayed but also all new

536
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:47,470
classical made method of creating

537
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:51,610
inducible mutation should be regulated

538
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:54,789
only exception was done exception

539
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:58,719
meaning here all product which is

540
00:24:54,789 --> 00:25:00,759
already exist should be not because this

541
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,210
is could be put on the danger our shelf

542
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:05,980
in this is a mark of the half-empty

543
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:07,930
because a lot of mutation breeding

544
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:10,660
radiation mutation was done in the early

545
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:13,210
60 and Bali for example our traditional

546
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:16,920
German beer probably would be not

547
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:21,039
produce because it's variety was mutated

548
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:22,779
anyway this is decision is we need to

549
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,119
accept it this decision because this is

550
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:27,220
highest level of the court we need to

551
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:31,089
think what the solution could be what

552
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:34,170
the other possibility I would give you a

553
00:25:31,089 --> 00:25:37,389
very short very quick now a few example

554
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:39,250
successful and very shortly for comment

555
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:42,310
for these slides this is very important

556
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:44,380
to have these pillows in plus efficiency

557
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:46,149
through genomic selection or the morgue

558
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:49,120
method of optimization your breeding

559
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:51,160
program and you should have the great

560
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:54,219
elements I would not mention only trace

561
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:56,170
SS sources of GM or gene editing also

562
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:58,269
for us and I give the examples roots

563
00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:01,900
very important to understood what is

564
00:25:58,269 --> 00:26:04,180
behind of of black books and enabling

565
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:07,360
technology because I think technology is

566
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:09,279
also moving process I will not go in

567
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,659
detail to comment what we have here you

568
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,670
may look here I'm talking about

569
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:15,040
precision farming by talking about

570
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:17,620
biologicals it just may have attention

571
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:19,960
and we looking for because again the

572
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:22,179
directive of Europe European Union to

573
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,920
reduce the pesticide which is positive

574
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:26,470
for environment but we need to have the

575
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,279
alternative latest decision was to take

576
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,279
neonics

577
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,309
which

578
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:32,779
see statement elements push are really

579
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:34,879
agriculture in Europe on the page

580
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:39,730
because the disease virus this is

581
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,730
extremely dangerous on different field

582
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:47,439
with Phil's our own very shortly in

583
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:50,690
Germany we don't have every year as

584
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,690
epidemics but what we observe every year

585
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:57,620
we have contamination this because and

586
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:59,299
this is problem from early walk of a

587
00:26:57,619 --> 00:27:01,609
Hermann Buhl smile we know this is to

588
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:05,659
QTL and I'm talking now about for my

589
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:07,490
history this is already - line and you

590
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:11,180
could see this elite line from right

591
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:13,160
side here is already took two round of

592
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:15,740
the crossing but still is too long and

593
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:19,040
it's not only too long but is also have

594
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:21,529
a lot of acid is only the beauty here is

595
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,690
Fusarium resistance and this is what i

596
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:26,629
mentioned if you start to walk with

597
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:30,559
genetic resources potentially we have in

598
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:32,360
many cases many example linkage but

599
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,250
because we have now nice tool we have a

600
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:36,589
lot of market is not limitation now

601
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:38,660
anymore and we could potentially think

602
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:41,539
about to increase the recombination this

603
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:44,150
is give us possibility because one my

604
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:46,309
famous example I spot resistance on with

605
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:49,700
mark I think you started as your PhD

606
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:51,859
properly or before PhD is 30 years on

607
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:54,110
plant breeding to remove negative

608
00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:58,279
linkage trick on the segment on

609
00:27:54,109 --> 00:28:00,469
chromosome 7 because segment came from

610
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:04,009
aegilops wintry cosas and this took

611
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:05,779
extremely a long time to remove what

612
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:08,629
happened in our case I already mentioned

613
00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:09,349
here to measure PDL and our idea was 15

614
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:12,020
years ago

615
00:28:09,349 --> 00:28:14,000
I tried to put a ball speed rail in very

616
00:28:12,019 --> 00:28:17,359
susceptible background opals and

617
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,880
moderate and what you could see here in

618
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:22,759
both case they put in here this balls UT

619
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:26,000
all these balls is one also and without

620
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:29,180
video we could reduce the FH parenting

621
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,759
but what was most important for us they

622
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:35,000
also could reduce very strong the

623
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:37,970
don't content

624
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,559
and we have a nice marker for said you

625
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:44,000
could really easily follow in the

626
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:46,039
program if some is took us at least four

627
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,119
years because we go from some is three

628
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:51,799
through spring queen width which is

629
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:54,379
quickest idle as winter weed because you

630
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:57,230
don't need internalization and we have

631
00:28:54,380 --> 00:29:00,050
some prototype the reason why I tell in

632
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:02,839
prototype we still not release variety

633
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:05,119
the reason is because we still could not

634
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:07,789
fully combine the highest yield with

635
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:11,750
resistance we don't know it's probably

636
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:14,869
some biological mechanism behind it some

637
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:17,869
of you have been two years ago in Wien

638
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:19,459
in Austria on with genetics symposium

639
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:21,619
our last because next we will have

640
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:24,890
Congress and you maybe remember the

641
00:29:21,619 --> 00:29:26,899
section of FHP was six presentation we

642
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:29,570
are now talking about very small

643
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:31,759
segments from some is three all six

644
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:34,189
present-day presenters mentioned my gene

645
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:36,920
is correct and a gene was described

646
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:40,039
before is not wrong we don't know what

647
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,900
is this this segment is potentially some

648
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:44,450
interaction we believe don't be some

649
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:46,190
interaction behind it we don't know hey

650
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,720
if we don't know mechanism and if you

651
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:50,630
don't know how the relation of

652
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,670
resistance with yield because in some

653
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:55,040
case and breeders who is very

654
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:57,650
experienced not going for hundred

655
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,480
percent of resistance to one leaf

656
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:01,880
disease because they mentioned very

657
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,880
simple if I make the leaf survey empty

658
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:08,780
from one disease another will and some

659
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:11,390
of them cost energy for plant going back

660
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:13,160
and this is a really nice example where

661
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:15,440
we mentioned for German government if

662
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:18,320
you like to do such project the country

663
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,299
we will do is Canada and this is show

664
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,189
for us is excellently how the

665
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:24,919
international cooperation to be

666
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:27,620
invincible moving to hybrid I which is

667
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,250
my famous subject I am real like because

668
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:31,159
I came from

669
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:33,619
cantabile Russia and rye breads a very

670
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,810
popular it's very healthy like Germany

671
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:38,899
used Poland used and this is very good

672
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:40,879
product look in here this is pre basics

673
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:43,250
is but look on that and to pay your

674
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,780
attention this is not like corn because

675
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:47,119
in corn you have to line we have a

676
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:49,220
little bit complex system

677
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:51,619
and please pay your attention here

678
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:54,259
because this is exactly the seeds we are

679
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:56,299
selling for the farmers and here is

680
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:59,440
importance as we have fully Poland

681
00:30:56,299 --> 00:31:03,500
fertility restoration because if not

682
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:08,750
anyone have idea what will happen I saw

683
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:11,058
you here but probably most of you not

684
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:13,339
familiar bees air but but in early sixty

685
00:31:11,058 --> 00:31:15,920
pharmacy specifically collected air good

686
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:26,058
because a mark could you help me was

687
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:27,740
they all follow it inside an import

688
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:29,960
important here as their pharmacy

689
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:34,400
collected because it was used in early

690
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:36,079
60 against abortion and you could assume

691
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,929
what will be if you have too much in

692
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:40,909
bread air good and occasionally and this

693
00:31:38,929 --> 00:31:43,910
was case exactly where I really like

694
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:45,679
transplant see I like Brunei Walker in

695
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:47,929
Germany and this is biggest exhibition

696
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,509
of agriculture product and specifically

697
00:31:47,929 --> 00:31:53,080
a real light go through organic and two

698
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:55,879
years ago the lady doesn't matter who

699
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:58,099
just promote the rye bread and mentions

700
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,950
this is most healthy bread you have ever

701
00:31:58,099 --> 00:32:03,139
my next patient was a immediately what

702
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:05,420
what varieties and she mentioned me name

703
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:07,190
of all variety and they immediately next

704
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:12,920
patient what is this motor corn or

705
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:15,320
herbal and this is transference it

706
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,450
doesn't matter GM or organic we should

707
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:20,029
have clear description you should be

708
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:22,130
transparent enough to mention also some

709
00:32:20,029 --> 00:32:24,589
organic product could be danger if you

710
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:27,650
have too much don't in your beat organic

711
00:32:24,589 --> 00:32:31,220
production it is not healthy for you you

712
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:33,019
should avoid and here is a really

713
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:35,150
excellent example because variation on

714
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:37,190
the resistance is very very small we

715
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:39,950
don't have very small variation but what

716
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:42,519
is good is biological competition soon

717
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:46,039
we have enough healthy pollen grain

718
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:48,259
fungal doesn't have too much shuns and

719
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:50,509
this is competitions this is escape

720
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:52,759
readers will dimensions this is escape

721
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:54,920
but breeders professional breeder use

722
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:57,410
escape many many many times they

723
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:59,519
sometimes not care this is one was as a

724
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:01,320
type of

725
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,019
we know the position already a long time

726
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:06,240
and what is also beauty because we put

727
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:08,849
easily and I really like to show skill

728
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,519
all style style on marking to

729
00:33:08,849 --> 00:33:13,649
differentiate between your tile tile in

730
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,379
sterile because as the case bleeder

731
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:18,990
should make next cross and next year

732
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:21,480
will found this is felt allows therapy

733
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:23,940
safe one here and of course as this is

734
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:27,660
segment here located on promise on this

735
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:30,509
and again this is line I will it and

736
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:33,660
this is sources we use very efficiency

737
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:35,039
by crossing system because to select

738
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:37,980
correct plant you will be a next

739
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:41,399
generation again you save one here and a

740
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:44,120
summary here this is was hybrid twenty

741
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:47,400
years before and now with our current

742
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:50,039
hybrid because this is Poland plus and

743
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:52,380
Poland plus is nothing else as use of

744
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:55,259
genetic resources molecular breeding a

745
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:57,090
smart breeding which is my opinion one

746
00:33:55,259 --> 00:34:00,690
of the best example in Europe how we

747
00:33:57,089 --> 00:34:02,220
manage it and came in a little bit to

748
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:05,100
the history I already mentioned I I

749
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:07,110
started with mapping coverage genome and

750
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:10,648
here is Professor Rick Eva's his five

751
00:34:07,109 --> 00:34:18,269
six was five host rhyming and this is

752
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:21,239
chromosome two two markers some

753
00:34:18,269 --> 00:34:23,009
microsatellite is some traits and them

754
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:27,628
reference you know we started is

755
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:29,250
cooperation I will show the pink we

756
00:34:27,628 --> 00:34:31,889
improvement this year we will have

757
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:35,849
golden standard of right and what has

758
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:37,649
happened now we have 135,000 but we

759
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:40,049
operate it is six six times they did not

760
00:34:37,648 --> 00:34:42,269
have any limitation but you may ask why

761
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:44,789
we need this all stuff if you don't as

762
00:34:42,269 --> 00:34:46,769
one example like it if you because I was

763
00:34:44,789 --> 00:34:49,590
also involved the double one is array

764
00:34:46,769 --> 00:34:51,929
she 12 in weed is not intensive a

765
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:54,899
sensitive is is sensitive not

766
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:57,300
incidentally and located on chromosome

767
00:34:54,898 --> 00:35:00,480
five you know already location but now

768
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:02,490
have all markers in four days we could

769
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,789
came to candidate gene and this is

770
00:35:02,489 --> 00:35:08,219
peopled a perfect tool we could applied

771
00:35:05,789 --> 00:35:10,739
for said to verify our old story

772
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:12,149
probably wishes help us now tool and

773
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:14,519
enforce it

774
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:16,320
and again this is not jobs one person we

775
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:18,179
are really happy this is this project we

776
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,820
have folk work as a pistol in fun in

777
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:24,079
technical university professor Geiger

778
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:34,710
who is a pioneer of hybrid with a hybrid

779
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:36,449
program right breeder 35 year on

780
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:39,300
breeding but we are really proud to have

781
00:35:36,449 --> 00:35:41,189
a lot of young people who is with us who

782
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,680
learn about and who could bring this

783
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:46,619
knowledge to the next poly

784
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:49,609
I put not omit to stay without body and

785
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:52,349
here is completely different example

786
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:54,660
some of you maybe know Richard Pickering

787
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:58,110
he was all his life in New Zealand and

788
00:35:54,659 --> 00:36:00,359
he woke on integration of segments from

789
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:02,579
her dimple bosom which is secondary pool

790
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:04,950
of ballet to heard uncle Gary which is

791
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:07,829
Bali which is growing on the field and I

792
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:10,349
am personally shoot on me I make mistake

793
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:13,619
I mentioned for him Richard nobody will

794
00:36:10,349 --> 00:36:16,230
use this but we are very lucky that he

795
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:19,319
did because here is integration in one

796
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:23,219
chromosome is wishes give full dominant

797
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:25,830
resistance to bali trough wires and this

798
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:29,579
is a really important disease because

799
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:32,699
look on that this is with resistance

800
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:35,420
this is without you don't have healed at

801
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:39,119
all and this is transmitted through

802
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:40,980
unfit and because climate change we have

803
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,900
really big danger and specifically

804
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:47,909
because european union stopped

805
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:52,820
application on in 65 since i got very

806
00:36:47,909 --> 00:36:56,219
weak because again and i'm really proud

807
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:59,210
and this is again related to the formula

808
00:36:56,219 --> 00:37:01,829
you remember again generation interval

809
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:03,449
we start it immediately you publish

810
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:08,489
their your paper and we start it on

811
00:37:03,449 --> 00:37:11,250
valley the reason is because and what we

812
00:37:08,489 --> 00:37:13,949
did and this is all european material on

813
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:16,739
six-row barley it was happiness to see

814
00:37:13,949 --> 00:37:18,659
if this means we mix of f different you

815
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:20,219
don't have clustering because breeders

816
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:23,429
and I'm talking now

817
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:25,230
not about hybrids I'm talking about self

818
00:37:23,429 --> 00:37:25,889
pollinated crops this mean breeder

819
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,869
privilege

820
00:37:25,889 --> 00:37:30,329
- immediately some variety release to

821
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:32,940
exchange material is very variable we

822
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:35,369
have read a little bit about now current

823
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:38,579
situation partly related is Nagoya but

824
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:40,589
also partly related here give us

825
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:43,049
excellent basis to stop genomic

826
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:45,510
selection and we need this wind molt is

827
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:50,269
basis for winter mold quality ballet

828
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:53,370
wishes became popular here and very very

829
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:55,949
simple race and I believe this is not

830
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:57,329
problem to selection but is problem for

831
00:37:55,949 --> 00:38:00,389
selection because it's related to

832
00:37:57,329 --> 00:38:03,299
singular anyway makes the story short

833
00:38:00,389 --> 00:38:05,099
going through its important visual knows

834
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:08,550
that we will not replace the fuel

835
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:13,019
capacity but we put in fuel as the best

836
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:15,360
material it will also reduce genetic

837
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:17,750
gain per year to increase genetic ain't

838
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,650
very you because we reduce the cycle

839
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:22,920
theoretically and I already mentioned

840
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:26,039
PRP will take his dream to have half

841
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:29,070
your selection side is still far away

842
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:31,259
from what we have potential and we did

843
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:32,250
the same for molting poly because we

844
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,050
decide is okay

845
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:35,909
yield is important but important those

846
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:39,420
molding we published this in theoretical

847
00:38:35,909 --> 00:38:42,389
to Oktoberfest which is in September

848
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:45,180
in not because it's genomic selection

849
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:47,369
this is very well correlated with

850
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:49,199
selection again very important

851
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:51,750
because you know and probably don't know

852
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:54,269
the assessment of molting qualities very

853
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:56,730
expensive and patient always if you go

854
00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:59,400
to to to narrow and if you compare

855
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:02,750
compare the malting barley with fitting

856
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:05,820
poly you will see like white and black

857
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:08,489
very less genetic variation in Multan

858
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:11,130
public because all molting bali breeder

859
00:39:08,489 --> 00:39:12,989
going for the quality you need to have

860
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:14,820
the quality but then you don't have

861
00:39:12,989 --> 00:39:17,039
place for for for increasing of the

862
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:20,750
yield and we are really this was not

863
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:23,130
possible for us to do all this advantage

864
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:25,349
physical genetic map and we are really

865
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:27,450
proud and be self new round and don't

866
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:31,199
have time to put new science publication

867
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:33,329
on with but my personal opinion is nice

868
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:35,609
to have chance print as reference genome

869
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:38,639
and I'm really proud as we also involved

870
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:39,660
in 10 plus genome indeed because I think

871
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:41,788
as

872
00:39:39,659 --> 00:39:43,739
happened already in maze we shoot to

873
00:39:41,789 --> 00:39:48,000
have at least few variety and some of

874
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:50,068
them should go in quick truth is also

875
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,010
helped us a lot the technology developed

876
00:39:50,068 --> 00:39:54,719
using cast in single application be used

877
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:57,799
in array still in-house application

878
00:39:54,719 --> 00:40:01,078
again everything is related to genetic

879
00:39:57,798 --> 00:40:03,690
what happened during class twenty years

880
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:06,568
you could look by yourself here through

881
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:08,429
genetics become become genomics be

882
00:40:06,568 --> 00:40:11,068
informatique data integration by met

883
00:40:08,429 --> 00:40:13,618
exchanges i enormous precision

884
00:40:11,068 --> 00:40:15,989
phenotyping is limited factor and what

885
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:18,510
is most important for me personally and

886
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:20,899
for us translation of genomic knowledge

887
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:26,490
in breeders knowledge is essential

888
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:28,139
keywords about hybrid and to be aware

889
00:40:26,489 --> 00:40:30,598
what we are looking we are looking not

890
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:33,568
mid parent hitter roses you will found

891
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:35,460
some publication 25% not belief onset

892
00:40:33,568 --> 00:40:38,219
because you need to contract from

893
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:40,619
control heterosis meaning the difference

894
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:44,939
between your hybrid and the best elite

895
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:46,740
variety and this is not too much I was

896
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:50,869
really proud to be with literal English

897
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:50,868
to publish very nice review and

898
00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:01,318
papier-mache but I put put it

899
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:05,730
specifically as aim for hybrid we are

900
00:41:01,318 --> 00:41:07,739
still far away from I would don't have

901
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:09,990
probably time to go more deeply in

902
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:12,719
phenotyping we do on different level we

903
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:15,568
do on level of research we don't level

904
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:19,259
of reading and we do on level of the

905
00:41:15,568 --> 00:41:27,150
field this is I already mentioned for

906
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:32,039
you very very crucial we are looking for

907
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:33,809
the solution we have some halfway we are

908
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:36,569
working also in plant physiology because

909
00:41:33,809 --> 00:41:38,970
it still big disagreement some and

910
00:41:36,568 --> 00:41:40,949
physiology publishing verify module not

911
00:41:38,969 --> 00:41:43,169
an mentioned only experiment we could do

912
00:41:40,949 --> 00:41:44,969
on control condition is experiment we

913
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:47,369
have completely different opinion within

914
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:49,919
our experiment is the fuel as a question

915
00:41:47,369 --> 00:41:51,750
how to combine the looking and you know

916
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,250
state green is important for many probes

917
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:55,858
eros also

918
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:57,269
you're looking for mobilization this is

919
00:41:55,858 --> 00:42:00,090
very important for me to show you

920
00:41:57,269 --> 00:42:02,789
because public-private partnership is a

921
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:05,099
crucial and I think in Germany we have

922
00:42:02,789 --> 00:42:06,570
very good example maybe we found a very

923
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:09,510
good solution because you know for

924
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:10,950
scientists is publication is must if we

925
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:12,599
will protect it is the company

926
00:42:10,949 --> 00:42:15,059
publication we have problem to

927
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:17,700
cooperation but also he brings the best

928
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:22,619
material we bring our facility for

929
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:24,960
example this is very important slide for

930
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:26,700
me because I mentioned not only turnover

931
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,800
in company notice the amount of money we

932
00:42:26,699 --> 00:42:30,750
for us is very important to keep the

933
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,060
next generation and we are really proud

934
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:34,760
own own plan but it's academies this is

935
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:37,349
a small but they keep it unique

936
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:40,530
opportunity for young tells if somebody

937
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:42,300
who have specification for I will really

938
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:50,040
open to discuss with you and give you

939
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:54,660
some advice on our but also not forget

940
00:42:50,039 --> 00:43:00,690
about our issues my professor in

941
00:42:54,659 --> 00:43:03,868
genetics in academic hotel OVA she is

942
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:05,579
now 90 she is still active on V and for

943
00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:08,490
me this is a she is also part of

944
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:10,588
encyclopedia of Moshe Feldman she and

945
00:43:08,489 --> 00:43:15,299
this is really if you have specific

946
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:20,338
vision some of you may be no union any

947
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:22,769
of he was in Pioneer here and professor

948
00:43:20,338 --> 00:43:26,969
Geiger I know a lot of about population

949
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:28,739
genetics my gail he was the head and I'm

950
00:43:26,969 --> 00:43:32,809
really proud mark to pull you up because

951
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:32,809
you also motivate me in some directions

952
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:39,659
genomic selection and finish my

953
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:41,940
presentation I like to give this you put

954
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:48,269
your a little attention to look through

955
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:50,250
and to look what is very famous and be

956
00:43:48,269 --> 00:43:52,619
saw stay and this is the basis of gm+

957
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:54,269
for Canada Forest image and plant

958
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:57,269
breeding is not only science but also

959
00:43:54,269 --> 00:43:59,280
its large extent of art of success and

960
00:43:57,269 --> 00:44:02,039
not contribute without this variation

961
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,619
creativity and love us and this is my

962
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:07,199
message to you please try to spend your

963
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:10,440
time to think what's the kind of job you

964
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:13,889
like where's the job you go make your

965
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:16,470
happy this is not easy but this is very

966
00:44:13,889 --> 00:44:18,900
important in our life and visit I like

967
00:44:16,469 --> 00:44:21,230
to finish and I very simple for your

968
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,800
attention and I'm open for questions

969
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:28,190
thank you very much

970
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:31,860
[Applause]

971
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:34,170
thank you very interesting presentation

972
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:38,280
do you have a few minutes questions I

973
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:40,490
also would say people have specific

974
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,380
questions and we're finished here

975
00:44:40,489 --> 00:44:46,429
that meeting 4060 plazas meeting and

976
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:49,470
kill for and I by anybody that wants

977
00:44:46,429 --> 00:44:54,829
more with Victor come over here in

978
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:54,829
Aikido for attendance so our questions

979
00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:02,280
kws went through life cycle is kind of

980
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:07,410
shut it down or didn't survive just fine

981
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:12,180
we simple yeah they were operating by

982
00:45:07,409 --> 00:45:15,989
singles yes okay w wash down or how do

983
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:19,559
they I mean very complex question for me

984
00:45:15,989 --> 00:45:21,779
we could okay after because I'm I came

985
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:25,590
from country wishes was very heartily

986
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:28,680
affected by listen code and I have there

987
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:31,650
also a possibility in epic a wishes for

988
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:33,779
Madera Institute to read listen co paper

989
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:37,139
in original in the Russian language I

990
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:40,050
mean we don't have too much affected of

991
00:45:37,139 --> 00:45:42,269
key SS by listen caller this is a short

992
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:45,420
answer but now we came in back with

993
00:45:42,269 --> 00:45:47,969
epigenetics and again what I could call

994
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:49,349
film not everything what he did and what

995
00:45:47,969 --> 00:45:51,629
he write was wrong

996
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:53,670
and this is again message we talk with

997
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:55,740
young students sometimes we are too

998
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:58,289
conservative in our decision and

999
00:45:55,739 --> 00:46:01,799
scientists mentions this is only white

1000
00:45:58,289 --> 00:46:03,570
and black but between white and black a

1001
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,640
lot of different and this should be

1002
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:07,440
ready also for compromise to think

1003
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:09,779
probably indifferently

1004
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,990
no company was not affected by listen

1005
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,990
code

1006
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:29,710
so right now a lot of us from these are

1007
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:33,619
best resources to digital and if if the

1008
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:36,199
decision to regulate you when we use

1009
00:46:33,619 --> 00:46:40,400
this precedent or maybe that happening

1010
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:43,309
14 editing here on Troost you know how

1011
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,858
did I mean you know maybe in a lot of

1012
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:49,639
ways in the u.s. lucky because you

1013
00:46:45,858 --> 00:46:51,139
hadn't made this incredible financial

1014
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:53,269
investment in this technology

1015
00:46:51,139 --> 00:46:56,150
right and we say okay cool we keep this

1016
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:58,639
new one but what would be your new

1017
00:46:56,150 --> 00:47:00,858
feature advice to somebody who is

1018
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:03,368
looking at Englishness technology with

1019
00:47:00,858 --> 00:47:06,380
the fear that in say 10 20 years

1020
00:47:03,369 --> 00:47:11,920
somebody might make the decision that no

1021
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:14,630
actually we're going regulate I put my

1022
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:17,300
note because i doesn't like because a

1023
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:19,039
lot of things plays a role players are

1024
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:22,220
Lords a politician and many other things

1025
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:24,619
but as equation we answer will be please

1026
00:47:22,219 --> 00:47:26,689
invest in the technology but invest not

1027
00:47:24,619 --> 00:47:29,300
only in one technology I could answer

1028
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:31,460
also from site of pharmacy in pharmacy

1029
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:34,060
if it is from hundred projects you have

1030
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:36,920
one successful you are successful and

1031
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:39,920
last point to that but if you might

1032
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:42,170
decision to invite or invest in hybrid

1033
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,570
or in genome editing invest this is a

1034
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:48,079
long term because in two years you could

1035
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:52,280
not turn the game this should take four

1036
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:53,960
hybrid with 10 15 20 years probably we

1037
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:56,300
will be not successful I am quite

1038
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,720
skeptic but it is my personal opinion

1039
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:01,039
because I probably well inform on

1040
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:05,719
direction of that but I also see the

1041
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:09,469
potential because new advantage shown in

1042
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:13,118
generic solution could be helped us we

1043
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:13,118
will see I'm positive

1044
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:22,460
one last question how long did it take

1045
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:27,170
kws to commercialize their first hybrid

1046
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:29,329
driver as the story was following since

1047
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:31,809
the hybrid program was development by

1048
00:48:29,329 --> 00:48:35,119
Professor tiger in professorship and

1049
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:37,190
they found the sterility and this is who

1050
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:40,719
is the problem was with the restoration

1051
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:44,420
team and soon they have already few

1052
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:47,119
prototype of hybrid right they give it

1053
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:49,639
this is product to two company key SS

1054
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:52,339
and our competitors grade a specific

1055
00:48:49,639 --> 00:48:54,980
company for hybrid and both company

1056
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:57,820
start because healthy competition is

1057
00:48:54,980 --> 00:49:01,389
also mortal it's very important and to

1058
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:15,110
to register the first variety is still

1059
00:49:01,389 --> 00:49:17,539
but now we are this has been a

1060
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:22,360
production of Cornell University on the

1061
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:22,360
web at Cornell edu
