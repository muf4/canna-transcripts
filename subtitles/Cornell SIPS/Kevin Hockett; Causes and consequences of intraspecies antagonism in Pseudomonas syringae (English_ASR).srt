1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,309
this is the production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,309
University

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:13,519
so as was mentioned I just recently

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:16,100
started my assistant professorship at

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,300
Penn State University and so all this

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,950
work that I'll be telling you about is

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,539
all the work that I did previously at

8
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:23,570
the University of Arizona but we'll be

9
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:25,099
continuing on in my new position and so

10
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,039
we'll be looking at the causes and

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,480
consequences of antagonism among

12
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:31,520
different isolates four different

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,500
strains of pseudomonas syringae and

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,179
we'll be focusing in on this molecule

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,698
healer hear that i'll be telling you

16
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:41,539
more about or the SEC structure I should

17
00:00:37,698 --> 00:00:43,039
say so first there's a lot of people

18
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:45,109
that have been interested in this field

19
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,700
of thinking about plant associated

20
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:48,469
microbial communities and the different

21
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,630
factors that influence these communities

22
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:52,370
of course views have a number of effects

23
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:55,040
for plant health and production this

24
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:57,468
crowd is I don't need to explain that in

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,238
detail for this crowd but there's been a

26
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:00,739
number of things that have been you know

27
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:02,929
over the past decades that have been

28
00:01:00,738 --> 00:01:05,209
understood in terms of pi hosts being

29
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:07,909
important which organ you look at or

30
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:10,250
even more recently was compliant

31
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:12,019
genotype is in terms of determining what

32
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:15,469
the microbiome for the plant is going to

33
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:17,000
be as well there's also been as

34
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:18,649
understanding that the other microbial

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,569
members that are present are helping

36
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:22,819
structure the community as well this is

37
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:24,590
really where my interest focuses is

38
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:26,209
understanding the interactions that are

39
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:30,289
occurring between these resident

40
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:32,500
microbes within the plant environment so

41
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:35,090
my research questions really focus on

42
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:38,090
how do you microbial interactions affect

43
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:41,179
the ecology and evolution of these fine

44
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:43,280
associated microbes what are the genetic

45
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:46,549
basis of these interactions this is

46
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,019
where I focus or where I come from from

47
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:49,728
a very molecular genetic and molecular

48
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:51,618
biology background so I'm always

49
00:01:49,728 --> 00:01:54,349
interested in what the mechanisms of

50
00:01:51,618 --> 00:01:56,239
these interactions are how these

51
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:58,700
interactions are then going to influence

52
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:02,239
downstream five microbe interactions and

53
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:04,909
then finally as was alluded to how can

54
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,978
we exploit these interactions for say

55
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:08,989
pathogen control or stimulating

56
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:11,629
communities that are going to improve my

57
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:12,980
health and productivity but for the

58
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:17,509
purpose of today we're just going to

59
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:18,709
focus on these two areas here so a lot

60
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:20,439
of people here are very familiar with

61
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:22,330
Sigmund stringy I won't belabor it too

62
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:24,370
much but it's a ubiquitous final

63
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:26,200
pathogen there's over 50 or 60 different

64
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,599
paths noise now that has been described

65
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:34,089
and so as a species again fact a wide

66
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:35,349
range of host crops or host species so

67
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,689
when we think about the phases of

68
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:39,219
bacterial host interactions there's a

69
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:41,919
lot of work a lot of great work done

70
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:44,469
here thinking about the pathogen once it

71
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,149
gets inside and sort of the interaction

72
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:48,819
between the microbe and its host plant

73
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,580
at the genetic level I come from the

74
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:53,769
background coming out of Steve's lab at

75
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,390
Berkeley where the focus was a little

76
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:58,330
bit more on understanding the microbes

77
00:02:55,389 --> 00:03:00,099
as their existing on the leaf surface

78
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,390
and so what are the stressors that they

79
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:03,370
encounter there and how do they survive

80
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:05,589
there so that they can build up a

81
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,569
sizable enough population that ingress

82
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,909
into the plant host is a lightweight

83
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:13,000
occurrence and so we know that things

84
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:14,979
like acquiring nutrients evading

85
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,250
defecation stress or desiccation

86
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:20,889
tolerance as well as tolerating UV

87
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,629
exposure are all major factors for

88
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:27,189
bacteria living in this environment that

89
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:30,099
they have to tolerate so when we think

90
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:32,319
about the microbes in on the leaf

91
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:34,719
surface one thing is that we need to

92
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,459
realize or keep in mind is that they're

93
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,709
found in aggregate so they're not spread

94
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:41,550
evenly across the leaf surface and that

95
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:43,959
these aggregates tend to associate with

96
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,850
particular anatomical features so the

97
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:48,039
base of glandular trichomes or in the

98
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:50,859
intracellular grooves and so that's what

99
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:52,719
I'm showing here with this glandular try

100
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,810
come here we have a large aggregate of

101
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,830
bacterial cells you're forming and

102
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,319
there's a number of reasons why we think

103
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:02,560
these aggregates form at these locations

104
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:04,120
and one of them is that the data seems

105
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,009
to suggest that these are really where

106
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,920
you're getting leakage of water and

107
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:10,449
nutrients from the week interior onto

108
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:11,919
the exterior and so this is where the

109
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:17,289
bacteria are actually going to make a

110
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:19,329
living and so if we think about these

111
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,530
microbes fighting for finite resources

112
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:22,449
of course there's going to be

113
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:24,159
competition there's only so much space

114
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:27,610
and only so much nutrients that are

115
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,140
leaking out so we think about we know

116
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,030
that there is a number of different

117
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:33,819
species and within a species there's a

118
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:33,968
great especially for stringy there can

119
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:36,368
be

120
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:38,228
great diversity of different strains

121
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:40,919
that are inhabiting the same environment

122
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:43,360
so we think about them potentially

123
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:44,978
interfering with each other's ability to

124
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,509
compete this could either be to

125
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:48,758
requiring resources more effectively

126
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:50,639
than the other member but the thing that

127
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,919
I'll be telling you about today focuses

128
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,918
more specifically on antimicrobial

129
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:59,408
mediated antagonism and specifically

130
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:01,868
this class of compounds here referred to

131
00:04:59,408 --> 00:05:04,569
collectively as bacteriocins and this is

132
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:06,639
a large group of different proteinaceous

133
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:08,459
compounds and you can think of them

134
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,168
essentially as highly specific

135
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:13,298
antibiotics so with an antibiotic you

136
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:15,488
would expect that most all members

137
00:05:13,298 --> 00:05:18,068
within a given species if that species

138
00:05:15,488 --> 00:05:19,418
are sensitive to the antibiotic most all

139
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:21,189
the members will be sensitive to that

140
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:24,248
same antibiotic except for those that

141
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:26,169
have a specific resistance cassette for

142
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:28,389
these systems it's quite the opposite

143
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:30,399
just because one string of species is

144
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:32,319
sensitive to a given bacteria so there's

145
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,658
no reason to expect another strain will

146
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:37,209
also be sensitive and so there's a high

147
00:05:34,658 --> 00:05:38,978
degree of specificity again and they're

148
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:40,300
also protein-based so this is another

149
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:45,068
thing that separates them from a

150
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:46,959
traditional antibiotics and this is a

151
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:48,579
little bit of a renaissance within this

152
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:49,629
field I would say there's a number of

153
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:52,209
groups that have started to become

154
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:53,588
interested it's not just within cerini

155
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:56,228
but with another student known as other

156
00:05:53,588 --> 00:05:58,209
environmental pseudomonads as well but

157
00:05:56,228 --> 00:06:00,459
if you look at the literature from about

158
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:02,199
the mid 60s through the early 70s there

159
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:04,569
was also a number of groups at this time

160
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,249
looking at it and the diverse group in

161
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:09,338
particular one that I'm just

162
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:11,889
highlighting here these bacteriocins but

163
00:06:09,338 --> 00:06:13,118
at this point all of the tools are all

164
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:15,158
the questions that were being asked

165
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:17,309
we're using bacteriocins basically for

166
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:19,808
species delimitation as well as

167
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:21,879
epidemiological markers and of course

168
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:24,669
are the tools available at that time

169
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:26,860
didn't allow for really in detail

170
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:30,158
analysis of the particular bacteria is

171
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:32,079
being produced so the field shifted away

172
00:06:30,158 --> 00:06:33,610
from this into a number of different

173
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,649
angles and so this is sort of something

174
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:38,110
that again had been looked at but

175
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:39,788
there's still a number of very relevant

176
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:43,538
and important questions that need to be

177
00:06:39,788 --> 00:06:46,919
asked and so the three things that I'll

178
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:49,259
tell you about today is the gym

179
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,750
a bacteriocin production this is all

180
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,490
again within soon on stringy as well as

181
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,949
some of the work on the genetics of

182
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,900
sensitivity and then some of our hint as

183
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:59,009
to what potential ecological role these

184
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:04,769
actually may be playing in the

185
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:06,240
environment so first off to screen for

186
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:11,039
bacteriocins it's very straightforward

187
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:13,590
you just have your your strain growing

188
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,180
up in the broth culture you add some

189
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:16,619
chemical inductance or you just let it

190
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,199
grow long enough and eventually the

191
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,730
cells in there will lice and release the

192
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,339
killing agent in this case of bacteria

193
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:26,250
sand into the supernatant filter

194
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:28,439
sterilized pellet cells and then just

195
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:31,379
you have the sterile supernatant here

196
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:33,209
and then you spot this onto a lawn

197
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:36,269
recipient bacteria and so in this case

198
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:38,129
the donor strain is going to be one

199
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:40,349
Pseudomonas string eat in this case

200
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:41,730
probably path of our and then all these

201
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:46,080
recipients trains again I think the

202
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:47,670
different strengths stringy so as you

203
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,310
would expect if you just had a medium

204
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:52,830
and you spotted on sterile media you

205
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:54,449
won't get any inhibition of growth but

206
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:57,269
with the supernatant containing the

207
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:59,300
bacteriocin and a strain that sense that

208
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:01,740
you'll get a very defined killings off

209
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,949
and as I mentioned you can have the same

210
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,750
supernatant on an alternative string and

211
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:13,079
you won't see any additional until ever

212
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:16,319
so we're very specific so these were the

213
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:18,569
original 18 strains that I selected for

214
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,920
screening and this represents a fair

215
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:21,389
amount of the diversity within

216
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,340
Pseudomonas stringy although there's

217
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:25,169
many more environmental strings and

218
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:29,039
other Tyler groups now that we know

219
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:32,220
about in solicit showing just the

220
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,930
cladogram of their relationship and all

221
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,300
of these columns are going to indicate

222
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:38,129
where the activity is coming from and so

223
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:41,250
I'm spotting all by all all of the

224
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:42,539
columns are going to indicate where the

225
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,669
activity is going so these are the

226
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:46,889
producers and these are the sensitive

227
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:48,329
strains being tested so where there's a

228
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:50,460
wide box that will indicate killing

229
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:52,950
activity on black box will indicate no

230
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:55,200
activity so the first thing you can see

231
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:57,570
is that there's a quite a diversity of

232
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,910
killing activity among these different

233
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,819
strains in fact you can see that there's

234
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:04,899
certain pattern

235
00:09:00,818 --> 00:09:07,568
like t1 and lacquer man's 106 up here

236
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:10,989
they have very similar killing spectra

237
00:09:07,568 --> 00:09:14,349
and it's also very similar to sit seven

238
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:16,269
or pga down here and so these are not

239
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,159
very closely related but they seem to

240
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:20,288
have the same killing specter or very

241
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,178
closely related killing spectrum so this

242
00:09:20,288 --> 00:09:24,100
indicates there's a high amount of

243
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:36,428
genetic diversity underlying with

244
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:38,499
genotype within their species so as I

245
00:09:36,428 --> 00:09:40,509
mentioned my interest really stems from

246
00:09:38,499 --> 00:09:45,159
the genetics underline this phenotype

247
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:47,678
and so for that i went in and focused on

248
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:50,469
b7 288 been a workhorse in the field for

249
00:09:47,678 --> 00:09:51,818
some time and this is also holdover from

250
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,918
my graduate work that I'm most

251
00:09:51,818 --> 00:09:56,469
comfortable with this particular string

252
00:09:53,918 --> 00:09:58,478
and trying to understand what were the

253
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:03,548
genetic determinants for its killing

254
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:06,189
activity so we have a complete genome

255
00:10:03,548 --> 00:10:08,078
there's online databases that you can

256
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:10,238
feed the genome into and it'll predict

257
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:12,878
most all the bacteria so that are

258
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:14,339
encoded within a given genome and so it

259
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,538
predicted these two different

260
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:19,689
bacteriocins here and these are just

261
00:10:16,538 --> 00:10:22,658
their locust tags and they're related to

262
00:10:19,688 --> 00:10:24,188
ecoli bacteria social are single

263
00:10:22,658 --> 00:10:26,139
proteins and i have a characteristic

264
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:27,668
catalytic domain and the characteristic

265
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:29,739
immunity protein that protects the

266
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:32,259
producing strain so that are very easy

267
00:10:29,739 --> 00:10:34,929
to predict however when i deleted both

268
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:36,729
of these individually there was no loss

269
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:38,288
of killing activity and then when I

270
00:10:36,729 --> 00:10:41,079
stacked the deletion there was still no

271
00:10:38,288 --> 00:10:42,668
offline activities misled the idea that

272
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:43,988
of course there's some other source for

273
00:10:42,668 --> 00:10:46,328
this killing activity and where's of

274
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:50,038
that so doing some literature searches

275
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:52,269
as well as some more genome gazing I

276
00:10:50,038 --> 00:10:53,979
happened upon another area and this was

277
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:56,739
just a regulator that I thought might be

278
00:10:53,979 --> 00:11:00,399
involved and on the whole deleting it I

279
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:03,788
called a joint activity so what is this

280
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,499
dune well it is located in this region

281
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:07,509
that was originally described to the

282
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:10,749
prophage region so the regulator I

283
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:12,908
deleted or the pair of regulators are

284
00:11:10,749 --> 00:11:14,350
here and then downstream was this

285
00:11:12,908 --> 00:11:16,720
annotated prophage

286
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:20,019
actually conserved throughout sumon

287
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:23,379
stringy and it's within this larger or

288
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:25,480
flanked by these two but I uses mile

289
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:27,519
markers trippy and trip Jesus basically

290
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:32,500
interrupted the tryptophan biosynthetic

291
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:34,240
operon and so this regulator led to loss

292
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,279
of killing activity and so I had a sense

293
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,600
maybe this prophage region was involved

294
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:41,039
in the killing activity but of course

295
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,899
this could be regulating many things

296
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:47,439
just to remind ourselves when we're

297
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:48,850
talking about pro pages most people are

298
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,180
very familiar with this but just to make

299
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,980
sure with the bacteriophage for

300
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:55,299
temperate bacteriophages we think of

301
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,370
them as having these two different life

302
00:11:55,299 --> 00:12:00,399
cycles the characteristic one where it

303
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:02,500
injects its oh so or sorry its genome

304
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,419
into the host cell the genomes

305
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,309
replicated the genes are expressed this

306
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:07,659
leads to formation of new variants that

307
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:11,619
are then released into the environment

308
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:13,990
we have virus replication there's the

309
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,090
alternative pathway where once the

310
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,740
genomes injected into the host cell it

311
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:19,870
actually integrates into the host cell

312
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:22,750
genome and is maintained there in a

313
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,580
quiescent state and so it's replicating

314
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,500
as long as the cells replicating and at

315
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:29,710
some point this will become induced to

316
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:32,049
exit back out and go back into the lytic

317
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:33,910
replication cycle and so this region

318
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:38,379
that I found looked like an integrated

319
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:40,990
bacteriophage so as I said deleted the

320
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:42,669
regulator and we're anticipating that

321
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,799
it's regulating the rest of the genes

322
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:47,409
for the bacteriophage and then

323
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,959
complement it i also deleted the genes

324
00:12:47,409 --> 00:12:52,990
that made up the tail structure of the

325
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,639
bacteriophage as well as the receptor

326
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,680
binding proteins and these are the parts

327
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,240
of the bacteriophage that are critical

328
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:02,620
for interacting with its host cell and

329
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,529
then that could be complemented as well

330
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:08,409
so deletion of the regulator killing

331
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:10,269
goes away it's complemented deletion of

332
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:12,009
the tail genes also abolished as the

333
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:14,620
killing activity this was a large region

334
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:15,970
that I didn't want to it was about 10 KB

335
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,289
and I didn't want to take the time to

336
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,540
complement because it would have been a

337
00:13:17,289 --> 00:13:20,889
little bit of a hassle so then just

338
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:23,019
focusing on the receptor binding

339
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:26,409
proteins I also lose connectivity and

340
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:27,470
this is complement and so we can say now

341
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:29,089
that this

342
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:31,490
predicted prophage encodes a

343
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:33,889
bacteriophage drive bacteriocin or what

344
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:37,460
we commonly just referred to as a tale

345
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:41,480
of sin and so as Melanie had actually

346
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:43,250
alluded to her work looking at the pious

347
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,340
ins of pseudomonas aeruginosa these have

348
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:50,029
been studied for a long time three four

349
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:52,129
decades if not longer actually and since

350
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:53,750
the besom trade AGM and there's been a

351
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:55,519
number of stringy genomes that had been

352
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,200
sequenced and we had the original search

353
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,240
you know they've been number of genomic

354
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:03,110
comparisons that there had never been a

355
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:05,450
description of a tailless and encoded

356
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:07,039
within the genomes of the strains that I

357
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,600
was looking at it led to this question

358
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:12,829
why is that if we've had this

359
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:14,779
information and we would think that if

360
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:16,670
it was just one co-option of one

361
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:18,980
bacteria page for this that we would

362
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:21,620
have seen it in the genome that wasn't

363
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:24,909
the case so again the question is are

364
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,409
these derived from the same progenitor

365
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:29,209
so if we look at the genomic sequence

366
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:31,730
they're actually located in the same

367
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:34,100
area so here in original just again the

368
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:37,430
mile markers trippy and rip gee it's the

369
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,779
same region for pseudomonas syringae but

370
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:40,579
when we compared the nucleotides

371
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:41,990
identity across this region we can see

372
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,360
that the conserved bacterial genes

373
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,159
indeed are conserved right we think

374
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,279
they're vertically inherited but there

375
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:51,199
is no nucleotide or protein sequence

376
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:56,539
similarity at all between these two

377
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:58,250
tables of regions so it seems the answer

378
00:14:56,539 --> 00:15:00,949
seems to be that no these are derived

379
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:04,250
from independent progenitors but just to

380
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:07,759
wrap that up we did some phylogenetic

381
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:10,789
inference comparing these two tails and

382
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,500
to their progenitor bacteriophages to

383
00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:14,659
see if they were clustering similar to

384
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,970
each other or at with different

385
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:20,389
bacterial pages indeed that's what we

386
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:22,700
saw so here we see pseudomonas ringing

387
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:24,529
and all the I slips up here our most

388
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,100
closely related to either phage new or

389
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:29,299
page SSB for this particular protein

390
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,360
whereas pseudomonas aeruginosa is

391
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:35,269
clustering with HP too and we see this

392
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,800
for all three of the genes that we

393
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:38,929
actually had a reasonable amount of

394
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,750
alignment that we could rely on most of

395
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:42,609
the other genes that are present

396
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:49,059
you can't align them so you can't do

397
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:50,919
these sorts of analyses okay so then the

398
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:53,049
conclusion is these are in fact drived

399
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:55,000
independently of each other they don't

400
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:57,099
have really any nucleotide approaching

401
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,259
sequence identity to speak of their

402
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,300
clustering with distance actuary pages

403
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:03,909
these bacteria pages are related to each

404
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:05,289
other but people who work on

405
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:08,319
bacteriophages know them to be very

406
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:09,789
distinct from each other and so this

407
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,190
means that there's been multiple levels

408
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:14,019
of convergence that's occurred first we

409
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:17,080
have the synthetic conversion so that

410
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:19,949
both of these Taylor sins are ending up

411
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,960
in the same genomic region in these two

412
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:24,520
hosts we also have the phenotypic

413
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,490
convergence where we're going from a

414
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:29,529
bacteriophage to a bacterial Center to

415
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:30,970
at a lesson and so this would also

416
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:32,889
suggest that there's going to be some

417
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:37,029
molecular convergence as well what do I

418
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:40,240
mean by that so just very grossly

419
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:42,399
looking at this structure for the maya

420
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,889
verde so these are tail bacteriophages

421
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,949
that have a double-stranded DNA genome

422
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:49,179
you have the header the capsid

423
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,860
associated or attached to that as the

424
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:53,139
tail and then at the distal end again

425
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:56,440
are the tail fibers or the receptor

426
00:16:53,139 --> 00:17:02,319
binding proteins and so this is what it

427
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:05,529
would look like with tem when we compare

428
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,930
the genes that are conserved here within

429
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:10,899
the tailless in region 4 this is B 728 a

430
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:13,120
back to SF b or page me and just focus

431
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,860
on page me up here you can see this only

432
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,989
the genes corresponding to the tail

433
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:19,240
region are retained so all the genes

434
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:22,870
necessary for regulation capsid

435
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:25,838
morphogenesis and such have been lost

436
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:28,599
from the page we need genome in this

437
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,919
talisman region and this was something

438
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:31,809
that had already been understood to

439
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,180
occur with the tailless and for

440
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:36,009
pseudomonas aeruginosa as well and so we

441
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:40,360
can see that we have the similar loss of

442
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:43,779
genes between these two systems so then

443
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:45,429
you go from bona fide bacteriophage to

444
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:47,619
this structure here where again now you

445
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:52,710
can see just the tail there's no head or

446
00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:52,709
capsid associated with this structure

447
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,740
so how we think these are working

448
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:01,409
borrowing from the literature for

449
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:04,349
pseudomonas aeruginosa if you look at

450
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:06,630
the outer membrane right for gram

451
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:09,329
negative bacteria the tail fibers

452
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:11,130
interact with a cell surface receptor on

453
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:13,589
the outer membrane the tail contracts

454
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:15,419
drives this core structure through the

455
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:17,369
outer membrane into the inner membrane

456
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:21,480
and this is going to deliver the phage

457
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:23,219
genome to the host so if you don't have

458
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,079
a genome to deliver though and we think

459
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,240
there's other adaptations as well as big

460
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:28,980
part of this is you don't have a genome

461
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,589
to deliver so you're basically an open

462
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:34,230
end up here and it still is going to

463
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:35,879
contract it's going to interact or drive

464
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,740
the core through the outer membrane and

465
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,720
into the inner membrane but at this

466
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,519
point it's going to lead to

467
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:50,940
depolarization rather than sage delivery

468
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:52,710
or sorry genome delivery so I was we can

469
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,450
imagine with these tail fibers since

470
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,829
it's known from the work with bacterial

471
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:57,569
pages that these are important for

472
00:18:55,829 --> 00:19:00,119
interacting with the host cells this is

473
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:01,889
a great target then for starting to

474
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:03,839
think about the specificity between a

475
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,400
given to a lesson and the cells that are

476
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:09,329
for the strings that are targeted by

477
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:11,190
that Taylor femme and so if we look at

478
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:13,500
this region across the number of

479
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,960
different strains we can see that the

480
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:20,009
receptor binding protein itself tends to

481
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,829
be the most divergent and so this region

482
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:24,679
here sequence similarity would extend

483
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:27,119
for about 10 or 15 kilobases upstream

484
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:29,580
which are all the core components of the

485
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:31,288
tail offense but with the receptor

486
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:32,759
binding protein and its associated

487
00:19:31,288 --> 00:19:35,099
chaperone there seems to be a lot of

488
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:39,529
evolution recombination that's occurring

489
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:41,459
in this region so can we engineer

490
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:46,099
retargeting in this way and the answer

491
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:49,048
is yes so for pj a path of our japonica

492
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:51,240
it is not natively able to kill pass

493
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:54,359
parked in india or path of our glycemia

494
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,159
as i'm showing up here however if i just

495
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,839
take those two genes the receptor

496
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:01,559
binding protein and we associate the

497
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:04,199
chaperone from be 720 and express it and

498
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:06,359
japonica without anything else i can now

499
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,019
retarget it to kill these two strings

500
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:10,699
because of these

501
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:10,700
to relate natively kills those teacher

502
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:15,599
and so I've done this for a number of

503
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:20,309
different strains and all of this

504
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:22,019
activity is transferable from pj i've

505
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:23,399
done with be seven tre day as well and

506
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:24,990
these other strains so basically

507
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,759
everywhere where I look I don't

508
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,950
anticipate all of this activities

509
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:30,599
derived from the tail so that it seems

510
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,340
like that's the majority of the killing

511
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:34,669
activity because I have some evidence

512
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:37,109
and I'll show you that in a second of

513
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:47,610
what some of these other bacteriocins

514
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:52,109
maybe do and again these killing spectra

515
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:55,019
are readily modifiable ok so now

516
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:56,819
shifting to we have essentially the key

517
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:58,529
in this scenario right so what's the

518
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:03,139
lock what is it about the host cell

519
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:03,139
that's also determining the specificity

520
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:09,180
we focused in early on a little

521
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,220
polysaccharides we had a couple of

522
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:13,500
reasons for doing that's one all of the

523
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:17,009
bacteriophages that these tail essence

524
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,539
are related to they all target LPS and

525
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,910
most people are familiar with this with

526
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:23,190
the major component of the gram-negative

527
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:25,230
outer membrane where you've got this

528
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:28,950
lipid portion here that's embedded in

529
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:31,349
the outer membrane another portion of

530
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:33,440
the core oligosaccharide that does vary

531
00:21:31,349 --> 00:21:36,779
a little bit but tends not to very very

532
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,420
significantly among strains and then the

533
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:41,490
highly divergent Oh specific or the

534
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:45,390
o-antigen component it's highly variable

535
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:47,460
among strange even within a species so

536
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:49,890
as I mentioned it was this is a known

537
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,299
receptor for back the bacteria pages

538
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:53,310
that the tail of sins are derived from

539
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:55,669
but also as you would expect for the

540
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:59,129
students original site a listen as well

541
00:21:55,670 --> 00:22:01,400
so we received a number of streams from

542
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:05,190
that Templeton's group and New Zealand

543
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:07,080
where he had characterized LPS mutants

544
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:09,779
and so these are all transposon

545
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:12,929
insertion mutants so I'm showing up here

546
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:14,430
at the top we have wild-type LPS this is

547
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,930
the wild-type strain and then these are

548
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:18,299
two strains that have a transposon

549
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:19,230
insertion but it's not associated with

550
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:21,000
LPS

551
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:24,079
so we can see that the killing activity

552
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,460
for this strain is tailless and arrived

553
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:28,109
because the structural mutant and the

554
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:31,558
receptor binding protein needles they

555
00:22:28,109 --> 00:22:34,109
lose all the account activity we still

556
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:36,178
have killing for these LPS mutants down

557
00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:38,490
here for the wild husband we would

558
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:39,870
expect that if the LPS is the receptor

559
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,910
that we wouldn't have seen any join

560
00:22:39,869 --> 00:22:44,069
activities however there's two things

561
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:46,048
that you can see right away first is

562
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:47,909
that these killings owns are

563
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:50,490
phenotypically distinguishable from you

564
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:52,320
so these have a very sharp edge which is

565
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:54,870
characteristic of the tails and killing

566
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:56,839
because it's a big bulky structure they

567
00:22:54,869 --> 00:23:00,119
cannot diffuse efficiently truth yoga

568
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:02,490
whereas for other compounds like smaller

569
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:04,500
single protein bacteriocins they're much

570
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:06,839
smaller and so they can deceased diffuse

571
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:10,380
through the auger matrix so you can get

572
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:11,819
the diffused killing zone here but the

573
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,740
other bit of evidence to show that it's

574
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:15,450
clearly not fit a lesson is in the

575
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,700
tailless and deletion mutants we still

576
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:19,710
had the same killing activity recovered

577
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,929
and so this indicates that there's

578
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:26,308
actually some other source of the

579
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:28,440
killing and so as I had shown before the

580
00:23:26,308 --> 00:23:30,509
deletion of this particular bacteriocin

581
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,380
it doesn't affect the killing of the

582
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:35,730
wild-type strings with wild-type LPS

583
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:39,270
deletion compliments and then the mock

584
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:41,190
compliment however now with these LPS

585
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:43,829
means you can see that by deleting this

586
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:45,360
alternative bacteriocin all the killing

587
00:23:43,829 --> 00:23:49,048
activities abolished in this is all

588
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:50,939
complement able as well so we have a

589
00:23:49,048 --> 00:23:52,230
genetic distinction here between the

590
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,929
killing activities but we can also

591
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:57,839
distinguish them physically as well so

592
00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:59,490
by doing a step of paid precipitation

593
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:01,439
it's just a simple method where you can

594
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:03,240
separate bulky high molecular weight

595
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,580
molecules from smaller molecule early

596
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,169
molecules this is very efficient for

597
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:12,089
recovering and it was developed as a

598
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:14,070
technique in the bacteriophage field you

599
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:16,199
can see that we can recover all of the

600
00:24:14,069 --> 00:24:18,928
tails and mediated killing activity the

601
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,090
two mutants complimented mutant and then

602
00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:23,190
a mox compliment but all the killing

603
00:24:21,089 --> 00:24:24,629
activity against the LTS weakness was

604
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:27,298
completely lost and not be comfortable

605
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:29,340
and so this is really interesting and is

606
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:31,529
something actually that to my knowledge

607
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:32,789
has not been reported on within the

608
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:35,279
bacteriocin field

609
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:37,740
that's that gaining resistance to one

610
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,200
tailless and led to sensitivity of the

611
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,480
other Taylor sense so it's not just not

612
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,220
only is there redundancy here but it's

613
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,569
conditional redundancy it's not but

614
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:48,420
they're both killing at the same time

615
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:50,250
but one has to be sent or sorry the

616
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:56,670
string has to become resistant to one to

617
00:24:50,250 --> 00:25:00,049
become sensitive to the other so

618
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:03,750
additionally we recovered a number of

619
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:05,669
streams that were resistant de novo

620
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:08,130
resistance to the talisman and so

621
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:10,289
working here with the green bean

622
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:12,330
pathogen half of our physio licola as

623
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:15,240
well as the soy pathogen path of our

624
00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:17,519
glycaemia i just essentially exposed

625
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:25,130
these cultures to the b7 trade a

626
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:25,129
tailless n selected for resisting colony

627
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:31,920
confirm their resistance in sequence

628
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:33,569
their genome and as we would expect most

629
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:36,090
of the genes that we recovered this is

630
00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:39,289
just a small subset of the mutants that

631
00:25:36,089 --> 00:25:41,250
I've sequence they all map back to genes

632
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:43,230
glycosyltransferases in particular in

633
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,569
these are well known to be involved in

634
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,829
LPS biosynthesis and they're closely

635
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:51,539
related to those that have been

636
00:25:46,829 --> 00:25:53,759
described in e.coli and so the question

637
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:56,369
that I had coming out of this thinking

638
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,230
about how these interactions in between

639
00:25:56,369 --> 00:26:00,089
these microbes in the environment we

640
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:03,120
expect that there will be selection for

641
00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:04,679
resistance that will be imposed within

642
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:06,179
the environment and so if the strain

643
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,490
does become an assistant to a given

644
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:10,940
bacteria sending in this case sort a

645
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:14,279
listen does that affect its ability to

646
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:16,730
interact with the toast plant so for

647
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:19,200
both of these strains the answer was yes

648
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:22,470
here we're looking at just infiltration

649
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,080
in this case the green bean pathogen and

650
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:28,589
green bean the black bar here is the

651
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:30,359
wild-type the gray bar here is heartfelt

652
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:32,429
deletion so this is blocked in its

653
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:34,289
ability to express the type 3 secretion

654
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:37,230
system and then all of these other

655
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:38,990
strains here BRMS bacteriocin resistant

656
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:42,180
these are all independent eye slits

657
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:44,069
independent mutations and we can see

658
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:46,590
that after 24 hours they really have a

659
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:48,720
growth defect except for this last 111

660
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:50,220
it has something of a growth defect that

661
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,710
seems to do better than the other

662
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:55,169
strains and that this growth defect does

663
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:57,179
persisted for EA shun 72 at least for

664
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:58,500
some of the strains I expect that this

665
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:00,419
is actually true for more of these

666
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,460
strains that there was just not enough

667
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:07,169
replicates here to get the statistics to

668
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:10,650
work and the same is true for path of

669
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:12,659
our glycemia so we can see again at 24

670
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:15,000
hours these strains are doing just about

671
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:16,980
as poorly as the harpell deletion mutant

672
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,099
does although they do significantly

673
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:24,058
better at 48 hours and 72 hours post

674
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:26,639
infiltration and again I think there's

675
00:27:24,058 --> 00:27:28,710
some replication issue here that but

676
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,210
I've seen this multiple times with this

677
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:32,190
experiment multiple independent

678
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:33,778
experiments they always lag behind the

679
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:40,320
wild type string even at these later

680
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:42,119
time points okay so we know some of the

681
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:44,700
genetics underlying the bacteria some

682
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:46,709
production as well as what the

683
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,690
determinants for the sensitivity are and

684
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:50,399
so now we want to ask well does this

685
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:52,830
actually matter in an ecological sense

686
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:56,519
and so again going back to some of the

687
00:27:52,829 --> 00:27:58,319
literature from the mid 60s so for

688
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,240
example a study here by Garrett and

689
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:01,798
colleagues where they were looking at

690
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,740
pseudomonads that they were taking off

691
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:06,629
of different fruit trees and this is a

692
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:09,720
little busy but I just want you to focus

693
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:12,000
on here when they looked at the bacteria

694
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,890
so that they were producing and the

695
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,250
majority of eye slits coming from pair

696
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:19,110
didn't kill other eye slits from pair

697
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:21,599
but they did kill ISIL it's coming from

698
00:28:19,109 --> 00:28:23,490
citrus and the converse was also true

699
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,369
but the majority of strains isolated

700
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:30,659
from citrus don't kill other citrus eye

701
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:32,788
slits but do kill pair Iceland so I had

702
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:35,100
the opportunity to collaborate with

703
00:28:32,788 --> 00:28:38,579
károly bulb and she was still out the

704
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:40,139
USDA in the Salinas Valley to ask some

705
00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:43,319
more questions based on collections of

706
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:45,270
strange she had had so many people may

707
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:46,950
be familiar with the Salinas Valley it's

708
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:49,769
essentially the salad bowl of America

709
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:51,929
during the spring and summer growing

710
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:56,329
seasons before it shifts largely to

711
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:56,330
southern Arizona for the winter growing

712
00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:00,929
in what she'd notice in this valley

713
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:03,869
there had been two different paths of

714
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:07,650
ours half of our API that would cause

715
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:08,969
leaf spot on celery and a different path

716
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,509
of our quarry and drink was it would

717
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:14,220
cause Lee spot-on salaam trance all

718
00:29:11,509 --> 00:29:16,410
these had been known to occur within the

719
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,600
Salinas Valley and in the late 90s early

720
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:21,150
2000s there was this new disease that

721
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:24,089
emerged leaf spot of parsley so these

722
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:25,920
are all maybe AC family but the

723
00:29:24,089 --> 00:29:28,139
interesting observation that she had is

724
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:31,019
that within the field or within a given

725
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:33,360
plan even though both of these paths of

726
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:35,160
ours existing are causing disease within

727
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:38,579
the valley she never found a mixed

728
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:41,548
infection so this would either be caused

729
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:44,928
by out of our API or a park ranger core

730
00:29:41,548 --> 00:29:48,389
that she never found them co infecting

731
00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:50,130
and so our question was well as this

732
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:52,009
potentially bacteriocin mediated

733
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:54,419
inhibition that's leading to this

734
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:57,990
difference so we screened a number of

735
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:59,759
API isolates and related strains and

736
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:03,240
compared those to the quarry and Rick

737
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:04,379
wise words and so now I'm just lumping

738
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,419
everything together i'm not showing

739
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,220
every I split individually but what I

740
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:10,919
want to draw your attention to is that

741
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:13,500
essentially all the API isolates killed

742
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:16,679
all the quarry in Jurek lies button so

743
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,970
this doesn't guarantee that this is why

744
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:19,769
there's this trade-off going in the

745
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:22,259
field but it's a strong indication it's

746
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:24,179
likely this is why you're only getting

747
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:26,339
one or the other infected even though

748
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:30,150
they're so confident and infecting this

749
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:31,349
host and so you know originally I

750
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:33,480
thought maybe there was going to be

751
00:30:31,349 --> 00:30:35,969
reciprocal antagonisms but it turns out

752
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,779
that's likely not the case that it's

753
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:42,179
actually the path of our API if it

754
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:43,859
encounters the host first then it's

755
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:45,780
going to block or indirectly and Corrine

756
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:48,959
drikl is only going to infect in the

757
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:51,089
absence of API so of course there's work

758
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,679
that we're planning to do where we'll

759
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:54,990
get some resistant needs to Cory and

760
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:57,929
Ricola and then see it now we can get a

761
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:59,730
mixed infection and then conversely go

762
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:02,340
in and delete the bacteriocins out of

763
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:04,019
API and see if that also will allow for

764
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:08,029
the same co-infection to occur as well

765
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:08,029
and so that's ongoing work

766
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:13,200
so with that I would just like to

767
00:31:10,819 --> 00:31:16,109
acknowledge my collaborators on this

768
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,749
work I postdoctoral adviser Dave altiris

769
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:20,548
as well a collaborator time runner who

770
00:31:18,749 --> 00:31:22,860
really helped out with the molecular

771
00:31:20,548 --> 00:31:24,658
phylogenetics for understanding the

772
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:26,128
evolution of the tailless in a bit the

773
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:29,190
derivation of the tail ism from

774
00:31:26,128 --> 00:31:30,990
independent bacteriophages and then care

775
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:33,028
label again she is not moved to Penn

776
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:34,679
State and then I've had a number of

777
00:31:33,028 --> 00:31:36,388
students that have worked with me and

778
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:38,190
contributed to the work that I've shown

779
00:31:36,388 --> 00:31:41,459
and then of course I've gotten support

780
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:45,590
through the SQ service working so with

781
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:45,590
that be happy to take any questions

782
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:51,419
[Applause]

783
00:31:52,038 --> 00:32:00,179
questions he's not here is it someone

784
00:31:57,118 --> 00:32:03,808
else asked um boys miss U's car seat

785
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:08,369
oxygen do you see that there's like more

786
00:32:03,808 --> 00:32:10,440
API cause like outbreaks yeah it's

787
00:32:08,368 --> 00:32:12,028
seriously I'll competing the other no

788
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,558
that's a really good question and that's

789
00:32:12,028 --> 00:32:14,878
something that I would really need to

790
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:17,878
talk to Carol II about because she has

791
00:32:14,878 --> 00:32:19,918
that data I don't know if that's true

792
00:32:17,878 --> 00:32:21,538
but that would be an expectation if its

793
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,999
inhibition in that way unless there was

794
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:26,908
some other compensatory thing that API

795
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:28,440
is not as good as remaining in certain

796
00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:30,778
reservoirs or something like that there

797
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,100
may be some trade-off there but we would

798
00:32:30,778 --> 00:32:34,669
expect that that's the only thing going

799
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:42,658
on the API may become the dominant one

800
00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:44,820
yeah good question the question of leave

801
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:48,379
earlier in the talked you said that in

802
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:50,960
order for one of the blue monosomy Isis

803
00:32:48,378 --> 00:32:53,579
resistance one bacterial so they must

804
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,429
swim trade-off and stability to a

805
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:58,888
different one and i was wondering if you

806
00:32:56,429 --> 00:33:00,720
could explain why that might be or as if

807
00:32:58,888 --> 00:33:03,058
are their genes are specifically being

808
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,759
trade to get it out at the same book is

809
00:33:03,058 --> 00:33:07,408
it might cause that so sorry just to

810
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:09,149
reiterate you're asking for the

811
00:33:07,409 --> 00:33:11,610
trade-offs and insensitivity between the

812
00:33:09,148 --> 00:33:14,729
two what is the basis why is there that

813
00:33:11,609 --> 00:33:16,769
trade-off yeah and the answer is I don't

814
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:17,909
know right now has a couple hypotheses

815
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:21,220
so

816
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:23,769
LPS is well known to serve a protective

817
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:26,350
function and so the idea maybe one of

818
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:30,399
the largest component of the outer

819
00:33:26,349 --> 00:33:32,859
membrane and so potentially by losing

820
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:34,298
the LPS in its full structure there's

821
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:36,519
still the lipid a is going to be there

822
00:33:34,298 --> 00:33:39,099
probably the coral ago saccharide may

823
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:40,960
still be there as well but it's lost all

824
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:43,418
of the o-antigen and the thought is

825
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,220
maybe there's some stress in the outer

826
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:48,509
membrane that's leading to upregulation

827
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:51,460
of an alternative cell surface receptor

828
00:33:48,509 --> 00:33:53,740
that's all surface receptors are sort of

829
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:56,230
similar but different hypothesis because

830
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,700
that that receptor is always there but

831
00:33:56,230 --> 00:34:00,099
the other bacteria some one of the

832
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:02,308
function of the LPS again we think about

833
00:34:00,099 --> 00:34:05,918
it protecting against oxidative stress

834
00:34:02,308 --> 00:34:08,320
antimicrobial peptides but it may also

835
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:11,349
be protecting this alternative receptor

836
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,849
from this other bacteria from being able

837
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:14,800
to access it and so there's a couple of

838
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:18,220
different questions but other than just

839
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,320
the loss of the for the disruption of

840
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:21,969
those LPS genes there shouldn't be

841
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,940
anything else different about those

842
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:26,168
strains complimenting them and showing

843
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:28,510
that it goes back I think would be

844
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:35,289
critical to shine that yeah but it's a

845
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:38,740
good question a quandary so what the

846
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:43,690
expression patent about the pro case

847
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:47,678
yeah yes you do for you please beaker

848
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:49,148
sawdust 50 with cards yeah no it's a

849
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,039
really interesting question when are

850
00:34:49,148 --> 00:34:53,469
these when is this going to turned on

851
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:54,608
potentially within the plant environment

852
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:56,819
right that's where we would care about

853
00:34:54,608 --> 00:35:00,670
so I do know that after infiltrating

854
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:03,700
fell into susceptible hosts and coming

855
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:05,139
back 24 hours I can recover the specific

856
00:35:03,699 --> 00:35:07,779
coloring activity so they are getting

857
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:09,819
induced once at hand side I anticipate

858
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:12,130
that potentially certain stressors on

859
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:15,039
the leaf surface like UV exposure or

860
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:17,380
defecation stress or starvation will

861
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:20,050
also induce them so for all of mine

862
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:21,880
right I use mitomycin c it's sort of the

863
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:24,280
sledgehammer to get them to turn on all

864
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,050
of their SOS systems and produce all

865
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,700
these different compounds

866
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:29,860
the interesting thing about this is it

867
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:32,529
couldn't be constitutive because just

868
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:35,079
like with a virus it's too bulky to be

869
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:37,090
exported out of the cell and so there's

870
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:38,409
only a subset of the cells at any given

871
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:40,750
time that are going to express this

872
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:42,069
because they essentially lice to release

873
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:44,349
these into the environment at least

874
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:45,940
that's what our hypothesis based on all

875
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:48,750
the previous research that's been done

876
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:51,849
and so looking at the dynamics of

877
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:53,469
induction within the plant environment I

878
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:59,739
think is something I'm very keen on on

879
00:35:53,469 --> 00:36:03,039
pursuing yeah good question a my

880
00:35:59,739 --> 00:36:07,179
question against the producing strange

881
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:09,309
as it is with your tables and so if you

882
00:36:07,179 --> 00:36:11,679
if you saw that it was all black boxes

883
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:13,900
on the diagonal there so there would

884
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:16,359
obviously be a high degree of selective

885
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:18,180
pressure to become resistant if you have

886
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:23,230
them sensitive so there's two things

887
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:25,329
related to that for the small like the

888
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:27,550
465 one that small single protein

889
00:36:25,329 --> 00:36:29,019
bacteriocin we know that the producing

890
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:32,080
strain also has a characteristic

891
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:34,059
immunity protein associated with it for

892
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:37,840
the tail essence it's probably just that

893
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:39,549
it's LPS is not recognized by the tail

894
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:42,250
soon as it's produced but there's been

895
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:44,560
some work looking at evolution biofilms

896
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:47,260
and student on a syringe in elsa and you

897
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:50,860
will get these sweeps where a strain

898
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:52,210
will change itself yes to them suddenly

899
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,740
become sensitive and they can show it

900
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,900
starts to kill itself and so then it

901
00:36:53,739 --> 00:36:57,759
quickly has another mutation that box

902
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:00,220
that from occurring so I think that does

903
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:10,180
crop up in nature let's quickly stamped

904
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:12,759
out make sure I understand so with your

905
00:37:10,179 --> 00:37:16,960
initial screen you're using vitamin C

906
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:20,590
induces donors yeah to get extracts that

907
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:23,949
have been tested various lines and of

908
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:28,860
you mean do you get different patterns

909
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:32,859
of interaction if you look at a

910
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:36,460
competition release as opposed to this

911
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:37,840
licence fee fie fo now and that's

912
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,579
something that I definitely am

913
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,200
interested in looking at is

914
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:43,660
starting to move back into the plant

915
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:45,818
environment but we haven't looked at Co

916
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:47,588
competing them within Ellie's

917
00:37:45,818 --> 00:37:49,239
environment to see how much it actually

918
00:37:47,588 --> 00:37:52,478
matters because you may still just get

919
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:54,608
based on where you find them distributed

920
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:55,778
you may they may be able to coexist as

921
00:37:54,608 --> 00:38:00,509
long as they're in different patches

922
00:37:55,778 --> 00:38:03,068
that are isolated but over enough times

923
00:38:00,509 --> 00:38:05,108
you know within a given field eventually

924
00:38:03,068 --> 00:38:06,788
of interacting enough you might see it

925
00:38:05,108 --> 00:38:12,699
sweep for one to the other but it's not

926
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:20,319
so good questions ok how many more

927
00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:24,009
question this has been a production of

928
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:26,038
Cornell University on the web at cornell

929
00:38:24,009 --> 00:38:26,039
