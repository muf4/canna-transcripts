1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,290
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,689 --> 00:00:05,290
University

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:14,500
so the person who drew the luckiest

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:18,550
number of the day when you do number one

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:21,280
is you newly and new comes to us from

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:25,480
Incheon Korea her mentors were Michael

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:29,380
gore and Elodie Gaddafi and her post

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,329
graduation plans are waiting for the

9
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:33,820
admittance decisions to a graduate

10
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:36,519
program in Europe so we wish your love

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:39,939
with that first the title alfred seminar

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:45,039
today is polymorphic inversion in brass

13
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:46,988
opinion hi my presentation today is

14
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,019
about polymorphic inversion in breast

15
00:00:46,988 --> 00:00:53,140
Canopus L of plenteous I'll be talking

16
00:00:50,018 --> 00:00:56,858
about the evolutionary process of brass

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:58,749
cannabis a process of Brasco species and

18
00:00:56,859 --> 00:01:00,609
what is pulling for conversion and what

19
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:02,978
are the strategies that we use to detect

20
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:05,079
polio-free conversion and how we process

21
00:01:02,978 --> 00:01:06,819
the data to find in Furman ifs that

22
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:08,590
could help confirming the prolific

23
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:12,609
conversion and breast connect with

24
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:15,310
species and results and conclusions this

25
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:17,980
is the triangle of view which represents

26
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:21,519
the relationship of six different braska

27
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:23,969
species there are three ancestral

28
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,799
species respectively bresca

29
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:31,299
Rustica chemistry and rapa and Brassica

30
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,609
oleracea that has a 1 sub genome B a and

31
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:37,420
C with a chromosome number 8 10 and 9

32
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:40,120
respectively and there are three species

33
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:43,510
that were created due to intercept

34
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:46,000
interspecific hydrogen between two

35
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:49,320
ancestral species for the purpose of

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,670
presentation today I'll be focusing on

37
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:57,669
interspecific high radiation of rasa

38
00:01:51,670 --> 00:02:00,990
cannabis so the evolution of Braska

39
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:04,090
deathless species were created by

40
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:07,119
Brassica oleracea which is scale and

41
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:09,729
Brassica Rapa and campus chemistry such

42
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,158
as bok choy they went through

43
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:14,260
interspecific hydrate hug radiation to

44
00:02:12,158 --> 00:02:20,590
create breast Kannapolis commonly known

45
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:23,469
as canola so dr. LOD cassabi was

46
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,459
working on Dreskin other species and she

47
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:27,250
found the putative

48
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:29,469
pulling risky inversions polymorphic

49
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:35,519
inversion prevents Mulla bus route and

50
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:38,439
pairing during meiosis which do let do

51
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,469
go through recommendation between

52
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:43,780
inversion heterozygotes but products are

53
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:46,359
not recovered that it's a problematic

54
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,870
for dog breeders and the farmers who are

55
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:53,349
looking for better or higher yielding

56
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:56,379
crops and the frequency distribution of

57
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:59,859
chloroplast haplotypes of Brassica napus

58
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:02,219
and it's a sister like textile lineage

59
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:05,040
have strongly suggested that

60
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:08,769
Ratheon apis have fully phyletic origin

61
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:11,560
with the initial hydration eventually

62
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:17,319
leading to synthesis of Brassica napus

63
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:21,430
multiple times and probably involving

64
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:26,318
different maternal ancestors each one is

65
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:29,939
showing the ancestral lineage and h2 the

66
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:35,530
richness represented in blue is showing

67
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:37,509
dr character of the lineage so for

68
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,359
studying of pulling American version of

69
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:44,500
Brassica napus we gathered 16 samples

70
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:48,639
worldwide and we mapped the chromosome

71
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,709
map of Brassica napus there are two

72
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:54,819
standout two sub genomes in Brassica

73
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:57,340
napus with total of 19 chromosomes blue

74
00:03:54,818 --> 00:04:00,358
is showing chromosome 8 and orange

75
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:03,250
showing chromosome C I studied

76
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:06,969
specifically chromosome c2 which has a

77
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:10,889
large Khalifa conversion and these were

78
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:15,478
based on this chromosome map we gathered

79
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:19,389
primers data from for studying this

80
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:23,860
putative pulmonary condition the goal of

81
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:26,139
this project was first GBS genotyping by

82
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,240
sequencing and WGS whole genome

83
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:30,430
sequencing were pre sequence by dr. le

84
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,788
digas avi and she found the putative

85
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,209
reversion rest Napa samples so we used

86
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:35,918
on

87
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:38,469
Sanger sequencing method in other

88
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:40,180
bioinformatic pipelines to validate

89
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:45,099
whether the potatoes in version that she

90
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:46,598
found were real or not these artists

91
00:04:45,098 --> 00:04:50,379
steps that we use to determine the

92
00:04:46,598 --> 00:04:53,079
polymorphic conversion double-hole

93
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:55,139
genotyping whole genome sequencing which

94
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:57,279
is sequencing the whole genome and

95
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:59,650
genotyping by sequencing which is

96
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:02,469
looking for to on single nucleotide

97
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:06,969
polymorphism and the genome we requested

98
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:10,660
by doctor polÃ­ticas avi and we use

99
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:14,080
sniffs that were from WG s and GBS to

100
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:16,120
compare those compare to confirm

101
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,879
polio-free conversion and also use a

102
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:23,680
singer sequencing method to validate for

103
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:26,709
fully Morpha conversion so there were 60

104
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,668
samples worldwide and we harvested those

105
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:33,728
leaves and using five different primers

106
00:05:30,668 --> 00:05:36,189
because there were snips were within all

107
00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:38,110
different locations and there were large

108
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:41,319
that was hard to flank all the students

109
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:44,259
with one primer after DNA with this

110
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:48,939
extraction we went through PCR to

111
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:51,400
amplify a gene of interest and do DNA

112
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:54,310
purification to get rid of contaminants

113
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:57,579
and run through singer sequencing which

114
00:05:54,310 --> 00:06:01,199
screens the identification of sequence

115
00:05:57,579 --> 00:06:05,109
variation we used on different

116
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,960
bioinformatics pipelines from linux

117
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:10,449
operating systems to Python and Excel

118
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:13,989
for confirming if the pulley metric

119
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:15,939
conversion is real so for Sanger

120
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,569
sequencing we looked at the pattern

121
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:21,490
where one is showing the fixed alleles

122
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:24,759
across orientation which does not give

123
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:28,449
in fermented or unique information and

124
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:30,669
to 3 &amp; 5 as alleles there are variable

125
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:33,360
of course orientation and we can see

126
00:06:30,668 --> 00:06:36,698
that there are some inversions within

127
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:41,500
the within the pattern but however if we

128
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:43,449
look at up there are their alleles they

129
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,370
are just fixed so which does not give

130
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:47,830
unformatted snips

131
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:51,009
however we look at number 4

132
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:52,839
our our sniffs there are different in to

133
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:57,219
orientation but they are fixed which

134
00:06:52,839 --> 00:07:00,189
could be informative the sister result

135
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:02,590
from one of the data we got from Sanger

136
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:05,939
sequencing that our first letter as a

137
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:09,279
diagnostic of ancestral lineage

138
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:13,529
respectively GMT and second letter is a

139
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:19,689
diagnostic of drive care drive lineage

140
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:21,129
aid T and G C so for after Sanger

141
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:25,660
sequencing we use the bioinformatics

142
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:27,310
pipeline to look for sniffs that are in

143
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,100
just whole genome sequencing and

144
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:33,569
genotyping by sequencing and snips that

145
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:37,410
are shared by both and there were around

146
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:42,870
23,000 for WGS and thousand for GBS and

147
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:46,300
545 for shared by both sequencing method

148
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:49,810
for the summary of the comparisons from

149
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:52,079
WGS and GBS they were sorted according

150
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:54,970
to subset of differences similarities

151
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:57,569
based on ancestral lineage and drives

152
00:07:54,970 --> 00:08:00,420
lineage and the proportion of snips were

153
00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:03,430
calculated that were no longer fixed or

154
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:06,550
before opposite alleles based on whole

155
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:11,050
genome sequencing there were a total of

156
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:13,600
112 snips fixed across boxes alleles

157
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:20,110
accorded to GBS however there are only

158
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:22,689
hundred six nips in GG s and and also

159
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,310
there were a total of 112 sniffs that

160
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:29,350
were fixed in two groups according to

161
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:32,440
GPS but out of 112 there were six out of

162
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:35,920
65 sniffs there were 16 snips that were

163
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:39,660
not in fermented due to low six-car

164
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:42,339
power of GBS which can be seen in the

165
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:45,879
orange column that doesn't have any

166
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:50,620
number of alleles and there were a total

167
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:53,289
of 106 snips that I'm 60% were found to

168
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:58,269
have both alleles and 80 percent help

169
00:08:53,289 --> 00:09:01,269
showing nidal abilities that finally

170
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:03,850
this data showed that

171
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:06,069
genotype detected by GBS we're comforted

172
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:10,149
by whole genome sequencing which the

173
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:13,300
inversion might be real for a future

174
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:16,299
study by own a no techniques will be

175
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:20,069
used to map genome of selected Brassica

176
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:23,079
samples and by nano techniques are the

177
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:25,930
technique that do the whole genome

178
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:28,959
restriction map to validate assembly or

179
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:31,269
an identify structural variation and

180
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,759
based on the results from this proud

181
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:36,189
nano technique we might be able to

182
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:40,450
evaluate whether the inversion is in the

183
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:43,029
whole genome level or not for conclusion

184
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:46,060
so the potato reversion inversion was

185
00:09:43,028 --> 00:09:49,480
detected by GPS and that was confirmed

186
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:52,088
by hos double OGS and it was again

187
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,230
validated using Sanger sequencing and I

188
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:57,190
also learned in fermented and form

189
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,860
important bioinformatics

190
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:03,430
technique that could be useful for

191
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:09,129
modern and on 21st century breeding

192
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:14,078
program thanks for dr. gore and dr. LOD

193
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:17,500
fasabi and Nicolas Kazmir for helping me

194
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:21,278
for doing research and thanks for dr.

195
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:36,789
Scanlan and dr. smart for allowing me to

196
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:37,450
present in here thank you because if

197
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:40,990
there is a

198
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:43,450
inversion in the species as I said

199
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:46,360
before there might be a recombination

200
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:49,990
but the products are not recovered which

201
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:52,690
means it won't create the species that

202
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:55,000
you are looking for so this problem for

203
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:58,110
the fritters where I'm trying to make a

204
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,110
new and better go

205
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:30,440
I am not sure about that I don't think

206
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:39,409
we did like multiple image studies other

207
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:41,840
questions for you in June this has been

208
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:46,689
a production of Cornell University on

209
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,690
the web at Cornell edu
