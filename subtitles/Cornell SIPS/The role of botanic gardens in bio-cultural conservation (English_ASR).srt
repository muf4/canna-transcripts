1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,480
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,880
university

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,880
thank you

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,320
thank you it's a pleasure to be here i'm

5
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:16,000
a little bit more height impaired than

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,320
don so i hope everybody can see me from

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,759
at least the nose above over this this

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,760
monitor it's good to see all these

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,118
familiar faces and some new ones i feel

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,400
like i'm back in plantations we could

11
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:27,278
have had this over the nevin vulcan

12
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:29,038
center and hello geneva

13
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,800
well yes i'm going to be talking a

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,480
little bit about biocultural

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,600
conservation and i'm going to go through

16
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,439
slowly

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,200
getting to that point but then talk

18
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,439
about why it's important that botanic

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,680
gardens play a role both in

20
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,280
environmental or biological conservation

21
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,439
as well as

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,160
cultural and linguistic

23
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:50,640
to make sure i find the right

24
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:53,198
button here but first of all

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,079
just a little bit about plantations for

26
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:58,479
those of you who don't get out much

27
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,799
or for those who are newer than i it

28
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,718
might be just useful to just have a

29
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,798
little brief overview as to who we are

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,719
and what we do but our mission if you

31
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,240
just want to boil it down to three words

32
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,400
is probably not much different from any

33
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:13,039
other public garden in the world

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,840
we involved in cultivation

35
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,439
of plants of course and their display

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,280
conservation

37
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,959
which includes these days also a very

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,640
heavy focus on sustainability and

39
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:25,919
sustainable practices

40
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,519
and education both formal and informal

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,079
because of the way we do these things

42
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:32,319
with a high level of professionalism

43
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:35,519
curatorial professionalism

44
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:39,438
we do consider ourselves as do zoos and

45
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:41,039
aquaria as living museums we curate our

46
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:44,158
collections with the highest degree of

47
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,520
professional accuracy we

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,040
want to know everything about every

49
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,399
plant that comes in where it came from

50
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,560
how it's doing what his health is

51
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,159
provenance all these kinds of things

52
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,040
and this makes the collections that we

53
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,040
have

54
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,439
much more useful and easier to be

55
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,920
integrated into various scientific and

56
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:02,239
academic activities

57
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,759
so as such we're integral

58
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,759
to cows

59
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,200
as well as to cornell

60
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,719
more broadly

61
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,080
and there's that more broadly part that

62
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,840
i think may become a little bit more

63
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,480
apparent as we go through this in terms

64
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,680
of other kinds of academic pursuits

65
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,799
and again for those who don't get out

66
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,599
much

67
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,920
it's

68
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,519
plantations is a fairly complex

69
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,519
entity with the botanic gardens around

70
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,040
the welcome center the arboretum across

71
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,599
the way

72
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:30,318
here as well as 34

73
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:33,359
natural areas so the total land area is

74
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:35,119
somewhere around 3 500

75
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,560
what about acres that's the word not

76
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,560
hectares acres

77
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,560
so we are a place that provides

78
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,639
solace it provides places for recreation

79
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,640
informal and formal education as i was

80
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,039
saying before places in which faculty

81
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,878
can bring their students or students can

82
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,120
bring themselves down there and learn

83
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,120
and study and reflect

84
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,920
so our collections

85
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,759
are

86
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,518
based on any number of different themes

87
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,399
some may be more geographic or

88
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,120
ecological and some more horticultural

89
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,319
or taxonomic such as the rhododendron

90
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,480
garden the york robeson york state herb

91
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,639
garden pam shade is the gardener

92
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,840
extraordinaire for this plot it's one of

93
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,598
the best but

94
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,759
reputed to be one of the best

95
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:22,318
herb gardens in the country and it's

96
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,000
absolutely a fantastic resource

97
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:25,919
for anybody who's interested in the ways

98
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
in which herbs are being used and for

99
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,119
culinary purposes medicinal purposes in

100
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,280
art and literature and the like and

101
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,000
through history

102
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,840
and you know don was sort of alluding to

103
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,560
the weather right now and how am i

104
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,840
adapting but i'm doing fine actually i'm

105
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,840
going to hawaii on wednesday

106
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,480
for a few days it's business don't worry

107
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,158
it's all business but even this time of

108
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,399
year there's plenty to do outside in

109
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,479
terms of horticulture and the winter

110
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,239
interest as a horticulturist or

111
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,919
landscape architects

112
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,120
say of gardens in the winter can be

113
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,878
quite stunning and striking with

114
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,400
gives you more of an opportunity to look

115
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:03,518
at parts of the plant other than the

116
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,599
leaves and the flowers you can look at

117
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,959
the bark and the color and buds and and

118
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:08,079
fruits that are still hanging on there

119
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,920
so

120
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,080
the mulestein family winter garden is a

121
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,238
fantastic resource

122
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,799
of course is the 100 acre arboretum all

123
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,639
the natural areas that are around us the

124
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,159
cascadilla and fall creek gorge trails

125
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,199
which are all part of our under our

126
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,400
purview

127
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,000
and then getting into the some of the

128
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,359
sustainability things i haven't talked

129
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,879
about the nevin welcome center but you

130
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,360
know that and don knows more about this

131
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,120
and i do leed certified the bias well

132
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,479
garden helping

133
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,079
manage some of the runoff that comes

134
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:35,758
from the surrounding area the parking

135
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,599
lot etc and sort of filtering it

136
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,360
biofiltering it before it gets into the

137
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,960
water gets into bb lake

138
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,000
but the faculty and student research is

139
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,839
something that i really want to put a

140
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,360
great deal of emphasis on in the next

141
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,039
few years

142
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,439
not just to our sort of

143
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,199
kinship in in the plant sciences and

144
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,759
horticulture and environmental sciences

145
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,120
but also in the humanities as well and

146
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,360
bring more of a

147
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,759
more artists down there and musicians

148
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,080
and and the like

149
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,439
and really bulk up our education program

150
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,639
so that we appeal

151
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:08,079
to a broad uh cadre of of students be

152
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,519
they people who are looking for formal

153
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,279
education or those who are just coming

154
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,599
for a more informal

155
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,879
experience

156
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,639
so

157
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,399
for me and for many of us here plants

158
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,400
are inspirational they inspire us in

159
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,799
terms of our research or in terms of the

160
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,478
way we manage our gardens at home

161
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,478
or at work and they've inspired some

162
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,319
people to serve rather perplexing ways

163
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:29,120
of displaying plants in some places such

164
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,399
as

165
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,478
in versailles

166
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:35,679
but also they inspire in terms of other

167
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:37,918
kinds of things we have charismatic mega

168
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,519
fauna such as the panda bear and the

169
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,279
elephants this kind of thing we do have

170
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:44,079
charismatic megaflora as well for

171
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:46,879
chrysic so we need to try and get people

172
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:49,758
involved and excited about the the world

173
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,600
of plants through any kinds of hook

174
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,199
and plants and nature and natural

175
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,120
systems

176
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,038
have inspired the arts in many any

177
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,280
number of ways and this is one of my

178
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:01,360
favorite recent novels barbara king

179
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,239
solvers prodigal summer which has a

180
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,800
great exposition of how nature works but

181
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,160
also how people interact with nature and

182
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,759
some of the conflicts that are there and

183
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,840
some of the

184
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,680
ways in which those two different types

185
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,439
of systems mesh

186
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,759
and of course it shows up

187
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,839
in any you know in art through the

188
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,639
painting through the ages this is child

189
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:24,478
hassam's painting of celia faxo's garden

190
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,720
at what's now shoal's marine lab or

191
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,159
apple door island this is celia thaxter

192
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,960
in her garden

193
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,400
so

194
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,839
we're inspired by the art but the art

195
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,439
was inspired by the garden so it all

196
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,359
comes sort of full circle and it can

197
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,038
come full circle in other ways too such

198
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,680
as putting art in the garden such as

199
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,519
chihuly's glassworks

200
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,360
this was a recent i'm not that recent i

201
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,519
guess almost 10 years old uh

202
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,680
installation that fips but dale chihuly

203
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,439
has been traipsing around the world

204
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,280
putting in his glass work in various

205
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,879
places and i think this is great to

206
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,638
appoint

207
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,399
if people come just for the art and

208
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,319
forget to look at anything else around

209
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,560
it i'm not sure that much has been

210
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,400
achieved other than the cash register

211
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,720
ringing and then of course here we have

212
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,038
these sculptures which were part of a

213
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,199
student project back in the 60s so these

214
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:10,560
are now sculptures in the arboretum but

215
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,400
actually the arboretum came later

216
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,560
probably about 20 years later these were

217
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,399
put in in the early 60s and the

218
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,839
arboretum wasn't officially established

219
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:21,679
until 1982 so this whole thing sort of

220
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:25,119
you might say sort of

221
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,800
this forest grew up around these things

222
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,120
and then jack elliot who's over in human

223
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,199
ecology his sculpture well actually it's

224
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,319
not a sculpture it is a maple root

225
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,400
structure that was in front of the

226
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,000
johnson museum for a while last summer

227
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,079
and then we had to transport it down to

228
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
us so the ways in which we can engage

229
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,079
people in art that has a botanical or

230
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,079
environmental focus and then get them

231
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,598
hooked and then get more talking about

232
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,959
plants of what they mean to them in

233
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,319
their daily lives in today's society

234
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:51,839
and one of the unfortunate aspects of

235
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,680
today's society is that many of the

236
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,038
plants and natural resources or systems

237
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,680
that we study are increasingly

238
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:59,519
threatened by one thing or another one

239
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,120
thing being land use changes and

240
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,279
deforestation

241
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,280
invasive species

242
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,038
climate change

243
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,119
so here here for instance

244
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,560
this has a impact not just

245
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,240
climate change has impact not only on

246
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,879
natural systems but on gardening and how

247
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,280
we garden so here's the

248
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,039
hardiness zone map from 1919 you can see

249
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,478
here we are

250
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:25,439
firmly in sconston zone five

251
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:28,478
and here's zone three up here the dark

252
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,360
area now here in the 2006 version we're

253
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:31,120
almost

254
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,959
out of zone five and look what happened

255
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,759
to zone three it's almost non-existent

256
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,518
in the contaminants united states

257
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,679
so this has a great impact on gardening

258
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,278
as well as our ability

259
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,799
to manage our collections in botanic

260
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,240
gardens and we need to be thinking ahead

261
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,919
as to how we're going to manage our

262
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,000
collections in the light of

263
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,799
these changes

264
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,278
now

265
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:53,838
one great thing about

266
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:55,919
being a living museum and keeping great

267
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,600
records on everything that we do is we

268
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,039
can look at phenological data that we

269
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,480
have in our archives and in our

270
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,919
notebooks and look to see how

271
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,920
phenological

272
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:04,958
events have changed over the course of

273
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,199
time

274
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,359
and we're doing this in chicago and also

275
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,278
in hawaii the royal botanic garden queue

276
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,680
has been doing a lot of work on this and

277
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,278
we have colleagues in boston too richard

278
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,519
primack who's been publishing quite

279
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:18,879
extensively on this phenomenon as well

280
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:23,440
but if you look at the flowering dates

281
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:24,799
of narcissus at q back in the 1950s the

282
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,240
average flowering date was the 9th of

283
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:29,120
march and now

284
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,360
it's uh late january so it's almost six

285
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,600
week shift in the flowering phenology

286
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,919
just of that one species they did this

287
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,120
for about two dozen different spring

288
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:41,120
flowering ephemerals and perennials too

289
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,560
and see the very summer shift and it's

290
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,320
anywhere from about

291
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:47,919
four weeks to eight to ten weeks

292
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,080
so significant and i just got an email

293
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:52,399
from a friend in in germany last week

294
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,000
saying spring is here

295
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,639
already

296
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,679
so it's amazing so these things these

297
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:02,480
various environmental issues have a

298
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,519
pose a great threat to the plant life of

299
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,080
the world

300
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,799
and uh chris thomas would publish a

301
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,040
paper about 10 years ago looking at

302
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,799
how many species

303
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,879
in the world are quote unquote committed

304
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:17,599
to extinction if the current trends

305
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:19,360
continue and for separated separating

306
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,879
out plants from everything else

307
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,800
he indicated that depending on where you

308
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,559
are in the amazon for instance and

309
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,159
what's already been occurring in certain

310
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,399
places within the amazon anywhere from

311
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,240
50 to 80 percent of the flora there's at

312
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,159
risk of extinction in the next 50 years

313
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,000
or so

314
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,000
in europe it's not quite so bad not

315
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,519
because it's a more resilient system but

316
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,600
because so much has already been wiped

317
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,159
out there's only very little left to be

318
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,959
wiped out

319
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,519
so

320
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,679
norm myers and others since him have

321
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,120
developed what we call biodiversity hot

322
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,879
spots which are just regions of the

323
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,639
world where the flora and fauna is a

324
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:53,679
particular risk of extinction due to

325
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:55,278
some of those

326
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,519
factors that i've already mentioned and

327
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:59,120
as you know and as you can see from here

328
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,560
these tend to be in the tropics and

329
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,879
subtropics and in the mediterranean

330
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,879
region

331
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,399
and you know sometimes you say well out

332
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:10,720
of

333
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,480
a crisis comes opportunity and this is

334
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,480
an opportunity for us i suppose as a

335
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,480
profession and in horticulture and the

336
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,079
botanic garden community to take a

337
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,839
leadership role and better understanding

338
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,879
and communicating about some of these

339
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,240
issues that are happening and the

340
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,879
effects that they will have on the

341
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,879
natural world

342
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,079
british ecologist william sutherland was

343
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,519
looking at all of this and looking at

344
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:34,879
endangerment of

345
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,078
birds and mammals using the iucn that's

346
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:37,759
the international union for the

347
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:39,838
conservation of nature using their red

348
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:43,278
listing criteria

349
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,200
and determined that of the almost 10 000

350
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,720
species of bird in the world 12 percent

351
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,399
of them are at risk of extinction in the

352
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,600
next few decades

353
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,679
of the

354
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,320
4 500 or so

355
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,919
species of mammals 24

356
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,560
and he said to himself well that's for

357
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,078
fun just try and use these iucn criteria

358
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,000
for endangerment and see how they might

359
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:04,719
apply to something else like endangered

360
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,240
languages and it doesn't work very well

361
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,680
but he tried to shoehorn some of these

362
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,759
things into those

363
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,838
criteria and came up with a number of 25

364
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:14,319
percent of the world's languages are

365
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,480
endangered so bits of our humanity are

366
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,399
as threatened as

367
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,560
other aspects of the

368
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,000
biota of the world however that's

369
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:23,759
actually quite a low estimate because

370
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,278
they're better ways of estimating the

371
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,679
percentages of languages that are

372
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:29,838
endangered and unesco uses a fairly

373
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,838
rigorous set of criteria and they've

374
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,639
estimated that about 50

375
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:38,079
of the 7000 existing languages

376
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,440
are endangered and long-term trends

377
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:41,359
we're losing about a language about

378
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,880
every two weeks

379
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,519
so about this time last year there was

380
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,958
the last living speaker of a language in

381
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,480
scotland it's called the fisher folk

382
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,838
language that person died so that

383
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,759
language is gone

384
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,839
and there was something in the

385
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,360
press maybe several weeks ago about the

386
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,440
last speaker of a native american

387
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,120
language in the southwest so we're

388
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,800
seeing this happening uh more and more

389
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,320
more more frequently

390
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:07,359
so people who study endangered languages

391
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,040
have tried to mimic some of these

392
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,120
this hotspot theme

393
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:14,000
and looking in language extinction hot

394
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,679
spots and again as you might expect

395
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,278
the greatest vulnerability is in the

396
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:19,599
tropics and subtropics where natural

397
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,679
systems are being rapidly degraded by

398
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,920
deforestation and resource extraction

399
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,759
and native people's indigenous peoples

400
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,838
being displaced of course there are

401
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,159
other other pockets up in northwestern

402
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,720
north america and northeastern

403
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,399
uh russia and china as well where there

404
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,879
are small isolated

405
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,799
indigenous groups

406
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,559
so for looking at the relationship so

407
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,399
what we're seeing here is the explicit

408
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:43,679
relationship cause and effect

409
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,000
relationship between the loss of

410
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,519
biological diversity around the world

411
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,120
and the loss of

412
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,839
linguistic and cultural diversity they

413
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,039
go hand in hand as as one erodes away is

414
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,800
taking the others down with it

415
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,319
and so this examination of the

416
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,879
relationship between biological

417
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,800
conservation and cultural or linguistic

418
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:05,838
conservation we call biocultural

419
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:08,319
conservation and this is an area i think

420
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,240
gardens can be become more deeply

421
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,399
engaged in

422
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,639
as we lose a culture or language we lose

423
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,720
the information that they have

424
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,240
what we call the indigenous ecological

425
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,680
knowledge or traditional ecological

426
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,560
knowledge about the natural world around

427
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,120
them

428
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,719
i went to a lecture last year from by a

429
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,078
woman who's i don't know what you call

430
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,839
her sort of

431
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,000
maybe an ethnomusicologist but she was

432
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,560
looking at aboriginal dances and various

433
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,639
groups throughout northern

434
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:37,359
australia and she was showing these

435
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,440
videos of these people dancing and then

436
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,919
she was sort of breaking it down parsing

437
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,639
it down showing how each motion had

438
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,719
something to do with the life cycle of a

439
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,639
species of bird when it fledged when the

440
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,560
bread how many offspring it had so this

441
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,320
whole ritual around it so once that

442
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,799
language is gone then all that

443
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,240
knowledge we may call it indigenous or

444
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,759
traditional ecological knowledge but

445
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,480
it's damn good ecological knowledge all

446
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,838
that just disappears so we're all the

447
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,879
poorer for it

448
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,279
as as humanity

449
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:10,240
so if you're

450
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:12,399
we're in hawaii or a native hawaiian

451
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,839
and any one of these particular plants

452
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,759
were to disappear then the native

453
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,160
hawaiian culture which is now going

454
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,639
through a renaissance would lose a

455
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:23,519
significant portion of its identity so

456
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,799
the taro which is a important staple

457
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,879
crop

458
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,719
the koa or ocasio-core which is used for

459
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:29,838
building canoes and other utilitarian

460
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,199
vessels

461
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,279
though

462
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:35,039
the metrocenters which is used in

463
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,039
laymaking and other kinds of ornamental

464
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,639
purposes these are some people might

465
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,639
refer to these as sort of cultural

466
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,799
keystone species

467
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,240
as opposed to ecological keystone

468
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,000
species but they're

469
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,360
central to the culture once they're gone

470
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,639
they're gone

471
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,039
and the taro as some of you might know

472
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,560
is a sacred plant throughout many of the

473
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:56,639
pacific island

474
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,319
cultures they believe that that's their

475
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,320
ancestry and i won't get into the

476
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,320
mythology of that at the moment but in

477
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,320
vanuatu for instance the residents there

478
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,320
say we don't we do not cultivate taro to

479
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,560
live but live to cultivate taro because

480
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,320
it's keeping alive their ancestral

481
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,559
heritage

482
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,680
and if you follow the news about gmo and

483
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:15,838
all that kind of thing there's been

484
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,439
quite a bit of hue and cry about this

485
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,920
particularly in the pacific

486
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,639
islands i mean it worked okay with the

487
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,879
papaya in fact there was a cornell

488
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,720
breeder who came up with a ring spot

489
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,240
resistant papaya and that's now being

490
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,000
widely grown in hawaii but that's one of

491
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,600
the exceptions

492
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,639
they're also diseases of taro that have

493
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,000
been going

494
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,839
you know through the pacific from time

495
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,919
to time and wiped out much of the taro

496
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,480
cultivation in samoa and so they

497
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,919
resorted reluctantly to using gmo taro

498
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,839
well the hawaiian said no way though i

499
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,078
knew 11 said no way because you don't do

500
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,639
gmo on your ancestor i mean it's just

501
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:49,599
heretical so there's been a lot of

502
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,839
place

503
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,600
instances in which sort of quote-unquote

504
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,839
western science or western approach

505
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,120
which is the things that conflicted or

506
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,720
intersected with some of the other

507
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,159
traditional ones but it's an opportunity

508
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,920
for learning

509
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,838
more about how other cultures see the

510
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,279
world around them and and appreciate

511
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,279
that more

512
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,519
more heavily

513
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,519
so with respect to sea level rise again

514
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:14,318
in the pacific the republic of kiribati

515
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:16,160
which is about uh 32

516
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:17,678
flat coral atolls no more than two

517
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,160
meters high

518
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,000
and for this is a trivia thing

519
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,558
so somebody says what's what's the only

520
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,519
country in the world which spans which

521
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:27,838
what

522
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,279
is present in all four hemispheres so

523
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,038
kiribati because the international date

524
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,879
line comes right down here and the

525
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:34,720
equator goes right through here so it's

526
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,760
in all four hemispheres

527
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,000
anyway

528
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,839
so sea level rise just a few centimeters

529
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
of sea level rise is going to

530
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,399
cause huge issues

531
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,558
as it is now here's the capital

532
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,400
town it's underwater here people who've

533
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,079
never seen water above their knees on

534
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,000
these atolls is now already up to their

535
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,599
ankles or above

536
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,440
and so now what they're doing is trying

537
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:58,000
to find a home they're going to be one

538
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,600
of the first in full entire nations that

539
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,720
is sort of an environmental refugee

540
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,038
status

541
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,480
fiji at the time i put this together

542
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:06,480
negotiating

543
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,839
to buy another negotiating can we just

544
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,319
please live there

545
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:12,240
uh 5 000 acres in fiji fiji is saying no

546
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:13,599
at the moment another

547
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,120
seeing of either australia or new

548
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:19,038
zealand will take some of them these

549
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,038
people's about a hundred thousand people

550
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,960
now if you go a little further afield up

551
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,840
to the northwest

552
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,279
north america this is alaska

553
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,119
in the northwest territories they're

554
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:31,200
about two dozen different languages and

555
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,038
cultures here of

556
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,360
first nations people or whatever the

557
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:39,038
appropriate term is these days

558
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:40,558
any one of which is dwindling

559
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:44,720
so if you look at this area up here with

560
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:47,119
a nuclear are in the far northern part

561
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,600
as a sea level as the sea

562
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:51,759
water temperature rises they're finding

563
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:54,639
the whales and other mammals and animals

564
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:56,480
that they hunt are moving further north

565
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,400
and so they're out there hunting in

566
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,798
these sort of rudimentary canoes and

567
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,919
they can't get out as far or they may be

568
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:03,679
able to get out as far but there's no

569
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,759
way they're going to get back in time

570
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,919
and so their ability to hunt for the

571
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,599
resources that they need is being

572
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,440
increasingly diminished

573
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,119
there's a nice uh write-up about this in

574
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,038
a book recently

575
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:17,678
cavallina that's the name of the town in

576
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:19,038
which they they live

577
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,559
so these environmental changes are

578
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,359
changing the natural world is having a

579
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,960
direct consequence on the cultural world

580
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,240
and here is part of their landscape

581
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,840
that's just

582
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,480
literally melting and going away and

583
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,359
going into the ocean

584
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,839
so

585
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,678
people who study this botanists and

586
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,199
ethnobotanists

587
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,038
anthropologists linguists have been

588
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,759
trying to develop a map

589
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:43,519
and how can we display or portray this

590
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:44,640
biocultural diversity we showed

591
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:46,400
languages

592
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,799
in terms of hot spots

593
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,038
biological hot spots but what about this

594
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:52,480
biocultural thing combining the two it's

595
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:54,798
very difficult because they're two very

596
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,038
different types of data and information

597
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:58,960
so combining the two into a single index

598
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:00,480
is almost it's not impossible but it's

599
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,480
very difficult and so this was a very

600
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,960
crude attempt

601
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,200
by david law and john harmon

602
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,759
and entire countries are coded a single

603
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,519
color even here an entire continent

604
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:12,558
certain colors the deeper the color the

605
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:14,400
more

606
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:15,839
endangered are both the biological

607
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,400
elements and the cultural elements

608
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:20,079
within that region

609
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,320
and it doesn't show therefore because of

610
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,480
the lack of fine grain some of these

611
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,519
areas up here or up here in the

612
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,159
northwest

613
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:30,079
or even across northern australia where

614
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,320
there are huge numbers of very small

615
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:34,158
indigenous groups remaining

616
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:35,759
this is another attempt that unesco did

617
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,240
with along with the world wildlife fund

618
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,720
that's just as unsatisfying the colors

619
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,200
here are just depicting the bio regions

620
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,480
of the world and you can't see at this

621
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,679
scale but they're just little dots

622
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,360
everywhere just shows where an

623
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,960
endangered culture or endangered

624
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,359
languages so they just superimpose one

625
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,720
thing over another

626
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:56,000
so

627
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,679
it is still a work in progress

628
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,679
so

629
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,679
i show this this is a

630
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,159
rare plant in hawaii it's an extinct in

631
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,600
the wild this is cyania truncata the

632
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,880
only place in the world you can see this

633
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:11,038
is in a test tube at the lion arboretum

634
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,360
what we can do is we can clone it every

635
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,720
individual will be genetically identical

636
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,399
but at least we can clone it and if

637
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,079
there's a habitat suitable we can put it

638
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,519
back out into nature once we grow these

639
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:21,439
things up in the greenhouse but you

640
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:22,879
can't put a culture in a test tube

641
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,000
you can do that with plants but once the

642
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,000
culture is gone it's gone

643
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,879
and

644
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,599
no lesser person of francois jacob than

645
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,960
nobel laureate in medicine in 1965 said

646
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:36,240
that in humans

647
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,400
natural diversity is further

648
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,640
strengthened by cultural diversity and

649
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,759
i'm hoping that we can as we develop our

650
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,080
programs

651
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,919
more at the cornell plantations and with

652
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,000
partnership from people at cornell other

653
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,759
departments that we can

654
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,240
dive into this

655
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:54,558
issue more deeply

656
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,960
there are a number of international

657
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:59,359
entities treaties and conventions and

658
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,919
such that will

659
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,678
draw these two issues together uh the

660
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,200
convention on biological diversity which

661
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,480
every nation in the world has ratified

662
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,480
except the us

663
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,720
uh george herbert walker bush signed it

664
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,960
but congress didn't ratify it so we're

665
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,759
we try to live up to its tenets towards

666
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,679
articles um but there's no

667
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:18,879
mandate that we do so but i think it

668
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,400
seems to be the right thing to do and

669
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,720
most people who work in

670
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,280
gardens and museums respect

671
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,960
the convention on biological diversity

672
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:28,720
but in a number of places within this

673
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,360
convention including this article 8j

674
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,600
they do refer to maintaining

675
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:35,199
indigenous and local communities for the

676
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:36,639
conservation and sustainable use of

677
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,319
biological diversity so they're making

678
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,240
an attempt here again to bring bring

679
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:42,319
these two together we can't do the one

680
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,759
without the other

681
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,359
something that's a little bit more close

682
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:46,240
to home for those in the botanic garden

683
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:47,839
world

684
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,200
is the global strategy for plant

685
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:50,558
conservation

686
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,600
which came out of the convention on

687
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:55,759
biological diversity and a number of us

688
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:57,439
from gardens around the world worked

689
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:00,879
quite a bit on developing this over the

690
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,558
last 10 years or so and it has targets

691
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,039
we had targets from

692
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:08,158
2000 2010 and now we have new targets

693
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,279
from 2010 to 2020.

694
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,039
such as

695
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:14,158
inventorying and having

696
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:15,679
electronical databases that document

697
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,039
every living plant in the world and all

698
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,640
these kinds of things because how are we

699
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:20,240
going to preserve what we have unless we

700
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,960
know exactly what we have and know the

701
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,359
full extent of it one of these targets

702
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,279
again like the conventional biological

703
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,959
diversity again refers to this

704
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,879
intersection between biological and

705
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,558
cultural conservation halting the

706
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,080
decline of plant resources and

707
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:36,399
associated indigenous and local

708
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,399
knowledge innovations and practices and

709
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,360
that's just a snippet out of that target

710
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,840
so you can get the gist of it

711
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:45,759
and there are i think there are 18 or 20

712
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:48,480
of these targets some of them have to do

713
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:50,480
as i said with digitizing

714
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,839
the floor of the world and these kinds

715
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,000
of things where you can say yes we've

716
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:57,119
done this much we've done we've done 75

717
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,038
of it or 85 or whatever the case may be

718
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,798
developing new educational programs or

719
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,798
communication strategies around all of

720
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:04,879
this this is a much harder one to get a

721
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:06,400
grip on and it's the one that tends to

722
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,720
be ignored just because it's a little

723
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,200
bit more difficult

724
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,880
to address

725
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,640
but gardens are addressing this

726
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,840
nonetheless those of you who've been to

727
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,919
new york much have been to queen's

728
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:20,319
botanic garden know that it's probably

729
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,159
in one of the most ethnically diverse

730
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:24,399
places in the us

731
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,799
and they've made an explicit attempt

732
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,240
to draw in the various ethnic groups

733
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,359
that are within

734
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,038
their

735
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:32,479
their area

736
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:34,879
and give them a place where they can

737
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,599
express themselves culturally

738
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,480
particularly as it relates to foods and

739
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:41,839
plants and that within their daily lives

740
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,440
and so they have a number of events a

741
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:45,759
number of festivals that aren't catered

742
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,600
just for you know for filipinos to

743
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:49,599
filipinos but filipinos to everybody

744
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:51,359
else so everybody can get a taste

745
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:54,000
figuratively and literally of what that

746
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,199
culture represents and how plants are

747
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,519
central

748
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,840
centrally important to the maintenance

749
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:00,879
of their

750
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:03,918
culture i've been working on and off

751
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,480
with rohingyas

752
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,480
in jordan who is establishing

753
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,240
a network of

754
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,159
new botanic gardens throughout jordan

755
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,759
there'll be a main central garden in

756
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,360
amman and then other satellite gardens

757
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:16,960
throughout the country and those

758
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:19,439
satellite ones are intended to do things

759
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,919
two things one is to showcase

760
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,440
the biota

761
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,278
and the biological diversity of that

762
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,880
particular region and the other is to

763
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:29,038
show the

764
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,480
the cultural significance of the peoples

765
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:31,919
in that region because they vary from

766
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,519
place to place

767
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,600
so these are even though she's not

768
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:38,000
calling it that these are biocultural

769
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:40,558
gardens

770
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,960
and she's financing these personally

771
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:44,158
because the government is not doing it

772
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,120
even though she's part of the royal

773
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,120
family

774
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:48,879
so she's doing it herself

775
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:50,000
and another place that's

776
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,039
doing this

777
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,038
and

778
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:55,119
i consulted with them briefly a couple

779
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:56,879
of years ago is in south korea where

780
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:57,759
they're building a new city southwest of

781
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,960
seoul

782
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:00,319
the city is going to be huge it's going

783
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,400
to be about three times the size of

784
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:04,558
paris or some such thing and

785
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,919
it's enormous and this is a scale model

786
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:08,158
that they have in the visitor center

787
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,679
showcasing this new big

788
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,919
r d and

789
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,519
city and have all these fancy apartments

790
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,440
and all these kinds of things the only

791
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:16,960
thing they've done so far is build the

792
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,600
sea wall which is the world's longest

793
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,600
sea wall 35 kilometers long with a four

794
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:23,119
lane highway on the top and two two lane

795
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,678
highways on either side that's really

796
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:27,918
grotesque in some ways

797
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,919
so they're doing this in this estuary

798
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,278
and the only saving grace and the

799
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,640
lighting here doesn't allow to show up

800
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:35,839
very clearly is right in here

801
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,600
this is what they wanted me to come

802
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:39,918
there for is they're building a 100

803
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:40,879
hectare biocultural garden

804
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,799
so it's going to be a garden that

805
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,960
showcases the biological heritage and

806
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:46,960
cultural heritage of that part of the

807
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,880
korean peninsula and the

808
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,480
chinese mainland that's just across the

809
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,880
sea from there

810
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,798
which i thought was quite an interesting

811
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,360
i'm not particularly

812
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:59,839
uh a fan of the rest of what they're

813
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,359
proposing to do here particularly big

814
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:02,720
golf courses and that kind of thing but

815
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:05,839
this is just a plan and these things

816
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,200
change and is you know given the current

817
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:08,639
economic state of the world it's

818
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,159
probably just as likely that this will

819
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,360
never happen

820
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,200
but there are people who are thinking

821
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,719
about this at least in terms of how can

822
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,558
we bring

823
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,558
people and the cultural heritage of the

824
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,319
world more close to the issues that

825
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:22,960
we're facing in with respect to

826
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:25,439
conserving the natural world

827
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,120
so as dawn alluded to when i was at

828
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,038
university of hawaii i established a

829
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,759
center for biocultural

830
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:35,038
studies there and what we did was draw

831
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:36,960
in people from anthropology linguistics

832
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:38,319
of the law school as they had law

833
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,000
faculty who are looking at climate

834
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:42,240
change and its impacts on indigenous

835
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,319
peoples and resource extraction

836
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,400
uh indigenous intellectual property

837
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:48,720
rights and all these kinds of things

838
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,400
so it ran the gamut i mean there wasn't

839
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,480
probably there was very few departments

840
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,278
at the university didn't in some way

841
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,519
have some connection to this particular

842
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:57,519
issue

843
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,519
and we developed partnerships as part of

844
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,519
that and mou's with the university of

845
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:05,119
auckland and new zealand

846
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:06,558
what we were doing in hawaii relates to

847
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:08,879
what going on there with the maori

848
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:09,759
population unesco is interested in this

849
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,360
too

850
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:13,038
at the university of south pacific in

851
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,278
fiji the smithsonian through their

852
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:16,640
recovering voices program

853
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:19,038
the east-west center which is a

854
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,799
non-profit big think tank in honolulu

855
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:22,879
looking at ways in which western and

856
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,480
eastern cultures can intersect and

857
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,080
support one another

858
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,599
so there's a lot of interest

859
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,678
in this it's just a

860
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,678
matter of articulating what the issues

861
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,159
are and making connections with people

862
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,679
in other disciplines

863
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,679
we held a

864
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,159
which is now every other year an

865
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,519
international conference on endangered

866
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,120
languages

867
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,480
at the university of hawaii and we had

868
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:46,079
people come there from all over the

869
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,399
world including people from google they

870
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:49,439
sent six people to this we had no idea

871
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:50,959
they were coming they just came in they

872
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,960
said announced themselves and after the

873
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,159
conference they said we want to help you

874
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,640
build

875
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,799
a website just for endangered languages

876
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,120
so they did they built it for us and now

877
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,839
all we have to do all is find the

878
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,879
linguists ethnobotanists

879
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:06,558
ethnomusicologists and others who are

880
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,799
documenting endangered languages and

881
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:11,278
cultures and put their information on

882
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:13,200
this public publicly accessible site

883
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:15,278
it's like a well-managed or well-edited

884
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,880
wiki really is what it is so there are

885
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:18,319
people now the university of hawaii who

886
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,840
manage manage this and this new

887
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:23,119
information comes and they vetted and

888
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:23,119
make sure it's all up to snuff

889
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:27,759
and now bringing all this back closer to

890
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,399
home you say what the hell does this

891
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:31,919
have to do with it in cornell but

892
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:33,278
and this is the white well i shouldn't

893
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,399
have said this is white pine tree who

894
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:36,398
knows what this tree is come on

895
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:39,200
robert

896
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:44,000
so this is an iconic tree in the

897
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,000
northern you know sort of mixed

898
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,798
hardwoods forests everywhere from

899
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,038
minnesota to the to the northeast

900
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:51,759
and it holds a special place

901
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:55,119
in

902
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:57,759
native american culture the hudan rasani

903
00:29:55,119 --> 00:30:00,558
i said that right confederacy

904
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:03,038
it's the original moocs m-o-o-c-s

905
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:05,119
mohawk hanaida anadaga

906
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:06,798
cayuga and seneca that's how i remember

907
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:08,000
just remember moocs for those of you in

908
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:09,119
higher education so that's right you

909
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,839
know what that is

910
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:10,798
so

911
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:13,678
they

912
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:14,879
so so to them the white pine is

913
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,000
is a very

914
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,600
key element of their cultural history

915
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,278
and we had a display on this at the

916
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:22,480
never welcome center when i first came

917
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:24,000
and i still don't know

918
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,120
it was just by happenstance that i'm

919
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,798
interested in this and happened to be

920
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:27,918
there or somebody said let's get this

921
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:29,679
guy done

922
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,240
anyway so they have there's all the

923
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,840
symbolism so they have how many needles

924
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,359
in the fascicle per fascicle of a white

925
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:37,439
pine

926
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:40,240
five okay so the

927
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,960
the they represent each of those native

928
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,640
american uh confederate nations that are

929
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,640
part of this confederacy

930
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,080
and this on symbolism there's a eagle on

931
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,960
the top of the tree and all this kind of

932
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,720
thing

933
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,399
but if the tree falls over if it's

934
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,519
tipped over in a windstorm or whatever

935
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:55,278
the root ball comes up you've got this

936
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,639
big depression in the ground and that's

937
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:58,720
where they would bury their weapons and

938
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,159
then cover them up then the rainwater

939
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,600
the stream or whatever would carry away

940
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,840
that violence

941
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:06,000
that'd be the end of war supposedly

942
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:07,678
anyway so they call it here the tree of

943
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,359
the great long leaves but it's also

944
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,798
referred to in their culture as the tree

945
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,839
of peace

946
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:15,440
so if the white pine were to disappear

947
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,798
not that it will

948
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,880
but it has been threat has been

949
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:21,200
threatened over centuries by

950
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,360
logging over logging and

951
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,720
one disease or another you know that's

952
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:26,639
possible that something like this could

953
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,480
disappear from a culture and there there

954
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,038
goes another piece of that culture's

955
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,038
integrity

956
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:34,000
so some other things we're doing and

957
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,559
done

958
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,759
reykjav can speak to these much more

959
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:39,839
uh

960
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:41,919
expertly than can i but

961
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:44,000
we can also

962
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,640
refer to and acknowledge and respect

963
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,798
other cultures just through horticulture

964
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,440
as well and so

965
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:53,278
we plan on continuing to promote this

966
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,798
east asian garden that don was involved

967
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:57,599
in developing

968
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:59,599
as a way to get people more engaged in

969
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:00,480
asian cultures and how plants have been

970
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:02,798
used

971
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,120
in those cultures for ornamental

972
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:06,639
aesthetic and other purposes so there'll

973
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:08,398
be some focus

974
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,440
unless things change dramatically on

975
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:10,879
korean

976
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,679
some aspects of korean japanese and

977
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,799
korean culture and how they use plants

978
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,880
in various

979
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:19,200
in various ways

980
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,080
and this is not just a and if you think

981
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,399
about

982
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,000
19 percent i read of

983
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:26,398
cornell

984
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,398
undergraduates self-identify as asian so

985
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:30,239
that's either american or from asia

986
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:32,798
coming here from asia for school that's

987
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,839
a significant population here and

988
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:36,798
there's very little here that's for them

989
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:38,079
and

990
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:39,599
we don't have to do something just for

991
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:42,000
them but it's also an opportunity for us

992
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,119
to learn more about them so it goes both

993
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,558
ways

994
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:46,158
then the peony and perennial garden

995
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:48,158
which may be in that great lawn area or

996
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,600
a portion of it we depending on how the

997
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,360
fundraising goes and all this kind of

998
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:53,839
thing things always change and scales

999
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:56,558
change but peonies are another plant

1000
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:58,480
that are very important some aspects of

1001
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,158
asian horticulture and gardens so there

1002
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,798
ways in which we can draw different

1003
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,240
cultures in here and then from there we

1004
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:05,759
can explore out in any number of

1005
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,440
different avenues

1006
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:09,599
so if you're wondering what the hell did

1007
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,360
was that all about here's the summary

1008
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:13,519
slide we're living museums so we have to

1009
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:15,199
maintain our horticulture and

1010
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,000
educational excellence that goes without

1011
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,759
saying

1012
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,640
so some people say well

1013
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:20,240
you're not going to be a botanic

1014
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,159
gardener anymore yes we are going to be

1015
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,759
a better one

1016
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,320
and a more impactful one and we have to

1017
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:27,679
remain indispensable to to cornell to

1018
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:29,599
the faculty of the students add to the

1019
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,360
community and forge relationships and

1020
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:32,719
partnerships with people in other

1021
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:34,798
disciplines in the humanities in

1022
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,480
particular

1023
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:37,200
and social sciences

1024
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,440
and

1025
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,360
and do more in terms of informing people

1026
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,919
about this intimate link and this sort

1027
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:46,319
of co-ed evolutionary link between

1028
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,159
uh nature and cultures

1029
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:49,119
and i usually like to close things by

1030
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,120
this

1031
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:53,119
uh phrase from shakespeare

1032
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:55,119
that he put in the words of ulysses and

1033
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:56,959
i think otherwise i just can't get

1034
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:58,719
through tourists and cressida

1035
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,480
but anyway he said one touch of nature

1036
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,720
makes the whole world kin and i think if

1037
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,240
we use this as our mantra moving forward

1038
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,159
and think about some this nature and

1039
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,440
culture thing will have left the world a

1040
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,039
better place

1041
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,440
so thank you very much for your

1042
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:11,440
attention

1043
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:21,398
how many of your graduate students

1044
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,398
are undergraduate

1045
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,918
so do you take courses in some of these

1046
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,200
other areas what

1047
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,039
i have so i have graduate students come

1048
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,799
to me from time to time well give me

1049
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,039
your best career advice i said don't

1050
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,399
focus you know

1051
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:38,719
you get so

1052
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:40,799
deeply embedded in this that statistics

1053
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,398
course or that biochemical system and

1054
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,679
things that relate to

1055
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:44,719
getting together in that particular

1056
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,398
field but

1057
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,239
it's really useful

1058
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:49,358
they don't make of course headphones

1059
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,559
anymore they're a hard copy i don't

1060
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:52,719
think back in the day you could just go

1061
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:53,838
like this and uh stick your fingers

1062
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,358
somewhere they're going to take that

1063
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:57,759
course

1064
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:59,199
as the musicology of forever whatever

1065
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,880
the case may be

1066
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:02,879
so i think it could make your

1067
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,839
yes

1068
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,800
you alluded to you know

1069
00:35:14,838 --> 00:35:19,199
uh maybe having a more active role in

1070
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,280
the humanities and social sciences are

1071
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:23,439
there particular departments

1072
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,920
within the cornell that

1073
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,838
you're kind of seeking to build those

1074
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,519
well we're doing some of that through

1075
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:31,759
the lecture series that happened with

1076
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:32,719
paul and the sonia were being

1077
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,079
have a

1078
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:36,239
pretty good relationship now with the

1079
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,000
english department but i want to expand

1080
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:40,399
on that

1081
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,400
theater

1082
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,519
filmmaking

1083
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,599
there's a fellow toby macau

1084
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,719
just a revival by toby mccloud's the

1085
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,720
non-profit

1086
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:53,279
called sacred lands project and he's

1087
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:55,598
been going around the world videotaping

1088
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,160
these different cultures

1089
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:01,119
mainly disappearing cultures and talking

1090
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:03,279
they need to give them about their

1091
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,358
relationship to the landscape

1092
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,960
around them so i'm interested in working

1093
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:08,719
with people like that as well we can't

1094
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,280
work with them directly here we can

1095
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:13,358
bring some of these people in too

1096
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,440
so it's funny he doesn't know this but

1097
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:16,719
um thinking about ways in which we can

1098
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,159
get some of this information out through

1099
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:20,319
these lecture series and so what if we

1100
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:22,879
had this woman who's indian who did a

1101
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,880
bit of this

1102
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,920
multimedia kind of thing called

1103
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,400
himalayan snow where she's looking at uh

1104
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,240
climate change in the himalayas

1105
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,838
the snow melting the glaciers melting

1106
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:35,519
and the impact that's having on those

1107
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:36,559
cultures that live in around the

1108
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:38,639
mountains

1109
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:41,199
there and then what impact that cultural

1110
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:42,719
loss is having on her mother in new york

1111
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,480
because now her culture there is

1112
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:46,719
disappearance so she's dreaming this

1113
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,719
loss herself so you can connect those

1114
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:50,639
dots generation generationally and

1115
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:51,838
connect them geographically spatially

1116
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:54,400
and temporarily

1117
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:56,719
and so what she does is she has this

1118
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,800
video thing that's playing while she's

1119
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:00,719
talking over and then there's this epic

1120
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,200
music from displaying physical movement

1121
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:05,118
as well and it's extremely powerful

1122
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:07,519
so i don't want it to be pedantic

1123
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,119
necessarily or lecturing

1124
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:10,159
as we get more into these things at

1125
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,519
least

1126
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:13,279
we need to not only approach the

1127
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:15,119
humanities but to some extent we also

1128
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:19,440
need to take that humanities approach in

1129
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,440
some ways to overcome our community

1130
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,519
yes yeah um hi i was really um pleased

1131
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,400
to see when you were talking about

1132
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:30,320
biocultural um diversity that then you

1133
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,240
brought the issue back to

1134
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,559
um you know kind of where we are today

1135
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:37,519
with the um

1136
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:40,799
and iroquois i think one of the issues

1137
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:42,719
that i mean it sounds easy to talk about

1138
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,680
preserving plants and everybody wants to

1139
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,559
protect the white pine or the black ash

1140
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:48,319
or

1141
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:51,679
those types of things and and thinking

1142
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,000
about um you know forming partnerships

1143
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:57,679
with with native peoples in in the

1144
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,320
region but the place where it gets hard

1145
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:02,639
is in terms of political sovereignty and

1146
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,039
this last year 2014

1147
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:07,519
was the 400th year of the two-world

1148
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:10,239
wampum which represents the the

1149
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:13,400
political agreement between iroquois

1150
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:15,838
nishoni peoples and

1151
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:18,320
non-native peoples it started with the

1152
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:19,920
dutch but then it also kind of frames

1153
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,039
the relationship between the

1154
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,599
haudenosaunee and u.s people today and

1155
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:28,800
where that comes the kind of rubber

1156
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:31,200
meets the road in difficulty is that

1157
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:34,480
much of new york state is under land

1158
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:37,118
claim conflict meaning that these people

1159
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:40,079
for whom we would like to save the white

1160
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:43,519
pine um have serious and legitimate

1161
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:46,160
claims to property in new york state

1162
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:50,000
based on political sovereignty and so to

1163
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:52,799
not recognize that um is to kind of

1164
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,199
frame the question um in

1165
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,359
not a trivial way but in a way that

1166
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:59,919
doesn't really recognize

1167
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:01,279
um that native indigenous peoples in new

1168
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,200
york state

1169
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,680
in northern north america are indigenous

1170
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:09,439
political entities with the desires to

1171
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,759
have their own land their own government

1172
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,400
and all the rest and so biocultural

1173
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,960
conservation when we form partnerships

1174
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,960
like that to be effective the very first

1175
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:22,000
thing has to recognize the political

1176
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,920
sovereignty of those groups so i salute

1177
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,358
you for bringing up the biocultural

1178
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:30,159
diversity and say let's not forget that

1179
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:32,239
there is political and all sorts of

1180
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:34,399
issues that go along with this right

1181
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:37,118
here in our own backyard and talk to

1182
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,760
people in kyogre county about how

1183
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,200
friendly they are with the human nation

1184
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,520
and you'll probably get slapped in the

1185
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:46,078
face right because they don't like the

1186
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:47,199
kids and they could care less about the

1187
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,400
white pie

1188
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:50,799
well okay

1189
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,760
that's true when i was setting up this

1190
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,599
i agree with all of that yeah

1191
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,880
we did get because they were native

1192
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,800
americans fault with a lot of native

1193
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,320
american i mean native points you know

1194
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,400
whines on the faculty there who are all

1195
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,320
engaged to this um

1196
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,760
in the nationwide studies program as

1197
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,359
well as in the law school another so yes

1198
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,320
we did bring in all that whole political

1199
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:09,119
thing

1200
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,359
and

1201
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,838
there's a it's a pretty dynamic system

1202
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:16,078
there too in hawaii and in aotearoa in

1203
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:16,880
new zealand

1204
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,240
and

1205
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,079
but through these different partnerships

1206
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:23,598
developed respect and from there you can

1207
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,800
work together and try to resolve some of

1208
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,559
these things so it's working out quite

1209
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,200
well in hawaii

1210
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:29,920
right now and i outfit always working

1211
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:32,319
out

1212
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,159
fairly well and i have no doubt the

1213
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,200
situation here will be resolved in some

1214
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:38,838
way that

1215
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,838
not everybody is unhappy

1216
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:46,719
christopher it seems that in considering

1217
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:50,480
this rapid loss of indigenous languages

1218
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:54,319
that it's either being caused by

1219
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:56,559
geographic changes such as these people

1220
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,119
living on the atolls no longer being

1221
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:02,719
able to live there because of rising

1222
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:05,440
ocean levels or because

1223
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:08,078
members of the groups speak those

1224
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,318
languages are migrating to cities and no

1225
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,039
longer identifying with their culture or

1226
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:14,880
the people are just dying out so

1227
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:15,920
given those factors

1228
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,760
what

1229
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,680
realistically practically can be done to

1230
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,800
preserve things

1231
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:25,519
like well that's where we work with

1232
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,280
anthropologists and logistics

1233
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:28,639
interests more than anybody else they

1234
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,240
don't want to

1235
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:33,358
help us with that

1236
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:35,759
and generally what happens is that go to

1237
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:37,598
these places where this is occurring

1238
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,720
and you interview with people and some

1239
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,318
of them say

1240
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:43,598
we don't want your health

1241
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:45,358
we doubt we die our community better off

1242
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,800
if we did assimilate into a lot of

1243
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:49,039
different cultures

1244
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,039
so

1245
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:54,639
some of these languages are going to die

1246
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,800
out because that's what they want

1247
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:58,318
for one reason or another

1248
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,760
there are many in which they do want

1249
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:02,639
their culture to be unhappy with

1250
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,640
devoting the fact

1251
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,880
the least we can do is

1252
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,480
archive for posterity and understand it

1253
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,400
and have it interpreted so we know what

1254
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,079
all these words and magic

1255
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,880
and stories and songs and dances mean

1256
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,519
and

1257
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,119
getting information from that

1258
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,880
beyond that

1259
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,400
what is happening in some places is

1260
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,280
instituting

1261
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,960
language training programs many of the

1262
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,960
older people talk about really how

1263
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,720
medicinal medicinals for some of these

1264
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:48,480
cultures they have the past they have it

1265
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:50,559
written out in their language but these

1266
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,838
paths are really used for

1267
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:53,759
whatever so they can use those as

1268
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:54,480
teaching tools for the next generation

1269
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,920
so

1270
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,358
i'm not an expert in that there are any

1271
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,920
number of different ways in which some

1272
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:01,519
of that can be reversed

1273
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,079
but the big thing in order for a

1274
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:05,759
language to remain viable is that it has

1275
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,599
number one it has to be passed down from

1276
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,640
one generation to the next

1277
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,079
and so when you're looking to see if

1278
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:11,759
your language is in danger that's the

1279
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,200
first thing you look at is the language

1280
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,560
being transmitted it doesn't mean

1281
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:15,519
transmitted then you have to look at

1282
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,920
what

1283
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:17,920
can we do

1284
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:20,799
first

1285
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:27,799
of course

1286
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:35,359
and what i've noticed from the students

1287
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:36,799
and the public is that the incredible

1288
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:38,639
interest

1289
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,760
in plants

1290
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:44,000
and medicine and health

1291
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,200
and it's rare that you go to gardens

1292
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,280
anywhere

1293
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:48,318
but they're very really very conscious

1294
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,160
of this

1295
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:53,039
i mean the public

1296
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:54,399
is constantly consuming all kinds of

1297
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:56,480
botanical stuff

1298
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,559
i wish they're clueless

1299
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,880
what they're thinking

1300
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:04,078
they are i mean it's a multi-billion

1301
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,318
industry so i think my question is

1302
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:09,039
how can gardens

1303
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:10,239
get into a topic which deals with

1304
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:11,679
medicine

1305
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:14,719
deals with

1306
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:17,118
health which everybody is interested in

1307
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:19,358
and you can touch especially in the

1308
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:22,318
ancient medicine of the american indians

1309
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:24,559
from north america south america i mean

1310
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:26,480
it's an incredible wealth

1311
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:29,519
and i'm just

1312
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,519
going to answer that question

1313
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,680
well

1314
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,519
we in the herb garden at the plantations

1315
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:39,199
we have

1316
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:41,838
17 themed beds

1317
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:43,519
we have two beds that are devoted to

1318
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:47,199
medicinal plants

1319
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:48,559
many of which are originate in western

1320
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:52,799
and europe

1321
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:54,159
european culture and um a few from china

1322
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,480
and a few from

1323
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:58,239
india

1324
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,400
and we also have

1325
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:02,838
one of the theme

1326
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:06,960
herbs of the native of american

1327
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:09,279
indians it's very small and

1328
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:12,000
they are located all around us in the

1329
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,240
trees the trees are medicine

1330
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,039
the shrubs are medicine we're you know

1331
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:19,598
they they have medicinal properties so

1332
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:22,159
they're featured all around us not just

1333
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:24,960
within this complex in this very small

1334
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:28,239
bed and the wildflower garden at the

1335
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,838
plantations has

1336
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:31,358
the woodland

1337
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:34,159
native plants some of which are

1338
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:36,318
medicinal and some are edible

1339
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:38,000
so it's through interpretive programs i

1340
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:39,759
think that we learn

1341
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,480
a lot more

1342
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:45,440
because we can only feature a small a

1343
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,519
