1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,309
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,309
University

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,580
well good afternoon everyone so my

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,960
name's Kyle I'm in the Missouri Club and

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,810
I'm going to be continuing our

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,850
discussion on disease resistance but I

7
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:21,039
will be talking about mapping mapping

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:24,669
disease resistance genes in key

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:27,789
curvature species so I'm going to talk

10
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:29,769
today a little bit about two different

11
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:32,710
categories I'm going to talk about

12
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:34,679
resistance to viruses and in particular

13
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:37,450
the viruses that I'm working with our

14
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:40,420
cucumber mosaic virus and then three

15
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:42,210
pody viruses papaya ringspot watermelon

16
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,769
mosaic and zucchini yellow mosaic and

17
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,899
then also I will be talking about our

18
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:50,679
work in mapping partner mildew

19
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:53,379
resistance specifically this gene pm0 my

20
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:55,600
work is being done in Cuba to pepo which

21
00:00:53,378 --> 00:00:57,968
is the species that includes things like

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,689
zucchini summer squash some winter

23
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:03,460
squash pumpkins things like that and

24
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:05,980
while this species is very important for

25
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,629
all of these market classes that really

26
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,700
aren't a lot of resistant genes to be

27
00:01:07,629 --> 00:01:11,769
found there's no native resistance to

28
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,469
any of these diseases in keek urban

29
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:17,259
people so because of that breeders have

30
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:20,829
been forced to go to other species for

31
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:23,620
virus resistance the most common source

32
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:25,920
of resistance for those four viruses are

33
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:30,100
coming from Nigeria and local and menina

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,740
these are too old old varieties of

35
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:34,000
Cucurbita moschata

36
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:36,339
Cucurbita moschata is like a

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,459
butternut-squash tropical pumpkin that

38
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,439
type of thing and they can cross pretty

39
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:44,289
well with Cucurbita pepo so we've been

40
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:47,319
in the past it's been used to bring in

41
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:49,630
those disease resistances but people

42
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:52,209
also use this variety called Whitacre

43
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:53,920
which is an interesting variety name for

44
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:56,039
this man Thomas Whitaker a famous

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,890
cucurbit geneticist and it has

46
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:02,350
resistance that it's been brought into a

47
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:06,189
cocoon of people species but it's from

48
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:11,318
three related wild species so it has a

49
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:13,030
very interesting pedigree and people

50
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:14,289
have been using this as a bridge so they

51
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,759
don't have to try to cross with all

52
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:20,280
these crazy wild species and

53
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,079
very rarely people are using teacher

54
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,348
Buddha Ecuador iNSYS which is one of

55
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,180
those related wild species that is much

56
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:30,869
more difficult to cross with but it does

57
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:34,290
have resistance so to get started on

58
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:37,709
this I was looking for any variety that

59
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:40,229
was listed as having some resistance to

60
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:42,900
any of these viruses and I got a pretty

61
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:44,039
good collection of mostly curative

62
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,110
people some masada

63
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:48,750
and a bunch of different market classes

64
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:52,769
but unfortunately for our two most

65
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:54,209
important viruses CMV and PR SP just

66
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:58,140
aren't that many resistant cultivars

67
00:02:54,209 --> 00:03:00,810
available right now so what I'm doing

68
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:02,729
moving forward is evaluating these and

69
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,400
trying to pick the best ones to start

70
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:07,500
developing segregating populations so we

71
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,560
can move forward with that and have more

72
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,530
of a combination there and for the

73
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,539
bottom two WMV 0mv at least we have a

74
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,930
few more varieties there so we can start

75
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:20,548
doing more mapping with those so I'm

76
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,260
going to just zoom in and talk about

77
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:25,379
just one of these viruses papaya

78
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:29,879
ringspot virus this is a devastating

79
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:31,829
disease causes just terrible fruit

80
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:34,799
deformation and then the plants are

81
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:38,189
stunted and they look disgusting and

82
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,560
nobody wants to buy this so you could

83
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:44,060
eat it but you went to a store nobody's

84
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,199
going to buy something like that so I

85
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,769
focusing on this one because it is

86
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:51,780
unique in that it's one of the poses

87
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:55,109
that in the past resistance has been

88
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,870
described by a single recessive gene so

89
00:03:55,109 --> 00:04:00,930
my my thought is that the most likely

90
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:03,299
candidate gene for this is this CIF 4 E

91
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,760
which is a translation initiation factor

92
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:09,359
that interacts directly with the five

93
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:11,399
prime cap of mrna and it's been shown in

94
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:13,590
other species that mutations in this

95
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,399
gene will result in a recessive

96
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:18,720
resistance to mostly pody viruses so

97
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,138
that's encouraging and also a few other

98
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,840
classes so here's a little cartoon of

99
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,069
how this works so yeah for you as part

100
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:30,500
of this whole translation initiation

101
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:33,019
complex and it binds directly to this

102
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,420
genome associated viral protein that is

103
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:39,229
acting as the five prime cap for virus

104
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:42,350
RNA and if there is a mutation in this

105
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:44,319
protein and it can't bind properly then

106
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,189
this whole complex doesn't form and

107
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:50,420
translation doesn't happen the virus

108
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:50,629
can't spread so so moving forward with

109
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,670
that

110
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:53,959
I'm just looking for any possible

111
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,699
candidate genes from other

112
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:57,859
transcriptomic works that have been

113
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:59,170
identified in curative species and I'm

114
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,490
going to start sequencing those genes

115
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:03,590
looking for any polymorphism that could

116
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,170
be really leading to these mutations

117
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:08,209
that would inhibit this finding and then

118
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:10,250
I'm also working to develop more

119
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:14,419
matching populations and doing more

120
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:16,759
screening okay so changing gears a

121
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,900
little bit I'm going to talk a little

122
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:20,389
bit now about

123
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:22,459
powdery mildew resistance so perhaps

124
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:25,329
some of you remember Bill Holdsworth

125
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:28,219
talking about this work so we have

126
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:30,800
mapped the major powdery mildew

127
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,510
resistance gene that's present in most

128
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,500
of the Popes parts that are available

129
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:38,589
today we used a an integration mapping

130
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,930
approach where we knew that these

131
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:43,759
resistance came from one particular wild

132
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,220
species and it happened in one

133
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,918
introgression event so we were able to

134
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:52,520
find this candidate interval of about

135
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:53,719
500 KB that all of the resistant

136
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,849
varieties shared and none of the

137
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,470
susceptible varieties had and with

138
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,890
additional fine mapping we got that down

139
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,540
to about 76 Kb and we developed a marker

140
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:05,899
that was predictive in key Corbett of

141
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:08,960
people but to keep going with this we

142
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:11,239
really wanted to figure out what is the

143
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,889
actual gene involved what what causal

144
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,720
polymorphism is happening right now our

145
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:19,490
marker is just sort of tagging this

146
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:22,910
introgression so to start I was working

147
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:25,009
through this analysis again and I redid

148
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:27,410
what we did using the new mo shadow

149
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:29,509
genome that's available which is much

150
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:31,180
more complete than the Pico reference

151
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:34,668
that we were using initially and found

152
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,290
one strong signal which is confirming

153
00:06:34,668 --> 00:06:37,959
what we found using the other reference

154
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:42,710
genome so that was very encouraging and

155
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:48,289
then I zoomed in on that region looking

156
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:51,009
at about 80 KB and we have about a dozen

157
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:54,200
or so possible genes in here that have

158
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:58,250
annotations and there are two in

159
00:06:54,199 --> 00:07:01,569
particular that I really want to focus

160
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:04,579
in on and that's this NBS lrr gene and

161
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:07,969
this part of millet resistance protein

162
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:10,399
that has the RP WH domain so these if

163
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:12,440
it's going to be any of these this is

164
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:16,789
where I want to put most of my effort

165
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:20,689
because this MBS LR gene is a very

166
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:22,879
common our gene for a lot of different

167
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:24,889
species and the powdery mildew

168
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,829
resistance protein with the RP WH domain

169
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:30,169
is very specific to powdery mildew and

170
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:33,620
it's been shown in few other species but

171
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:37,960
that is what is causing resistance so to

172
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:40,610
really get into this for these two

173
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:44,089
candidate genes we've been doing a lot

174
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:46,520
of sequencing did some rt-pcr and we

175
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:48,379
found that they are expressed in both

176
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:51,049
the resistant and susceptible varieties

177
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:53,360
so there must be something else going on

178
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:55,579
it's not just presence/absence so we're

179
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,620
trying to do additional sequencing and

180
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:59,569
using race to pull out the entire

181
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,550
sequence of these genes from both

182
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:03,589
resistant and susceptible varieties and

183
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:07,250
we're looking for polymorphism that

184
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:09,319
could be leading to this change and once

185
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,170
we are a little bit more confident that

186
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:14,240
one of these two genes is most likely

187
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:17,540
our best candidate then we're thinking

188
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,370
about moving forward with either a virus

189
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:22,819
induced gene silencing technique to

190
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:25,009
knock out the expression of the gene in

191
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:28,069
the resistant plants try to bring it

192
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:29,810
down to a susceptible level or possibly

193
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:32,720
using any transformation techniques that

194
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:36,169
could be like an ultimate confirmation

195
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:40,519
that our chem gene is in fact the causal

196
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:43,519
gene so with that I'd like to just thank

197
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:45,409
the members of Missouri lab especially

198
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,720
page reads for all for help with the

199
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:50,620
powdery mildew work my committee members

200
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,480
and my funding through Q cap then

201
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,710
allowing me to really dig into some of

202
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,440
these different a lot of different

203
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,940
diseases

204
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,910
which are really important to the key

205
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,580
kerbin for community at large so thank

206
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:08,759
you

207
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:08,759
[Applause]

208
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:27,350
so there you know there are even a lot

209
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:30,080
of work done in tea curb excusing that I

210
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:33,470
think one that has been shown to work at

211
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,900
least in proof of concept is I think

212
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,730
it's like Apple spherical latent fire or

213
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:39,110
something like that so that has been

214
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,420
shown at least to work in

215
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:44,269
proof-of-concept but not a lot of work

216
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:45,799
has been done using bigs in cucurbits so

217
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:47,240
that would be something that I wanted to

218
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:49,609
use that first would have to get the

219
00:09:47,240 --> 00:10:01,750
system working and then go from there

220
00:09:49,610 --> 00:10:01,750
but that sounds kind of fun to me so yes

221
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,610
so that is it's present all throughout

222
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,009
the United States I'm not exactly sure

223
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,050
where it came from but it also can

224
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:17,409
affect papayas Tussauds

225
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:20,059
it's that same sort of virus but it

226
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:21,559
pretty much infects papayas and then

227
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:25,069
kicker baits and not a whole lot else

228
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:31,119
it's not like CMV that can infect like a

229
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:31,120
thousand different things yes

230
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,990
mm-hmm

231
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:46,000
so that is a good question there's a lot

232
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:48,640
of redundancies so if the cell has other

233
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,070
like different versions of this it could

234
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,409
still function normally and it might

235
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:55,660
just be that there's specific yeah F or

236
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:59,019
E virus interactions that aren't working

237
00:10:55,659 --> 00:11:01,600
but with the cap protein of the mRNA

238
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:04,480
that's in plant cells that's slightly

239
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,009
different than this viral cap protein so

240
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,120
that interaction might not work with the

241
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:11,919
virus but it could still work with the

242
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,610
mRNA from the plant cell it's a pretty

243
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:22,809
common mechanism of resistance to assess

244
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:25,240
advisors like that this has been a

245
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:30,059
production of Cornell University on the

246
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,060
