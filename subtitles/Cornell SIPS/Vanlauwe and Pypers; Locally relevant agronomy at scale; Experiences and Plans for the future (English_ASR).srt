1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,960
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,960
university

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,119
bernard will lead us off and peter will

4
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,718
take over about halfway through so

5
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,479
without any further ado

6
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:17,198
thank you very much both for for joining

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,199
us today and bernard the floor is yours

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,880
yeah thanks a lot andy and also thanks

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,199
for the invitation

10
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,278
uh you remember we had planned this i

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,840
think earlier this year when we said

12
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:28,800
let's

13
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:31,039
still meet in you know face to face in

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,880
the u.s by that time you know we'll know

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,520
that the covet situation will have been

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,440
resolved do you remember that discussion

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,200
it would actually have been nice to come

18
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,039
physically to cornell i used to have a

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,399
bit of cooperation with cornell some

20
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,439
years ago but it's been

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,719
some time now that i've been there let's

22
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,439
let's maybe book this

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,960
this next year again or sometime and

24
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,280
thanks also for

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,960
for allowing us to talk about the new

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,558
initiative

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,000
i've developed the slides with my

28
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:59,519
colleague i'm going

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
to talk a little bit about the broad

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,558
picture of what we call

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,118
excellence in agronomy and then peter

32
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:07,679
will

33
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,760
give a little bit more zooming in he

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,560
will zoom in on an initiative that has

35
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,320
basically probably created some of the

36
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,320
arguments why we needed excellence in

37
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,879
agronomy initiative

38
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,679
so the rationale why why why why

39
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,239
agronomy

40
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,479
why you know agronomy is not a new term

41
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,199
it's not a new research area so why do

42
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,000
we need

43
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,759
an initiative across the cgi on that

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,680
there's a number of arguments we usually

45
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,280
present

46
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,960
we know there's been quite a bit of

47
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,280
success with crop improvement if you

48
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,359
read publications about the cgr and

49
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,759
impact it's usually around that

50
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,280
but we also know that the expression of

51
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,159
what is called genetic gain

52
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,759
at scale is not always there there is

53
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,118
some recent work from uh

54
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,759
symmets who looked at mace modern they

55
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,920
call it modern variety adoption against

56
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,359
national granules for a lot of countries

57
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,600
in africa

58
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,920
you see very nicely the picture is quite

59
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:05,519
scattered although in a lot of countries

60
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,239
there is quite a bit of an uptake of

61
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,079
modern maze varieties of course you also

62
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,640
see countries like ethiopia where

63
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,360
there's

64
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,439
actually substantial increases in yield

65
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,080
and we know why that is we know why that

66
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,840
is we know that variety alone is not

67
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,760
sufficient we know that you need your

68
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,080
nutrient inputs

69
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,280
the other side of the coin also shows

70
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,719
this is for instance

71
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,519
fao data on the left side here showing

72
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,598
fertilizer use over time for mozambique

73
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,319
malawi and zambia you see a clear

74
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,399
increase in malawi and zambia these are

75
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,119
majors for the same period and you can

76
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,000
correlate

77
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,519
those data and you clearly see that

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,519
there is a noise relationship

79
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,719
of course not all that fertilizer is

80
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,239
applied to that maze

81
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,199
that's that's for sure but there is

82
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,360
definitely a large proportion of it is

83
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,399
in southern africa which is which is

84
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,040
always based

85
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,039
basically so i think we know that but

86
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,639
it's good also to see it confirmed in

87
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,959
data

88
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,878
the second argument and i will not dwell

89
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,560
on this one the science advancement

90
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:07,679
there's been a lot of development in

91
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,479
tools

92
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,760
methods geospatial statistics big data

93
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,158
analytics

94
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,439
that actually allows us to implement

95
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:18,560
agronomy to scale

96
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:20,400
rnd while still being locally relevant

97
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,719
and i'm not going to dwell on this peter

98
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,959
will

99
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,158
dig a lot deeper into this bullet later

100
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,640
on

101
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:28,318
the third bullet why we feel there is a

102
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,639
large demand for agronomy

103
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,158
at scale with a lot of public and

104
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,878
private partner sectors

105
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,878
which is new by new i mean it's not new

106
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,000
as such but 20 years ago this was not

107
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:39,759
the case

108
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
so while 20 years ago you could have

109
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,079
done excellent signs that demand and

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,598
interest was not there today it isn't i

111
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,890
think we know

112
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,238
the cta reports from last year

113
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:53,039
[Music]

114
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,560
conducted by dalbert which shows the

115
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,519
sort of

116
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,400
deforest company starters present in

117
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,560
africa

118
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,799
with kenya here on the left having at

119
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,759
least 150

120
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,120
uh initiatives we also see on the map

121
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,719
here that although the

122
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,759
the number of initiatives in

123
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:16,160
in blue is pretty similar between east

124
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:18,478
and west africa the users in east africa

125
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,720
the orange circle is much

126
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,478
larger than in west africa although

127
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,840
probably today those circuits have

128
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,478
changed already

129
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,478
so of all those companies the insurance

130
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,800
companies agronomy advisory they are

131
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:33,360
interested in agronomy at scale

132
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,759
solutions and the very last point the

133
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,000
cgr reform process i think andy alluded

134
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,400
to

135
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,240
this there is a reform process ongoing

136
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,799
and it gives us an opportunity

137
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,800
to organize agronomy since

138
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,840
2005 there's not been a unifying force

139
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,639
in the agronomy space in the cgir

140
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,560
um this is these are the centers here

141
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,319
i'm not sure how familiar everyone is

142
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,360
with the centers but we are working with

143
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,159
10

144
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,479
centers which are highlighted here and

145
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,560
we

146
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,000
currently still have about 130

147
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,839
agronomists

148
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,560
involved in quite a lot of initiatives

149
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:11,439
and and spending about 10 to 15

150
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,120
of the budget so it's still impressive

151
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,719
when we did this study we were a little

152
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,759
bit surprised but it's

153
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,880
mainly through time-bound projects which

154
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,879
come and go which

155
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,800
don't create a lot of incentives to

156
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,279
cross-learn to

157
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,439
share experiences so we want to change

158
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,279
that

159
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,719
now what is the purpose and the scope i

160
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,439
mean this is this is a lot of

161
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,680
um you know big words and difficult

162
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:38,879
words so i'm not going to read this

163
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,759
but basically what we want to do is

164
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:43,120
we want to deliver agronomy gain for a

165
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,439
lot of people

166
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,680
because we know that agronomy gain will

167
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:51,600
have a positive impact on livelihoods

168
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:55,199
income soil health climate resilience

169
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,400
and we want to do this by setting up

170
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,800
agronomy at scale solutions

171
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,120
these two words in blue i will dwell on

172
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,478
a little bit

173
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,079
what is agronomy at scale and we've had

174
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,719
that question a few times

175
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:12,719
now what we really want to do is we want

176
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,000
to resolve that conundrum that that

177
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,639
contradiction

178
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,160
that agronomy has been plagued with on

179
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,639
the one hand agronomy is

180
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,439
locally relevant it's place based it

181
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,038
it's it's an adaptive process

182
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,800
but at the same time we need to work

183
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:29,599
with millions of people on millions of

184
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,918
hectares so how do you resolve this

185
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,759
20 years ago it was not resolvable the

186
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:34,079
only way you can resolve this 20 years

187
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,240
ago

188
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,758
is you go to a new village and you start

189
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,720
all over again

190
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,800
today we can resolve that conundrum so

191
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,680
what we want to do in agronomy and

192
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,680
scale is we want to assist people

193
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,000
farmers decision makers to take the

194
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,918
right

195
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,759
decisions on those soil and crop

196
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:55,120
management practices

197
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,199
that are taking place once a season i

198
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,840
would say for annual crops

199
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,439
we want to scrub and soil management

200
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,359
decisions to be influenced

201
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,719
informed by spatial and temporal

202
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,360
variability

203
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,360
we want that advisory to be targeted to

204
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,598
end users needs and to account for yield

205
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,160
profitability sustainability

206
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,759
peter will explain what this means in

207
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,680
practice

208
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,960
the second thing i've mentioned is

209
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,840
agronomic gain

210
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,918
we are currently developing a conceptual

211
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,799
framework around agronomic game

212
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:27,439
in line with what is called genetic gain

213
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,439
so we are

214
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,719
working around four key performance

215
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,680
indicators increased

216
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,479
use and profitability improved resources

217
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,519
efficiencies

218
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:39,439
could be nutrients labor increased yield

219
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:42,639
stability and improved soil health

220
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,120
and of course we know that those kpis

221
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,800
will

222
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,800
vary in importance or relative

223
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,240
importance for for the various regions

224
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,240
of the of the global south

225
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,520
how are we going to deliver that

226
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,519
agronomy at scale and

227
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,598
develop solutions and deliver them with

228
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,240
partners

229
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,598
so we had a co-creation process with all

230
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,079
those centers and he

231
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:06,719
assisted us with this and a number of

232
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,439
other

233
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,639
external partners and we ended up with

234
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,959
the structure around

235
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,840
four what we call modules this this

236
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,519
sounds a bit

237
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,439
you know a little bit theoretical and so

238
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,799
but i still want to explain this because

239
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:20,800
it shows

240
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,720
a little bit the different ways in which

241
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,319
we want to do agronomy

242
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,840
so on the left side we have the organize

243
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,520
module which is really hosting the

244
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,478
functions related to

245
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,838
internal organizations partnerships this

246
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,240
is also where we do

247
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,200
the prioritization and demand mapping i

248
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,000
think these are two

249
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,200
key words for the ones the new

250
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,440
excellence in agronomy initiative

251
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,640
prioritization that means having an

252
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,279
objective verifiable framework to decide

253
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,399
where and what you're going to do and

254
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,399
demand mapping

255
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,919
which means we are going to absolutely

256
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,080
respond to

257
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,679
demand by real people working with real

258
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,720
farmers and in real

259
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:04,639
regions so that will happen here

260
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,320
based on that demand mapping and

261
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:07,600
prioritization process there will be a

262
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,200
number of projects

263
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:15,360
one two to n which will start and stop

264
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,360
and which will deliver solutions

265
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,720
at scale depending on the demand that

266
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,240
was formulated now

267
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,959
this projects will be counting

268
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,120
on and using tools and data and

269
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,599
analytics in the transform module which

270
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,320
is this

271
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,399
vertical box here and where we feel

272
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,920
there is not enough

273
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,120
data or analytics available to

274
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:39,039
immediately use

275
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,519
in the delivery of those products we're

276
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:44,319
going to the innovate module which is

277
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,120
where the innovative the new r d will be

278
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,760
done in support of agronomy at scale

279
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,519
and of course this these two central

280
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,559
core boxes are influenced

281
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,759
by new data collected through these this

282
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:57,838
projects

283
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,439
this slide is interesting also because

284
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,120
it shows the docking points for

285
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,440
partnerships

286
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,039
um if we talk you know to your

287
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,839
colleagues and cornell

288
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,278
we at the cgr we will not claim and we

289
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,200
cannot claim that we host

290
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:13,759
all the skills and capacity needed to

291
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,519
deliver an agronomy at scale program

292
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:18,159
so we do have a talking point for

293
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,120
international research and academics

294
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:23,199
through the innovate module so probably

295
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,078
at one time next year we will start

296
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,480
actually

297
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,879
talking to cornell and see what this

298
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,440
means in practice

299
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,240
we have a docking point for the national

300
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,160
system

301
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,839
scientists to the transform module

302
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,069
because we want those tools to be

303
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,519
accessible used and

304
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:42,000
[Music]

305
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,839
empowering national systems to use those

306
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,839
tools and data

307
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,920
we have our demand partners here the

308
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,240
country engagement the private sector

309
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:52,159
all the people who need our agronomy

310
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,759
and we have a docking point for a donor

311
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:56,719
interest group so this is this is

312
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,240
this slide is is really in one slide

313
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,959
summarizing a lot of the

314
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,159
logic and partnerships that we want to

315
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,759
set up to deliver

316
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:08,159
on our on our vision

317
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,159
in term just a few more slides to dig a

318
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,879
little bit deeper into those modules

319
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,078
in terms of the organized module as i

320
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:15,919
said one of the key

321
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,120
innovations that we want to apply in

322
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,599
agronomy is

323
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,519
a very very conscientious process on

324
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,800
prioritization

325
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,560
i've worked in agronomy myself for

326
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,039
i usually say more than 10 years

327
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:32,319
although it's almost 30 years

328
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,039
and sometimes if you look back you see

329
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,200
that

330
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:38,240
a lot of projects you go you do your

331
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,160
work your demonstrations but you don't

332
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,799
decide or you've not reflected well on

333
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,639
why you do certain activities

334
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,000
and is the enabling environment

335
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,000
insufficient is the

336
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,200
the potential for scaling really there

337
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
so we want we want to

338
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,278
be absolutely objective and explicit

339
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,078
about that so we

340
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,679
are developing a three-stage process

341
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:59,919
where we start to define

342
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,719
where the agronomy can make a difference

343
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:05,360
in terms of farming systems countries

344
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,639
and status of our key performance

345
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,839
indicators

346
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,399
within that do the demand mapping and

347
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,440
look at

348
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,320
the conditions for uptake of agronomy at

349
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,079
scale

350
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,720
and then have an exotic assessment

351
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:20,559
framework on on potential solutions on

352
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,079
our technology packages that we would

353
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,559
like to deploy

354
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,239
in respond to that demands within a

355
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,399
certain geography so there's a lot of

356
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,320
discussion going on

357
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,799
this is work in progress but i wanted to

358
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,480
highlight this as a key

359
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:37,278
innovation and the way we want to

360
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,200
organize our agronomy research

361
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:41,039
the transform module peter will talk

362
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,839
much more about that that's as i said

363
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:43,919
the core

364
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,680
that's where the data and this data

365
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,759
solutions on the left are and where the

366
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:50,319
analytics and turnkey

367
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:52,240
models on the right side are just one

368
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,560
example we are going to work

369
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,079
quite a bit with the big data platform

370
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:58,719
of the one cgr this is

371
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:00,638
recent work so they've looked at their

372
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,120
guardian database

373
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:06,000
uh assembled fertilizer response data

374
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,480
from 760 locations

375
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,480
used machine learning procedures on

376
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,480
those data

377
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,959
obtained price data and computed

378
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,240
profitability

379
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:21,119
in space and based on that

380
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,240
could map the profitability of

381
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,679
fertilizer

382
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,639
within the continent with not only a

383
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:31,919
profitability on average but also

384
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,839
error bars around that so i think this

385
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,360
this shows the power of big data the

386
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,279
power of what you can do if we are

387
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,039
better organized than assembling our

388
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:42,000
data

389
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:42,799
in terms of the tools the turnkey

390
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,799
solutions

391
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,958
peter will talk a lot about our african

392
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,879
cassava agronomy initiative

393
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,078
i've shown this slide quite a few times

394
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,879
so now i can also

395
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:55,039
explain it but i think peter peter will

396
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,198
do a better job so i will hand the

397
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,480
the explanation of this slide over to

398
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:01,439
him

399
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,440
in terms of innovate this is think where

400
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,880
we absolutely need to talk to cornell

401
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,000
and other colleagues in the u.s and

402
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:08,799
elsewhere

403
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,360
here we want to do new r d which is

404
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:11,519
actually

405
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,360
potentially triggering new demand for

406
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,320
agronomy solution this is just one

407
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,519
example on where we want to engage in

408
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,879
measuring

409
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,399
yield at scale within season to increase

410
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,958
the efficiency of our

411
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,799
agronomy workflows and so on and so on

412
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,638
but there will be a lot of opportunity

413
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:32,639
other opportunities to

414
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,639
to advance the signs of agronomy

415
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,559
the last module the delivery module we

416
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:41,198
have actually

417
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:44,399
phrased around the number of key steps

418
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:46,719
around the generic workflow

419
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,639
it took quite a bit of time to develop

420
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,440
this workflow but it's also based on a

421
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,360
lot of

422
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,040
learning and probably a lot of earlier

423
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,240
mistake making

424
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:58,000
so on the left side number one

425
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,198
agree on the core partnerships that's

426
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,958
where we place the demand for agronomy

427
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,319
and number two step number two under

428
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,039
that develops the tool

429
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,920
the minimum viable product what is that

430
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,240
decision to

431
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:13,039
that we are going to develop in response

432
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,639
to that demand i will not go into detail

433
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:15,198
with a lot of the other steps but once

434
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,240
you have

435
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:20,240
that mvp described very well

436
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,480
we need to go and assembling the data

437
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,959
and the tools

438
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,240
go into prototyping and very important

439
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,879
step five

440
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,560
going to the validation process and here

441
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:33,039
we've learned by experience that the

442
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,758
validation process is not

443
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:37,519
just a technical process a set of

444
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,839
technical processes

445
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,679
you can test tools look at the

446
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,279
recommendations implement them and look

447
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,278
at yield differences that's what we

448
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:47,039
would do as agronomists

449
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,879
but we've learned from experience that

450
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,039
the user experience

451
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:53,519
the way the recommendations are

452
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,759
formulated and made accessible to people

453
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,560
the way they are interpreted

454
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,680
is as important as the technical content

455
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,000
itself

456
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:03,278
and we've learned by doing that you know

457
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,679
being demanded

458
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:08,078
with agronomy you have to have almost

459
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:10,159
equal importance given

460
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:11,838
to the technical aspects as to the user

461
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,159
experience aspects and then of course

462
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,279
you go into scaling and so on

463
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:20,559
so in our current work we are currently

464
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:24,480
operating a two-year incubation phase

465
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:27,198
we have identified 10 of what we call

466
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,440
use cases that are now under

467
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:32,639
implementation and which are all based

468
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,000
on actual demand from

469
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:38,240
a specific demand partner on a specific

470
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,078
agronomic issue in a specific geography

471
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,879
so we have six of them in africa

472
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,319
we have two of them in asia one in egypt

473
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,480
north africa

474
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,320
and one in latin america and each of

475
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,320
them

476
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:55,920
has a partner an agronomy

477
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,519
needs a cropping system and a geography

478
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,599
in which this will be applied

479
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,720
and of course i will not have time to go

480
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,880
into all this but

481
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,838
maybe to give little bit deeper into one

482
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,880
example the

483
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:12,159
example of digital green

484
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,240
in ethiopia digital green is an ngo

485
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,279
probably some of you know them

486
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,000
they are planning to reach 25 000

487
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,240
farmers

488
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,599
in wheat production system and they are

489
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,679
interested

490
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:27,918
in how they can increase retails

491
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,080
and quality of wheat so not just heal

492
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,880
but also the quality of the consistency

493
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,519
the

494
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,679
nutrient content so they want advisory

495
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:38,079
on uterus surveillance planting data

496
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:41,200
advisory and nutrient management

497
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,960
that's their demand they do have a

498
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,600
platform in which they provide

499
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:49,440
information to pharmaceutical

500
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:51,199
voice and they actually have an online

501
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,120
platform to collect feedback so we've

502
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,960
set up a partnership with digital green

503
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:56,879
the national systems

504
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,519
ministry of agriculture and then some

505
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,160
course support from usaid and so on

506
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,960
and this this use case which is that

507
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,080
tool

508
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,720
that will be submitted through ivr of

509
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:09,279
sms

510
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,640
information on this particular topics

511
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,678
will then be

512
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,840
piloted and validated and

513
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,240
ultimately developed in a form ready for

514
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:22,000
scaling so this is just one example

515
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,400
but we do have 10 of those examples so

516
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,400
this is my last slide from here peter

517
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,519
will take over as i said

518
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,440
my job was to sketch in broad lines

519
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,200
what excellence in agronomy is about

520
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,919
what we try to do

521
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,558
at the same time inviting cornell to

522
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,360
join us

523
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,000
help us with some effort and i've also

524
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,519
tried to

525
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,319
probably show that a lot of the

526
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:49,440
tools are work in progress or under

527
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:52,000
development so we will need support to

528
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,759
to develop to finish their development i

529
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,558
will stop sharing and i

530
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,200
assume peter will take over now yeah

531
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:00,879
very good

532
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,038
thanks thanks andy over to peter

533
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,679
thanks a lot bernard i can see your

534
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:05,679
screen peter

535
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,080
thanks andy and uh thanks to everyone

536
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:13,519
for uh for also giving me the chance to

537
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:16,558
to present some of the work uh um

538
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:18,079
so like bernard gave already uh quite a

539
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:19,918
number of hints i'll i'll try and dig a

540
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:21,279
little bit deeper into

541
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,280
some of the work that's been happening

542
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:26,960
through the african cassava

543
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:30,000
agronomy initiative or um or akai and

544
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,558
give some um some meat to the bone of

545
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,759
some of

546
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:37,599
the concepts that bernard has just

547
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:41,359
has just spoken about so as a means of

548
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:44,079
introduction um

549
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:44,798
i just like to show um a typical african

550
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,000
landscape

551
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:50,480
uh farming landscape so this is from uh

552
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,240
from north tanzania where you typically

553
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,519
see you know lots of small

554
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,960
holders um dispersed in the landscape

555
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,960
there's slopes there's different crops

556
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,840
there's a lot of banana here

557
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,038
different plots erosion happening you

558
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:07,119
see some good plot some bad plots

559
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,480
dark green crops and very pale yellow

560
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:12,000
crops um

561
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:14,480
so this is a very typical um situation

562
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,079
um and providing advice to that's

563
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,319
relevant to small holders

564
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:20,240
you know you need to take into account

565
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:20,960
that sort of heterogeneity that that

566
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,720
you'll find

567
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,798
so whatever you're going to promote is

568
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,960
definitely not going to work

569
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:29,599
in each and every farm and each and

570
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,720
every plot of every farm

571
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:34,079
but if you if you zoom out um and if you

572
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,400
look at africa

573
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,678
you know from from high up in the sky

574
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,880
there's also a lot of

575
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,200
variation at that scale um so here you

576
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,039
see

577
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,880
actually east africa you see on top

578
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:46,720
there you see lake victoria and on the

579
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,400
right you see mount kilimanjaro

580
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,000
so if you if you look at that scale you

581
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,280
know you have to deal with a lot of

582
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,919
different soils

583
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,480
from very acid to to actually high ph

584
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,759
soils

585
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,000
in this area even and and

586
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,919
also that sort of heterogeneity needs to

587
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,119
be needs to be taken into account

588
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,120
actually that's that's

589
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,959
often easier to do because we have

590
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:09,839
digital soil maps

591
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,240
um this is this is just uh some showing

592
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,599
you

593
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,359
um soil ph values um from from soil

594
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,839
grits i'll talk a bit later

595
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,839
more about that and and this digital

596
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:22,639
soil information we can we can use that

597
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:25,279
when we provide economic advice

598
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,240
so like i said if we want to advise

599
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:27,678
farmers you know

600
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,359
over the past decades we've seen

601
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,798
numerous papers that talk about

602
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:32,399
you know there is need for local

603
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,240
adaptation um

604
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,600
integrated so fertility management you

605
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,519
know requires

606
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,959
adapting your recommendations depending

607
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:41,279
on the type of sort of

608
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,679
field you're looking at sometimes you

609
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,440
see soil fertility varying as much

610
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,120
within a single farm as across the

611
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,159
entire continent

612
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:54,158
so blanket recommendations won't work

613
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:57,360
there will never be a one-size-fits-all

614
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,799
so that brings me to agronomy at scale

615
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,678
and and what it means

616
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,119
um to be to be locally relevant as the

617
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,480
title set

618
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:09,839
um but still working you know

619
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:13,120
at scale to service farmers across

620
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:15,119
across the landscapes

621
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:16,719
and the heterogeneity that i've just

622
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:18,479
shown

623
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,880
so what does that approach mean what we

624
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,360
did in in the project and i'll

625
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,400
just introduce the project in the next

626
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:26,879
few slides

627
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,798
what we try and do is we we we do field

628
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,440
experiments we're agronomists we like

629
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:32,480
trials

630
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,000
um and we try and understand um what

631
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,679
sort of interventions work under what

632
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,880
circumstances

633
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,640
then we apply crop models um to predict

634
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,400
what will happen in sort of the next

635
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,520
farmer's field and

636
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,600
gis and geospatial statistics to

637
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:49,119
extrapolate that

638
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,959
then pour that into some form of

639
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,479
decision support tool that we can put in

640
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,319
the hands of a farmer

641
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,079
and promote and scale that in very

642
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:58,000
simple terms that's that's what the

643
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:59,439
project tries to do

644
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,480
so i'll try and show a little bit in

645
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,759
more detail how how that workflow

646
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,558
happened in in the project but first

647
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,319
before that

648
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:09,678
these are a couple of sort of things

649
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:12,000
that that you know we

650
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,600
we talked about advances in in the field

651
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,279
of agronomy and some of the tools that

652
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:16,879
became available and that we're sort of

653
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:18,960
applying in this project we're talking

654
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,919
about using gis

655
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,240
to assist us with sampling locations but

656
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,840
also extrapolating our results

657
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,919
we're doing field trials with very

658
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:30,158
effective experimental designs and

659
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,720
using actually efficient data management

660
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,120
systems within those to make sure that

661
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,000
any data we collect we can actually use

662
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:38,719
within 24

663
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,519
hours after collecting it we do a lot of

664
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,640
stats and

665
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:44,079
geospatial work we use not just trials

666
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,600
but also surveys

667
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:49,278
um sometimes um

668
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:51,439
measuring things in farmer's fields can

669
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:55,519
actually get you answers

670
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,519
much faster than doing trials

671
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,039
we use a lot of methods that are fast

672
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,880
and accurate but sometimes less precise

673
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:05,440
sometimes spectral methods in the field

674
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,159
to look at nutrient deficiencies

675
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,240
um also with soil samples when we

676
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,000
analyze those and we have

677
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,640
large numbers of samples rather than

678
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,440
going through these into a wet chem lab

679
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,440
we

680
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,159
try and measure those very quickly using

681
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,840
near-infrared for example

682
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,919
crop modelling i'll talk quite a bit

683
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:27,199
about that and

684
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:30,400
and software and decision support tool

685
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,480
development so the

686
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,240
african cassava agronomy initiative this

687
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,519
is its logo

688
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,319
is is one of um it's a number of sister

689
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:40,480
projects

690
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:42,158
and that that have worked on this

691
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,480
agronomy at scale

692
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,960
and of course this project is now

693
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,000
specifically on on cassava

694
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,519
so we we try to develop

695
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,679
new technologies tailor these um

696
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:56,798
to the to the heterogeneity of farmers

697
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,880
and and deliver

698
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:01,200
recommendations to 000 farmers that was

699
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,400
our

700
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,880
our goal and we set out in 2016 when we

701
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,919
started this project

702
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,960
we operate in nigeria and tanzania and

703
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,919
we work with

704
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,720
with many many farmers many many

705
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,520
partners

706
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,240
talk a bit more about that in a minute

707
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:20,639
but

708
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,480
like i said the the core thing that we

709
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,480
really wanted to to achieve is really

710
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,480
having evidence-based recommendations

711
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,440
that are as much as possible

712
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,519
tailored to to be as as as locally

713
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,880
relevant as possible

714
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:37,359
so today some numbers you know we've

715
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,559
we've involved over 20 000 farmers

716
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:42,479
in field experimentation we've run over

717
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:44,960
5 000 5000 on-farm

718
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,558
field trials those are research-managed

719
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,640
trials

720
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,158
but conducted on-farm and we've taken

721
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,200
over 50 000

722
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:55,840
cassava yield measurements in in those

723
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,600
farmers fields

724
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:59,519
than 90 percent of all the data we've

725
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,959
generated comes from farmers fields so

726
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,839
we've done actually very little

727
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,840
on station work

728
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:12,319
we work on six use cases um

729
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,400
these are sort of demands that were

730
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:15,439
formulated within the project by the

731
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,200
primary partners

732
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,038
these partners are people that are on

733
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,440
ground

734
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:23,200
they are ngos they are fertilizer

735
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,798
companies they are starch processing

736
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,880
factories

737
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:28,639
who actually formulated what they need

738
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,320
in terms of agronomy advice

739
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:35,759
um to to service their um their clients

740
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:38,158
their farmers that they're working with

741
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,839
so we have for example fertilizer

742
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,240
companies who ask for better blends

743
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:44,319
formulating better blends

744
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,720
ngos who work on inter-cropping

745
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:50,079
practices of or planting practices

746
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,159
including tillage and wheat control

747
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:53,839
we have starch factories who want advice

748
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,000
on when to plant and harvest so that

749
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:58,079
they can get year-round supply of roots

750
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,079
to their factories

751
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:02,399
and several several partners actually

752
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:06,240
are interested in fertilizer use to

753
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,919
to increase productivity so now i'll

754
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,159
talk a little bit more about

755
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,120
about the fertilizer work as as an

756
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,720
example

757
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:15,519
much of the approaches i'll show we've

758
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,839
also applied to the other use cases

759
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:20,158
um but this one is is a bit special and

760
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:24,079
and i think a very good example of

761
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,919
how we work so we started off like i

762
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:28,000
said we're agronomists we like to do

763
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,600
trials and we did we did many of those

764
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,159
and we started with neutrino mission

765
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:32,798
trials

766
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,720
very simple trials where we applied high

767
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,079
rates of nitrogen phosphorus and

768
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,120
potassium and then looked at what

769
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:40,720
happened

770
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:42,639
if we omitted any of those elements

771
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,319
this is just a typical example you see

772
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,038
you get high yields if you apply the

773
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:47,359
nutrients

774
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:50,640
you you take those nutrients away the

775
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:52,398
yield drops substantially

776
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,159
but there's a lot of variation we don't

777
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:57,359
see the same everywhere

778
00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:00,320
this is just an example plot from our

779
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:02,639
first season in nigeria

780
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,798
so we see that in some farmer's fields

781
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,278
omitting nitrogen

782
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:08,639
reduces the yield a lot in other plots

783
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:11,839
of farmers

784
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,960
it's not so much the cases

785
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,359
in the meantime we've done many many of

786
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,759
those

787
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:20,240
of those trials we've done about i think

788
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:23,200
close to a thousand of them

789
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,038
um we have over 5000 close to 5000 plot

790
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,278
yield measurements

791
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:29,839
so that's that data sort of served us to

792
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:31,200
to start doing some modeling and we

793
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:34,879
actually coupled

794
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,200
two um two models

795
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,840
we used lintel and more recently

796
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,159
actually we switched to dsat

797
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:45,119
together to give us water limited yields

798
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,440
using geospatial weather data

799
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:48,479
and we use soil data also geospatial

800
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,000
soil data and

801
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:55,519
fed that to quests um but we

802
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,398
let's say dismantled crafts a bit and

803
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:01,038
replaced some of the parts by machine

804
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:03,599
learning to predict

805
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:05,278
indigenous nutrient supply from the soil

806
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:07,199
we also combine that with

807
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:13,038
some some variables that we got from the

808
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:16,000
farmer himself um

809
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:16,398
so we use soil grids um this is just the

810
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,200
maybe

811
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:21,038
this is again ph i think sword grids

812
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,759
actually offers um digital soil

813
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:26,319
information

814
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:29,839
on most of the um traditional uh

815
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:31,678
soil soil parameters

816
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:32,879
and then what you typically see is these

817
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,679
are this is

818
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,960
more recent data this is um yield with

819
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,320
fertilizer versus

820
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,319
versus a control yield um you see this

821
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:48,319
sort of typical spread

822
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:51,759
you have typically with higher yields

823
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:53,918
more variation but also larger responses

824
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,599
until you reach of course very high

825
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,240
yields and then you don't see yield

826
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,599
decreasing anymore

827
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,359
now what you see is actually that the

828
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:02,798
current yield is often best the best

829
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,798
single

830
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:06,480
indicator for the expected response if

831
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:08,158
you see the yield is low

832
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,759
typically you also expect that the

833
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,278
fertilizer response will be low and we

834
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:13,599
use that information

835
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:15,599
to define some yield categories and and

836
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:16,719
farmers can easily identify with them if

837
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:20,719
you if you turn that

838
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,360
into pictures for example like this

839
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,360
and you tell them you know this is the

840
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:27,439
typical cassava plant

841
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:29,278
you know which one is the most common in

842
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,960
your field and they can actually easily

843
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:33,919
relate to that and say you know

844
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,120
my field most often our clans look like

845
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,799
this

846
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,239
so that's a way for us to actually

847
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:41,839
identify what kind of

848
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:44,798
of um yield category or

849
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:46,480
or yield class we're dealing with and

850
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:47,599
that's one of those variables that we

851
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,919
and we added to

852
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:52,480
to the model to to predict indigenous

853
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,399
nutrient supply

854
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,480
now from all that data we're also able

855
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:59,359
to to see what kind of

856
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,038
what level variability in a nutrient

857
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:02,798
response occurs

858
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:04,720
maybe not unexpected from from the

859
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:06,480
pictures i showed in the beginning

860
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,000
some of that variation happens at a very

861
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,079
local scale

862
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,278
that's in this case the green part of

863
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:13,678
this bar

864
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:16,079
between fields from one field to another

865
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,720
a very

866
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:20,720
very small scale but also at the

867
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,919
regional level

868
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,960
i'm referring back to that to that map

869
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:29,440
of east africa where you see

870
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,558
between regions at a much larger scale

871
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,000
also an important

872
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:37,440
level of variation now if we try and

873
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,480
predict that um using soil information

874
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,360
from soil grits alone

875
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,159
we didn't do too well um there are

876
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:47,678
squares of

877
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:50,480
0.3 0.5 at most so we're not able to

878
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:53,600
really predict

879
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,079
nutrient supply and response

880
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:58,558
consequently but if we combine that with

881
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:00,158
that sort of local information

882
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:01,918
that we got from the farmer including

883
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,720
those yield categories

884
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,000
um we did substantially better and good

885
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,200
enough actually to

886
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,599
to start predicting um and going further

887
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,278
with that so we get our squares of 0.6

888
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:16,558
to 0.8

889
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:16,558
which we were very happy with

890
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,480
then the next step of course is we we

891
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,480
also need

892
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,159
the the yield ceiling so we need to know

893
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,200
what water limited yields

894
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,760
as sort of the maximum level

895
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,200
of yield that farmers can attain now for

896
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:36,480
cassava being

897
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:39,600
an annual crop an indeterminate crop

898
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,960
actually farmers plant cassava almost

899
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:45,119
at any point in the year in nigeria

900
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,640
and they will also also harvest it at

901
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:48,479
any point of the year

902
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,080
sometimes very early after eight nine

903
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,558
months sometimes they leave it in their

904
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:54,720
field for 15 to 16 months

905
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:56,480
so this has important implications also

906
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,399
for the kind of yields that farmers can

907
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,399
can get and what kind of responses to

908
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:03,038
fertilizer

909
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:04,239
so to to take that into account we used

910
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:07,200
dsat and we ran

911
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,480
over 460 million gridded runs of that

912
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,720
model

913
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,399
with rainfall data from the past 25

914
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,919
years

915
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:18,239
so that gave us data like this

916
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,640
for one pixel for example depending on

917
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,480
when farmer's plant and harvest

918
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,080
we could have a prediction of what the

919
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,120
yield would be

920
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:29,599
and also interestingly some some some

921
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:33,119
level of confidence or variation due to

922
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:34,798
rainfall which helps us to to make

923
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:37,119
predictions on

924
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:39,839
on risk and uncertainty on fertilizer

925
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:39,839
response

926
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:44,079
so then we're not done we'd still then

927
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:45,679
we have yield predictions we have

928
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:48,079
fertilizer response predictions or

929
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,000
nutrient response predictions um

930
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:51,678
but to give advice to farmers we don't

931
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,558
need to tell them how much n p

932
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,679
and k to apply to get a certain yield we

933
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:57,759
need to tell them

934
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,720
how much fertilizer to apply to get a

935
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:01,200
certain

936
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,839
net return on that investment so farmer

937
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,840
is not

938
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:04,879
necessarily interested in getting the

939
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:08,398
highest yield

940
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,878
but the highest profit so we coupled all

941
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:13,039
this then to an economic optimizer

942
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:14,480
which basically converts nutrient

943
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:17,679
responses

944
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,199
to fertilized responses instead of yield

945
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,838
to be optimized for

946
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,838
net revenue

947
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:26,719
so that allowed us to build maps like

948
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,720
this one for example

949
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,719
these are two states in nigeria and on

950
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:34,719
the left it shows

951
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:37,358
a recommendation for a urea application

952
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:38,078
and on the right hand side the kind of

953
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:41,199
yield

954
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:44,560
improvements that farmers can expect for

955
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,559
a certain yield class this is

956
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,639
so we can provide this to extension

957
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:49,918
workers and then they can use that to do

958
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,480
cost benefit analysis

959
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,480
for example

960
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,000
when we run this on a smartphone and

961
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,520
i'll talk a bit later about that

962
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,599
you can actually work with merc with the

963
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:04,079
gps capability of the smartphone to do

964
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:07,280
this at a much higher resolution

965
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,280
and it looks more like this

966
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:15,039
so then the last step in that whole

967
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,160
process after we've done all that work

968
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:18,079
we want to actually

969
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:20,639
validate that the recommendations we

970
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:24,640
come up with are

971
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:26,559
are good are profitable for farmers

972
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:28,400
so what we did is basically laying out

973
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:31,039
lots and lots of

974
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,599
very simple trials just two plots a

975
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:34,800
control

976
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,320
and our recommendation just next to each

977
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,359
other we color coded them

978
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,880
and blue and yellow in this case

979
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:42,880
and we did many of those we did over

980
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,559
5000 of those

981
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,960
and then we can look at how farmers

982
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:48,480
actually performed we see that over 75

983
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,320
percent

984
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,760
do realize a yield and a profit

985
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,720
improvement

986
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,000
and only two percent actually had a

987
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,000
negative impact

988
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,079
so with fertilizer you don't expect

989
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,800
really much negative yield

990
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,680
effects but fertilizer costs something

991
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,720
so it's not just

992
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:07,279
um yield effect but it's also getting

993
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:08,799
that

994
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,040
money back from your investment in

995
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,880
fertilizer

996
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:14,480
so that made us very happy and this is

997
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,440
another way of looking at these results

998
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,599
these are

999
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,720
cumulative probability distributions so

1000
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,200
the more the curve

1001
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:23,679
to the right and the larger the

1002
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:27,199
proportion of farmers that that had

1003
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:28,960
a positive return on their investment or

1004
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:31,199
positive yield effect in this in this

1005
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,199
case

1006
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:35,118
um so we did that during during two

1007
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,760
seasons

1008
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,320
in in both nigeria and tanzania and we

1009
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,839
were

1010
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,838
really excited about these results

1011
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,519
now we've done all that next question is

1012
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,159
then

1013
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:53,519
how do you put that actually to use in

1014
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:56,559
the hands of a farmer

1015
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:58,719
how can a farmer access that information

1016
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:01,119
and and actually do something with that

1017
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:04,639
without without us needing to

1018
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,760
to intervene directly now this this is

1019
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,279
where akilimu

1020
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,880
comes into place and this is the name

1021
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,040
that we've given to

1022
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:15,200
to our decision support system um

1023
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:16,400
it's turned out more of a platform now

1024
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:18,480
today

1025
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,039
but akilimo is actually two swahili

1026
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,159
words and pulled together it's aquili

1027
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:27,279
which means brain literally

1028
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:29,679
or smart and kilima which means

1029
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,480
agriculture

1030
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:34,879
so giving that that that whole thing

1031
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:38,960
actually a name has has also

1032
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,720
um really helped us to to to sell it

1033
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,960
and this is the slide bernard being

1034
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:45,598
referred to so this sort of

1035
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,679
embodies what wadaki limo is it's a it's

1036
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,880
a digital service to provide

1037
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:52,799
tailored agronomic advice so on the left

1038
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,720
box you see all that all that science

1039
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,039
we've done

1040
00:37:54,719 --> 00:38:00,078
all that data and all those models they

1041
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:03,199
sit on a cloud-based prediction engine

1042
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:05,039
that can run those models with input and

1043
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:06,480
provided through different interfaces

1044
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:10,079
that's the

1045
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,719
the middle box there and we built two of

1046
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,960
those

1047
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:14,319
interfaces ourselves we've built a

1048
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,079
smartphone app

1049
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,200
we've also made some simple tools that

1050
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,680
people can print that

1051
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:22,639
simplify those recommendations to to a

1052
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:26,078
two-pager that

1053
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:27,759
people can easily print and work with

1054
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,359
but in the meantime we work with several

1055
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,599
digital app companies who have

1056
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:34,799
integrated that service into their

1057
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,640
service and and some of these provide

1058
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,160
the recommendations over an interactive

1059
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:43,279
sms system

1060
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:47,358
or through a chat bot or to an ivr

1061
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:49,119
an interactive voice response system

1062
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:52,719
so that farmers can actually directly

1063
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,720
interact with our recommendations

1064
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,719
these are examples of those two pagers

1065
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:59,599
those printable for

1066
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:01,519
leaflets that basically show in a in an

1067
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,559
as visual way as possible

1068
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:05,599
and the critical elements they go hand

1069
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:09,838
in hand with

1070
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:12,480
with worksheets again two pagers

1071
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:14,639
where farmers are basically led through

1072
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,320
the basic calculations that need to be

1073
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,078
made and we've trained extension workers

1074
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,599
to help farmers complete those and

1075
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,920
they're available all

1076
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,960
in in local languages seven or eight

1077
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,639
local languages in the meantime

1078
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,400
these are some screenshots from our from

1079
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:31,598
our app that we've built

1080
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,079
the app obviously gives a much higher

1081
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:36,559
precision than the paper-based can

1082
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,920
um but the limitation there is that many

1083
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:41,119
farmers don't have

1084
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,000
smartphones and that these sort of this

1085
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,000
this sort of tool

1086
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,239
is mostly used by an extension worker

1087
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,039
who would interact with farmers

1088
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:49,598
so our reach is is let's say much more

1089
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:53,279
limited

1090
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,280
than with printable tools

1091
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,440
now coming to the end um some

1092
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,200
conclusions that that

1093
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:06,159
you know we've been um coming to

1094
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:07,759
in the last let's say one one year maybe

1095
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:11,440
a bit more

1096
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,520
we've um we've been pushing this this

1097
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,639
sort of system through

1098
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:18,000
and the the the dissemination strategies

1099
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:21,598
of our partners

1100
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,039
and today over 82 000 users are actually

1101
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,318
registered and applying our

1102
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:27,440
recommendations

1103
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:29,759
now for farmers to to actually profit

1104
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,440
or gain from those recommendations they

1105
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,480
they need to be reached first they need

1106
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,200
to understand

1107
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,280
how to use them they need to effectively

1108
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,879
use them

1109
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,119
do something with the information in

1110
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,400
their farm and then and then realize

1111
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,480
their profit

1112
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,519
so each of those steps we can we can get

1113
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,559
some feedback of

1114
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:51,759
of what is happening in their farms and

1115
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:54,880
we've done quite a bit of survey work um

1116
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:58,400
we've done some

1117
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,400
some some um

1118
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,440
choice experiments for example we've

1119
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,160
done phone interviews and sms surveys

1120
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,679
and we're

1121
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:07,440
getting a lot of interesting feedback

1122
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:10,879
and we're seeing for example

1123
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,200
that use an uptake is is very much

1124
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,318
affected by maybe the traditional

1125
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:17,199
factors age

1126
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:19,838
younger people are often more quick to

1127
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:23,118
do something with this sort of stuff

1128
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:27,358
educated farmers typically more than

1129
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:31,838
illiterate farmers as with traditional

1130
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:34,000
extension systems we often see that men

1131
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:35,279
have more access to these sort of tools

1132
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,679
than women

1133
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,119
often women don't have a phone and are

1134
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:41,759
relying on their husband for

1135
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,920
for getting a phone so it's it's not

1136
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,359
necessarily true that digital methods

1137
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,440
are as accessible to to women as to men

1138
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:51,358
wealth state is very important whether

1139
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,800
they are growing cassava for the market

1140
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:56,559
or for sustenance um the dissemination

1141
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,800
methods that are being used in the two

1142
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:03,679
format all these have have an important

1143
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:06,240
impact on on on use of our tools

1144
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:07,679
this is my last slide um very

1145
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:08,479
interesting also this is some very

1146
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:11,838
recent work

1147
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:14,079
is is when we look at behavior and and

1148
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:16,078
perceptions around our tools we've we've

1149
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,720
actually confronted farmers with

1150
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,079
40 different statements to do with the

1151
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:23,279
user friendliness

1152
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:25,039
the the the trust and

1153
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,560
confidence that our recommendations will

1154
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:29,039
improve yield

1155
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:31,039
perceptions around risk and cost and

1156
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:34,239
affordability

1157
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:36,559
market orientation um orient

1158
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:38,959
um attitude towards innovation if you

1159
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:41,279
look at all these things

1160
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,079
um what comes out very clearly is that

1161
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,240
if you

1162
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:48,240
if you use variable selection methods to

1163
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:49,919
see which sort of perceptions

1164
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:52,239
determine whether a farmer is going to

1165
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,000
make use of your recommendations or not

1166
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:55,759
what comes out in the very top is

1167
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,280
everything to do with with the user

1168
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,200
experience

1169
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,200
so if they cannot access the advice

1170
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:03,199
quickly and it's all intuitive to to use

1171
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:06,799
those tools that is going to

1172
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:08,159
determine half halfway already

1173
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,800
whether that farmer is going to do

1174
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:12,879
something with that advice or not

1175
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,480
so with all the signs we've invested you

1176
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,039
could actually argue that

1177
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,559
that as much effort would need to be

1178
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:21,119
invested in

1179
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:22,799
in making those tools as user-friendly

1180
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,000
as possible because because that

1181
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,560
determines

1182
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,559
whether all that will have any impact

1183
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,639
and then next in line

1184
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:33,519
luckily for us agronomists follows the

1185
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:36,639
perceptions around yield and revenue

1186
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:38,880
some cost and market access and maybe

1187
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:40,639
surprisingly lost in line is is you know

1188
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,480
the attitude towards innovation how

1189
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:44,480
often do they actually

1190
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,960
interact with extension services or have

1191
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,599
they made any investments in their farm

1192
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,599
in the past

1193
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,639
so like i said aquilimo we're trying to

1194
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:57,279
push it into

1195
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:59,358
turn it into more of a community where

1196
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,319
people can contribute and interact

1197
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:04,078
and turn it into a learning platform

1198
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:06,000
making it available to the excellence in

1199
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,880
agronomy and transforming it into

1200
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,079
something

1201
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,358
that can grow and inspire a lot of the

1202
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:14,480
work that will happen through

1203
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:17,039
through actions and agronomy

1204
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,079
um i need to acknowledge all the

1205
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:20,159
organizations

1206
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,680
that have that have worked and all the

1207
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:23,519
people in these organizations and they

1208
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:26,318
are they are really many

1209
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:27,679
um i can't possibly name all of them you

1210
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:29,279
can see from the logos that

1211
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:32,879
there are really a lot of organizations

1212
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:35,920
but many not mentioned here as well

1213
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,119
and with that i'll stop here thank you

1214
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,720
for listening i'm

1215
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,720
happy to answer a couple of questions

1216
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:45,440
thank you so much peter thank you

1217
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:48,159
bernard um we have a couple

1218
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,599
minutes for questions so i'm going to

1219
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:51,358
open the floor

1220
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:54,079
are there are there questions for for

1221
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:56,559
peter bernard

1222
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:58,000
yeah i have a question here louis

1223
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:01,440
speaking

1224
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,480
please go ahead away yes so i was

1225
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:07,519
wondering if you have experience with

1226
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,119
accessing farmers data such as

1227
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:11,838
[Music]

1228
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,640
like the planting date or how much did

1229
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:15,679
they apply

1230
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:17,679
and how much did they actually harvested

1231
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:19,118
is there a way for you to access that

1232
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:24,078
data via maybe smart

1233
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:24,079
phones or such technologies

1234
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,539
on on planting and harvest schedules we

1235
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,440
have quite a bit of information

1236
00:45:29,539 --> 00:45:33,519
[Music]

1237
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,358
well in the research process we gathered

1238
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:36,639
that through surveys but now that people

1239
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:38,799
are using our tools

1240
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:40,799
and we actually get that information as

1241
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,359
part of the input to the recommendations

1242
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,920
so we

1243
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:45,759
we ask farmers when they plant and when

1244
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,358
they intend to harvest to be able to

1245
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,400
calculate

1246
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:53,279
um a sort of expected yield for that for

1247
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,000
that planting and harvesting schedule

1248
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,200
getting yield data is is actually a very

1249
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,559
tricky thing it's it's

1250
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:02,078
um it's not easy and definitely not for

1251
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:05,199
a crop like cassava which is

1252
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,720
which is a root crop where often what

1253
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:08,559
you see above ground

1254
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:10,959
not necessarily says much about what

1255
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:12,880
you'll find below ground

1256
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,000
um we've we've experimented with a

1257
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,920
couple of methods to

1258
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,318
[Music]

1259
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,680
to combine quick above ground

1260
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:23,199
measurements with

1261
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:27,679
with minimal uprooting and sampling of

1262
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:30,159
well crop cuts and sampling plants

1263
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:31,279
with modest success i would i would say

1264
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:33,440
but yeah

1265
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,560
getting yield data in in smallholder

1266
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,960
farms fields

1267
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:37,838
in a in a quick and sufficiently

1268
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,920
accurate way

1269
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:43,759
is is i think still quite a challenge

1270
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:46,639
andy thanks

1271
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,720
please go ahead david yeah uh when i saw

1272
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:49,118
the tool it looked very nice you gave

1273
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:51,199
them

1274
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:54,720
one statement about what they could

1275
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:56,799
expect to see but you have behind that

1276
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,318
a lot of simulations so couldn't you

1277
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,720
give them a

1278
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:02,559
an uncertainty estimate on that also to

1279
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:05,118
say well this is what we think you

1280
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:05,838
will get if you do this recommendation

1281
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,318
but

1282
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:10,318
uh we this is kind of the range and

1283
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:13,440
would that then allow them

1284
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:15,119
to make a kind of a risk-based decision

1285
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:19,599
for themselves

1286
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:23,838
and that's a good question we we um

1287
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:26,079
we we've tried several ways of actually

1288
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:28,558
visualizing or explaining risk to

1289
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,720
to small holders and that's not easy to

1290
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,720
do

1291
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:35,439
very often when you when you confront

1292
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,559
them with ranges

1293
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,240
they tend to forget the lower end and go

1294
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:42,160
for the upper end and get very

1295
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:46,399
optimistic

1296
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:49,519
so what we've actually done is is

1297
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:52,160
asked them how often they they

1298
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:54,000
invest in in technologies and then

1299
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:56,960
assume that farmers who often

1300
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,760
invest in technologies are more the um

1301
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,000
risk-loving

1302
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,920
type of farmer and and then what we do

1303
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,119
is we actually set our threshold for

1304
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,159
profitability

1305
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,960
lower for those farmers than for farmers

1306
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:08,879
who

1307
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,400
who never invest and who can't afford

1308
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,880
the um

1309
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:15,599
losing money so that's very clever

1310
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,599
thanks yeah

1311
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,680
there are more questions from the floor

1312
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,760
yeah i have a question hi

1313
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:23,039
this is johannes hi bernard good to see

1314
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,599
you um

1315
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,880
nice to meet you peter and uh thanks for

1316
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,200
coming

1317
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,960
um even if it's not the traditional way

1318
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:33,519
um i was wondering

1319
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,280
you obviously you spent a lot of time

1320
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:37,920
and and it's looks superb

1321
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,400
uh your interface to the farmers and and

1322
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,960
and

1323
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,240
populations in rural communities um

1324
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,920
where you employ

1325
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:47,519
really nifty uh tools um

1326
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,119
how does that look on the on the

1327
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:51,280
upstream side um

1328
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,160
bernard you mentioned uh your your

1329
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,960
design

1330
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:56,639
and in reaching out more in a more

1331
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,519
organized fashion to the

1332
00:48:56,639 --> 00:49:00,318
academic research community um but you

1333
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:04,159
spend a lot of

1334
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:07,039
a lot less time in in in

1335
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:08,239
employing these kind of next generation

1336
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:11,119
tools to

1337
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:12,078
to pull in uh knowledge and expertise

1338
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,720
and skills

1339
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:16,000
from upstream as you do downstream is is

1340
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:18,719
there something that you can learn

1341
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,199
from the downstream side to to engage

1342
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:22,239
both

1343
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:25,519
in in a more rapid iteration with

1344
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:27,919
innovation but also the longevity of

1345
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:29,039
um building strategic partnership i

1346
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,639
think i think there's

1347
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:32,880
both of those and they're not they're

1348
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:33,838
not going hand in hand necessarily i was

1349
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,720
wondering about that

1350
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:38,960
what years about your strategic maybe

1351
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:42,959
maybe one

1352
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:45,358
maybe one comment you honest you know

1353
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,440
this this whole initiative is new and

1354
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:49,519
i've tried to

1355
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,720
what peter has been showing is one

1356
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:52,880
project

1357
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:54,000
that started in 2016 but the bigger

1358
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,599
picture i've tried

1359
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,519
the boring part of the seminar you know

1360
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:01,119
that's the new initiative that's being

1361
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:04,400
constructed since

1362
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,280
maybe one year now so one we recognize

1363
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,440
the need for

1364
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,319
innovation we recognize the need for

1365
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,119
linking with

1366
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:12,159
institutes like cornell but we want that

1367
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:15,440
innovation box

1368
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:17,199
also to be demanded uh to a certain

1369
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,800
extent we don't want to do the things we

1370
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:20,799
would love to do we want to do the

1371
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:24,079
things we should do

1372
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,440
in response to needs and so on so that

1373
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,280
probably will be a little bit

1374
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,280
opportunistic because you also need to

1375
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,519
explore new avenues and agronomy at

1376
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,480
scale and we will do that

1377
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:36,318
but we want to use the fields the sort

1378
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,880
of things that peter has been showing i

1379
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:41,279
think he referred to a few

1380
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,960
items which were difficult or hard or

1381
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,960
not satisfying

1382
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,280
i think these are very good entry points

1383
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,358
into innovation r d that we want to

1384
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,519
invest in to exactly

1385
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:53,679
increase the efficiency of our agronomy

1386
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:57,119
workflows and so on so

1387
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:59,279
absolutely um we are

1388
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,480
if all goes well and this and if with

1389
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,839
the capital

1390
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:08,079
if all goes well then we'll probably

1391
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:10,880
um start working on a much more defined

1392
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:13,599
initiative probably you know from

1393
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:16,318
quarter two next year

1394
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:17,119
with an end line of quarter four next

1395
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:19,519
year

1396
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,440
so there will be an intensive period of

1397
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:22,880
reflecting on the sort of question you

1398
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,318
just asked

1399
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,920
but many other questions and

1400
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:29,440
i think that would be the good time to

1401
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,639
touch base again

1402
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,639
johannes yeah

1403
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:40,000
thanks

1404
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:41,519
andy can i ask a question this is janice

1405
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,838
janice and then harold please go ahead

1406
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:46,559
james okay terrific um

1407
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:47,759
i'm interested in knowing the role of

1408
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,920
soil analysis

1409
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,720
underpinning all of this i mean how much

1410
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:55,599
of that is done or do you really rely on

1411
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:56,239
historical yields to predict what's

1412
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:57,680
needed

1413
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:59,358
and i guess my question is really

1414
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:02,239
leading to whether

1415
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:04,318
the soil dock system is involved here

1416
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:07,679
whether that's part of this program

1417
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:07,679
or not thanks

1418
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:12,159
will you try peter i can comment on yeah

1419
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:15,280
go ahead peter go ahead

1420
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:17,598
go ahead yeah it's it's not

1421
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,280
though at some point we we have some

1422
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:22,640
some discussions with

1423
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,200
um with patrick and we wanted to try out

1424
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:25,759
whether

1425
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:27,759
whether having the soil doc data as as

1426
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,880
additional covariates in our prediction

1427
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:33,280
model

1428
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:35,920
um would improve improve our predictions

1429
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,119
um like i showed we we currently rely on

1430
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,400
the soil grid

1431
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:42,160
data alongside with with local

1432
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,639
information that the farmer provides

1433
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:47,118
himself

1434
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:50,480
herself um and

1435
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:52,400
we don't include actual measured soil

1436
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,358
data at this point because most farmers

1437
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,358
would not have

1438
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:56,719
such data obviously for their for their

1439
00:52:55,358 --> 00:53:01,838
farms

1440
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:01,838
um right but it's i think

1441
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,519
i think the key point peter is that if

1442
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:10,480
you use all those geospatial

1443
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:11,838
information layers that are available

1444
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,960
everything you know even

1445
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:17,599
soil grids anything and you predict what

1446
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:21,199
inherent nutrient capacity would be

1447
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:24,240
you don't get very far but if you add

1448
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:27,439
one measure of local quality

1449
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:28,879
to that you get very well to 0.7.8 with

1450
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,838
point seven point eight you can do

1451
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,640
business

1452
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:34,558
with point three you cannot and that

1453
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:36,318
local what we've seen or what peter has

1454
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:39,040
shown is that you don't necessarily need

1455
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:42,000
to analyze yourself just a pictorial

1456
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:42,480
appreciation of yield is good enough

1457
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,400
okay

1458
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,480
you can imagine the cost and time and

1459
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,760
effort you know to let people look at

1460
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,599
the picture or

1461
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,720
take a sample and analyze it i mean it's

1462
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:55,440
a totally different absolutely

1463
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:57,039
great thanks will that stand everywhere

1464
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,679
all the time for all groups

1465
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:02,239
i don't know but it's nice to see it for

1466
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:02,239
cassava

1467
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,680
very good thank you thanks janice harold

1468
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:09,439
you had a question

1469
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:12,159
yeah um well first of all thanks

1470
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:15,200
gentlemen for outstanding presentation

1471
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:18,159
beautiful slides and uh very informative

1472
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:19,759
um just uh kind of following up on

1473
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:21,759
janice's question

1474
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,440
so you're you're looking at you know

1475
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,559
some of the basic soil

1476
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:28,559
properties and soil grids and and and

1477
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,240
nutrient contents and then you're

1478
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,559
also looking at you know a yield

1479
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:34,639
potential and and so to some extent

1480
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,559
you're dancing around the concept of

1481
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:40,719
soil health

1482
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:43,920
and um and your approach is is fantastic

1483
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:45,598
and uh so in a way it takes maybe this

1484
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,680
is the sort of the general

1485
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:49,838
quality or health of your soil and this

1486
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:51,279
is then what you need to do these are

1487
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:53,039
our recommendations

1488
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,720
but i was just wondering you could also

1489
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:57,838
sort of turn it around a little bit

1490
00:54:54,719 --> 00:55:00,719
and say you know you can

1491
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:01,838
improve the productivity or the health

1492
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:04,719
of your soil

1493
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:06,239
whichever way you express that if you do

1494
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:09,759
this or that so you can make

1495
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:12,239
your soil more like this other soil

1496
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,359
and thereby enhance the productivity of

1497
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:15,439
that soil

1498
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:16,400
and and so i was wondering whether in

1499
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:20,720
your

1500
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:23,519
communications through through this app

1501
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:24,798
you may have an opportunity to to sort

1502
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:28,480
of bring that

1503
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:30,079
concept also into um

1504
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,358
into the communications that you have

1505
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:32,000
with the farmers because you know

1506
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:34,000
obviously

1507
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,760
you're mostly focused on mineral

1508
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
fertilizers which is fine that's

1509
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,200
you know that's typically the first step

1510
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,559
um but i just

1511
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:42,639
was wondering whether you've thought

1512
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:45,839
about taking that

1513
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:47,838
to a different level by by bringing in

1514
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:48,719
concepts around soil health and how you

1515
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:51,279
can

1516
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:53,279
help these farmers sort of achieve

1517
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:57,040
higher yield potentials

1518
00:55:53,280 --> 00:56:00,559
by enhancing the quality of their soils

1519
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:01,039
yeah um yeah it's a very good question

1520
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:03,040
and maybe

1521
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:04,880
maybe the impression from my slides is

1522
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:05,679
indeed that we heavily focus on on

1523
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,720
fertilizer

1524
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:11,838
though this is just one use case and

1525
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:14,879
um in many of our tools we

1526
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:17,119
we actually emphasize the importance of

1527
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,559
for a farmer to to know the productivity

1528
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:21,119
of his field

1529
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:22,880
um we often visualize also that you

1530
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:24,640
could look at a field from being very

1531
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,519
poor to very fertile and if it's very

1532
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:27,199
poor

1533
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:29,119
you need to think about improving that

1534
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:30,960
soil by we actually having

1535
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:34,240
no our tools you know promoting the use

1536
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:37,358
of manure or compost or

1537
00:56:34,239 --> 00:56:39,679
crop residues and recycling those um

1538
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:41,440
and and also emphasizing these for for

1539
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:44,000
long-term productivity that

1540
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:46,000
you need to maintain your soil you need

1541
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,079
to avoid erosion

1542
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,280
so all those things they definitely come

1543
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:52,400
along

1544
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:54,798
um with with the advice um

1545
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,440
but the incentive for a farmer to to

1546
00:56:54,798 --> 00:56:57,759
invest

1547
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,880
will always be the short-term profit

1548
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,280
that he can realize

1549
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,760
from from an investment in in tillage or

1550
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:07,519
fertilizer or a new

1551
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,559
a new variety just alongside with that

1552
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:10,960
you you really need to

1553
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:12,000
to provide also the advice of of how to

1554
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,679
ensure long-term

1555
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,280
productivity i very much agree with that

1556
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:19,440
i'm not sure if i answered your question

1557
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:22,480
though

1558
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,720
harold is that uh you have a phone yeah

1559
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:27,679
i

1560
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:30,879
i i don't wanna just

1561
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:33,279
um but you know it's a consideration to

1562
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,160
to think because i think you have a very

1563
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,798
rich

1564
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:38,838
um set of a very rich data set that i

1565
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:42,400
think you could employ

1566
00:57:38,838 --> 00:57:45,440
probably effectively in terms of

1567
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,960
of you know maybe helping farmers

1568
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:50,318
understand

1569
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:53,440
you know how soil productivity

1570
00:57:50,318 --> 00:57:56,639
um can be enhanced not not only by

1571
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:59,920
applying mineral fertilizers but um

1572
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:02,639
by other you know you know

1573
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,079
physical biological sort of uh

1574
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:07,118
approaches

1575
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:10,160
um and in a way you have

1576
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:11,519
you have so much data at hand that um i

1577
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:12,879
think with some creative thinking you

1578
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:15,119
could really enhance that

1579
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,960
i think it's just a an opportunity that

1580
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:18,880
i just sort of wanted to point out

1581
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,559
and i don't really have really good

1582
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,880
answers but i i i think there's

1583
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:26,400
something there that could be pursued

1584
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:28,400
no i think harold the main entry point

1585
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,318
towards improved soil held the sphere

1586
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:34,160
the organic resource

1587
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:37,440
pathway um that's that's one of the most

1588
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:39,118
viable you know entry points

1589
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,039
and we all know in a lot of those

1590
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:44,240
systems the most limiting

1591
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:46,079
resource is organic matter so how do you

1592
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:47,919
increase the availability of organic

1593
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:49,359
matter if you don't have fallow systems

1594
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:53,280
anymore and i think

1595
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:55,440
you know we've always seen that somehow

1596
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,559
passing through chrome residues is a

1597
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,480
good way forward

1598
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:00,079
and we know that to produce crop

1599
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:02,079
resistance you need your nutrients and

1600
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:04,960
so on and so on

1601
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:07,119
um of course in fellow systems which do

1602
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,880
still exist in large parts of

1603
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:11,039
africa the situation is of course

1604
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,680
different and there you have

1605
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:14,239
you have those resources available so

1606
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:16,879
it's it's

1607
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:19,358
it's a mix of you know knowledge and

1608
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:21,599
availability of resources that will

1609
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:24,798
drive what what are your entry points

1610
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,798
towards better yields

1611
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:31,598
yeah anyway just adding on

1612
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:33,519
this will be a rich subject for when you

1613
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,880
guys uh this is something we should

1614
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:39,519
discuss when we are live

1615
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:39,519
in cornell you know and you know and

1616
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,000
absolutely september september next year

1617
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:48,000
yes

1618
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:50,079
i'll be vaccinated okay

1619
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,838

some of these

1627
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,798
new projects mature and and uh affording

1628
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:08,399
of course
