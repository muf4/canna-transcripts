1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
it's very important to repair bare spots

2
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:06,809
in the lawn before weeds have a chance

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,730
to invade the process is simple the

4
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:11,279
first thing you need to do is prepare

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,769
the soil get rid of existing vegetation

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:16,108
if there are any weeds there and the

7
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,690
deeper you can work the soil the easier

8
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,880
it's going to be for the grass roots to

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,650
penetrate and it'll help help the plants

10
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,739
withstand all kinds of stresses like

11
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:29,608
like drought and heat so you're going to

12
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:33,539
want to fill in with some kind of a soil

13
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:35,730
I've just chosen a top soil that I

14
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:40,649
picked up at the garden center and I've

15
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:42,898
also included some compost compost is a

16
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,450
good way to help improve the physical

17
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,670
properties of the soil can help retain

18
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,350
moisture and nutrients so if you've got

19
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,020
a compost pile at home that you want to

20
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,239
use that's a that's a good way to amend

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,730
the soil the seed I've chosen is

22
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:59,608
perennial ryegrass we're in full Sun and

23
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:01,529
it also has a characteristic of quick

24
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,000
germination which is something that

25
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,659
you're looking for when you're trying to

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,909
fill in a bare area so for a small area

27
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,580
like this I am just going to mix the

28
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:15,750
grass seed right with the soil and I'm

29
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:24,959
using a three-to-one ratio of the soil

30
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:27,799
mix to seed one two three and then one

31
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,798
more of the seed

32
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:46,400
you wanna firm the soil because when you

33
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:49,070
have good feed to soil contact it allows

34
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:53,120
the seed to extract moisture from the

35
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:55,279
soil and simply by firming the area like

36
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,100
this you can reduce the establishment

37
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,980
time by by up to a couple of weeks so

38
00:01:58,099 --> 00:02:03,739
it's really important and then the final

39
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:06,109
step is to keep the area watered you

40
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:08,379
don't want it sopping wet just keep it

41
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:08,379
moist

42
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:12,680
you don't want the seed or the seedlings

43
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,810
to dry out once they've dried out

44
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,700
they're done so once you've got good

45
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:20,120
germination you can back off on the

46
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:22,899
water that that will encourage the roots

47
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,900
to go deeper
