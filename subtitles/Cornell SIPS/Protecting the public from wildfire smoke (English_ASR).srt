1
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,920
Howdy. Thanks so much for having me and

2
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,000
for being here. Uh my name is Alistair

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,359
Hayden. I'm currently an assistant

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,198
professor of practice at Cornell

5
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,560
University and before this I was a

6
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,118
division chief in the California

7
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:29,198
Governor's Office of Emergency Services.

8
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:32,840
So, here to talk a little bit about some

9
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:36,000
uh more disaster flavored uh OneHealth

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,320
uh items. And so, it's going to be about

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,480
uh wildfire smoke and how we can uh

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,960
protect ourselves in our communities.

13
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,479
And, uh just a quick shout out, I'm love

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,239
working with our extension colleagues.

15
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,000
And I'll highlight Adam Hughes, the last

16
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:49,279
name on the list here, uh is one of our

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,600
extension colleagues who we've been

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,920
doing a lot of uh work on wildfire smoke

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,760
with. and we are here to support um if

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,960
you have any questions or uh want to

21
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:00,320
talk through wildfire smoke or

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,759
disasters. So, you've been staring at

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,519
this uh picture here and you probably

24
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,000
have a guess what it is, but in case

25
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,920
not, uh I'll just start labeling things

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,799
here. We've got clouds. We've got some

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,159
wildfire smoke plumes up there in

28
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:15,920
Canada. And then, of course, uh we've

29
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,400
got a smoke plume covering New York

30
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,519
State and the region here. And so, this

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:25,200
is a satellite image on June 6th, 2023.

32
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:27,118
So, the first really really smoky day of

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,519
that uh smoke wave we experienced a

34
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,799
couple years

35
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:33,679
ago. Wildfires are kind of a

36
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,079
quintessential onehealth issue. Uh so

37
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,400
they burn through vegetation and then of

38
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,399
course anything else that's in their

39
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,640
path. But healthy ecosystems actually

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,880
usually need some amount of fire. Uh and

41
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,439
that's most famously true out west in

42
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:50,399
the California ecosystems. But there are

43
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:52,959
uh ecosystems in our biomes out here. Uh

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,879
the pine barons ecosystem is the most

45
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:58,158
famous one that needs lots of um

46
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:59,839
wildfire uh both here in New York and

47
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,079
New Jersey, but even some of the

48
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,920
hardwood ecosystems do need uh fire just

49
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:10,478
way way less

50
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,479
frequently. Uh we are in an era where

51
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,920
wildfires are really exploding. And so

52
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:18,639
this is a figure from a uh a recent

53
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,359
publication that kind of shows uh the

54
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,919
change. Uh so the y- axis is the amount

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,680
of uh it's it's a schematic. This is not

56
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:29,039
actual data but it represents actual

57
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,200
data. So the y- axis is showing the um

58
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,519
the average acres burned each year and

59
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,759
then the x-axis is showing us time over

60
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,200
the last several hundred years. And you

61
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:42,159
can see that in the present uh there is

62
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:44,159
starting to be an uptick in the acreage

63
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,079
burned by wildfires. And this is because

64
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,159
our ecosystems are getting out of

65
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,640
balance. They're not uh they're no

66
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:53,039
longer healthy. And so one reason for

67
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,958
this is climate change. And I see a

68
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,519
bunch of comments in the chat. Okay,

69
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,598
that's uh not things I need to answer.

70
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,640
Sorry about that. Uh so climate change

71
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,560
is one of the reasons but uh there's

72
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,359
several other reasons that are commonly

73
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,439
referenced uh by folks who study this.

74
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,760
So we have more people moving into

75
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:15,680
high-risisk areas. So uh about 80% of

76
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,518
wildfires in the US are actually started

77
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,640
by humans. Uh sometimes that's

78
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,319
intentional, but most usually that's uh

79
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,639
unintentional. Can be something as

80
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:27,280
simple as parking a hot car on dry

81
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:30,000
grass. uh wildfires start for all sorts

82
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,000
of reasons. Um and then a really big one

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,598
that's shown on this graph is fire

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,799
suppression policies. So actually our

85
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:39,359
our policies since the late 1800s have

86
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,680
been to put out wildfires and again

87
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,760
ecosystems need those wildfires and so

88
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,920
by suppressing them we are causing the

89
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,719
ecosystems to be unhealthy and then that

90
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:51,759
is leading to this uh increase that now

91
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:55,199
we're seeing in the uh frequency and

92
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:57,519
intensity of fires. So again, this is a

93
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,598
a classic one health uh issue because

94
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,120
there's a feedback between human and

95
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:04,518
ecosystem health and just want to say

96
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,878
the future will be

97
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,000
smokier. So this is why we want to talk

98
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:11,438
about wildfires as a public health

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,878
emergency. Uh so as you probably have

100
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:16,238
personally experienced, uh I assume most

101
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,000
people at this point have lived through

102
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,159
a smoke plume regardless of where it is

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,600
that you live. Uh you might have

104
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,360
experienced some of these annoying

105
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,080
irritating symptoms that are associated

106
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,800
with wildfire smoke. Uh but wildfire

107
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:32,079
smoke can actually exacerbate uh more

108
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,840
serious health conditions. So um asthma

109
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,719
uh can be associated with cardiovascular

110
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,560
disease and infectious diseases as well.

111
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,040
And we see increases in emergency room

112
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,000
visits and actually mortality. And this

113
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,520
is not uh or this is during wildfire

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,600
smoke waves. So, there's additional

115
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,359
health impacts in the long term uh that

116
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,040
are still only just being studied, but

117
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,280
these health impacts are all things that

118
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,280
can happen while the smoke is still in

119
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,799
the

120
00:04:54,279 --> 00:05:00,319
air. So, what I really want to focus on

121
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,960
today is how to uh because you all work

122
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,560
with communities, um your frontline

123
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,560
workers, important for getting

124
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,000
information to your local communities. I

125
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,639
want to share with you what I understand

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,959
to be some of the best practices uh for

127
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,759
protecting from wildfire smoke in case

128
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,439
you get a a question about this. So, it

129
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,280
basically boils down to three things.

130
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,879
Getting good data and then knowing how

131
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:24,319
to protect yourself and protect your

132
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:26,560
community. So, the best way to get data

133
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:29,560
and the only way we recommend uh is

134
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,079
through this wonderful website

135
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,319
fire.now.gov. And this basically shows

136
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,639
air quality for the whole United States.

137
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,719
And it's got a uh some extra data that

138
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,400
makes it most useful for uh tracking

139
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,440
wildfire smoke plumes. And they keep

140
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:48,560
changing the formatting. Uh and it is a

141
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:50,120
federal data site. So we'll see how long

142
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,519
uh it remains

143
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,720
active. Um but to get all the data, what

144
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:59,279
I recommend you do is click the uh gear

145
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,440
in the upper right corner, and that'll

146
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,119
let you turn on some additional data

147
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,519
layers that are currently hidden by

148
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,519
default. And so I usually just go in and

149
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,879
turn everything on because uh I'm a big

150
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:13,519
old nerd and I want to see all the

151
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:15,439
data. So this is uh what it looks like.

152
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:18,000
Uh the last one I was showing was a less

153
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,959
smoky day. This is a um a smokier day

154
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,600
and I'm showing New York State

155
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:26,959
here. The big circles are official EPA

156
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:30,560
monitors. So, these are uh really

157
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:33,198
serious air quality monitoring stations

158
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,879
that are established by the federal EPA

159
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,000
as well as its state, local, and tribal

160
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:40,000
partners. And these are actually

161
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,759
defining your official air quality for

162
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,680
your region. And so, you can see across

163
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,160
New York State, there's only something

164
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,439
like 15 of those big um official

165
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,120
monitors. So, then we have the smaller

166
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,120
dots, and this is why I like turning on

167
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,280
all the layers. Uh these are independent

168
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,280
sensors. uh kind of community science.

169
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,679
So these are things that uh anyone can

170
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,519
go out and purchase and I'll talk a

171
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,560
little bit more about them in a second.

172
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:06,399
Uh they're lower quality data than the

173
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,879
uh official ones but they can be very

174
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:11,079
helpful for figuring out for example

175
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:15,199
where the edges of a smoke plume

176
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:17,120
are. And then uh the gray areas are

177
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,560
smoke plumes and these are observed by

178
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,560
satellites. And it's a little hard to

179
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,038
see here because this picture is all in

180
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,720
a smoke plume. So I'll just back up one.

181
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,279
And on this map, you can see that

182
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,680
there's a um a gray smoke plume covering

183
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:32,399
part of the United States. Um and the

184
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,720
smoke plumes, it's not necessarily smoke

185
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,318
at ground level. It could be a mile

186
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,680
above you. So, just because there's a

187
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,560
plume overhead doesn't mean you're

188
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,800
breathing the smoke.

189
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,000
So about these commercial sensors, we

190
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,598
worked with our um state uh cooperative

191
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,478
extension here uh local health

192
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,439
departments and one tribal nation to

193
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:53,918
distribute some of these commercial

194
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:56,800
sensors to some of the rural areas that

195
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:59,120
were further from established sites. So

196
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,879
we're working on uh promoting health

197
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,759
statewide and we noticed that there were

198
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,680
gaps uh especially in the rural areas uh

199
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,280
which is what this ugly yellow shading

200
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,199
is. I really need a better figure for

201
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:13,598
this. uh but we uh provided sensors to

202
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,560
our partners and then also some training

203
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:19,360
and assistance on installation and using

204
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,038
the data. And in case you're interested

205
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,038
in these, uh the ones we used were

206
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:26,959
purple layer sensors which are about

207
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:30,000
$300. Uh we got a grant to fund this. Um

208
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:32,240
and the reason we chose them was because

209
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,479
these sensors once you set them up can

210
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,360
actually send data to that official

211
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,719
federal website. And so these uh small

212
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,200
dots that you're seeing on the official

213
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:45,200
federal website are data from these

214
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:48,120
community established uh sensor stations

215
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,040
and uh they're working on getting more

216
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,440
companies air quality monitors uh able

217
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,719
to feed into that. So not trying to just

218
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,320
promote one company here. That's just

219
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,560
the one that I have familiarity with.

220
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,640
And I saw recently that uh there's

221
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,958
another company called Clarity who now

222
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:05,439
uh their sites their sensors also feed

223
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:08,479
to the site.

224
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,920
All right, I want to really focus on

225
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,680
different data sources for this um for

226
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,439
making decisions about air quality

227
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,120
because this is one of the primary

228
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,360
questions that we get during a smoke

229
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,799
wave. Uh there are so many sources of

230
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,039
data out there and they can say

231
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:27,000
conflicting things and lead to a lot of

232
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:30,399
confusion. So uh the

233
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,240
only the only official air quality data

234
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,839
comes from airnow.gov

235
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,120
And if you go there, you'll see a little

236
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,880
dial like this. And this is again a

237
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,200
federal website and it's pulling the

238
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:44,240
data from those official federal uh

239
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:48,560
monitors. And it's showing a couple

240
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,639
things here. So the first is uh I'll

241
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:55,599
first I'll point to is at the bottom. So

242
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:57,120
today's AQI is a 24hour average AQI.

243
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,000
And it's important to note that this is

244
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,240
a 24-hour average because that doesn't

245
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,600
necessarily let you know what is going

246
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,080
on right now. So, for example, uh there

247
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,240
could be really really bad air quality

248
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,560
while you're asleep and then you wake up

249
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,200
and then the air is fine. And so then

250
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,799
that average over the 24 hours could

251
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,399
look really really bad, but your

252
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,879
experience was actually while I was

253
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,839
outside uh walking the dog, everything

254
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:28,320
was fine. So when we're looking at

255
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:30,320
24-hour average AQI, uh what we are

256
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,519
recommending uh for decision- making

257
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,278
based on that is especially decisions

258
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,600
that are that might occur over the

259
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:39,600
course of a day. So you can see they've

260
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,920
got tomorrow's forecast. And so if

261
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,278
you're thinking about should I change or

262
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:47,360
modify my summer camp or activities for

263
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:50,879
um my outdoor activities for tomorrow,

264
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,480
the 24-hour AQI is good. Uh, so again,

265
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:53,919
this is great. It's official

266
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,320
high-quality data, but it doesn't

267
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,078
reflect what's going on right now. So,

268
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,879
the other thing you'll see on this dial

269
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,879
is what they're calling the Nowcast AQI.

270
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:06,320
And that's the dial part of this, the

271
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,600
the good. And that is really to give you

272
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,320
more information about what your air

273
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,680
quality is right now. And so, that's if

274
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,240
you're asking questions about like,

275
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:16,879
should I go walk the dog right now? uh

276
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,799
that is uh that is the data that you

277
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,799
should be using and that's less

278
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:23,439
appropriate for the decisions about

279
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:27,278
tomorrow. So again um good for right

280
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,440
now. But then both of these are good

281
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,600
because they're official data but they

282
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,519
come from monitors that might not be

283
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,320
that close to your location especially

284
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,720
if you're in a rural area. And so the

285
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,000
other place to get data from are these

286
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,720
commercial sensors which uh you can view

287
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,639
through that map. Um or if you get these

288
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,920
sensors, usually they come with their

289
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,759
own um data readout. And so these are

290
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,479
great for checking local air quality

291
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:57,759
trends. So you can for example yourself

292
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,600
observe, oh it was uh really bad an hour

293
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,679
ago, but it seems to be getting better.

294
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,440
So maybe right now is when I should pop

295
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,879
out um and take the dog for a walk. But

296
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,320
one thing I really want to warn against

297
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:12,799
with these commercial sensors is uh they

298
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,120
are less accurate and so the numbers

299
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,958
that you that they actually report out

300
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,159
especially during a smoke wave can be

301
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:23,679
off by a a huge factor like a factor of

302
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:25,278
five or so. And so you might observe

303
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,719
that your readout is going to say

304
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,879
something different than the official

305
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,399
data. And usually that's because your

306
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:34,799
your sensor is uh just doesn't have the

307
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,200
same level of accuracy, especially in

308
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,519
really bad air quality as uh the

309
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,839
official data. So I only recommend those

310
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,600
for trends. The really decision good

311
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,320
decision-m should come from the official

312
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,200
data sources.

313
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,800
And uh just to put a uh connect this

314
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,879
back to the fire and smoke map. I'm

315
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:55,120
sorry, it's small on the right here, but

316
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,439
the Nowcast AQI is going to show up as

317
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,959
the big dots on the fire and smoke map

318
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,040
and the commercial sensors are going to

319
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,679
show up as the small dots on that fire

320
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:05,679
and smoke

321
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:09,278
map. All right, so once you have the

322
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:11,439
data about your air quality, uh the next

323
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:14,720
question is what do you actually do? So,

324
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,399
we recommend uh using air cleaners and

325
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,240
we know they're they're very expensive

326
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,399
and can be hard sometimes hard to find

327
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,039
or purchase. And so, one thing that I

328
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,600
recommend and that I do um I do this

329
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,039
personally is you can make a very like

330
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,680
it's very easy to make, doesn't require

331
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:33,439
any skills, you basically just duct tape

332
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:35,759
a uh furnace filter to a box fan. And

333
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,480
so, you can build this uh air cleaner

334
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,480
for something like 40 bucks. Uh and then

335
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,920
you replace the air filters as needed.

336
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,959
But it's uh they're really effective,

337
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:46,479
they're really safe, they've been

338
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:48,479
tested, uh they work well. Uh so that's

339
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,839
for yourself and your family and an

340
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,879
indoor space. And then it's also really

341
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,600
important to look out for your

342
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,120
community. And so this is also uh air

343
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,800
quality can be communicated through

344
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,198
these um colored flag systems. And these

345
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:07,120
are basically the same colors as used in

346
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:11,159
that AQI. Um, but it's to communicate

347
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,039
what to do uh with your outdoor

348
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:14,958
activities. And when you're making

349
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,719
decisions about these, it's important to

350
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:20,319
remember that people might not have

351
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,759
access to clean air at home. Uh, so we

352
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,519
get a lot of questions about should we

353
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:27,120
cancel school? Should we cancel this

354
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:29,120
activity? Uh and you know the

355
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,078
recommendation is you know actually in

356
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,440
some cases the facility that you have

357
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:36,638
might actually be able to provide

358
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,639
cleaner air for your occupants than uh

359
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,759
people's home locations if they even do

360
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,120
have a um indoor home location. Uh so

361
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:44,480
it's important to think about all

362
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,879
members of your community when you're

363
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,600
making these decisions. And we have a

364
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:51,838
lot more information about this uh on a

365
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,519
a website that we put together with uh

366
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,639
some of the questions that we get

367
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,879
frequently asked during wildfire smoke

368
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:00,799
weights. So with that, uh thank you so

369
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:02,720
much for all your work. Uh thank you for

370
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:05,359
your attention and showing up here. And

371
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,600
there's my email in the chat if you uh

372
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,120
want to reach out to ask anything about

373
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,360
this. So, I guess yeah, when the smoke

374
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,039
wave hits, feel free to uh feel free to

375
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,879
forget about me until then, but send us

376
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,000
an email if you have questions when the

377
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,360
next smoke wave happens. Thank you so

378
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,399
much and happy to field questions now,

379
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,240
too.

380
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:26,639
Alistair on the thinking on the other

381
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,120
end of the spectrum as somebody who's

382
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,079
thinking about how to help us when we

383
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,320
have a smoke

384
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:36,000
event. You're obviously you must be also

385
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,560
talking with people who are thinking

386
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,480
about how to manage force to mitigate

387
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:44,319
the production of the smoke. Do you have

388
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:47,278
like your top three either colleagues

389
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,639
that you like or mitigation strategies

390
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:52,039
for forest management to reduce

391
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,639
uh

392
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:56,278
fire hazards?

393
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,639
Yeah. So

394
00:15:56,278 --> 00:15:59,838
the with with the fire hazard

395
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,440
specifically, there's kind of a

396
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,480
two-pronged answer. So everyone I talk

397
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,639
to who's in this space basically we are

398
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,560
just so far behind on they they

399
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,720
literally call it a fire debt. We are so

400
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:13,838
far behind on the amount of fire that

401
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,240
needs to happen in these landscapes that

402
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,480
we just need more people working in the

403
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,959
prescribed burn space. Um there's a way

404
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,519
of conducting these uh simulating

405
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:25,758
basically simulating natural fires uh in

406
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,679
a responsible manner. Uh it's going on

407
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,278
in New York State. It's going on all

408
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:30,879
over the country. I think it's most

409
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,439
vigorously happening on the West Coast,

410
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:35,838
but it's uh it's everywhere. This is a

411
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,680
really classic landscape management that

412
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,920
we need um for ecosystem health to then

413
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,838
uh improve human health. And kind of to

414
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,479
then the other question or the other

415
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,120
other part about how do we protect

416
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,639
ourselves and prepare for wildfires. Uh

417
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,639
really there's a lot of there's been a

418
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,799
lot of research in building codes in the

419
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,839
last two decades. I think the 2008

420
00:16:54,799 --> 00:17:00,159
building codes are uh that's been borne

421
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:04,000
out in a number of the recent fires. Uh

422
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:06,558
so the uh the California wildfires uh

423
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,519
since 2018 have supported this as well

424
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:11,038
as I believe um the Lahina wildfires. So

425
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:15,119
I'll start teeing up our transition to

426
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:17,519
Hawaii in a second here. Um but the

427
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:20,479
basically there are ways including many

428
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:23,519
lowcost ways of maintaining a home and

429
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,439
the landscape around a home that

430
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:27,679
significantly reduce the likelihood of

431
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,840
the home burning down uh when the

432
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,919
wildfires uh come through. if you live

433
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,839
in a high-risisk area. So, um that's

434
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,759
called home hardening and defensible

435
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,279
space are the two words that I recommend

436
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:40,000
people look up if you're interested in

437
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,000
that. And again, California has done so

438
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,359
much work on this. They have a lot of uh

439
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,839
the state government there has a lot of

440
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:48,399
public resources um about how to do

441
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:51,000
this, including a lowcost retrofit list

442
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,600
of how to do this cheaply for

443
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,839
yourself. Longer answer than you wanted.

444
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:59,519
No, I loved it. It was great. It's

445
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:02,558
exactly what I wanted. Um, uh, I want to

446
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:04,558
ask you, uh, while Scott is teeing up,

447
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:08,480
have you ever heard about the art

448
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:12,319
project from LA called Pigeon Blog?

449
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:16,319
I've not. Okay. So, in terms of filling

450
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:18,319
in data space, an artist in LA trying to

451
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:21,359
deal with an air quality issue, not

452
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:23,240
fire, but air quality issue, outfitted

453
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:27,119
pigeons with

454
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:29,440
sensors. and uh they all reported back

455
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:33,359
and it interpolated between the official

456
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,360
sensors. And so just in terms of the one

457
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,918
health working amongst and between

458
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:41,199
species to think about our shared

459
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:45,280
airspace, um I just think it it might be

460
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:48,960
like a fun uh side topic about how to

461
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:51,279
interpolate um air quality with with a

462
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,240
multiecies kind of perspective. But I

463
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:57,240
mean it could also just be a a a true

464
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:01,319
data gathering, right? I mean, it's it's

465
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:04,558
a I don't know. It it

466
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:06,319
it I'm going to just put it in the in in

467
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:09,678
the chat just because I think it's so

468
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:12,399
fun and fantastic, but um I really

469
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:15,559
appreciate your talk.

470
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,559
Thank you.
