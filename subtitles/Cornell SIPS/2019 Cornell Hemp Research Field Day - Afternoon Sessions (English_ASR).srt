1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,259
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:04,259
University

3
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:16,109
Tim Sweeney who is a policy analyst and

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:22,230
works 150 percent for Ag and markets

5
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:28,979
under percent of that on half than 50%

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:30,570
on his real job so Tim is just going to

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,210
give us a little overview of their

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,070
current regulatory status from the Agra

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,198
markets perspective and then I'm sure

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:43,859
he'd be happy to take all of your

11
00:00:37,198 --> 00:00:45,899
questions so I just want to start off

12
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:48,780
with a little background on the program

13
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,000
as many of you probably know the 2014

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,799
federal farm bill was what was the law

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,270
that allowed us to begin this whole

16
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,358
adventure in the first place and

17
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,309
subsequently now that 2018 farm bill has

18
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,100
expanded the program and changed it

19
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:04,739
somewhat whereas hemp is no longer

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,868
controlled substance federally however

21
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,670
until we have guidelines from the

22
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:10,560
federal government from the USDA in

23
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,920
particular we are continuing to operate

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,409
under the 2014 program guidelines so you

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,320
need to keep that in mind that it is not

26
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,489
yet a fully free market out there you

27
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,038
still need to register with the state

28
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:25,560
and you will even after the 2018 program

29
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:27,000
is fully enforced that's part of part of

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,750
the requirements of the federal farm

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,780
bill so that the farm bill requires that

32
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,819
the USDA now take charge of industrial

33
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,618
hemp and takes it out of the realm of

34
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:39,329
the DEA as it's no longer controlled

35
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:41,849
substance I should say as an aside

36
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:43,920
though New York law has not quite caught

37
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:45,509
up yet so technically have is still a

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,179
controlled substance in New York State

39
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:51,929
but they're working on fixing that so

40
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:54,420
the USDA now is in is in the process of

41
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:56,429
establishing their regulations to run

42
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,590
the hemp program for the entire nation

43
00:01:56,429 --> 00:02:00,810
once their regs come out once their

44
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,810
program guidelines come out each state

45
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,000
that wants to hope wants to host a

46
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,950
program will have to apply to the USDA

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,310
the USDA will have to approve the state

48
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,830
program and after that we will do

49
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,598
rulemaking in New York State which will

50
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,739
then for those of you who are in the

51
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,019
program you're familiar with the

52
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:21,180
research partner agreements we expect

53
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,189
that the requirements to have those will

54
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,769
go away and we'll be running the program

55
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:27,299
pursuant to regulations but for now all

56
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:30,030
of those requirements for the research

57
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:33,659
partner agreements remain in force and

58
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:37,169
and the 2014 farm bill remains in force

59
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:38,969
one exception that any of you who wanted

60
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:41,159
to get seed in the past from a foreign

61
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:43,979
source know what you had to go through

62
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:46,139
with us for that we had to apply to the

63
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:47,849
DEA to get an import permit they would

64
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:50,488
then send the paperwork back to me I

65
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:51,989
would send your permit to you the seed

66
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:53,250
would have to be delivered to our office

67
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:55,530
in Albany and then you'd have to come

68
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,479
and get it that is all gone away now as

69
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,330
the DEA is no longer requirement and

70
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:02,069
will not issue any import permits early

71
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:05,640
on this year that there was kind of a

72
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:08,099
bit of confusion where the the DEA said

73
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:09,449
we're not issuing permits and the

74
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,370
government in Canada said well we're not

75
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:13,409
sending seed to the US without a permit

76
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,909
so we were kind of in a tough spot there

77
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:17,250
but we finally worked all of that out

78
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:19,079
there are no longer any DEA permits

79
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,580
required and you do not have to come to

80
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,920
Albany to pick up your seed any more it

81
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,060
can be delivered directly to you and any

82
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:25,589
of you that had the misfortune of having

83
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,539
to come to our office to get the seed

84
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:34,439
will appreciate how big a deal that is

85
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:37,259
so over the years since the 2014 farm

86
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:39,269
bill started this all off 2016 was our

87
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,669
first year that we had a crop in the

88
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:43,620
ground in New York State the program has

89
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:45,899
grown like crazy since then I think

90
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,989
we're up to just over 500 growers now

91
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,530
and that represents about 18,000 acres

92
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:54,509
approved for growing in New York State

93
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:57,239
about 75% of that a question was asked

94
00:03:54,509 --> 00:04:01,500
in the morning session how much the the

95
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:03,870
acreage is devoted to CBD about 75% and

96
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,239
CBD it would be a good guess I think

97
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:09,719
we're currently taking applications for

98
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,219
growing for fiber grain and CBD we're

99
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:13,229
currently taking applications for

100
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:15,239
processing a fiber and grain we are not

101
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:18,959
however accepting any applications right

102
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,728
now for processing CBD and we don't know

103
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,680
when that will open up again I expect it

104
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:25,069
will but I really have no idea when that

105
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,069
would be

106
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:35,759
okay with regard to CBD CBD and food

107
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:38,370
according to the FDA and the FDA still

108
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,720
has oversight over CBD that was pretty

109
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,598
clear in the federal farm bill that

110
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,449
nothing in the farm bill undid FDA law

111
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:48,449
and so as far as the FDA is concerned

112
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:51,740
you cannot add CBD to food and you

113
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:54,210
cannot sell CBD as a dietary supplement

114
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,680
New York State we have a different

115
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:58,799
approach

116
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:01,848
you can add CBD to products that look

117
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,639
like food if those products are made as

118
00:05:01,848 --> 00:05:08,158
a dietary supplement in a GMP facility

119
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,800
and following all the Code of Federal

120
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:12,629
Regulations sections that apply to

121
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,098
dietary supplements the product would

122
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:15,389
then have to be labeled as a dietary

123
00:05:14,098 --> 00:05:17,728
supplement marketed as a dietary

124
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:19,620
supplement and sold as a dietary

125
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:22,318
supplement so we are a little bit

126
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,810
different than some other states in that

127
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:28,259
regard but we do allow CBD in in those

128
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:30,470
products does anyone have any questions

129
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,470
so far

130
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:39,689
I think I'm pretty much pretty much

131
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:41,550
cover about everything that I needed to

132
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:43,889
tell you for now the application process

133
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,449
remains the same you apply to us it's

134
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:47,009
still a five hundred dollar fee it's a

135
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:48,840
three year application a three year

136
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:50,819
license that you would be granted you

137
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:52,288
would go through the process of having

138
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:53,908
to do the research partner game and

139
00:05:52,288 --> 00:05:56,878
having that notarized and returned to us

140
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:59,310
you would need to still be sampled you

141
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,530
know 21 days prior to when you want to

142
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,418
harvest you contact us we will send a

143
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:04,769
horticultural inspector out you have to

144
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:06,839
fill out what's called a harvest report

145
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:08,939
form with us our horticulture inspectors

146
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:10,560
look about they'll sample your crop send

147
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:13,098
the sample back to our food lab to do

148
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,598
the regulatory test and then you'd be

149
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:31,408
good to go if your crop is is within

150
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:33,180
legal limits within 21 days so you you

151
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:34,829
apply to us you send in the harvest

152
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,050
report form which is more like a harvest

153
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:39,028
request that sort of a misnomer so it's

154
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,829
a harvest request form so within 21 days

155
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:43,978
of one you want to harvest is when you

156
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:45,538
should send that form to us so and then

157
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:47,038
we will do our best to get an inspector

158
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:50,098
I think they're shooting for within a

159
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:52,139
week yeah two to three days been my day

160
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:54,889
to day two to three days Larry says it's

161
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,889
been his experience

162
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:08,180
that is not within the purview of our

163
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:10,399
program so we have told people that if

164
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:13,129
they are selling a product that the FDA

165
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:15,289
considers illegal they're definitely in

166
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:17,930
a you know they could be in a bind there

167
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:19,580
and and it's there's somewhat of a gray

168
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,590
area as to what is allowed and what

169
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:23,810
isn't allowed but some of it's very

170
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:25,459
plain and the FDA if they choose to

171
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:34,879
enforce they could take enforcement

172
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:37,669
action you cannot sell any raw flour in

173
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:43,240
New York State to anyone outside and you

174
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:43,240
can make any products in New York

175
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,680
obviously so you're talking about when

176
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:06,949
the USDA issues their program expect to

177
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,150
come out with state as soon as possible

178
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:11,180
as the answer and I know that's not a

179
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:13,120
great answer we are i I spoke with the

180
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,410
woman who runs the egg marketing

181
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,439
services section at the USDA in their

182
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:20,750
test with developing the program and she

183
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:23,089
said that they are on track for early

184
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:26,240
fall release of the USDA program guide

185
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:28,489
right so then we will do everything in

186
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,139
our power to get our program submitted

187
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,060
to them and a timely fashion and get it

188
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:33,529
back out I would certainly hope that we

189
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:36,589
would be running under the new program

190
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:38,509
for next growing season but we don't

191
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:41,170
know there's a lot of there's a lot of

192
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:41,169
variables in

193
00:08:49,929 --> 00:09:02,569
did you say together no you heard it

194
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:04,729
right okay the question was whether or

195
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:06,830
not CBD smokeable flower is allowed in

196
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,379
New York State it is not we do not in

197
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:11,780
our program you cannot sell raw flower

198
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:13,820
to anyone outside the program and it

199
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:19,669
cannot do any smokeable or available

200
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:21,040
products they're not in our program or

201
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:23,779
they're violating their program

202
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,399
agreement with us and if that's the case

203
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:27,850
then they could be expelled from the

204
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,850
program

205
00:09:36,578 --> 00:09:39,578
right

206
00:09:43,299 --> 00:10:05,289
I don't want to speculate on legislation

207
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:06,850
that has a you know it hasn't passed it

208
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:09,219
and may may actually look a lot

209
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,329
different than the old legislation we

210
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,149
don't I don't know what it would look

211
00:10:10,328 --> 00:10:15,099
like but that is the model that was in

212
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:17,259
the previous legislation was that cvd

213
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,769
would be would be under that new

214
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:19,769
authority

215
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:30,590
[Music]

216
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:38,370
[Music]

217
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:44,049
in order for it to be industrial hemp it

218
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:47,259
has to be point three or below THC so I

219
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:49,209
I don't know what the legislation if any

220
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:51,129
would look like I don't know what that

221
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:53,379
if they would write something in the law

222
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:55,750
that would address that however I will

223
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:57,820
say that the federal level is point

224
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:35,470
three and we're going to be held to the

225
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:37,030
federal standard to get our so we have a

226
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:40,060
sampling protocol for the top ten

227
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:42,579
centimeters of the plant and one that

228
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:44,049
we're we're trying to be consistent with

229
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,350
what other states do as well so that

230
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:49,689
there wouldn't be any situation where

231
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:51,220
New York State products might have some

232
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,600
taint to them as with regard to

233
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,100
interstate transportation if we weren't

234
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,519
held to the same standard as other

235
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,519
people

236
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:19,869
so the question the question is with

237
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:21,938
regard to some marijuana plants that are

238
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:27,579
showing up in fields that are planted to

239
00:12:21,938 --> 00:12:30,759
some other crop or to him so it does so

240
00:12:27,578 --> 00:12:33,399
basically saying what's the possibility

241
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:35,048
of having unlicensed growers is that

242
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:37,769
where you're asking I think you're one

243
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:37,769
are you wondering about

244
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,919
there's no regulation that would would

245
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,990
address that are you worried about it if

246
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:58,169
your field tested hot because of that

247
00:12:51,990 --> 00:13:01,370
crop I would write so I would hope that

248
00:12:58,169 --> 00:13:05,699
the randomness of our sampling protocol

249
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:07,889
would take that worry away if that

250
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,420
wasn't the case and if it was a special

251
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:11,970
circumstance that you could prove that

252
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:14,159
you there was some renegade crop growing

253
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,540
there we could probably take a look at

254
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,409
that have our inspectors come back out

255
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:20,849
and see exactly what's going on there

256
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:30,750
until it falls into law enforcement says

257
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:33,450
right yeah do you do that will you have

258
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:37,379
a published procedure for how you will

259
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:39,390
handle a non-compliant test and what

260
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:40,860
will be the steps that you or law

261
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:44,370
enforcement will take after that

262
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:47,129
non-compliant test the second test will

263
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,779
law enforcement be brought to the field

264
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:51,029
what's gonna happen

265
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:53,429
Larry always has to do this to me yes

266
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:55,919
question I don't know the answer to that

267
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:57,839
procedure that policy has not yet been

268
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,509
established but I we are going to have

269
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:03,000
to come up with a disruption policy it

270
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:04,799
is not our intention to be law

271
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,220
enforcement there or take the place of

272
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,629
law enforcement jurisdiction if somebody

273
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,240
in our program ends up with a field

274
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:15,360
that's hot we will work with them to

275
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:17,370
destroy the crop and we will not our

276
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,100
first call is not going to be to law

277
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:22,080
enforcement to get them jammed up in a

278
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,629
legal proceeding we want we want this

279
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,060
program to succeed we want our program

280
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:29,070
participants to succeed so we'll do

281
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:31,529
everything we can within within the law

282
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,210
and you know we you have to keep in mind

283
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:34,350
that we're going to have the federal

284
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:36,000
government looking at us to make sure

285
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,680
that we're doing everything we need to

286
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,409
do to stay compliant with what their

287
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:45,399
requirements okay thanks a lot Tim

288
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:47,409
[Applause]

289
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:52,000
like this if you guys want to follow

290
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:54,219
along it's a little bit different than

291
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,889
some of the other camp handouts because

292
00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:01,509
the entire first page is about the

293
00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:03,970
weather so I'm sure there's a lot of

294
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:07,120
growers from different not just hemp in

295
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:12,190
the group and we've had a couple rough

296
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:15,370
years the last two 2017 was the first

297
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:19,540
time we got an actual spring planting of

298
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:23,320
her and it was wet it was a wet spring

299
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:25,990
we planted late in some of our locations

300
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:31,120
we had lots of Pythium so he lost a lot

301
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:32,919
of seedlings to that and then it sort of

302
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,259
turned into like this beautiful summer

303
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:37,979
so all of our seedlings that survived

304
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:42,210
the Pythia grew beautifully we had

305
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:45,580
amazing yields I've looked at other

306
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:47,110
trials from around the country and it

307
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,330
was just like yeah we can we can

308
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:53,110
definitely grow hemp for grain and fiber

309
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:57,910
in New York we can do this and then we

310
00:15:53,110 --> 00:16:02,830
had a beautiful long dry warm fall so

311
00:15:57,909 --> 00:16:05,139
everything got harvested it was it was

312
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:09,160
nice it was really nice our highest

313
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:24,610
yielding cultivar for green was over a

314
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:27,429
ton per acre and then our grains are our

315
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:31,180
fiber yields were also really high so we

316
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:34,838
were had six and a half dry tons per

317
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:39,009
acre ones are our biomass produced and

318
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:45,060
that was in 72 days so that that's

319
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:45,059
enormous and then we had last year

320
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:50,319
again again we've had a pretty wet

321
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:54,730
spring so he planted a little bit later

322
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,800
than we had hoped and then finally

323
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,360
things dried out enough to plant and it

324
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:02,049
was like someone could turn the faucet

325
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:07,269
off like we had five to six weeks of

326
00:17:02,049 --> 00:17:09,579
just drought so we had pretty poor

327
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:12,490
seedling stands and then in addition to

328
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:14,679
that because of the drought we had a bus

329
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,140
like stunting the plants were just

330
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,940
stunted it was we were watching it you

331
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:22,630
know watching it like you can do it plan

332
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:24,430
we're little cheerleaders and and we

333
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,960
thought we'd might be okay because the

334
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:29,980
wheat it was driving up if the weeds

335
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:32,259
weren't growing either and then the rain

336
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:34,779
started coming like everyone prayed way

337
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:37,180
too hard for rain last summer but I

338
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:41,789
think that was the key because once it

339
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:41,789
started it didn't stop until this spring

340
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:54,430
and the weeds out through all of our

341
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:59,589
shorter varieties it just didn't stop

342
00:17:54,430 --> 00:18:03,009
raining and so we had some big disease

343
00:17:59,589 --> 00:18:06,250
pressure later on in the season our

344
00:18:03,009 --> 00:18:08,799
grain yields were half that of what they

345
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:12,910
were the year before the fiber yields

346
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:15,519
weren't impacted nearly as much but but

347
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:17,710
they were still four and a half tons

348
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,389
verses six and a half times four and a

349
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:23,160
half tons of still a lot of forage to

350
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:29,620
earth a biomass to produce in 75 days

351
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:30,259
but but no it just still wasn't because

352
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:32,000
of

353
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:33,319
Stan's burn is good to start out with

354
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,019
wasn't as good as than the year before

355
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:38,779
and then our grains yields were at last

356
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:41,599
about half as much so there's a nice

357
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:46,759
graph on the back so we're for this data

358
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:50,389
we had 13 grain varieties in 2017 but we

359
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:53,509
and then for fiber types we also have

360
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:59,810
the four fiber types in 2018 but we

361
00:18:53,509 --> 00:19:03,680
added to it so we ended up having closer

362
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:05,899
to 25 grain and dual-purpose type but I

363
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,820
didn't include that information in here

364
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,900
because I just wanted to compare you

365
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:13,549
know the same varieties in both years

366
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,410
but I think the big difference that we

367
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:18,769
saw in the grain that wheat harvested

368
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:19,940
was the Fusarium on the grain that going

369
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:24,279
to talk about that too much

370
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:29,990
gary will be up here in a little bit but

371
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:32,690
so there was detectable vomitoxin in

372
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:37,579
some of our trials so especially trials

373
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:39,769
that were in locations around areas for

374
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:42,289
a lot of other feet and barley and oats

375
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:45,289
are produced those ones have very high

376
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:49,009
levels we had our highest detectable

377
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:53,049
level of vomitoxin is 36.6 parts per

378
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:55,549
million on some of our hemp so that

379
00:19:53,049 --> 00:20:00,500
that's a lot right I think the cutoff

380
00:19:55,549 --> 00:20:02,950
for food is 1 to 2 per 2 parts per

381
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:06,819
million depending on what the main

382
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:09,069
is going to be and so you know looking

383
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:12,369
at the screen and seeing 36 biggest

384
00:20:09,069 --> 00:20:17,919
ticks parts-per-million was a shock for

385
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:20,379
sure the other other quality components

386
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:25,800
of the brain were different as well so

387
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:29,890
in 2017 it was close to 36 percent oil

388
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:32,799
in the seeds and it was less it was 129

389
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:35,620
percent in 2018 so there's a big drop

390
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,569
there as well and just you could you

391
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:39,789
could look at the grain and see it was

392
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:41,259
not of the right quality it was

393
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:43,629
weathered looking there's lots more

394
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:48,990
throw a few pieces you can see

395
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:52,270
discoloration from the disease although

396
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:54,400
so in my head in my head we had one

397
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:57,599
awesome year which can show the

398
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:02,680
potential like New York can do this

399
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:05,349
we've got the potential the seed the

400
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:07,330
seed sources are there and then the next

401
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:10,209
year was just like whoa we're gonna need

402
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:12,399
some more tools and if we're gonna be

403
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:15,299
able to manage this and really keep this

404
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,300
going as a crop

405
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,960
restaurants

406
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:32,259
all of our all of our certified law

407
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:35,759
feedlots were fine or THC nothing came

408
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:35,759
in first person

409
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,650
[Music]

410
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:57,419
yeah he was asking at the Fusarium was a

411
00:21:54,900 --> 00:22:00,030
blue in from the neighboring fields and

412
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:02,430
that is very likely the chance last year

413
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:06,389
was a really bad year for Fusarium on

414
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:08,820
all of his small grains and corn and him

415
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:16,820
it was all over just a really bad year

416
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:16,819
for Fusarium Thank You Jamie

417
00:22:21,308 --> 00:22:25,609
thirty thousand just going to give a

418
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:30,279
quick update on our breeding program

419
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:33,229
here yeah so these cultivar trials are

420
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:35,990
really good at informing New York

421
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:40,099
farmers but they also informed readers

422
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:42,919
like me our breeding program this

423
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:45,619
Vermont primarily focused on developing

424
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:49,700
disease resistant high yielding

425
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:53,949
varieties with decent no oil and protein

426
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:56,929
content and diverse cannabinoid profiles

427
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:58,990
so we make selections from some of these

428
00:22:56,929 --> 00:23:00,950
cultivars that we've tested in the field

429
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:04,880
so we've been doing this for the past

430
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:08,660
like three years this year we identified

431
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,960
a subset of high yielding dual-purpose

432
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:14,090
goal cars that have good grain yield

433
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:18,039
along with good candidate Kenan

434
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:24,589
cannabinoid profiles so what we did is

435
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:27,740
we took seed Lots from these particular

436
00:23:24,589 --> 00:23:32,569
varieties and grew them out and see

437
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:34,669
flats and we made early selections at

438
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:38,899
the seedling stage based on plant

439
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:42,110
seedling bigger or height lack of

440
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:45,048
disease and then from there we are using

441
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:49,519
high-throughput molecular markers to

442
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:54,829
first identify a cannabinoid type or

443
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:59,569
hemp type or marrow or marijuana type so

444
00:23:54,829 --> 00:24:03,889
we can create progeny that are

445
00:23:59,569 --> 00:24:05,480
homozygous M type so we want to make we

446
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:08,190
want to make hemp populations we don't

447
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:11,579
want to make hemp marijuana populations

448
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:14,309
we saw that a lot of these coke bars

449
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:17,839
from the last couple of years have been

450
00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:22,109
segregating for ham and marijuana type

451
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:24,329
so if you want to talk to Jacob he's in

452
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:27,959
our lab he talked a little bit about

453
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:29,909
that earlier if you want to talk to me

454
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:34,200
about that more Jacob more just can't

455
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:37,320
ask us but so what we do is we're

456
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,420
screening these plants for a cannabinoid

457
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:43,289
type and then what we want to do is

458
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:46,289
select from that subset a percentage of

459
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:48,509
females and a percentage of males that

460
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:52,559
are have type and then we'll bring in

461
00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:54,859
hemp type females into greenhouse ranges

462
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:58,789
you know different varieties of piece

463
00:24:54,859 --> 00:25:03,029
have females and introduce them into us

464
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:07,230
introduce them to a single male cultivar

465
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:11,099
that we've also screened and from from

466
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:12,890
there we bulk those seeds and we'll you

467
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:16,589
know we'll book those seeds clean it and

468
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:21,120
plant it out in the field this year we

469
00:25:16,589 --> 00:25:22,799
planted out I think ten crosses and

470
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,899
we're still working on some more in the

471
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,059
greenhouse we've also done some

472
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:32,120
feminized populations that we're doing

473
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:36,720
selections on so from there we'll make

474
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:38,250
selections in the field so we don't make

475
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,069
selections in the field bring them into

476
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:43,980
the greenhouse and use those for our

477
00:25:41,069 --> 00:25:46,309
future crosses so the big you know we so

478
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:49,079
we don't have to really rely on

479
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:51,119
isolation you know so we don't have to

480
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:54,210
fear pollen in the field

481
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:54,959
we're actually wanting to go out do some

482
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:57,210
cultivar

483
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,970
evaluations in the field all in one big

484
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:01,860
field instead of isolated blocks you

485
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:04,950
know three miles apart from one another

486
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:07,199
it's just you just don't have the tools

487
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:11,970
to do that right now

488
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:13,649
so we've also we've also evaluated

489
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:18,329
different feral populations from

490
00:26:13,648 --> 00:26:21,028
Wisconsin Illinois Nebraska and some New

491
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:24,509
York feral populations as well as

492
00:26:21,028 --> 00:26:26,249
different feminized populations and

493
00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:29,220
dioecious populations of varying

494
00:26:26,249 --> 00:26:32,249
pedigrees so it'd be interesting to see

495
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:34,889
what kind of traits we we can garner

496
00:26:32,249 --> 00:26:37,319
from those populations so again like

497
00:26:34,888 --> 00:26:39,898
Larry said we're doing genotyping just

498
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:42,138
to look at the genetic diversity of the

499
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:46,498
plants that New York farmers are

500
00:26:42,138 --> 00:26:48,689
planting on the state we've done this

501
00:26:46,499 --> 00:26:51,360
for a year we have well we have two

502
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:53,548
plates of GPS or it's genotyping by

503
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:56,939
sequencing it's a different it's our

504
00:26:53,548 --> 00:26:58,769
genotyping method but we're going to

505
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,509
submit another plate soon so if you're

506
00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:03,210
interested in getting your plants that

507
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:04,710
you're growing how that genotyped it

508
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:07,159
won't be it there won't be any cost to

509
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:10,710
you we just will visit your field

510
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:12,960
collect your sample from your plan and

511
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:15,090
then we'll share it with you you know we

512
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,009
want to be as open as possible in our

513
00:27:15,089 --> 00:27:19,678
breeding program and our genotyping

514
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:22,470
program and we'll offer that and it will

515
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:26,909
throw that up online so you can see

516
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:31,379
where your plants set in the entire you

517
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:35,929
know what was that the galaxy of your of

518
00:27:31,378 --> 00:27:35,928
our genetic diversity that we see here

519
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:43,499
well yeah just come up and talk to me if

520
00:27:41,788 --> 00:27:45,118
you want to do that I've got a sign-up

521
00:27:43,499 --> 00:27:46,589
sheet and if you know your cultivars

522
00:27:45,118 --> 00:27:50,939
offhand you can just write those down

523
00:27:46,589 --> 00:27:53,099
thank you so let me just give the just

524
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,320
the two second summary of what we've

525
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:59,808
learned so far and we haven't gotten our

526
00:27:55,319 --> 00:28:03,528
second set of 95 samples back not every

527
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:06,599
variety is named according to its

528
00:28:03,528 --> 00:28:10,398
genetic makeup

529
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:13,740
so sometimes names don't match genetics

530
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:16,558
and that can be interesting and also

531
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:19,890
that we do see groupings of different

532
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:21,889
cultivars into distinct genetic groups

533
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:25,200
so we would like to expand that analysis

534
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:26,700
with another 95 samples so if you're

535
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,140
interested in doing that please let us

536
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,140
know thanks very much

537
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,880
[Applause]

538
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:38,470
[Music]

539
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,230
so certainly with a new crop on the

540
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:43,779
landscape the risk of diseases is

541
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:46,569
eminent and we're very fortunate to have

542
00:28:43,779 --> 00:28:48,039
Gary Bergstrom here to talk about the

543
00:28:46,569 --> 00:28:51,250
surveys and the characterizations

544
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:54,309
they've done the diseases so far yep

545
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:56,259
hello everybody so I'd like to start out

546
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:58,029
by acknowledging two people in my lab

547
00:28:56,259 --> 00:29:01,869
that are really at the at the forefront

548
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:03,720
of our diagnostic effort gen star Kevin

549
00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:07,059
Meyers would you stand up there and and

550
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,529
all three of us will be around and I

551
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:10,839
would love to visit with you about

552
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:13,480
things that you think may be diseases

553
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:15,579
that you're seeing in your fields but

554
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:19,809
where I think we will all agree we're

555
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:21,849
still learning a lot and this is the

556
00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:23,500
third year of our effort to try to in

557
00:29:21,849 --> 00:29:27,639
surveillance to try to find out what's

558
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:29,170
going on in in commercial fields of hemp

559
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,090
as well as in some of the kind of

560
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:33,130
variety trials that you've seen here

561
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:34,509
today and if you noticed it was by and

562
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:36,640
large pretty clean we found that little

563
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:39,160
bit of pottery mildew we did collect a

564
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,130
few very minor leaf spots and you may

565
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:44,590
have noticed a few plants showing will

566
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:46,630
owing wilting on one side of the plant I

567
00:29:44,589 --> 00:29:49,599
think there's some Fusarium wilt and in

568
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:52,540
a relatively few plants out there but

569
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:55,240
with certainty as we intensify

570
00:29:52,539 --> 00:29:58,960
production of this crop like any other

571
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:01,180
crop we grow if we you know have it have

572
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,640
it grown in more fields and have it

573
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:06,000
grown more intensively with greater

574
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:09,850
frequency and on any particular field

575
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,950
we're likely to see eventually an

576
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:15,309
increase in some of our disease problems

577
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:17,019
so at the at the onset here we're trying

578
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:19,450
to record everything even some

579
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:21,369
insignificant little spot on a leaf

580
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:25,059
we're trying to find out what what

581
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:26,979
organism causes it you know is they're

582
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:29,230
super susceptibility in some of our

583
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:31,750
varieties etc so we're trying to get a

584
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:34,599
handle on all of that and we're very

585
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:37,119
interested in collaborating with all of

586
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:38,829
you a lot more eyes and ears here we

587
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:42,129
certainly aren't getting to the vast

588
00:30:38,829 --> 00:30:43,769
majority of your of your field so keep

589
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:47,500
us in mind either through your

590
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:48,710
Cooperative Extension educator in your

591
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,769
local area and

592
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:53,600
number of them are here with us today or

593
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:56,778
contact me or those in my lap we'd be

594
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:58,908
very interested in that so at this point

595
00:30:56,778 --> 00:31:02,538
where are we we're basically want to

596
00:30:58,909 --> 00:31:04,850
minimize diseases as as a factor in the

597
00:31:02,538 --> 00:31:06,349
production of this crop and since you've

598
00:31:04,849 --> 00:31:09,230
already heard a couple of times we don't

599
00:31:06,349 --> 00:31:11,298
have registered legal available and

600
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:13,730
efficacious fungicides is one of the

601
00:31:11,298 --> 00:31:17,750
tools at this point I think this will

602
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:19,909
change over time but we have very good

603
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:23,119
agronomic practices that we can put in

604
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:26,778
place we can for starters put a lot of

605
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:29,389
emphasis on on-site selection you've

606
00:31:26,778 --> 00:31:31,849
heard that the sites on your farm where

607
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:34,190
you're going to grow the crop we we need

608
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:37,158
a well-drained site ok Pythium is going

609
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:40,548
to be a problem and it's not going to be

610
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:43,580
adapted to every field on your farm we

611
00:31:40,548 --> 00:31:45,349
also know right off the bat that we that

612
00:31:43,579 --> 00:31:49,398
this is a crop that is very susceptible

613
00:31:45,349 --> 00:31:52,339
to white mold fungus the clairtenney of

614
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:55,639
fungus which is a very wide host range

615
00:31:52,339 --> 00:31:57,500
fungus and this is already a principal

616
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:00,200
problem for us in this state and growing

617
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:03,829
crops like dry beans snap beans soybeans

618
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:06,470
a number of other vegetable crops so we

619
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:08,839
know that if we have white mold problem

620
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:12,079
in those other crops it's only going to

621
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:15,230
lead to a white mold problem in the hemp

622
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:17,750
if we follow those in rotation so being

623
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:19,429
aware of not only the hemp and the hemp

624
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:21,648
varieties but what is the previous

625
00:32:19,429 --> 00:32:24,860
cropping history in the field is very

626
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:27,459
important you're going to hear in a

627
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:30,109
little bit here from dr. Alan Taylor

628
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:32,210
who's going to talk about some of the

629
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:35,178
pioneering work on looking at efficacy

630
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:39,319
of different synthetic chemicals and

631
00:32:35,179 --> 00:32:44,240
biological materials for application to

632
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:46,548
seed to try to get some control of some

633
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,429
of these seed borne and early growth

634
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:50,869
soil borne microorganisms so I won't say

635
00:32:49,429 --> 00:32:53,509
a lot about that other than to say that

636
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:56,418
that is a critical issue and probably

637
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:57,919
where we need pesticides the most is is

638
00:32:56,419 --> 00:33:00,169
getting that seed out of the ground

639
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,840
getting a vigorous initial stand so

640
00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:05,350
hopefully that'll be one of the first

641
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:07,750
developments in that arena and a good

642
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:10,539
seedbed is important as well to really

643
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:13,000
prepare the ground well I don't know how

644
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:14,769
much if anybody is planting in a no-till

645
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,299
situation right now that has some

646
00:33:14,769 --> 00:33:18,220
probably not too much and that's

647
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:20,169
probably just as well because that that

648
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,809
has some other complications as well as

649
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:25,210
far as seed emergence and depending on

650
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:26,740
what the crop residue from the previous

651
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:31,840
crop we could be carrying along

652
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:34,299
pathogens from a previous crop so my

653
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:36,549
biggest concerns are at the two ends of

654
00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:39,009
the growing season getting that seedling

655
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:41,919
out of the ground getting it protected

656
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:43,569
that way and I'm also in our program

657
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,820
we're putting a lot of current emphasis

658
00:33:43,569 --> 00:33:49,210
on the end of the season kind of

659
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:51,429
problems of diseases and also mycotoxins

660
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:53,799
one of the things that's nearly

661
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:56,590
universal that I've seen and looking at

662
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:59,430
fields is botrytis gray mold and it has

663
00:33:56,589 --> 00:34:01,839
that gray webby growth all over the the

664
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:03,789
floral parts and whatnot and that's

665
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:07,480
that's going to be problematic for any

666
00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:10,960
end use you know kind of an anti quality

667
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:13,030
factor there so we're aware of that I

668
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,369
there there may or may not turn out to

669
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:17,019
be some varietal differences along that

670
00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:20,289
line hopefully that we could see

671
00:34:17,019 --> 00:34:23,230
something like that but also I know

672
00:34:20,289 --> 00:34:25,000
Chris's group is is doing some work with

673
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:27,219
some of the same chemicals she's looking

674
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,780
against a powdery mildew interesting and

675
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:30,969
interested in finding something you

676
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:34,210
might have efficacy against botrytis as

677
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:38,019
well I'm concentrating very much on on

678
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:39,940
the fungi that will colonize the

679
00:34:38,019 --> 00:34:43,630
finished product either the grain the

680
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:47,039
seed or those buds and what we find is a

681
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:50,550
predominance of Fusarium fungi and

682
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:53,259
Fusarium is notorious for producing

683
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:55,450
mycotoxins and I've spent the better

684
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:57,430
part of my career working in cereal

685
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:59,069
crops where the principal problem has

686
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:02,199
been Fusarium head blight and

687
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:04,720
contamination of the of the grain with

688
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:07,839
dioxin a violin also known as vomit

689
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:09,519
toxin and so it was at least a mile

690
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,250
surprise to me to start looking at

691
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:15,070
quality and the and the hemp and finding

692
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:17,489
that though those same problems are very

693
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:20,039
prevalent there and we're finding a

694
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:22,359
diversity of Fusarium species

695
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:24,159
particularly Fusarium gramineae arum

696
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:28,690
which is the principal problem we have

697
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:31,089
on corn and small grain cereals which

698
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:33,309
does in the long term open up the whole

699
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:36,220
crop rotation question a little bit as

700
00:35:33,309 --> 00:35:37,809
well because the the wisdom would be if

701
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:40,299
we're having problems with white mold

702
00:35:37,809 --> 00:35:42,639
and we have some commonality with maybe

703
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:44,830
some of our diseases of vegetables in

704
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:46,750
some cases that grain crops would be a

705
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:49,059
great rotation well there's a caveat on

706
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:51,070
that we have to look at that and I think

707
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:53,320
that we have to be conscious of how

708
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:56,170
Fusarium might be building up in the in

709
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,880
the grain crop that precedes the hemp

710
00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:02,289
crop so we have a lot to learn about

711
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:05,650
that again we may you know get super

712
00:36:02,289 --> 00:36:07,690
lucky and find find a variety or some

713
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:09,610
genes in particular that would confer

714
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:11,349
resistance to Fusarium but I wouldn't

715
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:14,140
hold out a lot of hope on that I've been

716
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:16,839
working in cereal systems for my fourth

717
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:19,199
decade now and it is still an elusive

718
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:22,480
problem genetically we have been able to

719
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:24,460
basically sort out the super susceptible

720
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,099
varieties and kind of push them to the

721
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:29,320
side and we have found genetic control

722
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:31,839
that moderates a you know kind of

723
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:34,630
intermediate level of resistance and yet

724
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:36,760
when it rains when the crops flower and

725
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:38,769
we have the fungus in the air we will

726
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:42,790
get Fusarium develop and we will have

727
00:36:38,769 --> 00:36:44,230
mycotoxins Jamie may be scared you a

728
00:36:42,789 --> 00:36:45,940
little bit about that one figure about

729
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:49,179
thirty-six parts per million than that

730
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:50,829
I'm hoping is an extreme case but we've

731
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:53,230
been looking at seed Lots from last

732
00:36:50,829 --> 00:36:56,380
couple of years and it's not unusual to

733
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:59,409
have four or five six parts per million

734
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:02,980
the FDA guidelines for any human food

735
00:36:59,409 --> 00:37:05,230
product is one part per million okay so

736
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:08,349
there there will be some effort made to

737
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:09,969
try to bring things down to that one of

738
00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:13,239
the things that we're actively looking

739
00:37:09,969 --> 00:37:16,409
at in our research program is we're

740
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:19,059
looking at the possibility of both

741
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:21,699
organically approved type fungicide

742
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:24,489
materials bio fungicides as well as more

743
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:26,859
traditional chemical fungicides and

744
00:37:24,489 --> 00:37:27,619
we're applying that at the outset of

745
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:30,559
flower

746
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:32,989
on the crowd we have some experiment

747
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:35,960
we're doing some timings on that too so

748
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:38,809
we would like to see what potential that

749
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:41,570
has in bringing down suppressing the

750
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:44,150
levels of this deoxy no volatile toxin

751
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:46,039
in the in the grain or in the in the

752
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:49,430
buds so that's something we feel is

753
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:50,719
pretty high priority right now talking

754
00:37:49,429 --> 00:37:53,269
about kind of in the middle of the

755
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:55,159
growing season we've seen an awful lot

756
00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:57,440
of different things we've seen some of

757
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:59,539
these vascular wilt disorders haven't

758
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,519
seen a complete wipe out of many fields

759
00:37:59,539 --> 00:38:03,409
of that but we've seen some serious

760
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:05,780
problems in a couple of cases with with

761
00:38:03,409 --> 00:38:07,940
Pythium root rot that's the that starts

762
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:10,400
early in the season and progresses into

763
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:12,740
killing whole plants also the Fusarium

764
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,780
fungus in soils can do that you may have

765
00:38:12,739 --> 00:38:17,839
seen some stray plants in the plots this

766
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:22,370
morning that showed Fusarium wilt what

767
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:25,370
we have seen is a whole diversity of

768
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:28,159
fungal leaf spots and some of them

769
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:29,839
really very minor you know have to look

770
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:31,759
a long way in a row and find a couple

771
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,590
spots here and there and a couple of

772
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,740
diseases in particular one we call by

773
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:40,039
Polaris leaf spot that seems some

774
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:41,899
connection with varieties as well but it

775
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:45,739
can be severe blighting of the whole

776
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:49,940
canopy so we will be looking primarily

777
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:52,429
at genetic varietal selection in the

778
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:55,280
future as a means of combating some of

779
00:38:52,429 --> 00:38:57,049
those things and so we look forward to

780
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,880
working together with larry's program

781
00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:01,490
and others here to try to get a better

782
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,140
handle on those things but there the if

783
00:39:01,489 --> 00:39:04,969
you're into Latin names there's a few on

784
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:07,449
that sheet there they're all kinds of

785
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:11,149
generative fungi that we have found

786
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:13,639
associated with these blights and we're

787
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:15,590
methodically working through proving

788
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:17,299
they're pathogenicity isolating them in

789
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:20,180
pure culture inoculating amount of

790
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:22,310
different varieties of of half in the

791
00:39:20,179 --> 00:39:25,099
greenhouse and seeing to what extent

792
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:28,250
they are pathogenic another interesting

793
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:31,190
question is the host range of some of

794
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:35,030
these pathogenic microbes for instance

795
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:37,099
we we found some organisms that we

796
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:40,280
haven't proven yet but very similar

797
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:40,650
organism found on the weeds nearby in

798
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,170
our home

799
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:46,650
plots so it could be that weed control

800
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:48,960
is also important in you know in the

801
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:50,730
epidemiology of some of these diseases

802
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,088
so we we have a tremendous amount to

803
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:57,119
learn and we look forward to you being

804
00:39:54,088 --> 00:40:00,239
students along with us and help us to

805
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:02,278
learn some of these things so are there

806
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:07,019
some questions or some observations

807
00:40:02,278 --> 00:40:09,269
you'd like to share okay the question

808
00:40:07,019 --> 00:40:11,309
was whether we have found any difference

809
00:40:09,269 --> 00:40:14,400
in susceptibility if you will between

810
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:17,490
the money's just and dioecious varieties

811
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,260
since we're basically just looking we're

812
00:40:17,489 --> 00:40:20,788
not inoculating anything so there's no

813
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,770
controlled experiments to do that

814
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:27,089
comparison so we can't definitively

815
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:28,980
describe that the vast majority of the

816
00:40:27,088 --> 00:40:29,369
varieties in field settings we've seen

817
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:34,318
before

818
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:36,960
so far disease is fairly uncommon most

819
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:39,358
most of the plants of all all types are

820
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,650
looking fair well I won't say resistant

821
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:42,960
because they may not have been exposed

822
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:45,480
to the inoculum but I don't have any

823
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,338
general observation on that the line is

824
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:52,818
there some information anybody's aware

825
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:52,818
of along that line yeah good

826
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,119
yeah

827
00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:08,549
but I appreciate that observation and we

828
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:10,079
can we can try to look at that a little

829
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:13,890
more closer that's that's very helpful

830
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,869
thank you thank you so I just curious if

831
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:18,299
anybody that's been growing the crop has

832
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:22,170
had any significant production issue

833
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:24,630
with disease they don't want to be the

834
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:26,720
only one so come talk to me privately

835
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:30,420
thank you

836
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:33,539
[Applause]

837
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:36,088
and our last speaker of the afternoon is

838
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:38,039
dr. Alan Taylor who is a seat scientist

839
00:41:36,088 --> 00:41:39,989
here at Cornell Agrotech and has been

840
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:41,849
doing some research on seat treatments

841
00:41:39,989 --> 00:41:49,078
and their interaction with soil

842
00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:51,450
pathogens Alan thanks Larry and you can

843
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:54,690
see quite a number of speakers that we

844
00:41:51,449 --> 00:41:57,298
have today but really I want to say is

845
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:59,190
as a seed guy to be a part of the

846
00:41:57,298 --> 00:42:01,920
Cornell hemp team has been really

847
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:03,900
rewarding with this project pathologist

848
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,450
plant breeders a canned ray of people in

849
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:08,039
their expertise is then Chris and Larry

850
00:42:06,449 --> 00:42:10,798
have really pulled together their

851
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:13,199
expertise is so we can move together so

852
00:42:10,798 --> 00:42:15,210
so that's been really rewarding so my

853
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:17,879
program in the area of seed Science and

854
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:19,650
Technology besides what I'm going to be

855
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,530
talking to you on the seed treatment

856
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:24,900
project today is we also try to provide

857
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:26,880
support to their the ongoing project so

858
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,200
we're looking at some of the seed Lots

859
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,680
that are coming in will do the

860
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:33,389
germination purity to see quality so

861
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:35,879
we're doing that in conjunction with

862
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:37,889
with a larger project to kind of move

863
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:42,450
everything forward and so we all kind of

864
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:44,699
learn together Tim talked about in his

865
00:42:42,449 --> 00:42:47,250
presentation from Ag and markets about

866
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:49,828
the big picture going on what's with the

867
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:52,199
farm bill and really if I go back a year

868
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:54,660
ago when we started working with the

869
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:56,848
seed treatments to really pitch this to

870
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:59,639
this ir4 group which is the national

871
00:42:56,849 --> 00:43:02,670
group which fosters registration for

872
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:04,949
specialty crops I kind of got hemp is

873
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:07,889
considered as a specialty crop but that

874
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:09,539
they would be working on biological and

875
00:43:07,889 --> 00:43:11,548
chemical seed treatments and at that

876
00:43:09,539 --> 00:43:16,048
time just a year ago at this time before

877
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:18,480
the 2018 farm bill was passed it was all

878
00:43:16,048 --> 00:43:20,548
the industrial hemp CBD hemp was lumped

879
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,309
in with a recreational cannabis so

880
00:43:20,548 --> 00:43:26,309
there's no pesticides were labeled on

881
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:28,650
this so this is really a void however

882
00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:30,390
there's already very mature materials

883
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:32,099
and special the chemical seed treatments

884
00:43:30,389 --> 00:43:34,019
that are already there and you use this

885
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:37,500
to be grow any other crops or even

886
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:39,210
biological so so really our project was

887
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,280
kind of to pull some of this together

888
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:42,889
some of these promising materials that

889
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,530
already been used commercially

890
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:47,690
on other crops to see how they're going

891
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:49,700
to work on him

892
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:52,550
I want to thank Gary who just talked

893
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:54,949
about first of all the need really have

894
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:56,690
need of getting this crops a direct

895
00:43:54,949 --> 00:43:59,719
seeded crop for an industrial for either

896
00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:02,240
fiber or for grain to get it established

897
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:05,329
and the seed treatments and how that can

898
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:07,609
help that also Gary's group have been

899
00:44:05,329 --> 00:44:10,309
very supportive in providing the

900
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:13,610
pathology support for this project as

901
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:16,579
well so it's fortunate again getting

902
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:18,309
back to this ir4 group again that they

903
00:44:16,579 --> 00:44:20,239
their whole purpose is to foster

904
00:44:18,309 --> 00:44:21,799
registration we have what's called their

905
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:23,989
integrated solutions which is one of

906
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:26,750
their large programs which has become a

907
00:44:23,989 --> 00:44:28,339
multi regional so we have field studies

908
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:31,340
they'll be talking about from cornellà

909
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:33,590
two locations we also have field studies

910
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:37,070
in the southern region at Virginia Tech

911
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:38,390
and then also at North Dakota State on

912
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:42,200
the South Center excuse me the

913
00:44:38,389 --> 00:44:46,099
north-central region though so when we

914
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:48,199
did this we've use one variety of anko

915
00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:49,909
as a dual purpose variety and inc has

916
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:51,429
been kind of our white rat that we do

917
00:44:49,909 --> 00:44:54,920
for a lot of our seed quality

918
00:44:51,429 --> 00:44:57,469
investigations good quality seed line to

919
00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:00,170
begin with we've developed my laboratory

920
00:44:57,469 --> 00:45:02,209
I'm kind of working off of this handout

921
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:03,650
if you haven't the evaluation of seed

922
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:06,380
treatments on industrial crops for

923
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:08,329
management of damping off so we have a

924
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:10,160
laboratory scale seed treatment

925
00:45:08,329 --> 00:45:12,079
equipment my program is pretty unique in

926
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:14,539
the in the United States for having

927
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,909
small scale equipment that we can

928
00:45:14,539 --> 00:45:19,699
basically simulate what a larger seed

929
00:45:16,909 --> 00:45:21,889
company would be doing I'm treating many

930
00:45:19,699 --> 00:45:24,379
many pounds of seeds we can treat just

931
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:27,079
an ounce of seed which is fine for most

932
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:29,090
of our trials so we're able to do that

933
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:31,340
in-house to do a lot of screening on

934
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:32,930
what seed treatment binders - some of

935
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:35,269
the particulars that I'm not going to go

936
00:45:32,929 --> 00:45:37,699
into here but the first thing we want to

937
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:40,579
do is we're seeing this material we're

938
00:45:37,699 --> 00:45:43,279
looking at biological biological so two

939
00:45:40,579 --> 00:45:46,009
major biocontrol agents is either a

940
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,110
beneficial fungi Trichoderma or a

941
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:51,890
beneficial bacteria which are bacillus

942
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:53,960
and then we also had a chemicals

943
00:45:51,889 --> 00:45:56,929
Genta is the only chemical company that

944
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:58,970
stepped up a year ago so very mature

945
00:45:56,929 --> 00:46:02,409
materials the apron Excel Maxum

946
00:45:58,969 --> 00:46:05,899
materials that are widely registered on

947
00:46:02,409 --> 00:46:08,058
vegetable as well as field crops we also

948
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:10,160
have biochemical materials in the

949
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:12,200
chemical group are called phosphites you

950
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:13,788
know phosphate as a fertilizer but the

951
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:16,189
phosphates are unique that their

952
00:46:13,789 --> 00:46:18,259
systemic materials but also been shown

953
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:21,440
in other systems to control Pythium so

954
00:46:18,259 --> 00:46:24,739
we wanted to include that number of

955
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,450
pathogens Pythium just like again gary

956
00:46:24,739 --> 00:46:28,190
kind of set the stage for me to talk

957
00:46:26,449 --> 00:46:30,558
about this the Pythium has kind of been

958
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:32,480
our our key target pathogen but also

959
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:34,910
Fusarium and rhizoctonia that can be

960
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:37,608
there we have a laboratory bioassay that

961
00:46:34,909 --> 00:46:40,129
we screened materials early on just to

962
00:46:37,608 --> 00:46:41,838
look at application rates also if

963
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:43,460
there's any potential phyto toxicity as

964
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:46,130
we're playing materials again for the

965
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:49,670
first time on hemp we don't know what

966
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:52,249
that seed treatment crop combination is

967
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:54,528
going to yield so we did all that type

968
00:46:52,248 --> 00:46:57,018
of background information if you're

969
00:46:54,528 --> 00:46:59,659
interested in the data it's on the back

970
00:46:57,018 --> 00:47:01,969
sheet and to try to simplify because

971
00:46:59,659 --> 00:47:04,009
there's there's 15 treatments and rather

972
00:47:01,969 --> 00:47:06,379
to try to go through all this but color

973
00:47:04,009 --> 00:47:09,139
coded this to really kind of simplify

974
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:11,960
and you can if you don't have it you can

975
00:47:09,139 --> 00:47:14,328
almost see it from here is on the stand

976
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:16,818
improves here and then we say all these

977
00:47:14,329 --> 00:47:19,329
treatments in blue are the chemical c

978
00:47:16,818 --> 00:47:22,308
treatments that's the apron XL maksim

979
00:47:19,329 --> 00:47:25,039
combination doing very well and you

980
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:28,460
would expect that they're very well well

981
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:30,559
developed chemistry's for control the

982
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:33,199
two black treatments are the non treated

983
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:35,599
seats so that's our check and then all

984
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:39,248
these greens are the biological so the

985
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:41,690
biologicals and in our hands on him is

986
00:47:39,248 --> 00:47:44,659
affording really no appreciable

987
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:47,088
protection against early season damping

988
00:47:44,659 --> 00:47:49,190
off this is just based on our two field

989
00:47:47,088 --> 00:47:51,009
studies we had the field study conducted

990
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:53,210
in East Africa and I want to thank Jamie

991
00:47:51,009 --> 00:47:55,579
who just talked to you a few minutes ago

992
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:58,159
helping coordinate that site and then

993
00:47:55,579 --> 00:47:59,539
the Geneva site that Larry's group was

994
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:01,539
very supportive in

995
00:47:59,539 --> 00:48:04,070
in us getting that one launched as well

996
00:48:01,539 --> 00:48:06,409
so we're really at the first year with

997
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:08,390
us at this point in time I'm still

998
00:48:06,409 --> 00:48:10,789
waiting for the data from the Virginia

999
00:48:08,389 --> 00:48:12,500
Tech sites and the North Dakota so we

1000
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:14,269
can start filling this in and again

1001
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:17,269
that's really the purpose of having a

1002
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:19,940
multi-state multi-region project is in

1003
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:22,009
case we have flukes in our data we want

1004
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:24,590
to see what sort of a consistent trends

1005
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:26,540
there would be over the long run we're

1006
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:29,450
in communication now with all the

1007
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:31,639
companies for biological companies the

1008
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:34,309
chemical company things like that so

1009
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:36,109
they are two abreast of this we're going

1010
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:38,659
to be the plans right now would be to

1011
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:41,059
continue this project for a second year

1012
00:48:38,659 --> 00:48:42,500
we'll be tweaking some things going back

1013
00:48:41,059 --> 00:48:44,570
to kind of a drawing board and looking

1014
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:46,460
at especially these biologicals try to

1015
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:48,890
improve their efficacy to get them to

1016
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:52,610
prove prove better especially using

1017
00:48:48,889 --> 00:48:55,369
Pythium as our target pathogen so that's

1018
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:57,680
kind of very quickly in a nutshell kind

1019
00:48:55,369 --> 00:49:00,529
of what we found there's any questions

1020
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:04,039
on this or other seed questions yes the

1021
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:06,200
three use a tip um so I use area Minh

1022
00:49:04,039 --> 00:49:08,300
Rhizoctonia are kind of a three key that

1023
00:49:06,199 --> 00:49:09,769
the pathogen Frankie

1024
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,810
saw born pathogens that would be

1025
00:49:09,769 --> 00:49:14,809
tackling the city and again when we

1026
00:49:11,809 --> 00:49:17,299
focuses that when we had the natural and

1027
00:49:14,809 --> 00:49:19,759
festival with Pythium Gary's group did

1028
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:21,740
the characterization of that Pythium for

1029
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,570
us so we know what pathogen went what

1030
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:26,059
species that we're dealing with and so

1031
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:27,530
it with it with our tell all tell attest

1032
00:49:26,059 --> 00:49:29,960
which is kind of a seed testing

1033
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:33,019
procedure then we can screen things you

1034
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:34,940
know 24/7 and so we can see can what's

1035
00:49:33,019 --> 00:49:38,590
going on which treatments are doing well

1036
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:38,590
which ones are not doing well I meant

1037
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:47,889
okay I'll turn this back over Larry so

1038
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:50,920
we can get a deal this has been a

1039
00:49:47,889 --> 00:49:55,139
production of Cornell University on the

1040
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:55,139
