1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,819
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:10,099
University plus I'll turn it over to you

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,099
and yeah we'll take it from here

4
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:49,649
an insect it could be a disease okay so

5
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:52,800
any any type of a pest that it crops up

6
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:56,250
in us in a farming system can be seen as

7
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,959
a problem in itself and that gives you a

8
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,789
very that gives you a very different

9
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,149
solution then the problem becomes how do

10
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:05,820
you kill the past or it can be seen as a

11
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,609
symptom of the direction that your

12
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:12,089
system has gone in I have found more and

13
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:14,340
more and some sometimes it's not real

14
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,159
apparent but by introducing the right

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,710
new species to the system we can change

16
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,259
the system so that it doesn't become the

17
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:25,079
ideal host for what we consider the

18
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,750
problem and I'm going to digress a

19
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,929
little bit because I we've got a perfect

20
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,790
example that was done here at Cornell of

21
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,670
this concept but it's with a little

22
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,590
different crops and that's dry beans

23
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:40,710
where and that one of the early soil

24
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:44,368
health tests came out of this where we

25
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:47,938
were growing dry beans and then waiting

26
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:50,219
five years and coming back and the same

27
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:52,709
disease complex that had been in the

28
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:55,679
roots of the dry beans was back almost

29
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:57,839
as if we hadn't rotated and we were

30
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,530
blaming the varieties we were looking

31
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,710
for organic fungicides until Georgia

32
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,989
Bowie took me aside once and said this

33
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:08,878
problem has nothing to do with your

34
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:10,769
reactive stuff it has to do with how

35
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,169
you've been farming with what your

36
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,680
system is what he explained was that we

37
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:16,679
were wrote

38
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,750
two grasses and other legumes the other

39
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,200
legumes were co-hosts to the same set of

40
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,019
problems that were in the dry bean roots

41
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:26,250
and specifically there were two problems

42
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:29,968
that were building up because of our

43
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:33,239
lack of diversity one was the fungi the

44
00:02:29,968 --> 00:02:35,310
Pythium or Isaac tonyia the Fusarium the

45
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,060
other was pathogenic nematodes which

46
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,799
were opening up the roots and creating a

47
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:44,598
big highway for all the pathogens to

48
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:48,329
move in and whenever we had a wet spring

49
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:51,179
in that situation we had the roots rot

50
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:54,389
off and a lousy crop of beans what

51
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,950
George suggested was why don't you mix

52
00:02:54,389 --> 00:03:00,150
up your system a little bring in some

53
00:02:55,949 --> 00:03:02,459
other species wheat and this this is

54
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:05,639
actually the perfect slide for it after

55
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:08,310
the corn we decided to shift gears we

56
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:11,939
frost seeded yellow mustard yellow

57
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:14,218
mustard gives off has glucosinolates in

58
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:16,530
it it gives off a cyanide gas at vial

59
00:03:14,218 --> 00:03:19,228
fumigate the soil kills the pathogenic

60
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:22,560
nematodes but it also seems to get rid

61
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:24,120
of the fungal complex and within a

62
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,310
couple of years of changing our system

63
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,590
our dry bean yields had gone from about

64
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,719
900 pounds to where we actually had one

65
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:34,109
field that produced 4000 pounds of dark

66
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:37,289
red kidneys it on average it doubled our

67
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:39,659
yields just to add and this would have

68
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:42,719
been early spring we've frost seeded

69
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:46,258
no-tell after corn in March yellow

70
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:49,469
mustard and incorporated it in June when

71
00:03:46,258 --> 00:03:51,328
it was time to plant the dry beans the

72
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:53,609
big concept here I don't want to belabor

73
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:55,669
that particular practice and we have to

74
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:58,650
separate between systems and practices

75
00:03:55,669 --> 00:04:01,409
you know we've got a problem and you

76
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,180
described it really well Matt was we

77
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,918
tend to have this mindset if I want to

78
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,540
add this really good practice to a

79
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,180
system but if it's not compatible with

80
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:12,179
the system it's not going to work so in

81
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,799
in this case we changed our system to

82
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,310
remove the reason that we had the

83
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:19,858
buildup of the problem now when we try

84
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:24,028
to create a system that incorporates the

85
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:26,069
rolled rye in the no-till and again this

86
00:04:24,028 --> 00:04:27,159
is a good example of how do we reimagine

87
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:30,040
the system

88
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:34,050
but I think we're gaining quite a lot by

89
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:36,280
having more diversity in our farm by

90
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:41,710
eliminating some of these pitfalls that

91
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:43,329
create pest problems and I there's a

92
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:46,239
piece of research that I would love to

93
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:47,979
see done here at Cornell Penn State or

94
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,220
anywhere that they're willing to do it

95
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:55,710
is I believe every species that we grow

96
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:59,650
changes the soil and makes it the ideal

97
00:04:55,709 --> 00:05:01,349
environment for some other species it

98
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:03,759
makes it a terrible environment for some

99
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:06,189
make it's probably neutral for others

100
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,310
and we have this spectrum just like with

101
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:13,060
herbicides there's a control spectrum I

102
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:15,970
would like to see some work done on how

103
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:19,180
these species interact so when we put

104
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:21,670
Ryan to roll it my observation is that

105
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:25,959
why is either neutral or beneficial to

106
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:27,759
soybeans it's extremely hazardous to

107
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:29,739
some other species in fact once I

108
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,269
thought I had a great idea this was back

109
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,480
when I first started talking with Matt

110
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:36,039
of picking other allelopathy species so

111
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:42,390
that we could follow the Rye with

112
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:42,390
no-till sunflowers that was a bad idea

113
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,969
rye will literally kill sunflowers it's

114
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,060
one of the most easily controlled

115
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:54,160
species for the effects that the Rye has

116
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,160
and we call that allelopathy I think

117
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,320
we're I think we're oversimplifying it

118
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,580
allelopathy is plant chemicals that are

119
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:02,050
given off by the roots but there are

120
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:04,240
other modes of action that are going on

121
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,460
a plant like rye that uses a lot of

122
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,579
nitrogen is also suppressing species

123
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:11,589
that need a lot of available nitrogen

124
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:13,689
every species has a group of microbes in

125
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:16,779
the soil if we don't have the right

126
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:18,129
microbes in the soil then we're

127
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:20,439
suppressing something and that's where

128
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:23,409
we got in trouble growing other legumes

129
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:24,939
with dry beans we were building up us a

130
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,740
lot of species in the soil that made

131
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:29,500
that soil not be a healthy environment

132
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,990
for the crop we were trying to grow so

133
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,870
this inner species type of research I

134
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:37,750
think could inform us in our no-till

135
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:40,449
systems as to how do we use the cover

136
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:42,490
crops as a way to improve the

137
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:44,199
environment for the intended crop and

138
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,569
then how do we create it into a circle

139
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,400
so that we're actually optimizing the

140
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:53,139
system using the right cover crops to

141
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:55,329
give the desired conditions a few things

142
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:58,240
that we've tried on the farm and I'm way

143
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:59,378
out ahead of the science here but we

144
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,838
have to try new things to take

145
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:05,139
observations is we've noticed that if we

146
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:06,759
put tillage radish in the fall with our

147
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:08,800
winter grains that we actually have a

148
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,439
slight increase in yield one to two

149
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,329
pounds of tillage radish put in with

150
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,960
winter wheat has given us and observed

151
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:18,519
yield boost we also have noticed that

152
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:22,838
when we've had problems with the rolled

153
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:24,459
R I sometimes even though it improves

154
00:07:22,838 --> 00:07:26,620
soil structure if we've had really bad

155
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:28,598
weather and especially bad weather when

156
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,788
we establish the Rye we've got some

157
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:32,438
legacy effect of not really great soil

158
00:07:30,788 --> 00:07:35,468
structure it makes the planter network

159
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:38,379
as good makes it harder to get the seed

160
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:41,019
placement where you want so by putting

161
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:43,240
the tillage radish in the system our

162
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:45,430
theory is that we're going to be

163
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,588
penetrating the soil loosening it up and

164
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,139
actually mitigating possible legacy

165
00:07:47,588 --> 00:07:53,408
problems in the soil structure improving

166
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:55,838
the soil health and if it is at a if

167
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:59,498
it's in at a population that helps or as

168
00:07:55,838 --> 00:08:02,168
neutral to the Rye we could pre we could

169
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:06,099
be creating a better root situation for

170
00:08:02,168 --> 00:08:07,359
no telling in to I've seen suggestions

171
00:08:06,098 --> 00:08:09,639
that maybe we should be putting them in

172
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,639
rows that would be a really interesting

173
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,110
concept but again I'm out ahead of where

174
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,389
the science is I'm trying to throw out

175
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:19,199
ideas format I'll Drive him crazy with

176
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:19,199
ideas before

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,680
and I'm Klaus Martin's we're certified

178
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,750
organic farmers for over 20 years we

179
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,139
farm just an hour from here we've worked

180
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:38,649
very closely with Cornell ever since I

181
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:40,809
can remember and a lot of the work

182
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:44,470
that's been done here we've cooperated

183
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:46,000
with and advised and and I think it's

184
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,820
been a very complimentary thing where

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,820
observations made in the field are being

186
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,590
tested here we're finding that the

187
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,480
research that is being done I'm gonna

188
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,879
put in a plug for the farming systems

189
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,370
trial the long term organic farming

190
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:03,120
systems trial here was informed by

191
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:07,330
what's happening out on farmer's fields

192
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,919
but at this point it is been consistent

193
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,509
enough and has moved ahead far enough so

194
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:13,419
I think it's going to start informing

195
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:15,370
what farmers do know that that's been a

196
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:18,370
real big benefit and I think there's

197
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:20,860
been a synergy between Cornell and the

198
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:23,080
organic farmers in this region that has

199
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,490
resulted in Cornell being ahead of most

200
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,230
of the rest of the country on organic

201
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:28,539
research but also the New York farmers

202
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:31,269
being ahead of farmers and other parts

203
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:32,860
of the country and I have I talk at a

204
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:34,480
lot of Midwestern meetings where people

205
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,669
come up and they're envious of us for

206
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,920
living next to Cornell for the kind of

207
00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:40,809
support we've gotten in the quality of

208
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:44,709
the research that has helped us move

209
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:48,239
ahead in our yields so I'm going to drop

210
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:50,320
that part of the talk and go back to

211
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,120
adaptive management I think that's what

212
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,350
you started talking about and it really

213
00:09:52,120 --> 00:10:00,129
is important so we'll go back to 2016 we

214
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:04,080
had planted 70 acres which was a big

215
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:06,370
jump for us of Rye for role down and

216
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,550
believe it or not we were much drier

217
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:11,230
than musgrave we had less we had three

218
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:14,349
inches less rain during the summer than

219
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:18,039
musgraves did and that was kind of a

220
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:20,290
disaster in terms of drought we had

221
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:22,599
three inches of rain total from May 26

222
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:26,709
until the end of the growing season and

223
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,540
had gone six weeks with under an inch so

224
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,009
you can imagine what our no-till

225
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:31,929
soybeans look like they actually yield

226
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:34,929
it only 200 pounds less

227
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:37,809
ones at Musgrave but we could have done

228
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:41,139
really really well because I did

229
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:43,449
chickened out on our worst field when I

230
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:45,970
saw how dry it was and we decided to

231
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:48,670
harvest at his Ryland the Rye llege was

232
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:52,028
a really profitable crop because in the

233
00:10:48,669 --> 00:10:54,189
severe drought forage prices doubled so

234
00:10:52,028 --> 00:10:55,929
it was an adaptive management where even

235
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,130
though we had to change our plan we were

236
00:10:55,929 --> 00:11:00,250
able to change it to something more

237
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:03,370
profitable now hindsight's 2020 I should

238
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:05,440
have done that with all of our in fact

239
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,179
one of our fields some amount if

240
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,250
somebody had grown hairy vetch once and

241
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:12,759
it was a mixture of hairy vetch and rye

242
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,320
that was about nine tons or nine

243
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:16,809
thousand pounds per acre of dry matter

244
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,810
the stuff was over the hood of a big

245
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:21,429
tractor by about two feet I imagine the

246
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:23,949
forage that we could have harvested on

247
00:11:21,429 --> 00:11:26,949
that instead of getting a piddly 900

248
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:29,560
pound crop of soybeans but what we

249
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,028
followed that with and because this was

250
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:32,439
our worst field we knew that there

251
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:35,350
wasn't enough water you couldn't even

252
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:38,790
plow that land it was so dry so we know

253
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:42,220
tilled sorghum Sudan grass into it

254
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:44,708
sorghum Sudan grass it was that was a BM

255
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:49,180
our sorghum Sudan is able to tolerate

256
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:51,250
much drier soil than soybeans we

257
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:53,639
actually harvested our biggest and most

258
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:56,070
profitable crop off the poorest field

259
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:59,470
because we have pulled a big crop of

260
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:02,740
chop triage and then we pulled two

261
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:04,528
cuttings of sorghum Sudan it's amazing

262
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:08,080
you can get as much dry matter as you do

263
00:12:04,528 --> 00:12:09,759
from a crop like that but this kind of

264
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,320
adaptive management really drives

265
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,600
researchers crazy because it can't be

266
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,028
replicated it's it's kind of a

267
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,430
seat-of-the-pants thing but it is its

268
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:21,370
opportunities that we can build into a

269
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:23,349
system like that and by going from the

270
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:24,820
what would have been the crimp try to

271
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,930
harvesting forage putting in sorghum

272
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:32,050
Sudan we went back to a winter grain

273
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:33,879
which made a good crop the next year so

274
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:35,049
that that's one of those adaptive

275
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,610
management tools

276
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:38,879
another adaptive management tool and

277
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:43,509
we've been talking with Aaron Silva in

278
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:45,139
Wisconsin is the system was developed at

279
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:47,659
about route 80

280
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:50,178
and Raya is crimped at the right time of

281
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:53,838
year to get the best soybean yield if

282
00:12:50,178 --> 00:12:55,639
you're at that latitude we're really

283
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,019
close to route 90 a little different

284
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:58,639
latitude there's about a 10 day

285
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:00,528
discrepancy between when you ought to be

286
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,980
planting soybeans and when you ought to

287
00:13:00,528 --> 00:13:05,328
be rolling the Rye determinated what

288
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,798
they're doing in Wisconsin is just

289
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:08,028
planting the Rye when it's time or

290
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:10,428
planting the soybeans when it's time to

291
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:12,668
plant soybeans and then crimping the Rye

292
00:13:10,428 --> 00:13:15,769
later when it's time to crimp the ride

293
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:20,869
when we were coming into the severe

294
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:23,058
drought in 2016 we actually had plenty

295
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:25,759
of dry matter and we crimped well before

296
00:13:23,058 --> 00:13:27,379
an thesis to stop water loss the reason

297
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:29,720
we had even the nine hundred pounds were

298
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:31,428
that really miserable drought was that

299
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,928
we were able to stop much of the water

300
00:13:31,428 --> 00:13:38,539
loss when we came back at about two

301
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:42,678
weeks the soybeans were this high and

302
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:44,480
the Rye was getting right back up so we

303
00:13:42,678 --> 00:13:45,828
took the crimper and I tried several

304
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,739
different things but we went in the

305
00:13:45,828 --> 00:13:51,039
opposite direction and we had did no

306
00:13:48,739 --> 00:13:53,028
damage whatsoever to those soybeans

307
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:56,539
running over them and they were drilled

308
00:13:53,028 --> 00:13:57,828
they were narrow rows but we didn't hurt

309
00:13:56,539 --> 00:13:59,659
them with the tires and we didn't hurt

310
00:13:57,828 --> 00:14:01,479
them with the crimper and we were able

311
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:04,068
to flatten and terminate those that rye

312
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,808
going in the opposite direction a couple

313
00:14:04,068 --> 00:14:08,319
weeks later when it was time when it was

314
00:14:05,808 --> 00:14:11,439
an thesis and it was time to terminate

315
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,440
[Music]

316
00:14:19,948 --> 00:14:23,740
kill of the ride Chesley Clause the

317
00:14:22,448 --> 00:14:27,399
saying that's what we're getting and

318
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:28,980
maximizing our soybean yield and so this

319
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,600
idea of this threshold you know

320
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:34,360
maximizing your bottom s I think like

321
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:42,730
you say that that may work better south

322
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:45,009
of here that's right and just deal with

323
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:47,070
whatever we need to with the right not

324
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:49,240
being ready he's coming back and again

325
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:52,329
we're doing something else

326
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:55,919
yeah pretty consistent never see the

327
00:14:52,328 --> 00:14:58,328
entire yield so a couple of months ago

328
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:01,719
we brought in somebody to do a program

329
00:14:58,328 --> 00:15:03,309
at our farm and we talked about New York

330
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,980
is too far north you know all these

331
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:08,500
advantages you have at route 80 but this

332
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:13,060
guy was growing organic no-till grains

333
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:15,899
and vegetables in Germany I know it

334
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:18,250
would be like being up north of Toronto

335
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:20,740
far north of Toronto for at the latitude

336
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:23,470
he was working at and he showed us some

337
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:25,269
tools some techniques and some ideas

338
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:27,970
that were giving him extremely

339
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:31,480
successful results far north of where it

340
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:34,089
should be possible to do right I I met

341
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,370
one of his classmates once he'd been

342
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:38,230
he'd went to school in Germany and the

343
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:40,419
professor was talking about no-till and

344
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,620
saying organic no-till is very

345
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:43,059
successful talking about the Rodale

346
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,100
system but it can't possibly be done

347
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:46,899
this far north and this is one of these

348
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,089
guys that you can picture him he popped

349
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:53,948
out and so I've been doing it for three

350
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:57,269
years what's the problem I'm sure you

351
00:15:53,948 --> 00:16:01,659
love students that do that kind of thing

352
00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:04,149
so what Yan Hendrick has done he had

353
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:07,000
looked at what is it that tillage does

354
00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:10,659
and how do we achieve that without

355
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:15,759
tillage and I think those are really

356
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:18,809
important questions to frame so that

357
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:22,000
that kind of opens it up to more ideas

358
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:24,789
what he was his goal was actually to

359
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
grow vegetables and he came up with the

360
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:31,088
idea of transfer mulch he made some

361
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,889
mental filters in his mind these were

362
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:33,510
rules that he farmed within so he said

363
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:34,860
one rule

364
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:37,980
I'm not going to import any organic

365
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,629
matter from off the field so within

366
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,279
those rules he would take cover crop

367
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:44,370
like when you head to clover

368
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:47,159
if he didn't need it for mulch didn't

369
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:51,810
need it for anything else he would chop

370
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:56,610
it and cover it to ferment and would

371
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:58,399
store it or if he had beds he would chop

372
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,649
the cover crop from between the beds and

373
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,090
put it on the beds

374
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:04,650
he found that when you crimped and you

375
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:06,779
didn't have enough biomass to control

376
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:09,060
the weeds you could bring in transfer

377
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:11,220
mulch to get up to the right amount of

378
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:13,500
biomass and control the weeds the other

379
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,640
thing he found with the transfer of

380
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:19,380
mulch and this is the other thing

381
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:22,110
tillage does is it produces it releases

382
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,490
fertility now when you till you start a

383
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:25,919
biological fire in the soil you're

384
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:28,559
burning up organic material and

385
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,810
releasing minerals that the crop that's

386
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,460
growing hopefully needs at the right

387
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:35,339
time is when they're released because if

388
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,870
you're if you do tillage that releases

389
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:38,609
these minerals not when the crop needs

390
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:39,779
them it's basically recreational tillage

391
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:41,189
and you're putting stuff out there that

392
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:43,200
either is going to leach into the water

393
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,820
or the weeds are going to use it and

394
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,769
that that's one of the problems of

395
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:49,439
tillage it can actually increase weeds

396
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:52,099
even though it's a tool used to reduce

397
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,259
weeds so he started looking at how much

398
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:58,859
mulch does it take to control the weeds

399
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:59,309
but also what composition of mulch do

400
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:02,759
you need

401
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:05,609
what CN ratio and what chap length so

402
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:09,629
what particle size to release fertility

403
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:12,509
in time with when the crop needs it now

404
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,850
those concepts really stretched my

405
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:16,559
thinking and he along with these

406
00:18:14,849 --> 00:18:20,399
concepts he said well let's look at this

407
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:22,859
crimper and when you use this the

408
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,780
organic matter lasts the longest and we

409
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:28,469
had a little discussion about the

410
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:31,139
temperature so he said how about if I

411
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:34,289
sharpened the backside of those blades

412
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,120
and put a hitch on the other end so now

413
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:39,269
if he wanted the organic matter to last

414
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:41,939
as long as possible he would run it the

415
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:43,529
way we're doing here if he was in a

416
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,880
hurry if he wanted to warm the ground up

417
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:47,019
quicker and wanted it to break down

418
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,510
faster remember it's a it's a cool

419
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:50,829
damp environment where he is he would

420
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:53,769
run in the other direction and it would

421
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:55,960
chop and he could speed up the

422
00:18:53,769 --> 00:19:00,519
degradation in the breakdown by about 40

423
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:02,410
percent then he got a machine that would

424
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:03,639
actually it was a flail more it's a

425
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:06,460
little higher tech than the ones we have

426
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:09,970
here that would cut right to the surface

427
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:11,860
and shred the material and that would

428
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:15,539
increase the breakdown speed by more

429
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:19,449
than double so that gave him some tools

430
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:21,009
that he could use to make those

431
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,769
disadvantages that he had in to

432
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:25,839
advantages there's no reason we can't be

433
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:29,529
using those tools I would love to see

434
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:31,980
some work done here with you know what

435
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:34,389
happens if we use use this for chopping

436
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,569
you know maybe if we're crimping the

437
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:39,280
second time over we ought to be cutting

438
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:41,019
that could be cutting the heads off late

439
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:45,309
enough so that we're not getting the

440
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:46,329
grain ripening afterwards so sorry I'm

441
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,589
not giving you a whole lot of answers

442
00:19:46,329 --> 00:19:50,879
here I'm just trying to throw out

443
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:50,879
questions for the researchers

444
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:07,128
but I

445
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:10,490
things like one of the major bottlenecks

446
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,420
is rolling

447
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,420
getting that time period right

448
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:34,880
I'm involved in this program but also

449
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:37,670
people are looking at it serial and I'm

450
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,710
trying to look at earlier Rosalie and

451
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:41,210
their species so that's why we're

452
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,829
looking at partly because it matures a

453
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,900
little bit earlier we thought that we

454
00:20:42,829 --> 00:20:46,339
get in and deal with the battery we just

455
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:49,910
were getting as much weed suppression

456
00:20:46,339 --> 00:20:51,109
with that so people are thinking about

457
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:56,630
it and approaching in from different

458
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:59,990
ways breeding is one of them but and

459
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:02,150
Hendrik was also using mixtures and he

460
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,769
he was doing prescriptions depending on

461
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,840
what you were going to plant afterwards

462
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:08,089
and when it was going to be planted for

463
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:09,919
things that would be later or earlier so

464
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:11,240
it was not just the mechanical but this

465
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,930
this is work that's really compatible

466
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,930
with what you're doing

467
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:25,290
I see one of the barriers to growers

468
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,289
implementing some of these

469
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:33,660
and the last seniors and we're more

470
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,660
expensive than the road

471
00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:41,250
blowers you just don't run it with the

472
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:44,259
younger in the video

473
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:47,500
I've actually tried called the mulcher I

474
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:48,819
I've never done the the mower but this

475
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,490
was this was actually one of behind

476
00:21:48,819 --> 00:21:53,049
Andrews point he said he didn't have a

477
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,930
lot of money and he said a lot of

478
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:57,549
farmers don't he said just try things

479
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:59,320
you know and it's the called Amal true

480
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:01,480
did a great job for me but this this

481
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:05,139
crimper isn't that expensive at least on

482
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:11,170
in the no-tell planners and drills can

483
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:12,730
be rented oh okay that's a good

484
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:15,400
challenge for your Conservation District

485
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:17,740
in our County the Conservation District

486
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,300
had one for twenty years now there are

487
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:50,440
five of them in the area that are for

488
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:53,230
rent that farmers have we actually have

489
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,900
a neighbor who is a brilliant no tiller

490
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:58,779
he's conventional he bought an old

491
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:01,390
single disc drill and he waits until a

492
00:22:58,779 --> 00:23:03,519
rain and he gets his cover crops to

493
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,590
