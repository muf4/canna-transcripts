1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:04,940
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,939
University

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:12,580
it's interesting when we compare notes

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,130
some of the things that heather has said

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,500
I'm going to say again and the reason

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:20,769
being is what we both found they are

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:23,439
critical steps in success with these

8
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:26,169
crops that's why we repeat them because

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:29,769
that's what we've been finding now

10
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:32,049
basically winter cover crops are really

11
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:35,289
a winter forages basically a cover crop

12
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:38,229
on steroids you get all the benefits and

13
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:40,058
then some why because as she said you

14
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:42,308
put some management into growing this

15
00:00:40,058 --> 00:00:45,369
stuff you put some effort in it really

16
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:47,619
comes back to benefit you in multiple

17
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:50,468
ways you get all the soil nutrient

18
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:53,820
benefits and you get a return on your

19
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:56,740
checkbook that spring

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,950
with winter forages we're increasing our

21
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:02,980
yield per acre 25 to 35 percent getting

22
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:06,820
six to ten tons a very high quality feed

23
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:09,099
early when we had the drought in 16 a

24
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:11,229
lot of people put it in because they

25
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:13,799
needed feed early in the next spring and

26
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:16,630
that gave them the earliest feed it

27
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,030
produces forage for the high and fresh

28
00:01:16,629 --> 00:01:21,819
cows we can all make heifer feed we can

29
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,680
all make low Kathy you can't always make

30
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:26,439
that creampuff stuff for the high cows

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,110
this is for the high cows and I've got a

32
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:31,868
number of farmers who have told me they

33
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:34,599
grow it specifically to feed in the

34
00:01:31,868 --> 00:01:37,269
summer because one day heat turns on and

35
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:39,549
the cows lump they put that in the diet

36
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:42,879
there is no slump the cows keep milking

37
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:45,219
right on through and dick grant up at

38
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:48,069
miner Institute said that's because of

39
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:50,200
the very high end DFT digestibility of

40
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:52,419
this stuff they can digest that fiber

41
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,490
without producing a lot of heat so they

42
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:57,370
keep on milking so guys grow it

43
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:59,349
specifically for the high cows and they

44
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:03,850
get all the benefits of a cover crop

45
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:06,969
while doing it if you put nitrogen on

46
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:09,879
and sulfur you need sulfur you're gonna

47
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:13,419
get crude protein equal or beating a lot

48
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:15,669
of the legumes 20% you're going to have

49
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:18,219
an energy level taking that flag leaf

50
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:21,339
stage you'll have an energy level within

51
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:25,180
that energy of lactation equaling what a

52
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:28,180
lot of corn silage is have and if you

53
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:31,540
look at the TPN BFD the total tract and

54
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,849
the F digestibility corn silage average

55
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:39,359
corn silage or alpha average alfalfa is

56
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:42,909
42 good stuff is 48 and this stuff is 66

57
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,220
really good feed guys have started

58
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:47,530
growing this now comeback and they grow

59
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:50,050
it again and again again because of the

60
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:53,560
milk you can get out of this

61
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:56,530
now the economics on it economics are

62
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,900
driven a lot by yield it runs between

63
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,840
seven tenths of a tonne per acre to two

64
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,520
tons per acre two tons per acre is worst

65
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,420
case scenario you need a shot of

66
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:09,010
nitrogen in there and one ton dry matter

67
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:11,739
reduction in the corneal and I'll

68
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:14,709
explain why that occurs in a minute

69
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:17,560
we're gonna come up and this may this

70
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:19,540
appear especially based on work that

71
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,000
heather has been doing with these short

72
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:24,639
seeds and corn varieties that really

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,770
crank out the yield go look at her work

74
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,869
you could see short season varieties we

75
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:31,200
can grow that really pushed the yield

76
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:35,379
you don't always need a yield hit

77
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:37,959
optimum planting date for us where I am

78
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:42,299
I'm just south of Albany New York ten

79
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:46,240
days to two weeks before we that is the

80
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:48,730
500-pound gorilla in the room for yield

81
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,909
you need to get it in the ground as she

82
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:55,389
said ten days to two weeks before your

83
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:57,789
wheat planting date my wheat planting

84
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:59,859
date is September 20th ten days before

85
00:03:57,789 --> 00:04:03,759
that I need to have this in the ground

86
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:07,330
September 5th or September 10th but we

87
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:10,419
need to get the corn off then to do that

88
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,830
by not planting it early by planting it

89
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:14,619
in October because that's when we put

90
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:17,519
cover crops on right well there goes 20%

91
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:20,980
of our yield right off the top it's gone

92
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,530
because you need those early heat units

93
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,920
to drive the tillering as she said you

94
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:29,259
get nine tillers instead of a one or two

95
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,449
tillers so if you were gonna plant late

96
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:33,849
and add more seed and seed guys like the

97
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:36,339
Celje to do you're going to have to put

98
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,680
450 pounds of seed out there to get the

99
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:41,060
same yield which is ridiculous you need

100
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,850
to get it in on time

101
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:46,399
now bill Cox's work found that there was

102
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:49,970
3/4 of a ton of silage lost for every

103
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:52,339
five-day shorter season corn on average

104
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,560
but with Heather and Joe Lawrence's work

105
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:57,139
where they can see that these shorter

106
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,930
season varieties can crank out the yield

107
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:02,870
I had one this year an 82 day variety

108
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:04,639
gave me 30 tons to the acre but we're

109
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:08,180
going to take this as an assumption and

110
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,909
if we go from 105 day to an 85 day so we

111
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:13,879
can get our triticale planted sooner or

112
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:15,650
our where I planted sooner we're going

113
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:20,180
to give up a ton of dry matter which is

114
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:22,699
about 3700 80 pounds of milk we're

115
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,699
replacing it with two to four times a

116
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:29,509
dry matter of winter forage and we're

117
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:33,680
now gaining 8,000 to 16,000 pounds of

118
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:35,959
milk per acre for 3700 we gave up on the

119
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,750
corn go back and look at her short

120
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:40,759
season corn data by shortening up the

121
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,129
corn you're not going to be losing yield

122
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,439
if you double crop and the important

123
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:47,240
part is is we may not even lose yield

124
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,290
with some of these shorter season

125
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:53,379
varieties

126
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:55,810
this is a more graphic example if we did

127
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:57,759
assume that to reach on yield this is

128
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:00,459
what it looks like if we put in a single

129
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,039
long season 20 tonne to the acre versus

130
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:05,409
17 with a double crop but then when you

131
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,200
put on a minimum double crop or an

132
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:10,840
optimum bubble crop we get higher yields

133
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:13,240
and I could explain some of those pieces

134
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:15,849
why it has to do some work with their

135
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,860
climate zone but the bottom line is is

136
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:20,230
now we are getting more yield than with

137
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,900
a full season crop and you're not out

138
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:25,270
there in November chopping corn silage

139
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:27,189
if you're out there in November cut

140
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:29,199
chopping corn silage you are packing the

141
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:32,350
snot out of that ground and you're

142
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,180
getting long-term yield reduction get

143
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,430
your corn off on the ground is dry

144
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:39,240
get your triticale in and then you could

145
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:42,150
take off and keep going

146
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,930
if we remove the residue it makes it

147
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:48,810
easier to plant the next crop now there

148
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:52,348
is a problem with some of this and that

149
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:55,168
is called allelopathy and I was that's

150
00:06:52,348 --> 00:06:56,490
what I had brought up with sorrow who

151
00:06:55,168 --> 00:06:59,459
talked just before lunch

152
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:02,788
allelopathy is real it will inhibit

153
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:07,529
grass crops growing next corn sorghum

154
00:07:02,788 --> 00:07:10,529
death can be inhibited by having winter

155
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:15,329
grain residue there in the ground we get

156
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:17,098
around it by using strip till I sent

157
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:19,490
this in I had another picture of what we

158
00:07:17,098 --> 00:07:22,199
use basically it's a clearing Coulter

159
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,689
that has a little like knives on it and

160
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:27,030
it scrapes the top half inch or inch of

161
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:29,759
dirt away it removes that allelopathy

162
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:32,008
from the plant you plant it into clean

163
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,340
ground and it pops up out of the ground

164
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:37,590
and grows with no problem whatsoever if

165
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:40,649
you don't do that you are going to be

166
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:43,319
taking somewhat of a yield loss they had

167
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:46,228
a 4 ton yield loss at miner Institute

168
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,418
where they planted right into Rye well a

169
00:07:46,228 --> 00:07:50,430
lot of that was allele opacity just

170
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:52,439
inhibiting the plant you scraped that

171
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,598
aside you can use your no-till planter

172
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:57,329
plant right into it this is going to

173
00:07:54,598 --> 00:08:00,689
allow air in water to move in for clay

174
00:07:57,329 --> 00:08:03,000
soils this is huge because clay soils

175
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:05,550
seal over like this countertop on the

176
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,860
first rain air and water can't go in and

177
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,750
out when it rains it all washes off and

178
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,610
takes the soil with it the bridge ends

179
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,620
clays are perfect for that kind of stuff

180
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,050
for sealing over but if your planting

181
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,478
into this all those stems have a root

182
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:21,889
going down into the ground allows air

183
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:24,509
and water in and out

184
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:26,699
okay if we have a lilo pathy it's sort

185
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:28,469
of like getting lemons you know God gave

186
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:31,080
you lemons so what do you do you make

187
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,538
lemonade all right we have a lilo path

188
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:35,309
it keeps weeds from growing

189
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:36,330
lambsquarters pigweed ragweed all those

190
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:38,549
keeps from growing

191
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,288
it keeps the corn crop from growing it

192
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:43,829
keeps the sorghum crop from growing it

193
00:08:40,288 --> 00:08:46,649
doesn't affect legumes so we said well

194
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:48,600
duh normally people don't like to put in

195
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:50,730
legumes very often they don't like to

196
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,820
rotate why because they only get a half

197
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,769
a crop seeding year and so then the

198
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,510
second year you get full year and that

199
00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:00,299
yield and then you'll start to come off

200
00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:02,819
over time afterwards so we don't want to

201
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:07,049
see down and take a half a crop you have

202
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:09,960
an option you grow winter forage you

203
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:12,120
take off two to four tons of dry matter

204
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,580
come back in and they'll tell your

205
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,519
alfalfa into it getting one cutting of

206
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:21,480
alfalfa and the total yield that year is

207
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:25,500
equal to your full years you never take

208
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:29,750
a yield loss you now get a full yield on

209
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:32,879
that year and added benefit on that is

210
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,539
first of all the wind stays up and off

211
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,059
of it

212
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:40,019
some guys found that this late last year

213
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:43,079
when it was really dry they planted

214
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:46,439
their raw alfalfa no-till into triticale

215
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,450
stubble and it still grew it kept that

216
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,560
drying wind off of those little plants

217
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,860
they could get established

218
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:55,739
they took off and grew it works with

219
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:59,250
alfalfa red clover and soybeans it works

220
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:01,528
very well no tilling it in it reduces

221
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,659
seeding risks as I just pointed out an

222
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:05,250
increase is seeding year yield which I

223
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:07,439
just mentioned a minute ago

224
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,879
you've got your total yield stops

225
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,740
erosion loss

226
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:16,350
I had a farmer call me up here about

227
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:18,839
about in July or August and he said I

228
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,180
put in five six hundred acres of alfalfa

229
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,910
this year plowed it all up smooth it all

230
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:26,219
up planted alfalfa on the whole thing I

231
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:28,350
had a hundred and fifty acres of

232
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:31,259
triticale I motored off and I no tilled

233
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:33,750
alfalfa and this year we had a lot of

234
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:34,740
gully washers downpours he had it in

235
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:38,700
June he got

236
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:42,480
hammer he says I've got 5 to 600 acres

237
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:44,399
of gullies rocks and no seeding because

238
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,740
the fields washed out and I have a

239
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,519
hundred and fifty acres of creampuff

240
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,278
alfalfa

241
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,919
that's doing just fine thank you this

242
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:57,059
question to me was does it justify the

243
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:58,439
cost of a new no-till drill so I gave

244
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:00,179
them the names of a couple people to

245
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,040
talk to he never talked to him I think

246
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:03,659
he just wanted a reality check he went

247
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:06,269
out and bought the no-till drill he's

248
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:08,789
doing all his leggings this way and the

249
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:11,278
other benefit that happens on big farms

250
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:14,338
it inhibits weeds I mentioned it moves

251
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:16,080
the workload the first nice week the

252
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:18,330
first nice day in April you're a week

253
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,800
behind second nice day in April you're

254
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,839
two weeks behind isn't it the way the

255
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:23,759
workload usually goes you're trying to

256
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,490
get seedings in your ground work table

257
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,990
stones planted and spread manure and get

258
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,509
that ground worked up so you can plant

259
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:32,669
corn all at the same time we take all

260
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:35,129
the seedings and we move them right out

261
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:37,289
of there come springtime you spread your

262
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:40,620
manure you plant your corn come in

263
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:43,078
harvest your triticale or rye take it

264
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,789
off go get your grass fields triticale

265
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:46,889
comes off just before the cool season

266
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:48,899
grasses so you take your triticale you

267
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:51,000
take your cool season grasses then go to

268
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:53,250
your alfalfa grass mixes finish up with

269
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,328
good alfalfa now it's beginning of June

270
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:59,039
come back in that field spray it with a

271
00:11:57,328 --> 00:12:00,870
quart of roundup and accorded to for

272
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:04,110
just a cord around him I'm sorry a

273
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:06,929
quarter roundup or less I've used a half

274
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:09,149
cord around them and a high gallonage of

275
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:10,588
water 17 18 gallons yet here you hose it

276
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:12,778
down because there's a lot of little

277
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:14,190
shoots in plants coming up you wipe them

278
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:18,689
out come back in with your no-till

279
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:21,270
planter this field had no post merchant

280
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:22,529
herbicide that's what it looks like

281
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:26,069
pretty good

282
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:30,419
it will grow very well this has been a

283
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:32,940
huge sleeper in winter forages that few

284
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:34,699
people have realized works and it works

285
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,730
really well

286
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:39,680
now managing this for forage you have to

287
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:42,110
management's had there touched on this

288
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,819
you have a fall nitrogen management and

289
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,100
you have a spring nitrogen management

290
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,810
and there are two very different pieces

291
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,200
but they are interrelated

292
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:53,659
Sarah's talk just before lunch here

293
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,360
today was right in the the ballroom was

294
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:58,579
right on target with terms of tying up

295
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:02,240
nitrogen from the fall keeping it out of

296
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:05,570
the water the biomass that you have is

297
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:09,590
the most important factor it is driven

298
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:12,290
by planting date nitrogen stored is

299
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:15,350
driven by biomass times the planting

300
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:19,129
date 62 pounds of nitrogen we picked up

301
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:20,840
after a corn crop if we planted a late

302
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:23,689
we picked up four pounds where did the

303
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:26,990
60 pounds go into the water supply or

304
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:29,510
denied Rifai neither which is good both

305
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:31,850
our losses to the farm ones a pollutant

306
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:34,789
but if we plant this on time we're gonna

307
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,440
pick up 60 pounds of nitrogen now we

308
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:39,169
have taken this a little bit further

309
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:42,290
you'll see in a minute the benefits that

310
00:13:39,169 --> 00:13:45,500
you get from cover crops or winter

311
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:48,439
forage accrue according to the biomass

312
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:51,409
produced this is planted September 9th

313
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,660
this is planted October 6th this is

314
00:13:51,409 --> 00:13:56,120
going to be not needing any herbicides

315
00:13:53,659 --> 00:13:58,429
this will need a herbicide because

316
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,860
there'll be weeds in it this is tying up

317
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:02,929
the nitrogen adding organic matter the

318
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:06,320
roots are going deeper adding soil

319
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:08,539
structure soil health and producing

320
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,879
those tillers Heather had talked about

321
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:13,490
that give you the yield potential for

322
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:17,360
the next year all of this because you

323
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:19,089
get it in on time on time is very

324
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,490
critical

325
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:23,319
and then dr. Kettering's and myself have

326
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:26,799
both come up with a similar graph here

327
00:14:23,318 --> 00:14:29,799
in our data's our researches each which

328
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:32,799
is as your biomass goes up the pounds of

329
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:35,169
nitrogen stored goes up and I did find

330
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:38,558
out Q that mine didn't have a higher

331
00:14:35,169 --> 00:14:40,808
nitrogen didn't have a higher line with

332
00:14:38,558 --> 00:14:42,759
manure it was the exact same line no

333
00:14:40,808 --> 00:14:47,169
difference that's something new I just

334
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:49,089
figured out yesterday what what we did

335
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:51,278
is we said all right if this will tie up

336
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:54,189
nitrogen what if I put some manure on in

337
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:56,169
the fall because my previous work any

338
00:14:54,188 --> 00:14:58,179
time with what nitrogen on in the fall

339
00:14:56,169 --> 00:15:00,729
I got a yield increase across all

340
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:02,289
nitrogen levels the next year so I said

341
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,509
well I don't want to buy fertilizer and

342
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:06,278
we all got manure we need to unload

343
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:08,350
where are we going to go with it what if

344
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:11,379
we put some on the ground so we came in

345
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:13,778
and we put 4,000 gallons on incorporate

346
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:16,990
it right away and plant it we came in in

347
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:20,850
October put 4,000 on incorporated and

348
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:24,068
planted at the end in November we had

349
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:26,700
123 pounds of nitrogen stored in the

350
00:15:24,068 --> 00:15:29,370
above-ground material

351
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,230
in the October one we had four pounds of

352
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,929
nitrogen everything was still in the

353
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:37,620
soil and much of that was gone by spring

354
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:39,689
they had converted over to nitrate so we

355
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,820
have another piece going on here where

356
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:43,529
we're looking at putting that manure and

357
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,480
we have a new injector it's just been

358
00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:47,009
built it's in Iowa right now they're

359
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,860
trying to get a truck to haul it here

360
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:52,620
and we're gonna try coming in and mid

361
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:55,800
November and injecting right into the

362
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:58,139
sod of the winter forage manure so we

363
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:00,059
don't need nitrogen in the spring so you

364
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:02,309
put it in late it's the ammonia form

365
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:04,169
it's gonna stay there till spring and it

366
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:06,419
warms up it's going to convert to

367
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:08,909
nitrate but as soon as it warms up the

368
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:10,799
grasses the winter forage is already

369
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:13,740
growing and it's gonna suck it right up

370
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:18,599
so remember I said 75 pounds of nitrogen

371
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:20,909
we had a higher nitrogen higher tons of

372
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,740
dry matter to break even we think we can

373
00:16:20,909 --> 00:16:27,629
drop that so we don't need anything in

374
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:29,220
the spring yes I am using instinct with

375
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:32,159
it but we don't know whether it pays or

376
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,980
not we're still working on that my

377
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,870
problem is is the the research is on a

378
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,629
farm that Cornell is selling tomorrow

379
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:42,179
and I've got a sweet talk whoever buys

380
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:43,980
it to let me finish my work so it's

381
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:46,948
we're on tender hooks until tomorrow

382
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:49,139
I'll tell you the answer tomorrow all

383
00:16:46,948 --> 00:16:52,349
right if we put manure on in the fall

384
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:55,139
the following spring we got 14% higher

385
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:57,209
yield where we had put it on versus not

386
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,939
putting manure on where are we doing in

387
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:02,250
October we had 33% higher yield I

388
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:05,939
remember there is still looks back that

389
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:08,338
up there is still a significant portion

390
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:10,980
of that nitrogen is lost because you

391
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:14,159
don't have enough biomass to tie it up

392
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,720
and store it in the crop that is the

393
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,179
critical piece this is an

394
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,699
environmentally sound program this I

395
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:22,950
have real reservations on in terms of

396
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:26,310
polluting the water supply

397
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:28,559
top dressing it in the spring I do not

398
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:30,779
recommend top dressing it in the spring

399
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,359
if you've done a good job planting this

400
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:35,789
in the fall this is what it looks like

401
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:38,219
you spread manure on that it's going to

402
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:40,319
get into the crowd and I have one farm

403
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,420
they refuse to admit anything but I

404
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:46,869
understand why because it's a complete

405
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:51,070
embarrassment put manure on

406
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:53,258
chop the stuff off put it into silo when

407
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:55,089
they started to feed the bunk out they

408
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:58,749
hit it with the loader and the whole

409
00:17:55,089 --> 00:18:02,019
pile slid down in a slimy maggot filled

410
00:17:58,749 --> 00:18:03,909
mess you don't want to feed that to the

411
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:06,399
cows they insisted on it

412
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:07,240
screw the cows up royally making things

413
00:18:06,398 --> 00:18:10,028
even worse

414
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,859
I don't recommend putting manure on the

415
00:18:10,028 --> 00:18:13,990
top of any of this there is some

416
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:16,240
possibilities for injection we are

417
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:18,159
working on that as I go right now

418
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:28,569
hopefully we'll be able to continue the

419
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:30,429
research on it all right yes yes we're

420
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:40,480
gonna probably do it just before

421
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:43,149
Thanksgiving surface application problem

422
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,249
comes back to this we get it mixed into

423
00:18:43,148 --> 00:18:47,349
those crowns this this is this was taken

424
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:49,329
last week that's what my winter forage

425
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:50,769
looks like going in another one just

426
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,359
putting it on top of that it's going to

427
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:54,249
get into the crowns and it's going to be

428
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:56,229
there in spring and that's where you

429
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:57,879
could get into real troubles that's why

430
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:00,399
we're looking at an injector that will

431
00:18:57,878 --> 00:19:02,079
slice through put it into the ground so

432
00:19:00,398 --> 00:19:04,628
we don't have the problem if that works

433
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:06,548
we could theoretically come in in March

434
00:19:04,628 --> 00:19:08,740
when the ground has maybe a little bit

435
00:19:06,548 --> 00:19:11,168
of frost left in it and put that in then

436
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:22,450
we don't know we're way out on a limb on

437
00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:24,159
this my concern would be we're expecting

438
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:26,019
a lot of rain this winter two-hundred

439
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:28,299
percent of normal precipitation we're

440
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:30,069
supposed to be warmer than normal and if

441
00:19:28,298 --> 00:19:32,618
rain is leeching through this and the

442
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:36,649
ground is frozen then it's still running

443
00:19:32,618 --> 00:19:38,839
off in the water that's my concern

444
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:40,759
there's some real hesitancies in here

445
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:42,019
you got to be be careful we don't know

446
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:45,109
all the answers I'm just telling you

447
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:47,119
where we're going with the research okay

448
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:49,519
as Heather said before stage of growth

449
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:52,939
is a bigger effect than the species of

450
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:56,629
grain chose them this is stage 8 at

451
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:59,539
stage 8 it's not ready yet the leaf is

452
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:02,150
still rolled up in the stem here coming

453
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:05,420
out you're not getting full yield this

454
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:07,700
is stage 9 the leaf last leaf is out and

455
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,920
the head is in here this is what we hit

456
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:13,370
for high quality winter for it whether

457
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:15,380
it's rye wheat or barley or triticale

458
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:18,379
this is what we hit right here

459
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:22,580
now I had stage 8 on a Thursday I had

460
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:26,270
stage 9 on a Friday I mean on a Tuesday

461
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:29,299
rather from Thursday to Tuesday and in

462
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:32,150
that timeframe we had a 35% yield

463
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:33,980
increase if I could give you something

464
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,929
to put on to get a 35 percent yield

465
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:39,470
increase you jump on it but in this case

466
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:41,509
you built the factory let it produce let

467
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:44,179
it produce until you get to here now

468
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:46,129
this is stage 10 that's boot stage when

469
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:48,800
we were at 12,000 pounds of milk per cow

470
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:50,780
that was fine but we're at 30,000 pounds

471
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,869
of milk per cow this is where we need to

472
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:56,299
be is that stage 9

473
00:20:53,869 --> 00:21:00,439
that being said a couple of pieces first

474
00:20:56,299 --> 00:21:03,740
Jeff's work showed that triticale the

475
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:07,549
red line here loses quality at a slower

476
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:09,589
rate than as wheat or rye the other

477
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:12,759
piece is what is the temperature of the

478
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:12,759
year you're doing this

479
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:18,519
2010 it was a normal to warm spring as

480
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,190
it went down here's a like either this

481
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:23,919
one or this one this flag leaf stage

482
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:26,019
quality's going down as time went on all

483
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,140
right this is digestibility Katy Reaper

484
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:28,140
our

485
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:34,460
2013 we were at flag leaf stage this is

486
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:37,849
actually boot stage year flag leaf boot

487
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:42,980
and headed out and it's still real

488
00:21:37,849 --> 00:21:45,230
high-quality why it was cold 2013 two

489
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:49,220
hours north of us they had three feet of

490
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:52,430
snow it was down to freezing or just

491
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:55,519
above freezing that night so if it's

492
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:57,890
that cold you don't have to rush quite

493
00:21:55,519 --> 00:22:00,619
as much you have a bigger window to get

494
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:02,420
things done unfortunately usually when

495
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:03,859
it's cold like that it's also damp and

496
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:07,610
rainy and you can't always get out there

497
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:09,439
so it doesn't always work all right it

498
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:11,029
rains for three weeks the stuff is all

499
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,100
headed out what am I going to do with it

500
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:15,349
well first of all is a lot of foreign

501
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:16,609
speed straw so you could chop this stuff

502
00:22:15,349 --> 00:22:20,000
that's head straw and you put it in your

503
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:21,889
TMR the other is at Lake mood through

504
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,619
early milk stage it's intermediate on

505
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:27,259
protein moderate on energy digestibility

506
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:29,529
will not inhibit intake for good heifer

507
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:32,569
growth without the heifers getting fact

508
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:35,420
it makes an excellent heifer feed I have

509
00:22:32,569 --> 00:22:37,250
one farm that grows this for their dry

510
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,529
cows they don't put any manure on that

511
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:42,079
field they draw it grow it for dry cows

512
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:44,240
if I grow red clover and tried to kale

513
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:47,269
the middle of June I'm pulling off 21

514
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,329
tons to the acre of 35% dry matter

515
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:53,240
material if I go just triticale I pulled

516
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:56,389
off 16 almost 17 the farmer says he gets

517
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:58,339
consistently 18 tons to the acre now I

518
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:00,950
would not use red clover I would use

519
00:22:58,339 --> 00:23:03,259
medium red red clover heads out too soon

520
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:05,569
and then at the terior h real fast

521
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:08,089
medium red keeps right on growing and

522
00:23:05,569 --> 00:23:10,639
could produce a lot more yield you look

523
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:13,730
at the dry matters that stuff is bowrekt

524
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,190
to a windrow and go ahead and chop it

525
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:17,990
now if you're doing at stage 9 and

526
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:21,409
you're doing for the milk cows do not

527
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:23,960
mow it to a narrow windrow you need to

528
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:28,159
use wide swaths same day haylage to get

529
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:31,220
that quality in the sugar runs 20

530
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,720
percent 1 year ran 26 percent the guys I

531
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,339
was doing the work with said we can't

532
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,460
use your data nobody's gonna believe us

533
00:23:34,339 --> 00:23:40,129
as 26 percent sugar sunny days cold

534
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,600
nights it'll produce the sugar and as

535
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,730
one farmer said he started worrying

536
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,769
about the cows because when they pulled

537
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:47,480
up with a wagon the mixer wagon with

538
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:50,089
this stuff in it he said all the cows

539
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,829
jump up and come running over to so I

540
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:53,209
said well long as they're doing that I

541
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:55,069
wouldn't worry about it they start

542
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:56,538
rolling to have her start rolling it and

543
00:23:55,069 --> 00:24:01,069
smoking and out back of the barn you can

544
00:23:56,538 --> 00:24:03,710
probably work high yield 6 to 14 tons

545
00:24:01,069 --> 00:24:06,230
the acre two to three times what alfalfa

546
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:08,269
will yield so that means your management

547
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:11,179
for harvesting stuff has to be a little

548
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:12,669
different here the guy was mowing it

549
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:15,860
thought he was doing a really good job

550
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:18,710
60% I cut her bar width you need to be

551
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:20,479
more than 80% of cut her barn well what

552
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,919
we did is we stopped them we opened up

553
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,288
the shields in the front of the Machine

554
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:28,278
yes he was driving on it but now we are

555
00:24:24,288 --> 00:24:30,740
at 80% of cutter bar with the second

556
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:34,278
piece is mowing with these shields down

557
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:36,679
the lawyer shields down versus up when

558
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:39,048
we mow when it down what happens is it

559
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:44,360
comes up it hits it and drops it in a

560
00:24:39,048 --> 00:24:46,429
lump and lumps don't dry this is Curtis

561
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:49,189
Martin in Savannah he was measuring

562
00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:51,919
every two feet was a pile and the piles

563
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:53,570
don't dry he opened it up so it flows

564
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,889
right through and out the back it

565
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:57,439
spreads it uniformly

566
00:24:54,888 --> 00:24:59,538
it's going to dry a whole lot faster

567
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,919
here's the lumps all the way up through

568
00:24:59,538 --> 00:25:05,658
and down and over hook back up this year

569
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,240
we opened up the back of the machine and

570
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:10,700
you can see the difference in the past

571
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:13,069
it lays it out loose fluffy turn them

572
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:15,288
let air through it and let it dry but no

573
00:25:13,069 --> 00:25:17,178
matter what you do as one farmer said if

574
00:25:15,288 --> 00:25:18,888
I grow this right and I'm pulling off

575
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:20,809
three and a half tons of dry matter it

576
00:25:18,888 --> 00:25:23,719
goes out the back of the Machine and it

577
00:25:20,808 --> 00:25:25,548
goes splat and it dries on the outer

578
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,240
three-quarters of an inch and the rest

579
00:25:25,548 --> 00:25:29,940
sits there

580
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:33,240
two hours after mowing we recommend you

581
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:36,028
come in with a cheddar and Ted it lift

582
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,909
and spread it all right it had spread

583
00:25:36,028 --> 00:25:41,069
out you've got to watch your forward

584
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:43,380
speed otherwise you make tedder lumps

585
00:25:41,069 --> 00:25:45,869
that machine can go faster than it can

586
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:48,570
handle the tonnage remember this is two

587
00:25:45,869 --> 00:25:49,769
to three times more than alfalfa and you

588
00:25:48,569 --> 00:25:51,658
go whaling through there with the

589
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:53,579
tractor it's gonna go but it's going to

590
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:55,020
grab big hunks pack them together and

591
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:57,449
throw them out the back of the machine

592
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:59,519
you need to watch your forward speed

593
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:01,980
keep the RPMs up the Watchers forward

594
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,778
speed so it can pull it apart I don't

595
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:07,200
own stock in the company but every

596
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:09,960
farmer I know who has bought of the MIR

597
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:13,950
hook time Tedder says it's a different

598
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:15,630
machine it works very well to do stuff

599
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:18,450
like this it really pulls it apart

600
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:19,110
throws a green on the top and the dry on

601
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:21,028
the bottom

602
00:26:19,109 --> 00:26:23,069
they said it's fascinating the work it

603
00:26:21,028 --> 00:26:26,130
works very well but you do need to Ted

604
00:26:23,069 --> 00:26:28,859
it so harvest you want to mow it wide

605
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:30,539
80% of cutter bar with ten today after

606
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:32,490
two hours of drying if your machine is

607
00:26:30,538 --> 00:26:34,648
not putting at a eighty percent then

608
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:37,288
when you get done mowing the field go in

609
00:26:34,648 --> 00:26:40,889
with the Tedder and tent it out chop it

610
00:26:37,288 --> 00:26:43,950
longer an inch or more we chop BM our

611
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:47,070
corn why we chop it long because if we

612
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:49,140
don't it falls apart and flushes out of

613
00:26:47,069 --> 00:26:51,509
the room and before you get the extent

614
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,480
of digestion that you want this stuff

615
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:56,788
will digest faster than BMR corn will so

616
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,829
you need the longer particles and the

617
00:26:56,788 --> 00:27:01,140
longer particles are less likely to

618
00:26:58,829 --> 00:27:03,210
juice if you don't get it dry enough the

619
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,880
longer the particles are less juicing is

620
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:08,100
going on you want to insulate the same

621
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,470
day as you mow it unless it goes down

622
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:12,808
below 40 degrees if it's below 40 at

623
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:14,880
night down into the 30s you can hold it

624
00:27:12,808 --> 00:27:16,589
overnight you're going to be alright the

625
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,570
temperatures are cold enough otherwise

626
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:20,849
you need to get it in the same day you

627
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:23,369
mow it and then use a homo lactic type

628
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:29,240
bacteria to get those high sugars the

629
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:29,239
ferment at 24 hours 48 hours it's cold

630
00:27:29,319 --> 00:28:06,490
questions wide

631
00:27:32,440 --> 00:28:08,080
in about five minutes yes I'm back and

632
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:11,740
forth on that because I had a study

633
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:15,189
where it was planted early 120 pounds of

634
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:18,910
nitrogen planted October 120 pounds of

635
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:21,460
nitrogen planted October no nitrogen the

636
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:24,519
dead stuff went right on in overall

637
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:27,190
three that's where the water set in

638
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:29,379
March when the ground started the thon

639
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:31,779
you have those virgin clays and you get

640
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,640
these ponds out there in March the snows

641
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:35,980
melting and you get these big Blake's

642
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,470
and apply in spots you don't expect them

643
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:41,579
snow mold comes through and really

644
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:41,579
hammers it at that point

645
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:08,110
did you get any icing all right I

646
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:11,410
haven't run into that Sara ran into it

647
00:29:08,109 --> 00:29:15,849
with hers I haven't run into it but the

648
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:17,500
icing could be a big factor yeah I'll

649
00:29:15,849 --> 00:29:19,089
find out this year because I've got some

650
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,069
stuff that's I think I have two and a

651
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:22,869
half tons a dry matter out there and I

652
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:25,899
had 8,000 gallons of manure before I

653
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:29,559
planted it that's experiment and so that

654
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,970
is set up to get really nail we get the

655
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:33,220
right conditions we'll see what it does

656
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:35,400
but the flipside is when we get it

657
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:38,710
canopy like that if it doesn't SH mush

658
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:40,960
yes you guys get feet of snow if it

659
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:43,269
doesn't SH Moore's down then it actually

660
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,220
protects the crowns from the cold so it

661
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:46,269
can help the other possibility you know

662
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,909
knowing where you're from

663
00:29:46,269 --> 00:29:53,588
there it's probably the wooly mammoths

664
00:29:48,909 --> 00:29:55,028
or mastodons trampled it that's she'll

665
00:29:53,588 --> 00:30:10,569
back over me in the parking lot for that

666
00:29:55,028 --> 00:30:14,700
one I have serious reservations about

667
00:30:10,569 --> 00:30:24,158
the varieties you're growing now those

668
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:25,598
okay the other piece that comes in I

669
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,179
didn't put it in this talk acai had a

670
00:30:25,598 --> 00:30:30,128
limited amount of time you need to get

671
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:32,440
it in especially in your area with your

672
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:35,078
heavier soils and colder temperatures it

673
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:37,119
needs to be an inch and a quarter in the

674
00:30:35,078 --> 00:30:39,608
ground if it's not an inch and a quarter

675
00:30:37,118 --> 00:30:41,348
what happens in the springtime freezing

676
00:30:39,608 --> 00:30:42,308
at all it'll pop it up a half-inch

677
00:30:41,348 --> 00:30:44,528
that's all it takes

678
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:46,209
and then the air dries those roots and

679
00:30:44,528 --> 00:30:47,950
the plant sits there is this little

680
00:30:46,209 --> 00:30:50,589
green stub it never grows and I said

681
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:52,298
winter kill no you didn't get it in the

682
00:30:50,588 --> 00:30:54,128
ground it was a hardware issue the loose

683
00:30:52,298 --> 00:30:55,749
knot at the steering wheel didn't plant

684
00:30:54,128 --> 00:30:57,968
it deep enough you need to get it in the

685
00:30:55,749 --> 00:30:59,709
ground I made that mistake early on I

686
00:30:57,969 --> 00:31:02,619
didn't get a shallow I didn't get it

687
00:30:59,709 --> 00:31:04,538
deep enough and I got royally screwed

688
00:31:02,618 --> 00:31:07,238
because it died on me and up in the

689
00:31:04,538 --> 00:31:09,249
north we put our varieties up north

690
00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:11,679
we're looking at moving our variety

691
00:31:09,249 --> 00:31:14,139
trial now with the Willsboro they got to

692
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,909
get it in an inch and a quarter in the

693
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:18,728
ground at least so what dozen Heath

694
00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:22,179
that's another piece but ice sheeting

695
00:31:18,729 --> 00:31:25,328
and packing down I haven't experienced

696
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:26,769
that in 18 years of doing it doesn't

697
00:31:25,328 --> 00:31:28,950
mean it doesn't happen it can still

698
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:28,950
happen

699
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:44,860
yes that's what I did that works right

700
00:31:41,589 --> 00:32:06,189
anyway yeah that works very well no not

701
00:31:44,859 --> 00:32:07,899
when it's growing on the top yeah no no

702
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,059
just such a plain your alfalfa earlier

703
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:12,759
and you'll get that's the other thing

704
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:14,319
you guys can get five tons of dry matter

705
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:16,450
six tons of dry matter off your

706
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:18,519
triticale I'm doing good to get three

707
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:20,019
she's doing good to get two because as

708
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,250
you move north it gets tougher and

709
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:22,869
tougher because you got to plant it

710
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:25,000
earlier and earlier I'm pretty soon I

711
00:32:22,869 --> 00:32:27,250
work with some guys up in Lacombe which

712
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,539
is two hours north of Calgary you can't

713
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:31,299
see polar bears from there but they're

714
00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:33,609
just around the corner and they are

715
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:35,200
growing a sixty-day corn it takes 90

716
00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:36,909
days to get it mature but they're

717
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,279
planting all their triticale in the

718
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:41,350
round the 15th of august they got to get

719
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,690
it in early enough to get the tillering

720
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:45,219
to get the growth on it to get the yield

721
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:47,049
and make it through the winter but you

722
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,339
have a higher yield potential than I do

723
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:51,819
because I used to live down a quarry

724
00:32:48,339 --> 00:32:54,250
built and we have that long fall and

725
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:57,569
that long spring there you have a lot

726
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:57,569
more yield potential than I do

727
00:33:05,539 --> 00:33:09,180
you know we got I had a picture I sent

728
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:12,269
Sara it's um

729
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:14,759
a guy in 2016 planted corn after his

730
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:17,059
triticale and he has a what was she a

731
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:19,740
six month old and maybe a two year old

732
00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:21,389
standing next to his corn and his corn

733
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:23,150
was tasseled and it was as high as the

734
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:25,410
two year old which is about this high

735
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:27,420
but he said his neighbor's wasn't any

736
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:29,970
better and he has a whole barn for bunk

737
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:32,039
full of triticale so he did or right he

738
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:35,190
says it was fine and he's going to do it

739
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:37,049
again it will dry the ground if you have

740
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:39,420
heavy ground like Heather fights with up

741
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:41,819
there all the time it helps to pump the

742
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:44,250
water out in the spring so it allows you

743
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:47,609
to get on but if it turns dry that is an

744
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:51,269
issue but interestingly the first year I

745
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:53,279
did that alfalfa I took it off put the

746
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:57,089
alfalfa in the beginning of June we had

747
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:59,460
one three-quarter inch rain about a week

748
00:33:57,089 --> 00:34:01,980
after and then we had a quarter of an

749
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:04,470
inch of rain the third week in June and

750
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:07,049
we had nothing through July to the

751
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:08,610
middle of August Bill Smith looked at my

752
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:10,800
plot and September he says it looks like

753
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:13,440
a two-year-old stamp that's how well it

754
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,350
grew it really did well and some guys in

755
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,150
western New York tried it in 16 and they

756
00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:20,069
were amazed at how well it worked right

757
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:23,010
through the dry a little bit of moisture

758
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:24,630
that air is kept off of it and they can

759
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:26,340
get started but yes it can get dry

760
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:30,000
enough that nothing grows it's not a

761
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:32,220
perfect system it can get wiped out then

762
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:38,369
I put stuff in and April and had to get

763
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:40,079
wiped out too yes you're not opening the

764
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:43,139
ground up and drying it and you have to

765
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,880
no-till it you open a slit and a press

766
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:46,589
wheel drill put it in don't try

767
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,360
broadcasting your seed or user a

768
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:49,800
brilliant cedar and then rolling it

769
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,420
afterwards you might as well just take

770
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,660
the seed and throw it in the bushes it

771
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:57,650
does not work then there does have done

772
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,649
that don't do it

773
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:04,909
[Music]

774
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:17,019
if it was that high and is a very good

775
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:18,068
chance that has already started sending

776
00:35:17,019 --> 00:35:19,690
a seed head up

777
00:35:18,068 --> 00:35:21,338
especially because beginning of

778
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:23,530
September we had some really cold

779
00:35:21,338 --> 00:35:25,719
weather it may have got enough chilling

780
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:28,180
that had burn alized and it's now

781
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:30,219
sending a seed Hut up and it may not

782
00:35:28,179 --> 00:35:33,219
make it through the winter simply

783
00:35:30,219 --> 00:35:35,019
because it was planted way too early now

784
00:35:33,219 --> 00:35:37,118
what we have done though is we've

785
00:35:35,019 --> 00:35:39,489
planted the beginning of August we've

786
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:42,280
planted oats 100 pounds of oats 80

787
00:35:39,489 --> 00:35:43,929
pounds of triticale and then we take the

788
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,839
old saw blade to manure in on it and

789
00:35:43,929 --> 00:35:49,629
then take the oats off and the September

790
00:35:46,838 --> 00:35:51,849
cut it four inches not shorter has to be

791
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:54,099
four inches and we got a couple of tons

792
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:56,170
of really night oast night's oats feed

793
00:35:54,099 --> 00:35:58,390
and then all the true the kale started

794
00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:01,119
growing after that we moved it we took a

795
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:02,769
tree to Cal crop off the next spring so

796
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,960
you can but if you get it too early and

797
00:36:02,769 --> 00:36:05,798
it grows too long and it gets a chance

798
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,539
to burn alive

799
00:36:05,798 --> 00:36:09,539
it's going to get killed out it will die

800
00:36:14,278 --> 00:36:23,099
