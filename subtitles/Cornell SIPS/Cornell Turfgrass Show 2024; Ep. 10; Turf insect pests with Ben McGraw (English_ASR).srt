1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,080
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:08,480
University welcome everyone to the show

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,919
uh Frank Rossy here with Dr Ben McGrath

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,798
from Penn State University who we're

5
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,480
going to get to uh a little bit uh and

6
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:15,838
talk about insects from the spring we've

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,199
been trying to do this for a while and

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,679
it's been a funky spring so let me start

9
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:23,118
out like I usually do with uh putting

10
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:26,359
our kids to work on the golf course uh a

11
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:28,198
lot of great tweets as usual this became

12
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:31,400
something that got popular during the

13
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,160
pandemic and and so pleased to see uh

14
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:36,000
Golf Course superintendant exposing

15
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:39,558
their kids like this uh to the work and

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,519
being outside and the toils of what we

17
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:47,000
love about being on golf courses um many

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,399
of us know not long ago we lost uh uh Dr

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,719
Joe Vargas a friend of mine and I'm sure

20
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:55,399
an acquaintance of Benz over the years

21
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:58,280
uh from Michigan State uh I have uh been

22
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:00,000
uh uh quiet about this uh Joe was a

23
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,759
really important part of my early career

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,400
career when I first started at Michigan

25
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:07,280
State and the guy next to him was no

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,680
slouch himself Gordy LaFontaine uh we

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,680
lost Joe just a a month ago and they had

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,640
the service for him this past weekend

29
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,040
and in this picture you can see Gordy La

30
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,319
Fontaine holding the mic for Dr Paul

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,439
Ricki who just celebrated his 90th

32
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:26,959
birthday so while we um you know grieve

33
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:29,639
the passing of a turf grass giant we

34
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:32,519
continue to celebrate having Dr Ricky

35
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,680
around so having roots in as a Sparty

36
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:38,118
for my couple of years there early on uh

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,399
still touches my heart Joe Joe always

38
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:43,560
had a smile and a kind word and for

39
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:45,680
those of people who you know always

40
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,759
might have had a difficult time with Joe

41
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,799
uh I was never one of those people I I

42
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,519
got along with Tim perfectly well I

43
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,600
think it was Ben we're all crusty

44
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:57,560
northeasterners huh was a classic New

45
00:01:54,599 --> 00:02:00,559
Englander from the GetGo okay so this

46
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,960
past we week uh we were pretty warm to

47
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,759
the east as you got near the ocean and

48
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,559
even North you were pretty warm as as

49
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,840
soon as you got towards central

50
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,439
Pennsylvania and West you got a little

51
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,200
bit cooler uh some places in the high

52
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:17,878
elevations uh 8 degrees uh below normal

53
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,598
uh where you were really up high so

54
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:22,919
cooler uh towards the southwest and

55
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:24,439
warmer towards the Northeast now what's

56
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:27,039
been really interesting is we're

57
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:30,359
starting to see heat stress levels uh

58
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:32,799
already um build and these are models

59
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,280
that we developed when the nighttime

60
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,719
temperature is uh at least

61
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,919
70Â° and the combination of the

62
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:44,080
temperature and the humidity is over

63
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:46,559
150 uh for more than five or six hours

64
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,959
we call that heat stress so what you can

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,719
see here is the heat stress is going to

66
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,199
be with us down state and even in

67
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:56,280
Southwest Pennsylvania Ben where you are

68
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:59,359
and then slowly dissipate uh as the week

69
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,400
goes on we are not expecting to see uh

70
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,680
much of distress now what's also

71
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,799
interesting typically follows this when

72
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,560
you get moisture are folar diseases and

73
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:11,400
normally we talk about Dollar spot but

74
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,680
whenever the heat starts to build you

75
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,239
can start to see it building towards the

76
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,280
Southwest uh today and tomorrow but

77
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,360
really only persists in in in the Boston

78
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,439
area the Metro New York area the I 95

79
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,959
Corridor down to Washington DC um in

80
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:31,359
places where Brown patch is likely to be

81
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,000
a problem I would want to make sure I

82
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,840
had some protection in place uh along

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,680
the shore and the I95 Corridor south of

84
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,759
New York City it's looking like it's

85
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,599
going to be a pretty good run for brown

86
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:45,359
patch for the week soils are warm and in

87
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,959
fact they've been getting warm and as

88
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,560
they in places where they're drier

89
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,158
they're even warmer well into the 70s in

90
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,840
Metro New York and pretty much 60s

91
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:57,438
everywhere else so biological activity

92
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,759
is well underway in all the soils in the

93
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:03,280
Northeast so again as the rainfall comes

94
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:05,239
with warm soils you could expect a surge

95
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,079
of growth on the other side of that if

96
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:09,039
your soil is functioning right if your

97
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:12,120
soil is really able to process the

98
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:14,280
organic matter mineralize that nitrogen

99
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,639
you should get a growth response on the

100
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,199
other side of some expected rainfall

101
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,040
that's passing through the Northeast

102
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,759
this

103
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,759
weekend it's been pretty dry it's been

104
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,879
wet in Beantown I know uh the Red Sox

105
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:28,879
are not loving it as wet as it's been

106
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,639
and also a little bit down by euben in

107
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,000
Southwest Pennsylvania look like you got

108
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,240
a little bit of rainfall uh down there

109
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,439
but really for the most part the

110
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,560
majority of the re uh the region has

111
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,918
been dry this past week and it looks

112
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,199
like a little bit of a break I never

113
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,959
really like these prognostications it

114
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:48,319
looks like it might be warmer than

115
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:51,279
normal it looks like it might be a

116
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:53,800
little bit wetter than normal but what

117
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:56,198
we've been talking about uh in our sort

118
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,879
of extension conference call call world

119
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:01,038
has been the patterns of rainfall are

120
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,918
coming through but we may not be getting

121
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,800
that much rain now we might get a bit of

122
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:08,240
a dump through a a storm coming through

123
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:12,079
in the next day or two but it looks like

124
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:16,240
rainy showery conditions but not major

125
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:17,839
rainfall expected now Ben I had a laugh

126
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,560
you know I used to when I used to watch

127
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:23,159
my kids play soccer I didn't bother

128
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,720
sitting with anyone I just stood off by

129
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,400
myself I wasn't a big Yeller but I

130
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,160
didn't also want to be near anybody

131
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:33,359
because on the off chance something

132
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,400
happened I'm likely to just punch him uh

133
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,000
a as a reaction uh so I know this was a

134
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:41,519
very interesting time uh and you tweeted

135
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,478
about it so uh I won't talk more about

136
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:47,560
it I'm gonna get into marital issues I

137
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:50,000
got my own trouble okay so so let's get

138
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,439
into our conversation today Ben and

139
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,680
let's start with something that's very

140
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:58,160
uh pertinent to New York although maybe

141
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:01,840
not necessarily this year uh we are def

142
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,439
we are expecting a band of neonicotinoid

143
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,478
insecticides um across the state of New

144
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:08,918
York this is probably likely going to

145
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,360
happen in other places as well I I doubt

146
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:14,478
we're going to be an isolated uh state

147
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,038
for this particular rule um so I want to

148
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:20,079
talk a little bit about Alternatives and

149
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:22,719
worries right because on Long Island we

150
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,800
don't have a Cel print right we have a

151
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,800
limitation for some of our use down

152
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:31,439
there so I'm let's start out with how

153
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:34,360
worried are you about this and how much

154
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,598
confidence do you have in Alternatives

155
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,560
like I put up here entomophagous

156
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:41,879
nematodes and maybe BT

157
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,319
galleri yeah oh we're gonna get into

158
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:47,918
some difficult talk here right from the

159
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,439
start so start you know I gotta say uh I

160
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:51,359
gave a talk at the New England Turf

161
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,038
Regional Conference and somebody came up

162
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,759
to me and was like Hey I'm from you know

163
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,560
because they draw from Long Island at

164
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:59,080
that conference and they were like we

165
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,079
don't have a celant and I was shocked by

166
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:03,198
that I mean that's one of the the

167
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:05,719
softest chemistries that we've seen you

168
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,478
know it impacts or it affects the insect

169
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,319
by binding to a receptor that humans

170
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:12,598
don't have so it's virtually non-toxic

171
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:14,000
to mammals it's safe to the applicator

172
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,519
uh just one of those crazy things that

173
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
you don't have in New York so uh I was

174
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,918
unaware of that and and what we're

175
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
seeing with the neonic issue is like

176
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,399
it's changing by the month here in all

177
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,399
of the states around us you know

178
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:29,000
Maryland New Jersey Connecticut uh

179
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:30,478
possibly having a band so it's hard to

180
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,759
keep up on all these things my home

181
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,399
state of Maine uh has moved to a band

182
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,199
I've written lots of letters and all of

183
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:40,038
this stuff uh and I do think we have

184
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:43,639
better Alternatives so I haven't

185
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:45,918
been I mean I'm happy to uh support the

186
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,639
turf industry in in writing letters and

187
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:49,639
whatnot and and I think there's some

188
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,319
pretty clear science that in the turf

189
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:52,840
grass world it's not a huge issue

190
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:54,639
because we're watering these products in

191
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:57,679
any white grub product you need to

192
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,720
deliver it down to the Target so uh that

193
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,280
removes a lot of the risk um if you

194
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,520
don't have the ability to get water to

195
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,638
these sites maybe it's a an estate or a

196
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:09,000
park or a golf course rough uh where we

197
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,079
typically would see these scubs uh and

198
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,439
there's a lot of people who don't have

199
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,680
irrigation rough so uh just by selecting

200
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:16,598
a granular formulation immediately

201
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,240
removes the rest that's work that Dan

202
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:22,680
Potter did 100 years ago what so there's

203
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,400
ways to work with neony yeah that uh you

204
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,038
can minimize the risk so what was the

205
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:31,158
hubub I I heard it was about seed

206
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:32,958
treatments in a doesn't that minimize

207
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:35,639
risk as well by just putting it on the

208
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,319
seed oh I think that you know I mean I

209
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:39,000
would love where I'm getting with this

210
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,278
is I'd love to see Turf treated

211
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,759
differently as far as Banning but uh

212
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,838
nobody's you know it's it's hysteria and

213
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:49,600
nobody's really willing to look at the

214
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:53,040
science and um I I do think that seed

215
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,680
treatment is bad the the neonic and you

216
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,639
know maybe companies could have avoided

217
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:59,519
this uh you know we know that Turf and

218
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,679
ornamentals are small potatoes so uh

219
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,560
they're just we're just going to get

220
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:04,479
caught in the crossfire what happens

221
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:07,039
with a seed treatment with the neon and

222
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,320
this science is very clear that it does

223
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:11,078
impact pollinator populations this is

224
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,240
excellent work out of Purdue Christian

225
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:15,879
krup Keys lab and you want to talk about

226
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,120
somebody who uh did great research that

227
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:19,159
you know kind of got caught in the

228
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,440
crosshairs from these chemical companies

229
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:24,120
when you place the neonicotinoid on the

230
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,519
seed treatment there's a lot of uh

231
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,759
evidence that it might not work in

232
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,759
Northern uh agriculture but in Southern

233
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,720
Agriculture that products there and it

234
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,559
gets uh the insects that he needs to get

235
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,680
Northern it might not but the big

236
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:37,359
problem is when you put them in the

237
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:40,958
Cedars it basically volatilizes the

238
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,720
compound so any plume of neonicotinoid

239
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:45,159
coming through pollinating um insect

240
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,839
population is just going to smoke them

241
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:51,360
out you're talking about dust dust

242
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,959
essentially dust yeah so uh not

243
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,879
volatization but the dust coming off of

244
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:58,479
this so that's very clear um so I don't

245
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,278
think that we need to treat these things

246
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,320
as you know good good or bad there's

247
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:05,838
lots of nuances with that in the turf

248
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,680
world what we can speak about is you do

249
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,560
want to W every white grub product you

250
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,120
want to water in and and these are

251
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:14,319
products that water in and once you

252
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,600
water it in uh they're pretty benign

253
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,000
okay um

254
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,560
so uh unfortunately it's kind of blanket

255
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,559
treatment and and there's enough

256
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:25,399
momentum this thing's running downhill

257
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:27,439
that um it's probably going to be lost

258
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:29,360
now where we do have great Alternatives

259
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,120
like the diamides and there are

260
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,839
differences within the diamide so I

261
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,320
don't want to paint with a broad brush

262
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:39,200
well and also just clarification golf

263
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,480
has access to a Celler print corre it's

264
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,320
lawn care and Landscape that are not

265
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,759
going to have the access to a Celler

266
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,240
print yeah and that's uh that's

267
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:49,759
unfortunate I think and if we look at

268
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,639
within the diamides there is great

269
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:55,240
variation I wouldn't say that a fence

270
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:57,399
would be similar uh or even a tatr which

271
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,360
New York doesn't have yet uh those are

272
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:02,159
not the same as a cint as far as

273
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,079
pollinator safety so a celin you know

274
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,600
gold standard for white grub control

275
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:09,759
really really um soft on pollinating

276
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,120
population okay so then let's let's talk

277
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:14,000
about uh these other options I know you

278
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,240
played around with nematodes as a grad

279
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,879
student right oh

280
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,680
yeah g has gotten some momentum uh

281
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:23,278
thoughts on Effectiveness because we

282
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,120
know behavior is going to have to change

283
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:28,039
a little bit I'm wondering about

284
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,600
effectiveness of these products yeah uh

285
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:32,519
so we're g to delve into some tricky

286
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,639
area here because I've had a CEO of a

287
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:40,240
company crawl upside my about this stuff

288
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:44,879
so uh what I'm GNA say is that both can

289
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:48,519
be effective um however you know one is

290
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:51,720
a you know they're biological so we

291
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:54,320
assume that they are um more benign than

292
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,480
uh or less hard well we're talking about

293
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,480
a living organism a living organism with

294
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,639
the with the nematode right you're

295
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,639
talking about a BT formulation with the

296
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:05,799
grub G yeah so with the nematodes we

297
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:08,680
want to overwhelm them with high numbers

298
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:11,120
of very uh healthy individuals uh

299
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:13,159
infective juveniles and when we can do

300
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,480
that we can overwhelm a pest population

301
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:17,679
so we know that they can be there's all

302
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,440
you know um we've known this for you

303
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:22,958
know decades and decades and decades the

304
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,880
problem is supply and demand and really

305
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:29,278
um getting viable Source um so I'll

306
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:32,278
probably get some ey from some uh

307
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:36,639
biological supply companies so you have

308
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:39,159
concerns about the quality control of

309
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,600
okay and that's that's valid right

310
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:43,480
that's a valid concern we do studies

311
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,720
with nematodes all the time and we get

312
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,480
them from online sources or insectaries

313
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,079
and I can tell you uh because I did do

314
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,720
this for my PhD that we get batches upon

315
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:57,519
batches that are entirely dead that is

316
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,720
not an uncommon thing so if I was doing

317
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,480
this and and I think they're exceptional

318
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,519
I mean that was my PhD work I don't know

319
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,560
anybody who's using nematodes to control

320
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,120
annual Bluegrass Weevil however we

321
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:09,638
showed in our work you can get 90%

322
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,839
control of larve with a single

323
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:14,480
application they're comparable in price

324
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:17,320
uh to our insecticides that we have

325
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,039
today uh but nobody's doing this and I

326
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,760
think it's a lot of like what is this

327
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,958
maybe in Canada you know in certain

328
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:26,559
crops it's very uh well adopted you know

329
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:29,719
mushroom production Southeast PA there's

330
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:32,119
nematodes being used so um you know it's

331
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,800
it's this kind of Market thing uh they

332
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,720
are living organisms they don't store

333
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:37,559
well you need to recycle them through a

334
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,480
live hose that that can be rather

335
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:41,719
expensive so they can be effective I

336
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,039
would want to make sure that I have a

337
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:47,160
viable Source uh I would want to make

338
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:49,679
sure that they're alive on on delivery

339
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:52,240
so and you've got to wait right this is

340
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,638
a big shift right Ben because the

341
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,720
nematodes have are going to go on as you

342
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:01,879
Scout in August not as a preventative in

343
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,040
June are they correct correct uh so you

344
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:05,519
would you be using them primarily in a

345
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:07,278
Curative sense I know there was work

346
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,120
done at Cornell about these long-term

347
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:12,600
persistent nematodes and yeah uh we're

348
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:16,039
not sure yet yeah Elon seals been

349
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:19,199
playing around what about B gari uh any

350
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:20,958
thoughts we've tested this a lot a lot

351
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,639
in field trials because anytime a

352
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,319
company has a natural uh product that

353
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:28,039
they want to test this is usually a

354
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:31,079
standard in it so we have reams of data

355
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:32,799
my colleagues have dreams of data uh I

356
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,919
put up a slide a couple years ago in

357
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:37,240
Ontario with and the title of the slide

358
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:40,599
was consistently inconsistent and I

359
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:43,720
immediately received uh uh some emails

360
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,320
from the company so uh you could take my

361
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,839
uh I'm not beholden to the company or

362
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,320
anything I'm beholden to the people York

363
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:53,320
you know what Ben what I've learned is

364
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,040
is if I've got people angry at me it

365
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,480
must be because I'm saying something

366
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:59,240
that's uh true as well and and you know

367
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,278
I've got believe me if it works that

368
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,879
would be the number one promoter uh we

369
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,958
have had trials where it's given good

370
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:09,759
control we've had trials where

371
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:11,958
absolutely no control so uh again uh

372
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,519
it's it's a formulation this is going to

373
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:16,559
be a little bit more stable but it's

374
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,799
going to have variation between uh

375
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,838
batches as well so and and also this is

376
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:24,799
more typical that you'd put on in the

377
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,519
spring as a preventative no this this

378
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:29,359
would be uh something that you'd want to

379
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:32,159
put in uh July so that it's in place for

380
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,278
when the so it's I wouldn't really

381
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,799
describe it as a preventive but it you'd

382
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:39,439
probably want to time it so that um the

383
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:41,318
neonate bites into it that they acquire

384
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,959
the most amount of toxin all right all

385
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:46,399
right we got a lot of ground to cover

386
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:48,838
ABW is next right's a lot of funky stuff

387
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,720
going on here oh Wicked so let's start

388
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,079
with this question because you know as

389
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,240
not an enologist uh the general

390
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:57,278
extension person in the state I get a

391
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,198
lot of questions and and we've really

392
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:00,958
sort of said okay there's the Greet

393
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:03,758
models and been we've talked about this

394
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:06,479
on the show in the past we really rely

395
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,959
on uh an uh phenological indicators and

396
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,959
the rod dendrin tends to be a strong one

397
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:14,239
so here's my question is there a

398
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:16,719
disconnect this year between Degree Days

399
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,240
phenological indicators and annual

400
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,160
Bluegrass Weevil populations I don't

401
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,759
think so I think I don't I don't I don't

402
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:27,240
feel that in in my travels here I think

403
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:29,959
these things uh I mean look we take a

404
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:33,159
lot of samples uh we use very precise

405
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:35,399
methods of analyzing um what stage the

406
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:38,879
insects are in as far as the laral

407
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:40,440
stages um you know I'd like to think

408
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:41,720
that a golf course superintendent could

409
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,959
do this but it would be super

410
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,480
timeconsuming to get the level of uh

411
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:50,000
accuracy that we have and so with that I

412
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,959
I will say that these things generally

413
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,120
seem to work pretty well I've started

414
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:57,119
seeing people say uh like man as

415
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,159
variable as it is every year it always

416
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,519
lands on like Memorial Day and would

417
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,838
tend to agree we see a lot of

418
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,600
variability at the beginning of the

419
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,038
season and then everything comes

420
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,880
together almost in a calendar basis uh

421
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:09,798
but Growing Degree Days have been pretty

422
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,160
good

423
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:15,318
so yeah here's a picture from Matthew

424
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,160
leg uh talking about just that sort of

425
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:19,759
uh I agree with you let let me go back

426
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,919
for a second uh I hear this all the time

427
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:25,160
from Andy Wilson at Beth Page who's a

428
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,799
big scouter lots of data uh he's pretty

429
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,798
consistent you're right you're going to

430
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:32,279
see it at this time so figured maybe

431
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:35,119
with the mild winter and a funky spring

432
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:36,678
it got a little weird I'm glad to hear

433
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:38,719
it didn't because that means maybe

434
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:41,000
control programs are going to work

435
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,798
Matthew leg with senta Canada just

436
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,400
published uh put this on Twitter

437
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:49,839
yesterday and you've got these variety

438
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:53,160
of growth stages here uh do we call this

439
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:56,759
asynchrony or do you call asynchrony

440
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:59,840
when you have multiple populations Ben

441
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:02,839
well I would say asynchrony arises from

442
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:04,720
uh probably uh a lack of control of

443
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:06,599
adults I mean that's really what's going

444
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,400
to lead to asynchrony is if you have

445
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:11,199
something that's laying egg so if I look

446
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,440
at that if I take a core and I see you

447
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:17,080
know presume let's just say those are

448
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,279
first second third fourth in stars um

449
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:21,359
you know whether they are or not uh just

450
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:24,038
for example sake we got four instars

451
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,759
there uh that says to me something laid

452
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:29,440
an

453
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:30,919
egg uh 7 days ago 14 2128 eight days ago

454
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,798
so you've got something that's you've

455
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:34,919
got a population of adults that are out

456
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:36,918
there laying eggs for over a month and

457
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:39,520
we know that if we don't control the

458
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:42,080
adult the adult has a very long time

459
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:44,558
that it can produce eggs uh at least we

460
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,439
know that from confined field studies

461
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:48,519
whether they live that long in the field

462
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,360
probably not but if we have them

463
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:53,079
confined they can lay eggs for a long

464
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:55,479
period of time so what we also see is

465
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:57,599
even in areas where we do have an adul

466
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,319
aside down uh you're not going to get

467
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,038
the entire population so there's going

468
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:04,480
to be some asynchron but I would say if

469
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:06,759
you took enough uh enough larval samples

470
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,880
or enough Turf samples heat extracted

471
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:10,679
and look at them underneath microscope

472
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,480
you would have an average that is moving

473
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:16,600
pretty consistently whether you applied

474
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,558
an adul asde or not okay so that raises

475
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:20,639
a great question and we don't have all

476
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,519
these products in New York but this

477
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,720
these products seem to be the rage when

478
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:28,158
it comes to larvicides if I'm correct

479
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,960
and I've started to hear and I know you

480
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:33,960
have caution against this in the past uh

481
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,159
aoid you know we have a lot of um uh

482
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:40,519
pyoid resistant adult populations as you

483
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:42,919
know uh and um like places like Beth

484
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:45,679
Page have really sort of gone away from

485
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:48,400
completely trying to make an adult aside

486
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,159
applications we know those things can

487
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,200
cause issues when we're trying to

488
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:56,840
control larve right a uh pyoid resistant

489
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,720
grow uh abws can be differentially

490
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:03,038
susceptible to larva side as I think

491
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,839
you've taught me in the past where uh

492
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:06,798
how do you like these products because

493
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:08,599
the other comment you made that still

494
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:10,679
resonates the last time we were on is

495
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:12,918
you basically said Frank we got enough

496
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:15,798
products now we know enough about this

497
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:19,080
now I don't think this is a major pest

498
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:21,000
problem anymore uh that can't be managed

499
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:23,359
uh maybe the problems that we used to

500
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,839
have are not the problems controlling we

501
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:30,759
have nowadays I'm a little bit nervous

502
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:33,480
because relying on ldes as you said

503
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:35,798
could be risky so tell me how to put

504
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,960
this into context without an adult

505
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:41,440
decide and relying on a larvicide am I

506
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,679
just making three larvicide applications

507
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,360
now instead of three adulticide

508
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,880
applications clear this up for me Ben

509
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:49,959
well I do think that sequential

510
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,280
applications are needed whether that's

511
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,720
an adulticide followed by a larvicide

512
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:56,519
and that's it's basically um you know I

513
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,319
have a couple of Consulting courses that

514
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:00,798
I do on the side and uh we've taken

515
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:03,158
these places that have probably made

516
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:05,759
four Springtime applications where two

517
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:07,600
and done and then we're even kind of

518
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:09,079
looking whether we need to make a summer

519
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,599
application many of these are super

520
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:13,960
high-end and that's really kind of an

521
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:16,119
insurance act however um you know I

522
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,319
really like uh the adula side followed

523
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:21,239
by aarva side but I I know that some

524
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:23,678
people don't want to go that route uh I

525
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,558
would still caution against relying on a

526
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,880
single product we just wrapped our uh

527
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:31,678
two weeks of field trial data so you

528
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,760
know this is all really early uh it

529
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,360
seems like a lot of the submissions that

530
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,000
these companies have made are these

531
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:40,719
programs and and I am a big believer in

532
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,519
programs but from a recommendation

533
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,159
standpoint it's very difficult for me to

534
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:48,240
say this solo product does this unless

535
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:49,880
we're looking at that solo product right

536
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,960
uh the other complicating thing is the

537
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,559
insect's going to move it's going to lay

538
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,880
eggs over time so if we're looking at

539
00:21:53,558 --> 00:22:00,519
the contribution of a single larva side

540
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,880
um you know that could be uh difficult

541
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:05,038
to assess because it's got to work on

542
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,520
much longer that spread out asynchronous

543
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:09,158
development so uh I do think we have a

544
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,759
lot of products I mean obviously from

545
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:12,919
our trials um our trials were great this

546
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:14,960
year so I think it's going to be a

547
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:17,400
banner year we're coming off of a couple

548
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,120
of crap years yeah where it's like am I

549
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,679
going to work my the rest of my life on

550
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:24,000
ants and earthworms and these unsolvable

551
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,000
things or can we get back to like the

552
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,798
early 2000s ABW level and what we've

553
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,200
seen is some places that have been

554
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:33,200
really bit hard but I do think like a

555
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,400
lot of the places that I consult with or

556
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,960
a lot of the places where we have trials

557
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,720
where we're doing what we recommend

558
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,640
those things are non problems they

559
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,000
really are I mean I think it's really

560
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,440
about timing as we all know and I think

561
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,759
it's about using products that make

562
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,840
sense relative to the life cycle of the

563
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:54,839
insect I'm seeing a lot of freestyling

564
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:57,119
though I am just seeing like I don't

565
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:59,359
know if people have like chemical sheds

566
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,158
where you've got eight things that think

567
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,158
you know are recognizable that you heard

568
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:06,320
in a talk somewhere but people are

569
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:08,320
absolutely fraking freestyling out there

570
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,678
uh I'm not on Facebook but somebody

571
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:12,879
shared a Facebook post where it was like

572
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:15,919
what's the best product for ABW larvel

573
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,880
control and I saw about 20 responses

574
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,880
from these people where and it was like

575
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,880
a you know the sequential program with

576
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:26,400
like two products that are not effective

577
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:28,520
it's like so I do think we don't need to

578
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,600
I mean this insect doesn't occur uni

579
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:32,158
form L across a property and when that

580
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:33,879
happens people are going to think that

581
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,000
they get good control with marginal

582
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:39,360
products and I think this year is going

583
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,759
to really flush that out okay so good so

584
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:44,918
so okay so I want to recap what you just

585
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:47,359
said uh your studies your trials are

586
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:49,240
indicating uh it's we got a lot of

587
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,558
annual Bluegrass weevils out there this

588
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,599
year after a couple of years of not very

589
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:56,918
much uh no surprise on the Facebook

590
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,240
baloney but the social media thing if

591
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:00,600
you know there's a lot of things we

592
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,120
don't get right there so you want to be

593
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:06,240
very careful when you're making choices

594
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:09,359
and it sounds like once you get enough

595
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,839
data and you are able to start uh making

596
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:16,798
timely applications this no longer is

597
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:21,038
going to be a primary issue that said

598
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:23,918
it's expanding its range Ben is is it

599
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:27,079
behaving differently the further south

600
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:29,240
you get the further into Ohio you get

601
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:31,759
are there any nuances that are different

602
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,319
for this organism as it's expanded its

603
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,440
range from the Northeast where it's been

604
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:38,038
for 40 years I've been spraying this

605
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,880
thing for 40 years since I was working

606
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:41,798
on golf courses yeah I mean anything

607
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,440
that I say would be purely anecdotal

608
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:46,639
other than uh we do have one side in

609
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,480
Columbus and we worked pretty closely

610
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,360
with them and when uh they started to

611
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,360
have problems and we implemented you

612
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:56,000
know a program that would be what I do

613
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:58,439
in uh Pittsburgh or Philadelphia or New

614
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,759
England and within a couple of years

615
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,120
they're they're practically non-existent

616
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:03,759
um I think the biggest problems that

617
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:05,839
they're having there is you know kind of

618
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:08,119
the education that you know everybody

619
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:09,959
would roll their eyes about now so it's

620
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:12,239
for me as an extension educator it's

621
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,440
almost difficult because I've got two

622
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,720
sets I've got um you know people who are

623
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,919
like I don't need to know about the

624
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,000
biology anymore and then the people that

625
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,399
really just need the ABCs of it and I

626
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,798
think that's really what it is I think

627
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:26,678
we overthink these things I agree 100% I

628
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:27,960
and and we've been I mean this is just a

629
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:30,640
course of doing business in the

630
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,440
Northeast East and now it's a new issue

631
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,880
yeah for them to put in their Rhythm

632
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,798
down there all right listen we're and

633
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,480
I'll say the last thing is it's just

634
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:40,359
it's a much more complex Turf pest than

635
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,120
any of the other Turf PS where that have

636
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:43,759
one generation per year you have one

637
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:45,798
timing you've got a product that you can

638
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:48,278
put down within three Monon window and

639
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:50,440
you get them that's why this this just

640
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:51,720
involves a little bit more uh being on

641
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,798
the ball and selecting the right

642
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,759
products and so I hate to bring up an

643
00:25:53,798 --> 00:25:59,960
unsolvable problem I hate to bring it up

644
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:01,960
but I'm going to but I saw yester that

645
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:06,519
anals which are

646
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:10,079
worms as a biomass on the planet have

647
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:13,398
more biomass than humans livestock and

648
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:16,319
wild animals put together so this is an

649
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:18,719
indication that there's a lot of worms a

650
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:21,359
lot of biomass in the worm in the world

651
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,079
on worms all right so let's start a

652
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:27,479
little bit with some uh stuff that went

653
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:30,158
away and now has come back the irritant

654
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:33,079
approach with uh the

655
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,039
saponin uh I saw a product at a golf

656
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:37,319
course I visited just the other day

657
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:40,319
called castaway doesn't appear like

658
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:42,359
we're trying to disguise this anymore

659
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:46,678
that we're controlling worms with early

660
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:49,879
birds so to speak um thoughts on this as

661
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:53,320
a primary strategy for addressing worm

662
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:57,120
issues yeah so the saponins work I mean

663
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:58,918
they definitely work the problem is um

664
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,519
you know there's some variabil between

665
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:03,799
products we've looked at Castaway it

666
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:06,200
looks just like um rise8 it looks just

667
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:08,038
like early bird they work I mean and

668
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,600
it's it's obvious it's a physical

669
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:13,640
disruption it irritates their mucousy

670
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:16,079
skin they come to the surface um a lot

671
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,799
of water right a lot of water lot of

672
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,960
water uh sequential applications like

673
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:20,720
you're not going to get anything that's

674
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,360
in a

675
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,120
cocoon uh and so if you get marginal

676
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,479
kill and you still have some adults out

677
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:28,319
there they're going to reproduce I mean

678
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,919
they're very stable population so

679
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,200
produce a couple of cocoons every couple

680
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,480
of weeks uh so anything in the Cocoon is

681
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,399
just going to hatch out and that's why

682
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:38,399
you get like 21 days suppression with

683
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:40,278
these but if you do it every 21 days

684
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:42,839
three times in a row we can Flatline

685
00:27:40,278 --> 00:27:45,200
these things right however I mean that's

686
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:48,879
like I don't know anybody who can afford

687
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:51,240
to do that I mean the cost of it is is

688
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,600
astronomical yeah what I see with

689
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,759
products and this is crazy I mean I want

690
00:27:54,599 --> 00:28:00,119
to call half of the thing no not half

691
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,119
I'll say 95% of the products out there

692
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:04,759
if I see a product that says it doesn't

693
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:07,839
kill them it deters them that's one that

694
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:10,798
I see a lot I'll say BS on that okay if

695
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:13,678
it says it doesn't kill them it just

696
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:15,879
stops them from casting I would tell ask

697
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:19,440
you Frank is there any organism that

698
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:21,960
eats and doesn't on planet

699
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,960
Earth read my kids a book called

700
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,480
everyone yeah exactly exactly we all

701
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,798
have but I mean this is we're in a small

702
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,159
community here here where information is

703
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:33,679
f free flowing I I was explaining this

704
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,240
to my wife there's nothing like the turf

705
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,919
industry I just can't believe that there

706
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,519
are companies out there and we have the

707
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:40,399
data that show that these things do not

708
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:42,759
work that they are familiar with that

709
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:45,558
they commission that work and they still

710
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:46,679
promote these kind of things out there

711
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:48,480
the only way you're going to kill an

712
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,798
earthworm is if you physically disrupt

713
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,599
it or if it gets into its nervous system

714
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,480
which is very similar insect that's why

715
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:56,839
we deal with it in our laboratory those

716
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,679
are the two mechanisms uh we're looking

717
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:00,480
at cultural practices I know your

718
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:03,679
colleague Kyle's doing some awesome

719
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,159
stuff too well I want to go to Pa's work

720
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:09,159
let let's go to Pa's work at Arkansas

721
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,919
because this uh made my head explode

722
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:14,080
right because they did a beautiful video

723
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,880
on pages work that you can find on

724
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:20,720
YouTube when she was at Arkansas um and

725
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:23,200
and I know you've commented on this and

726
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,200
I want to just talk about the disparity

727
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:30,880
between what I hear in the Pacific

728
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:33,000
Northwest for large volumes of sand and

729
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,080
what paig is said and what you is said

730
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,839
and so first off um a soil root Zone

731
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:41,639
with light top dressing lots of worms

732
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:44,720
soil root Zone heavy top dressing not

733
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,559
many worms sand root Zone but the none

734
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,679
of these were statistically significant

735
00:29:47,558 --> 00:29:52,119
said Paige even though we got these

736
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,038
differences the variability and this is

737
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:56,798
one of the things Kyle laments to me all

738
00:29:54,038 --> 00:29:58,480
the time is finding uniform populations

739
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:01,000
that's why you got to be on the road all

740
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,319
the time to find populations you can

741
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,159
study so here's the question light top

742
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:09,879
dressing May reduce casting activity in

743
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:12,679
a soil root Zone top dressing rate may

744
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:16,640
not have any effect in a sand-based root

745
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:20,679
Zone can you provide any indication of

746
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,960
where using sand or an abrasive material

747
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:26,559
you know Williamson did Blackjack many

748
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,679
years ago that fine glass stuff what are

749
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:31,558
your thoughts about deterring them

750
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,919
through sand top dressing so one I would

751
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:35,558
say these are probably different worms

752
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:37,679
than that we're dealing with um I would

753
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:39,398
say the lack of statistical differences

754
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,038
I don't want to make too many inferences

755
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:43,479
but what I can say with our species

756
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:48,038
which is

757
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:50,679
aoia uh longa so it's like fairly common

758
00:30:48,038 --> 00:30:52,798
in the Northeast it's a European species

759
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:55,120
um I think we're going to submit that as

760
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:57,359
a short publication for the

761
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,000
international yeah yeah so if there's

762
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:00,798
any reviewer out there that are looking

763
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,880
to willing to look the other way on

764
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:05,240
variability and understand that this is

765
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,720
a lower tier journal what we saw over a

766
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:10,359
threeyear period with top dressing at at

767
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,278
Fairway rates um you know heavy and

768
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:15,199
light and then we really increased in

769
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:19,000
the last year is we saw more casting in

770
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,639
in heavy top dressing uh and light too

771
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,519
so even the light was heavier casting

772
00:31:21,638 --> 00:31:26,278
than that and what I thought it was like

773
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:27,599
uh you know maybe it irritates them so

774
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:30,079
they feed more but that didn't make

775
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:32,519
sense and then we found a a published

776
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:34,879
article in agriculture where they looked

777
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:37,919
at Sand content within the areas where

778
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,000
earthworms were feeding and it led to a

779
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,600
greater digestibility of their food so

780
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,759
like a chicken with a crop you know

781
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:46,158
they've got to grind down that organic

782
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:48,038
material uh and that allowed them to do

783
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,760
that so any every time that we saw it it

784
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:51,960
was almost immediate like the ratings

785
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:53,558
that we took right after that and we

786
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,319
applied these to the same plots year

787
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:56,879
after year for threeyear period and it

788
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:58,678
just kept going up and up and up in

789
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,080
these plots so

790
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:03,278
relative to the untreated control so uh

791
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,398
different

792
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:07,759
earthworms very poorly understood Group

793
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:10,599
which is surprising because they're a

794
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:13,440
large um you know

795
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:15,398
organism uh and you know most part we

796
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,679
look to agriculture to and try to do the

797
00:32:15,398 --> 00:32:19,038
opposite because they want to promote

798
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:21,798
them so um you know like what we've been

799
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:23,919
looking at recently is like compacting

800
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:26,000
uh because we do see in agriculture in

801
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,519
between rows of crops they have less

802
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,278
earthworms and there's plenty of studies

803
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,759
on that the compaction uh might impact

804
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:34,759
the uh cocoons and whatnot we just can't

805
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:36,638
compact them enough and it's you know if

806
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:38,440
you've got a lot of organic material in

807
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:40,199
there and you're running a roller over

808
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,440
these Fairway plots it's really that

809
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,679
sponge effect it's probably just

810
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,200
temporary it's probably you probably

811
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:49,360
can't compact them enough in Turf until

812
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,840
you start to lose Turf because you've

813
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:54,359
compacted it so greatly so um I think

814
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:56,199
we're we're kind of looking at these

815
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:58,158
things again I think moisture is a big

816
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,519
component to that but as far as the

817
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,960
cultural practices of top dressing um I

818
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,399
think there's just so much organic

819
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,880
material for them in the soil to feed

820
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:09,678
upon uh the other thing too is they feed

821
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,880
on Leaf material on the surface so

822
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,038
unless you're going to get rid of all

823
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,760
that leaf material I mean they there's a

824
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:19,038
reason why this is somewhat

825
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:22,759
unsolvable yeah yeah so all right so so

826
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:26,278
so I know we are already way past and I

827
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:28,038
don't see any questions for us Ben I do

828
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:30,880
have some things about ants but I'm

829
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:33,839
going to save them for another day I

830
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,200
will just say it is a conundrum for me

831
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:39,519
when I go out to that Pacific Northwest

832
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,720
and I see and these superintendent swear

833
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,960
by it they'll say Frank I got two inches

834
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,639
of sand over here I don't have worms I

835
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,480
got one inch over the there and I got

836
00:33:45,638 --> 00:33:51,038
worms like crazy is that a species

837
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,839
difference or is it the per you know

838
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:54,839
they got a lot of different climate than

839
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:57,359
we got out there I mean you know that's

840
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:59,398
Ireland sort of stuff so we speaking of

841
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,759
Ireland we just did last September went

842
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:03,798
over and we tried to survey these kind

843
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,119
of where we see abrupt changes this is

844
00:34:03,798 --> 00:34:07,558
what I

845
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:10,398
always fascinated about where you have

846
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:12,838
casting it stops in a straight line and

847
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:14,319
so we selected sites that had this we

848
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:18,519
went to these sites we did paired

849
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:20,639
sampling sent them uh to Micah Micah and

850
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:22,079
Brookside we looked at every variable in

851
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,878
there we did it with the Pennsylvania

852
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,599
samples as well no two sites are

853
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:28,519
different and it wasn't saying you'd

854
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:30,519
have I mean we had them on slopes where

855
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:32,280
you would think like they' roll down to

856
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:34,759
the bottom they were higher casting on

857
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:40,280
slopes we a lot of these courses in

858
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:42,720
Ireland um uh really high pH uh sand Top

859
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:45,960
Sand cap like a 12in sand cap and

860
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:48,239
they're casted in that uh so I I think

861
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,039
it's hard to generalize I do think like

862
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,759
the first thing that anybody needs to do

863
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:55,000
when they do earthworm work is what

864
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:58,400
species are you dealing with and I

865
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,760
think there's a lot of literature like

866
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,639
just go way back and it's like oh

867
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,320
earthworm like I wouldn't just be able

868
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:08,759
to say weevil like you know if it was an

869
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:10,720
enological study so uh I think there are

870
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,680
great differences I think these things

871
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:15,719
can tolerate a great deal and I think

872
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:18,598
soil pH is one that people always talk

873
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:20,000
about oh you got to acidify them I think

874
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:22,160
you you'll see in the literature that

875
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,280
these earthworms can handle a very wide

876
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:25,759
range and if you have pH of three you're

877
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,119
probably going to struggle to grow turf

878
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,480
grass yes you know so that's exactly so

879
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:33,039
between four and 10 we're okay with most

880
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,519
species well and I got to say as we wrap

881
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:38,759
it up I mean when I I remember chatting

882
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:41,119
with Jim beard the father of tur many

883
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,680
moons ago and he had just finished some

884
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:47,200
work looking at uh the maintenance

885
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:51,679
practices at St Andrews in the 17 and

886
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:53,919
1800s predevelopment of uh synthetic

887
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:57,039
salt-based fertilizers like ammonium

888
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,838
sulfate and they had used so much you

889
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:02,960
know animal manure and leaf mold and

890
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:05,279
they created so much organic matter on

891
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,800
the old course that actually there was

892
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,880
talk that the game of golf would not

893
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,920
continue because they couldn't get a

894
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,358
playable surface because of the worms

895
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,760
and it wasn't until the costic ammonium

896
00:36:14,358 --> 00:36:19,559
sulfate uh was developed that they could

897
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,880
put out there and really irritate them

898
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:24,599
it literally saved the game of golf so L

899
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,838
we think worms are in a big problem I

900
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:30,359
know I know St Andrews fairly well I'm

901
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:33,559
reading Gordon Mo's uh Memoir right now

902
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:35,318
he attributes it to putting out sand uh

903
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:37,078
on the old course that they they had

904
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:39,318
earthworm problems when he started so

905
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:41,480
that would have been in the early 90s uh

906
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:43,119
when he was working with Walter Woods

907
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,039
and I can tell you every time I've been

908
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,079
to St Andrews I find worm castings on

909
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:48,759
the first Fairway and is hard as a

910
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:52,039
fraking rock there you won't find a

911
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:54,720
firmer surface maybe Royal Melbourne but

912
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:56,519
uh man it's they're everywhere they're

913
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:58,039
everywh they're everywhere all right Ben

914
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:00,159
thanks for taking the time really

915
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:02,279
appreciate you doing it hope our travels

916
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:04,399
pass each other yeah see you brother

917
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,280
thank you this has been a production of
