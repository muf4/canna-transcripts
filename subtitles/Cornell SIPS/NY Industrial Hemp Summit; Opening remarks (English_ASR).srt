experts from other universities here in

27
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:10,519
New York State for industry members to

28
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:12,769
share their knowledge and to share their

29
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:15,799
experience on industrial hemp potential

30
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:18,649
impact on the economy here in New York

31
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:20,539
State the conversations that we are

32
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:23,209
having today are intended to help build

33
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:25,340
momentum around government Governor

34
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:28,549
Cuomo's vision for expanding industrial

35
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:31,069
hemp production here in New York and as

36
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:33,319
some of you heard me say this morning we

37
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:35,090
do have tremendous potential here in New

38
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:36,920
York State for the production of

39
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:40,159
industrial hemp which really has not

40
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:43,399
been grown here for decades now if

41
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,618
efficiently and and economically grown

42
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:48,200
an emphasis on that efficiently and

43
00:01:45,618 --> 00:01:51,469
economically grown industrial hemp could

44
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,390
be used to launch a wide range of New

45
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:55,899
York made goods that could include

46
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:59,689
things like healthy hemp seed oils

47
00:01:55,899 --> 00:02:03,259
building insulation animal bedding novel

48
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:05,478
medicinal products however because hemp

49
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:07,969
has not been grown commercially here in

50
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:10,580
our state for so long a great deal of

51
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:12,830
research and preparation lies ahead of

52
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,530
all of us and this is where Cornell

53
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:18,560
University and our SUNY partners come in

54
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,318
and and we have roles to play here for

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,959
example our plant BRE

56
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:25,268
have the knowledge and the experience to

57
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,670
advance hemp breeding and to test a

58
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:30,370
range of varieties for performance here

59
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:32,949
in our state they can help determine the

60
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,900
best growing practices for hemp here in

61
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:37,688
New York and where and when and under

62
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,700
what conditions it will flourish our

63
00:02:37,688 --> 00:02:42,479
college and our SUNY partners are

64
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:45,128
committed to providing sustainable

65
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,750
improvement in the lives of people here

66
00:02:45,128 --> 00:02:48,638
in New York State through our research

67
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,699
through our teaching and through our

68
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,980
outreach and we're particularly pleased

69
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:55,869
to work in concert specifically with our

70
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:57,759
SUNY partners our State University of

71
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,739

we are committed we are committed to

76
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:12,400
exploring New York's capacity to grow

77
00:03:09,938 --> 00:03:14,709
industrial hemp profitably and to take

78
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,469
advantage of new markets and through

79
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:20,560
such strategies we can help facilitate

80
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:22,389
rural economic agricultural development

81
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,329
throughout our state today's summit

82
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:27,400
really is only the beginning of what I

83
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:30,129
hope will be a very successful venture

84
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,180

really great to be here it's great to

129
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:23,620
see the crowd has gotten kind of

130
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:25,449
energized a little bigger there's a lot

131
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,718
of interest in this subject and thank

132
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:31,360
you so much Dean we had an awesome

133
00:05:28,718 --> 00:05:32,949
discussion this morning we had the

134
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,800
Lieutenant Governor here and some of

135
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:38,499
your elected representatives and some of

136
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,379
them still here but we had a great

137
00:05:38,499 --> 00:05:43,449
discussion a great summary we looked at

138
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:45,430
where the industry is now we looked at

139
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:47,408
what we've done so far we looked at our

140
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,569
potential and we looked at where the

141
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:51,430
opportunities for the state to intersect

142
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:54,879
and help grow it and I think we're

143
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:57,189
pretty much all on the same page and to

144
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,509
kind of summarize that I won't talk

145
00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:00,399
anymore but I would direct your

146
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:01,959
attention once again to the to the

147
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,490
screen we showed a video this morning

148
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:05,528
we're going to show it again because we

149
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:08,528
have a number of new people and because

150
00:06:05,528 --> 00:06:09,968
we like the video so if you would direct

151
00:06:08,528 --> 00:06:11,588
your attention to the thousands of

152
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:14,050
years-- industrial hemp has been a

153
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:16,088
valuable and versatile crop once a top

154
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,770
commodity on American farms production

155
00:06:16,088 --> 00:06:20,168
was driven out by other emerging

156
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:23,218
industries and eventually the federal

157
00:06:20,168 --> 00:06:26,740
government made it illegal to grow until

158
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:28,748
now recognizing its vast potential the

159
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,240
federal farm bill allowed States to

160
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:34,180
launch pilot programs for industrial

161
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,668
hemp research and in 2015 Governor Cuomo

162
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:39,038
announced a bold plan to put the Empire

163
00:06:36,668 --> 00:06:40,568
State at the forefront of the country's

164
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:42,699
hemp provided with the type of

165
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:45,610
legislative action that Governor Cuomo

166
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:47,530
has led with with Albany

167
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:50,050
it's making a real difference partnering

168
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:51,969
with SUNY Morrisville JD farms in

169
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,400
Madison County harvested New York's

170
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:57,580
first industrial hemp crop in decades

171
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:59,439
Cornell University wasn't far behind it

172
00:06:57,579 --> 00:07:01,629
was made possible through Governor

173
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:04,660
Cuomo's industrial hemp research pilot

174
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:06,879
program allowing up to ten permits to

175
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,400
grow and research hemp as an

176
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,350
agricultural commodity study nitrogen

177
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:13,659
content Mesilla we studied seeding rates

178
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:16,450
New York is abundant in water abundant

179
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,410
and arable land and for us this crop

180
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:20,019
made a lot of sense

181
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:23,230
hemp research is now expanding across

182
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:24,969
the state I think hemp is not only a

183
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:27,879
great opportunity for diversification on

184
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,380
the ground but it could lead to a lot of

185
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:31,269
great job and manufacturing

186
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:33,699
opportunities that we've lost sort of

187
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:35,829
today to globalization hemp and

188
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:38,199
marijuana may look similar but make no

189
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:40,240
mistake these plants have a significant

190
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,979
difference I think the major thing for

191
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,720
people to realize is that industrial

192
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:46,600
hemp is not marijuana even though it

193
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,900
looks like it THC is the mind-altering

194
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:52,620
drug and in marijuana and industrial

195
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:54,849
half have very very low levels of that

196
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,879
generations of innovators have pioneered

197
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:59,950
new markets for this dynamic crop using

198
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,899
every part of the plant to drive growth

199
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:04,000
in vital industries and boost the

200
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:06,849
profitability of the agricultural sector

201
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,339
today the US retail market for

202
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:11,500
industrial hemp is nearly six hundred

203
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:14,139
million dollars and makes a good

204
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,089
insulation as well as wallboard for

205
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:18,659
buildings will be useful for automobiles

206
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:21,339
pressboard and furniture bags and

207
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:24,460
biodegradable packaging material so

208
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:26,229
shampoos cosmetic products you shell

209
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:28,239
hemp seeds themselves or tasty and

210
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:29,800
they're a great superfood now with the

211
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,259
support of the state legislature

212
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,810
Governor Cuomo is taking the program to

213
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:36,539
the next level removing the cap on the

214
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:39,159
number of permits for hemp research

215
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:41,740
supporting unprecedented exploration of

216
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:43,990
the crops viability and encouraging New

217
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:48,080
York's best and brightest to discover

218
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:50,149
and rediscover hemp potential and as we

219
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,980
have more opportunity to do research I

220
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:54,259
think we can just make it a better crop

221
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,909
and a more economical crop across the

222
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:57,439
board we could bring lots of industry

223
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:58,399
back to New York State put a lot of

224
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,170
people back to work

225
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,419
Shep is really an industrial crop it

226
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:04,519
should just regain its rightful place in

227
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:06,500
the American agricultural landscape the

228
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:08,659
global demand for industrial hemp is

229
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:12,909
growing and here in New York the

230
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:12,909
possibilities are endless possibilities

231
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:23,809
are endless you know one of the words

232
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,339
that the Dean and I'd like to share with

233
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:26,838
each other quite a bit is collaboration

234
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:30,230
we talked about that a little bit

235
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:32,390
earlier but I think when we collaborate

236
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,830
and we have our partners here in the

237
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:37,549
room and we have our partners on the

238
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:39,860
same page who can be against this I like

239
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:41,838
our I like our chances here

240
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:46,070
the governor is very much committed to

241
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:48,290
this idea he's excited about hemp and we

242
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:50,120
talked about in our regular basis so

243
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:52,219
this is I just want to say from the

244
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,440
state standpoint we're committed to

245
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,690
staying with this and doing the things

246
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,829
that we need to do so there's a vision

247
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,890
behind all of this

248
00:09:57,828 --> 00:10:02,750
there's a very practical side of it

249
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:04,458
today's summit is even though we've been

250
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:07,339
working at this many of you for a long

251
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:11,569
time certainly many of us at the state

252
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:13,160
level for a couple of years now coming

253
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,560
up with the ideas and doing the

254
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:18,620
necessary work to get it over the hump

255
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:20,619
we're not done yet there's more to do in

256
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:24,528
this summit is really just the beginning

257
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:26,179
so excited to be here the Lieutenant

258
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:28,578
Governor when we got done with our

259
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:30,109
session this morning we had a good

260
00:10:28,578 --> 00:10:32,569
conversation with a number of our

261
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:35,659
partners we heard some needs

262
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:37,730
we heard some things that needed to to

263
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:40,278
be done in order of us for us to take

264
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,259
those next steps going forward and I'm

265
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:45,110
just going to summarize for you now some

266
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:49,429
of the deliverables from this morning

267
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:51,379
session that are underway as you know

268
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:53,958
the first legislation which was

269
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:57,289
sponsored by my colleague here to the

270
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:59,189
left it helped us get started and

271
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:02,250
allowed the Department

272
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:05,400
to designate some areas attached to

273
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:07,279
research institutions to begin to do

274
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,840
some work on hemp in New York State

275
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,759
well we've issued the first ever

276
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:15,149
research permits to private farms and

277
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:17,519
businesses and previously that pilot

278
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:20,189
program was limited to the research

279
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,590
institutions but at the governor's

280
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,930
direction we've expanded the pilot to

281
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:26,850
include private entities so six of those

282
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:29,789
private farms and businesses were issued

283
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:31,769
permits bring the total the total number

284
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:35,909
of hemp research sites across the state

285
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:38,639
to ten so we've added 21st century hemp

286
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:42,389
and our RIT in Rochester we've added

287
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:45,029
Cavallaro farms in Goshen New York once

288
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:48,120
again JD farms in eat in New York old

289
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:50,600
Mud Creek farm in Hudson New York the

290
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,100
plant science labs in Buffalo and

291
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,710
pre-process in ellsberg New York a

292
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,310
couple of other things of note that we

293
00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:01,920
heard from our partners this morning

294
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:03,989
going forward we're going to seek DEA

295
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,269
permit allowing businesses to import

296
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:09,810
seed and establish a seed distribution

297
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:13,559
site for international imports we heard

298
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:15,739
about the importance of C importing seed

299
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:19,409
is central to research in New York State

300
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:21,690
and in addition to that we are seeking a

301
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:23,969
US Drug Enforcement Agency permit to

302
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,410
import the seed so the New York State

303
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,330
Department of Ag and markets will

304
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:29,519
advocate to ease the federal

305
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,200
requirements to acquire hemp seed so

306
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,689
that will be making the federal efforts

307
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,810
as well but in the meantime we will hold

308
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:38,330
the permit at the Department happy to

309
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:41,250
announce that we're going to award

310
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:44,460
$400,000 to Cornell University to

311
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:46,529
continue to expand the research we heard

312
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:48,210
that loud and clear

313
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:50,129
the researchers at Cornell's AG

314
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:52,230
Experiment Station in Geneva are going

315
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:54,088
to explore the best practices for

316
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,889
growing varieties the best varieties of

317
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:58,200
them the different soil types the

318
00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:59,759
various locations around the state we've

319
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,320
got a lot of catching up to do

320
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,539
culturally if we're going to be

321
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,700
successful with this crop and the

322
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:08,219
Experiment Station will also assess hemp

323
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,100
seed quality for germination and weed

324
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,210
contamination so thank you for that

325
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,830
we're going to establish a hemp

326
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,480
technical

327
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:17,300
team the lieutenant governor talked

328
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,889
about this to support optimal growing

329
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:20,839
and processing of hemp

330
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:22,970
the state will establish a hemp

331
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,070
technical team consisting of our

332
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,509
department in Ag and markets of liaison

333
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:29,750
they're three Cornell Cooperative

334
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:32,000
Extension partners educators in the

335
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:34,789
field so we need to stay on the same

336
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,649
page as we go forward we're going to

337
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:38,389
increase our testing capacity at the

338
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,850
department we heard about that this

339
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:43,250
morning as a need the department will

340
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:45,050
apply for a permit to test industrial

341
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,659
hemp for THC which is an important part

342
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:49,669
of the process obviously this additional

343
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:51,919
lab capacity will help ensure that New

344
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:54,709
York State emceed and other products are

345
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,209
accepted in other states testing will

346
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,889
also provide protection to the

347
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,590
department that growers the researchers

348
00:13:57,889 --> 00:14:03,379
that the crops meet the acceptable THC

349
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:05,480
level we're gonna create a working group

350
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:07,610
on top of the technical team a working

351
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,550
group to stay on the same page again to

352
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:12,980
support industry development it will

353
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:15,349
include academic partners key industry

354
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,870
members other state agencies to

355
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:20,060
strengthen the hemp industry in New York

356
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:22,460
State the working group will help build

357
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:24,829
relationships share information and best

358
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:27,170
management practices regulatory

359
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:30,460
requirements and as we go forward

360
00:14:27,169 --> 00:14:32,809
identify the research needs that come up

361
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:34,730
we're gonna engage stakeholders and

362
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:37,219
program development so we're all

363
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:40,029
partners in this we'll seek input from

364
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:43,040
farmers researchers industry leaders

365
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:44,689
will look to revise the pilot program as

366
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:48,589
we need to the regulations and the

367
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:50,720
program requirements and in addition

368
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:52,879
we'll propose changes to minimize the

369
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,680
oversight of the research done by the

370
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:58,549
educational institutions as it's

371
00:14:54,679 --> 00:15:00,639
appropriate and I think this is clearly

372
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:03,169
very important point to make here

373
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,110
advocate for the federal policies to

374
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:08,149
boost the industry we're still

375
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,769
restricted we still have this cloud

376
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:12,679
hanging over our head and over this

377
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:14,329
industry but the governor has an office

378
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:16,309
in Washington DC they're very active

379
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:19,129
they're on the same page with you and

380
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:22,459
with us they have influence with the

381
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:24,110
Congress down there for me at the

382
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,030
Department of Agriculture and at our

383
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:28,129
other agencies in the state we all have

384
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:29,990
national relationships with other

385
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:33,019
commissioners secretaries and directors

386
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,730
and that organization will also advocate

387
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:37,850
and we'll work through those channels as

388
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:40,159
well to help advance what we know to be

389
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,529
the right direction to go in so I think

390
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:44,240
I'm encouraged I'm encouraged at the

391
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:47,240
national level I'm encouraged certainly

392
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,070
here at the state level I think as you

393
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,409
go through this afternoon you will see

394
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:53,720
the quality of program the quality of

395
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:57,350
people involved in here and you should

396
00:15:53,720 --> 00:16:00,320
be encouraged as well with that let me

397
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:04,009
introduce our partner and Assemblymember

398
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,140
downlo Pardo who has sent me more emails

399
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:09,379
in the last year than I've got from any

400
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:11,870
other single source I think she's very

401
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:14,809
focused she's very passionate she cares

402
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:16,789
a great deal about her people her farms

403
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:22,059
her agriculture here in New York State

404
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:22,059
and this mission so with that thank you

405
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:33,290
she's never given me that email address

406
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:35,750
that was your first problem well hi

407
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:38,569
everyone it's really very nice of you to

408
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:40,850
all be here today and you share I'm sure

409
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:43,760
aren't interested passion in this new

410
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,019
exciting crop industrial hemp you know

411
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,600
many of us I'm sure in the room are old

412
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:50,600
enough to have you know lamented for a

413
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,210
very very long time that this crop was

414
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,639
something we could not grow and as I

415
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:57,730
became more familiar with the potential

416
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:00,949
of this crop it was really unacceptable

417
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:03,680
to be honest with you that we had a

418
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:05,509
consumer demand for products people were

419
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:08,568
purchasing products people were

420
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:12,170
manufacturing products with imported

421
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:14,149
materials and it didn't make any sense

422
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:16,670
to me whatsoever that we weren't able to

423
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:19,310
afford our farmers that opportunity and

424
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:22,130
to give manufacturers homegrown local

425
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:24,559
product and when the farm bill came

426
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:27,439
along which allowed New York State to

427
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:30,559
become a place where we could do pilot

428
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,420
research senator O'Mara and I jumped all

429
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,480
over it and I'm you know it was a bit of

430
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:38,000
a stretch to people we had to go one by

431
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,740
one with the vote ham why industrial

432
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,750
hemp sheet and explained to people right

433
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:44,240
off the bat that it was not marijuana it

434
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:46,429
was a cousin it was this it was that and

435
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,829
they finally understood especially for

436
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:51,740
places like upstate New York the

437
00:17:48,829 --> 00:17:54,379
enormous economic potential for not only

438
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:56,690
farmers but for manufacturers I come

439
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,520
from Endicott New York and represent

440
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:01,190
Endicott and Binghamton area which was

441
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:03,740
all about shoes and computers it was a

442
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:06,200
manufacturing town so many places are as

443
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:10,819
well and to get the economic developers

444
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:12,590
to have this come to clarity for them

445
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:15,639
that this isn't just about growing a

446
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:18,980
crop this is about producing goods and

447
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,570
services but making goods again in New

448
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,910
York State and I think that's what

449
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:25,490
really began to turn people around about

450
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:28,308
this the following year the farm bill

451
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:31,329
gave us another opportunity to not only

452
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:34,819
research this crop but to also market it

453
00:18:31,329 --> 00:18:36,829
transport it process it and sell it if

454
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:38,359
it were not for that particular bill all

455
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:39,619
the research crops would have had to

456
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:41,689
have been destroyed which would be a

457
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:43,219
terrible thing because the forty acres

458
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:45,500
of beautiful hemp that you're seeing and

459
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:48,529
depicted in this logo behind us that JD

460
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,480
farms was just a spectacular thing to

461
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:56,649
see and smells pretty good too by the

462
00:18:50,480 --> 00:19:00,829
way let's say and so we are now able to

463
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:02,990
to take advantage full advantage of what

464
00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:04,189
they have allowed we've stocked this at

465
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,190
the federal level whatever they've

466
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:09,529
allowed we've come right behind it

467
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:12,110
Senator Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell

468
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:13,970
are the sponsors of these bills and some

469
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:17,058
of our own senator senator Gillibrand

470
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:19,789
are sponsors of the industrial hemp

471
00:19:17,058 --> 00:19:21,289
farming act you know while they are

472
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:23,659
trying to figure this out in Washington

473
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:27,159
New York State is positioning itself to

474
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:29,650
be very competitive an all manner of

475
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:33,290
hemp whether it's in the pharmaceutical

476
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:36,440
nutraceutical textiles of various food

477
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:39,079
and other other products that are

478
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,850
already in the works it's very exciting

479
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:43,069
so when the federal government does

480
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:45,379
relax this which will make it a little

481
00:19:43,069 --> 00:19:47,119
bit easier for us we will have the

482
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,950
Northeast pretty much sewed up as far as

483
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,019
I can tell and all of you who are in the

484
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,690
room who expecting to get involved in

485
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:52,859
this

486
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,769
I think will be very pleased with

487
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:58,769
outcome commissioner a ball mentioned

488
00:19:55,769 --> 00:20:01,019
some of the fabulous developments at the

489
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:03,120
state level we're very lucky that the

490
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:07,048
state is willing to really come to

491
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:09,839
assist on the de a seed certification a

492
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:13,558
seed acquisition issue and all the rest

493
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:16,019
of these considerations with research

494
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:17,759
dollars becoming behind it and trying to

495
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:19,319
make it easier for those of you who have

496
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,110
been involved in the craft beverage

497
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:23,730
industry once the state got its head

498
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:25,949
wrapped around making it easier for

499
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:27,960
craft beverages you have seen the

500
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:30,000
results and I can tell you without a

501
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,450
shadow of a doubt that this is the next

502
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,089
thing that the governor and team are

503
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:38,100
putting their full force and focus

504
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:41,009
behind it's truly a very exciting time

505
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:44,329
for those of us who've long long wish

506
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:47,669
that Hamm could be receiving its due so

507
00:20:44,329 --> 00:20:50,638
what I want to just say in closing is

508
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:54,059
that just to get everybody on the same

509
00:20:50,638 --> 00:20:55,709
page we had 10 research licenses as part

510
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:58,500
of the original program and those have

511
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:00,808
all been filled what is about to happen

512
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,278
now as part of the recent budget is

513
00:21:00,808 --> 00:21:04,349
going again the Commissioner mentioned

514
00:21:02,278 --> 00:21:05,970
they're going to be unlimited licenses

515
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:07,918
available but regs have to be

516
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:10,679
established for that so we're a little

517
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,809
we're a little behind for this growing

518
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:15,179
season but I would fully expect and I

519
00:21:12,808 --> 00:21:19,528
hope correct me if I'm wrong the 2018

520
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:22,590
will very likely be the year when we can

521
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:25,019
see a much larger build-out among

522
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:27,558
farmers who are interested it's going to

523
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:30,120
be critical however that those farmers

524
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:31,589
understand the supply chain and are

525
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:33,750
going to be growing for a particular

526
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:35,970
market so they're not just randomly

527
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,319
growing some random cultivar they're

528
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,808
going to be growing from a particular

529
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:41,819
market and that market is going to have

530
00:21:39,808 --> 00:21:45,778
processing available and we have in the

531
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:48,628
mix proposals right now to do hubs in

532
00:21:45,778 --> 00:21:52,319
the area of whether it be on CBD oil or

533
00:21:48,628 --> 00:21:55,769
in fiber so in 2018 you may very well be

534
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:58,200
in a position to have a marriage with a

535
00:21:55,769 --> 00:22:00,149
particular company that wants a certain

536
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,369
type of strain and you may have a

537
00:22:00,148 --> 00:22:04,018
processor in the mix so it's all

538
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:04,669
seamless with the assistance from the

539
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:06,559
state

540
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,269
so thanks for your patience over these

541
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,789
years and decades for some of us who

542
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:12,230
have cared about this plant our time has

543
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:15,049
finally come and I'm absolutely

544
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,730
delighted to be part of it and happy to

545
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:23,539
to play whatever role I need to in the

546
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:25,970
future thank you this has been a

547
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:30,789
production of Cornell University on the

548
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,789
