where does forum has been going through

33
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,359
some really exciting changes and these

34
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:47,659
two have been at the heart of some of

35
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,129
those changes really strengthening

36
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:52,950
accountability and responsibility in the

37
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:55,408

positive experiences from working with

after you hear them today you'll see

79
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:36,839
that they should likely have no trouble

80
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:38,949
going forward in the world given their

81
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,409
the way in which they're ready to

82
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:43,419

yours Thank You Marcia for that

86
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,790
introduction good afternoon everybody

87
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,860
once again my name is hawk and this is

88
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:07,329
sarah and we are representing the Hortis

89
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,610
forum Cornell's undergraduate

90
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,650
horticulture Club today the reason for

91
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,930
our presentation is because last spring

92
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,430
we applied for an engaged leadership

93
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,340
opportunity grant through engaged

94
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:20,079
Cornell and one of our pay ups to that

95
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:21,459
was to have a presentation at the end of

96
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,668
the year kind of summing up our

97
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:26,110
reflection on the whole grant process

98
00:04:23,668 --> 00:04:27,849
just a little background on for this

99
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,009
forum we have a mission statement that's

100
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,110
cultivating a positive social community

101
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:34,449
which fosters a passion for plants and

102
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,919
teaches the value of horticulture we try

103
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:38,339
to embody this and all the activities

104
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,918
that we do and it's a plethora of

105
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:42,000
activities throughout the semester

106
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,649
Wednesdays we usually have meetings

107
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,540
every week except for the first

108
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:47,399
Wednesday which is an officer meeting

109
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,620
that's where we do hands-on activities

110
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:51,448
industry tours whether they're local or

111
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,220
even on campus and then we do Club

112
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:55,590
updates so general club happenings

113
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,840
you've probably seen sales around campus

114
00:04:55,589 --> 00:05:00,599
before we do Friday sales it's either a

115
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,369
man Lobby physical sciences building or

116
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,379
sometimes Hope Plaza and then we do

117
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,120
social events also so where we kind of

118
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:10,319
connect to the community but also have

119
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:12,209
our name tied to it as well so more on

120
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,649
our engaged leadership grant we have a

121
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:16,500
three-part program that Sarah is going

122
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:18,929
to outline for us today so when we were

123
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,478
looking back at our grant we kind of

124
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,220
split it up into three main problems or

125
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:25,289
topic areas that we were kind of

126
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,720
experiencing so the first is

127
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,160
horticultural learning opportunities we

128
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,660
realized we were kind of falling into a

129
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,070
routine and we wanted to make sure we

130
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,090
are getting the most out of this

131
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:35,519
learning experience

132
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:38,159
the second is exploring public and

133
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,659
purposeful mission again we have this

134
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,490
beautiful mission statement but we

135
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,919
weren't utilizing it and we weren't

136
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,680
necessarily following it to its most

137
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:49,649
capacity and the third part is a

138
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,360
leadership model alteration so we

139
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:53,609
realized that the way our leadership

140
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,740
model was set up we weren't really

141
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:58,680
utilizing each other and the work wasn't

142
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,509
being distributed accordingly so the way

143
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,519
we're gonna kind of explain this grant

144
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:05,189
and our processes is that we're gonna

145
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:06,810
start by telling you about what problems

146
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:09,719
we were facing and then how we addressed

147
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,459
it through the grant followed by the

148
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,310
outcomes what is going well what are we

149
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:15,839
still working on yep I'll start with the

150
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,788
first part which is the new hoard of

151
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,769
cultural opportunities and we looked at

152
00:06:17,788 --> 00:06:21,538
this through the lens of plant sales so

153
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:23,668
one of the big things that artists forum

154
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:25,918
does is we have to greenhouse base up at

155
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:28,859
kpl greenhouses where we produce a whole

156
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,240
bunch of different plants some of the

157
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,830
problems that we have with producing

158
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,168
these plants is that we're selling to a

159
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:36,029
flooded market we usually have people

160
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:38,038
who are buying the same plants over and

161
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:39,629
over again and when we're only doing

162
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:41,668
sales at three different locations we

163
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:44,639
see the same people you can only make so

164
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:46,259
much money out of man lobby we also have

165
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,478
a lack of learning opportunity with the

166
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:49,800
same plants we have a whole bunch of

167
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,229
begonias and a whole bunch of snake

168
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,210
plants usually we just divide them or

169
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:56,160
leaf cuttings from them and we do the

170
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:58,019
same thing over and over again so it's

171
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,250
gets very monotonous and we're not

172
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:01,139
really expanding our learning

173
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,399
opportunities that way and we're not

174
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:04,529
really paying attention to what our

175
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,689
consumers need if we're operating as

176
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:08,369
like a club business for fundraising we

177
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:10,819
should also know what we're selling to

178
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:13,230
who we're selling and why we're selling

179
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:15,719
so our steps towards improvement through

180
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,069
the grant we decided to consolidate and

181
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,080
transition one of the two of our

182
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:22,649
greenhouse bays into a spring vegetable

183
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:24,990
starter this met this method had us take

184
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:27,269
our separate succulent house and

185
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,410
tropical house combine them into one and

186
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:30,169
make sure there are practices were on

187
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,820
point so they're all combined

188
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:34,740
sterilizing this newly opened house and

189
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,750
then replacing it with seeded vegetables

190
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,189
so seeds is a new opportunity that we

191
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,189
started to step in rather than a leaf

192
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:42,629
cutting or division propagation through

193
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:44,100
this we had an opportunity to learn

194
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,719
about the growing of vegetable crops

195
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,000
bedding plants and then hanging basket

196
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,490
through a donation with dr. bill Miller

197
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,259
and finally we actually could expand our

198
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:56,939
market to the Greater Ithaca community

199
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:58,649
and not just students these are some of

200
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:00,750
the varieties all these pictures that

201
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:04,319
you see were taken by cordis forum

202
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,670
members in our greenhouses or later on

203
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,449
we'll see some pictures from Steve

204
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:11,400
riders now we're talking about outcomes

205
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:13,560
so positive outcomes of doing this

206
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,939
change in the sale perspective is that

207
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,610
we learned how to grow a wider variety

208
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:19,560
of plants in the greenhouse it expanded

209
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,790
our market so bedding plants and

210
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,470
vegetables you're not really going to be

211
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:25,140
selling to students here we're here for

212
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:27,120
only a semester we geared more towards

213
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:30,269
the Ithaca community we had to send out

214
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,370
publications and to staff so they could

215
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:34,289
have gardens over the summer we increase

216
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,029
our membership product participation

217
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:37,769
with many projects by sending out email

218
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:39,478
saying this is a new opportunity that

219
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:41,129
you can get involved in it's hands-on

220
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,200
and it's gonna take a lot of work we

221
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:45,240
hope to see you there and then finally

222
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,560
we had a connection to the community we

223
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,730
weren't just selling a house plant we

224
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,739
were selling something that they could

225
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:52,500
use for food and it had a very good

226
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,970
impact on our club some of learning

227
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,990
opportunities we didn't really want to

228
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,759
say negatives throughout this

229
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,620
presentation this is just something that

230
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:00,809
we can work towards in the future the

231
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,320
sale timing and planning we sowed our

232
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:02,819
seeds

233
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,079
too early and we ended up having

234
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:08,809
tomatoes that were almost four feet high

235
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:12,169
trying to put individual labels in each

236
00:09:08,808 --> 00:09:13,818
four inch pot was extremely difficult we

237
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:16,009
started to have some leaning plants tip

238
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:18,799
over entire flats flip onto the floor

239
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:21,019
and have to throw those out our sale

240
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:24,738
time actually conflicted with the Ithaca

241
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:26,869
garden sale downtown so we're trying to

242
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:28,239
pull the same type of consumers from

243
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:30,980
Ithaca who's been going there for years

244
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:32,540
up to our greenhouses at kpo which is

245
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:36,619
still kind of hard to describe how to

246
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:39,078
get to we also didn't budget and how

247
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:41,689
much plants to produce and kind of match

248
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:43,159
it to the consumers need for that so in

249
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:44,719
coming next year's we're gonna have to

250
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:46,219
definitely evaluate how much we had

251
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,769
leftover and how much we should actually

252
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,689
sell for the next year

253
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:52,489
and I talked about our growing issues we

254
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:54,528
also had a really warm greenhouse and

255
00:09:52,489 --> 00:09:57,350
the tomatoes liked that so I kind of

256
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:59,360
just perpetuated our problem we did not

257
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,159
use any sprays when we were growing

258
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,019
these plants we used a lot of beneficial

259
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:06,528
insects and when we have a lot of leaf

260
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:10,249
cover and dense planting it just

261
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:12,169
increases pest potential moving forward

262
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:14,089
so our next steps we will be doing a

263
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:15,948
spring sale next spring we're going to

264
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:18,049
tweak how what varieties we use and how

265
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,519
much we're going to grow we're also

266
00:10:18,048 --> 00:10:23,269
going to seed them at the right time

267
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,649
hopefully we use Neal Matson and we're

268
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:26,778
going to use them again as a resource

269
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:28,999
and hopefully have a better outcome for

270
00:10:26,778 --> 00:10:32,119
that and then we're gonna look for a new

271
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:33,499
sale opportunity position kpo

272
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:36,019
greenhouses as I mentioned it was hard

273
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:38,119
to get to livestock position pavilion

274
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:40,068
has an actual address that we can send

275
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:41,689
to consumers to say come here to the

276
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:45,889
livestock pavilion will have plants for

277
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:47,778
you so the next part of our grant really

278
00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:49,730
focuses on exploring public and

279
00:10:47,778 --> 00:10:51,740
purposeful mission so while we have this

280
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,659
club and we we love plants and we want

281
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,850
to share that love with others we were

282
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:57,649
so kind of struggling to find good

283
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:00,798
meaning and to have that meaning match

284
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:03,139
our actions so the existing problems

285
00:11:00,798 --> 00:11:05,360
again are just embodying our mission of

286
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:07,188
cultivating a positive social community

287
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,438
which fosters a passion for plants and

288
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:11,088
teaches the value of horticulture we

289
00:11:09,438 --> 00:11:13,360
were often finding that we were profit

290
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:16,189
driven but we wanted to be philanthropic

291
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,470
so it was kind of finding a good balance

292
00:11:16,188 --> 00:11:23,549
and also motivating our members

293
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:25,830
you see the same vision so through the

294
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:28,709
grant we wanted to work with Geneva

295
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:31,470
community gardens to grow Transplant

296
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:34,170
special transplants for that program we

297
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:36,960
also reached out to cows departments to

298
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:39,240
find expert experts in different fields

299
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,180
and to make sure that we were building

300
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,049
our knowledge and our skill sets

301
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,639
accordingly

302
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:47,399
we reached out to Professor Perrault CEO

303
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,379
to talk about marketing and how we want

304
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:52,220
others to see our club and what we want

305
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:55,289
our club brand to be just as one example

306
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:58,800
we also hosted a cow's wide workshop on

307
00:11:55,289 --> 00:12:01,469
community gardens with Fiona dougherty

308
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:04,559
dr. Steve riders and dr. Christine smart

309
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:07,200
who are able to talk to us as well as

310
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,629
cows members and other students and

311
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,890
faculty and staff about how important

312
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:15,120
community gardens are and what

313
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:17,939
opportunities we have there so things

314
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,429
that were really positive on Cynthia and

315
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,350
I you can see us there on the right we

316
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:23,309
went to the giveaway day in May and it

317
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:27,029
was really excellent

318
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:28,769
it was so humbling and and great to see

319
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:30,569
community members really excited about

320
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:32,429
these plants and asking great questions

321
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:35,070
about how to grow them and how to care

322
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:37,889
for them and looking at producing their

323
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:40,020
own vegetables the plants were

324
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:42,629
distributed to a dozen community gardens

325
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:44,189
around Geneva and of 5,000 pounds of

326
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:46,889
fresh produce that was produced

327
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:50,400
throughout Geneva approximately half was

328
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:52,080
thrown from Hortis foreign plants so you

329
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,559
know for a first-year program that's

330
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:57,360
really exciting to know that our efforts

331
00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:01,349
here in Cornell can make a big impact

332
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,360
elsewhere some challenges we faced was

333
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:06,540
that our giveaway day was the same day

334
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,639
as our budding plant sale so we were

335
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:12,480
kind of struggling to find the students

336
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,009
to go to the giveaway day and it was

337
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,259
hard to recruit student participants

338
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:18,569
overall about volunteering I think

339
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:20,759
people liked the idea but during final

340
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:22,440
exam period and throughout school

341
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:24,439
everyone's busy and everyone's stressed

342
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,820
and then sometimes difficult to find

343
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,870
ways to motivate people to follow

344
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:33,180
through and just getting people there to

345
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:36,509
see how exciting and how worthwhile

346
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:39,149
project is moving forward we would love

347
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:41,100
to do another giveaway day maybe even

348
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:42,689
having more giveaway days and sending

349
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,940
different students on different days to

350
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:46,980
different locations so that way we can

351
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:50,070
increase our impact and also get more

352
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:52,230
Club members excited about this project

353
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,850
we're also looking for opportunities for

354
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,379
Community Impact looking at different

355
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,360
community gardens looking at different

356
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:59,129
places where we can distribute our

357
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,000
plants or looking for different niches

358
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:05,309
where we can grow different plants which

359
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,330
also ties back into our learning

360
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:12,599
potentials now on to the most

361
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:14,700
complicated part of our grant writing so

362
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,470
we actually got a specific type of

363
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,690
engaged Cornell grant it was under the

364
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:20,519
leadership branch of it

365
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:23,960
the original leadership model that we

366
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:26,250
have is one way our new proposed kind of

367
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,930
hybrid variety of leadership model is

368
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,309
another way I'll try to explain it the

369
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:31,019
best that I can if you have any

370
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:34,079
questions during this point feel free to

371
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:35,759
raise your hand so the problems that we

372
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,400
had with our existing model of

373
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,450
leadership is that we have a vertical

374
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:41,370
hierarchical leadership model where we

375
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:44,430
had a president a vice president

376
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:46,529
secretary and so on it was an uneven

377
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:48,359
distribution of work so some officers

378
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:50,669
really wouldn't be there unless it was

379
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,409
super needed for them to be there and

380
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:54,750
others would be there 100% of the time

381
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:57,240
and it was an unclear and overlapping

382
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,470
job descriptions for example one of the

383
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,360
things that we had is who's going to

384
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,660
post on social media is that the

385
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,700
Secretary's job is at the webmasters job

386
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:07,469
and finally we have a club of officers

387
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,210
it's a core group of students who we

388
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:11,129
find always at the green house or always

389
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:13,710
at our sales but we have a listserv

390
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:15,539
that's over a hundred members log so we

391
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:19,200
try to evaluate like how are we going to

392
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:21,539
include the other steps towards

393
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,100
improvement we developed a horizontal

394
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:25,379
leadership model instead of a vertical

395
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,090
model we created a whole new sales

396
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:29,970
position that would cater towards that

397
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:31,800
specific positions needs and then we

398
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,930
added consulting advisors like Marsh

399
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:38,579
mentioned in the introduction we added

400
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:40,549
leah dr. Madsen and dr. lamb so now a

401
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:43,170
visual so you can see what the original

402
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:45,870
hierarchical leadership model looked

403
00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:47,099
like we have four greenhouse workers

404
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,960
usually two of them

405
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,029
head greenhouse managers and then two of

406
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,560
them are apprentices usually we hope

407
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:54,299
that the apprentices would take on the

408
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:57,419
greenhouse manager position in the next

409
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:58,859
year however that's not always true one

410
00:15:57,419 --> 00:16:00,539
of the main problems that we find with

411
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,810
this is that there's no clear connection

412
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:05,909
with who's interacting with our members

413
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:08,459
so we have all these physicians but no

414
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:10,169
real direction and where to go to with

415
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,780
our horizontal leadership model we try

416
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:14,849
to change that we created work teams

417
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:16,649
instead of just positioned so that we

418
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,509
have a direct connection to our members

419
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:20,699
you can see now that we have the sales

420
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:22,529
treasurer position on the far right but

421
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,050
we also have the greenhouse webmaster

422
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:26,879
public relations treasurer and under

423
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:28,549
that whole umbrella is the president

424
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,960
position who's more acting like a CEO

425
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:32,490
asking to make sure that all the working

426
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,259
groups are doing what needs to get done

427
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:36,690
and that they're actually saying on top

428
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:39,149
of their tasks at any point in my

429
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:40,890
position as the president I can step in

430
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:42,750
and help another group out but it's not

431
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:46,949
really my main responsibility as much as

432
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:48,690
the team and the members positives that

433
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:51,330
we've had for this is that we've had an

434
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:53,070
improvement in the tasks distribution we

435
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,950
have now clear expectations on what

436
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:57,120
working team is supposed to do what

437
00:16:54,950 --> 00:17:00,180
we've strengthened our knowledge base

438
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,990
through faculty connections we can draw

439
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:06,119
on different specialties that we have so

440
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:08,099
dr. Mattson has all of this greenhouse

441
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:09,989
production knowledge I'm sure we're

442
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:12,539
going to be calling on dr. lamb for IPM

443
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:14,099
and the greenhouse for the spring and

444
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:15,509
then we have more member inclusiveness

445
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:17,309
fostered through these explicit

446
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:19,259
connection with working groups we're now

447
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:20,039
sending out signups and say if you want

448
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:21,449
to work with Maya

449
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,909
our sales treasurer who's doing

450
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:37,019
marketing and sales organization sign up

451
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:39,029
and connect with her so that's gonna

452
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:41,309
come up in like two slides it's moving

453
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:44,009
forward so if you hold on to that

454
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:45,960
thought I will get to it some of our

455
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:48,359
learning opportunities is the stroma

456
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,900
with involvement of the balance credit

457
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:53,729
volunteering and effort we have students

458
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,500
who were still seeing or just touch and

459
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,299
go when it comes to events if it says

460
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,930
free on it they're there if it says work

461
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:01,849
on it they're not

462
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:03,259
so we're trying to incorporate this

463
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:05,599
whole thing of like you can get

464
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:08,180
something if you put something in we're

465
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,199
trying to say that in a very nice way so

466
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,960
that we're not saying that this is

467
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,400
mandatory for you to be in this club and

468
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,990
then finally the accountability and

469
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,800
transparency that comes with these

470
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:21,259
officer positions we have five new five

471
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:22,819
exclaimed expanded positions but now all

472
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:24,829
of those positions need to work together

473
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:27,019
with each other to make sure that that

474
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:28,970
overlap is not going to happen again the

475
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:30,980
transparency is becoming because Marsha

476
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:33,829
is requiring us to do bi-weekly updates

477
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,360
which help everybody in the club I'm

478
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:39,619
just saying like what officer is doing

479
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:42,169
what for that coming week moving forward

480
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:44,419
we know that this is a workable model

481
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:46,160
it's not set in stone yet we just

482
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:48,529
transitioned into it it doesn't mean

483
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,910
that all of our problems are solved it's

484
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:52,509
going to be malleable for the future

485
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:55,130
outlook now the problem that we had that

486
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:57,500
Don just mentioned was that motivating

487
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,180
members to join these working teams how

488
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,710
are we supposed to do that if we're

489
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:03,019
having problems getting them to show up

490
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:05,480
to some of our meetings we're trying to

491
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:07,309
include a top-down enthusiasm so we have

492
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,019
working teams and I'm trying to

493
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:11,779
encourage them to reach out to members

494
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:13,730
be more than a net ID and have them show

495
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:15,710
your face at a meeting and show your

496
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:17,360
face at a sale to say hello my name is

497
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,220
hawk I'm the president would you like to

498
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:20,750
work with me on this project actually

499
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,789
getting your voice out there and making

500
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:26,029
that personal connection to the members

501
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:28,159
it's not happening 100% now it's still a

502
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:29,839
dream up in the air we're trying to pin

503
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,400
it down for next semester which is going

504
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:37,279
to happen in the reflection definitely

505
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:38,600
for this fall so just beyond the grant

506
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:41,119
we've been having a lot of success in

507
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:43,039
other areas of our club we've been more

508
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,959
excited about finding new ideas for club

509
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,490
meetings before we were kind of stuck in

510
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,370
these routines of doing the same

511
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,630
activities every year and with these new

512
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:53,779
changes has kind of sparked some

513
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:56,690
inspiration for new ideas we've been

514
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:58,819
really excited about doing more

515
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,470
community events such as the succulent

516
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:03,230
planter that was given to president

517
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:05,269
Pollock and Dean for which we had

518
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:07,339
students on the art squad helped to

519
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:10,099
plant such planter and it turned out

520
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:12,379
really great as you can see we want to

521
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:13,699
host more intentional free community

522
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,470
activities too

523
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,100
continue to get the community engaged

524
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:21,100
and to keep our members engaged as well

525
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:23,269
we're making new club partnerships and

526
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:25,459
reaching to the public and making sure

527
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:26,599
that we're not just falling into a

528
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,880
routine but we're really pushing

529
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:30,798
ourselves to be active in the community

530
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,419
and to be working with other groups to

531
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:35,450
make sure that we are getting the most

532
00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:37,730
out of this experience so we'd like to

533
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:39,710
give a huge thank you to engaged Fornell

534
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:41,990
for sponsoring this grant and all of our

535
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,819
projects we also like to thank our

536
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:46,609
advisor Marsha game she's Lee who's been

537
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:49,250
with us every step of the way dr. Reiner

538
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:50,959
is doctor smart um Fiona Daugherty for

539
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:54,589
helping us with all the community garden

540
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:58,159
work as well as Kevin who is a he's now

541
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:59,418
a graduate student but he was an

542
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,919
undergraduate member and he's always

543
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:03,919
around and he takes great pictures and

544
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:05,690
he's really fun and was a great help for

545
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,190
this presentation we'd also like to

546
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,778
thank everyone else who's been there

547
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:24,788
with us throughout the way and everyone

548
00:21:08,778 --> 00:21:26,778
who supports so one of the trade offs

549
00:21:24,788 --> 00:21:29,658
horizontal management structures it's

550
00:21:26,778 --> 00:21:31,970
harder to make decisions because people

551
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:36,889
evolve you've found that to be true and

552
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:38,990
have you done that yes so I have a very

553
00:21:36,888 --> 00:21:42,859
strong opinion when it comes to making

554
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:45,259
decisions my philosophy is that if you

555
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:48,229
think of the idea you can also think of

556
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:50,058
a way to get it done so if someone for

557
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:52,069
example comes up with me that the idea

558
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:54,109
is saying oh it's a great idea to have

559
00:21:52,069 --> 00:21:56,509
business cards I'm like that is a good

560
00:21:54,109 --> 00:21:57,979
idea Maya is doing sales and you can

561
00:21:56,509 --> 00:21:59,750
hand out business cards there how about

562
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,480
you collaborate with Maya and make that

563
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:05,000
happen so it's I'm very much so like

564
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,649
it's either a yes we can try to do it or

565
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,269
what are the problems with it how can we

566
00:22:06,648 --> 00:22:10,219
work to fix it before we start rolling

567
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:12,788
with it but I usually hold the person

568
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:18,740
who comes up with the idea accountable

569
00:22:12,788 --> 00:22:21,798
go ahead my question is what did the

570
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:23,960
engage Cornell grant provide you in

571
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:26,509
terms of resources and people that you

572
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,028
know could interact with or fight

573
00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:31,519
mm-hmm so one of the problems that we've

574
00:22:29,028 --> 00:22:34,159
had is the money struggle if we're

575
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:35,690
profit motivated sometimes we always

576
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,209
don't want to spend our own money to do

577
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:40,548
stuff especially when we have trips and

578
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:41,719
things going on engaged Cornell gave us

579
00:22:40,548 --> 00:22:43,368
an opportunity to kind of take that

580
00:22:41,719 --> 00:22:45,649
weight off our shoulders to do this

581
00:22:43,368 --> 00:22:47,988
community deity donation they paid for

582
00:22:45,648 --> 00:22:50,208
plant materials the growing time in the

583
00:22:47,989 --> 00:22:53,149
greenhouses and then also some of the

584
00:22:50,209 --> 00:22:54,859
outreach stuff so we did printing like

585
00:22:53,148 --> 00:22:56,689
the plant varieties when we gave away

586
00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:59,568
the plants instead like what they were

587
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:02,808
good for we actually only used a quarter

588
00:22:59,568 --> 00:23:07,028
of the funding that we requested because

589
00:23:02,808 --> 00:23:13,878
we got a lot of faculty donations to us

590
00:23:07,028 --> 00:23:17,108
does that answer you a question okay you

591
00:23:13,878 --> 00:23:20,388
mentioned that you're seeking new

592
00:23:17,108 --> 00:23:22,818
collaborations and partnerships there's

593
00:23:20,388 --> 00:23:25,939
quite a few students here who are part

594
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:30,078
of Soho has there been any efforts to

595
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:32,088
collaborate between artists and so um

596
00:23:30,078 --> 00:23:33,979
actually from our experience there

597
00:23:32,088 --> 00:23:36,219
hasn't been and that's definitely a

598
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:38,348
space and a void that needs to be filled

599
00:23:36,219 --> 00:23:41,149
because we have a lot of the same goals

600
00:23:38,348 --> 00:23:44,208
and we want to do the same things and

601
00:23:41,148 --> 00:23:45,588
we're interested in the same topics but

602
00:23:44,209 --> 00:23:47,839
absolutely that's definitely a space

603
00:23:45,588 --> 00:23:50,269
that needs to be filled in the coming

604
00:23:47,838 --> 00:23:54,108
months I think you guys had a sale or a

605
00:23:50,269 --> 00:24:04,548
hands-on activity last semester we tried

606
00:23:54,108 --> 00:24:06,618
yeah yeah some of the other partnerships

607
00:24:04,548 --> 00:24:09,259
that we're looking into is the nature Rx

608
00:24:06,618 --> 00:24:10,848
and Cornell mines matter a very strong

609
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:12,979
push these days are going to be that

610
00:24:10,848 --> 00:24:14,598
plant in human wellbeing I have a

611
00:24:12,979 --> 00:24:15,979
meeting on Wednesday with somebody from

612
00:24:14,598 --> 00:24:28,368
nature rx that we're going to be working

613
00:24:15,979 --> 00:24:30,169
with I just want to say that you know

614
00:24:28,368 --> 00:24:32,928
we're thinking about this in the context

615
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:35,059
of horticulture and cows but if you

616
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:38,239
imagine the hundreds and hundreds of

617
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:40,369
clubs on campus the issues that they're

618
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:41,990
describing of a vertical leader

619
00:24:40,369 --> 00:24:44,269
ship model and moving to a shared

620
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,160
leadership model is something that so

621
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:48,740
many clubs are struggling with on campus

622
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,740
so we actually have the eye of the

623
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:53,930
University in terms of watching the way

624
00:24:51,740 --> 00:25:07,490
this is unfolding because it could serve

625
00:24:53,930 --> 00:25:17,620
as a university model as well at you as

626
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:20,210
a model but I'm just really short on is

627
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:22,250
participation and national beauty it's

628
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:25,100
like a HSN guys have a chance to go

629
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:27,619
there double I and the opportunity there

630
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:29,959
for undergraduate Ball minutes I didn't

631
00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:33,259
as you're going forward are you thinking

632
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:36,558
about maybe sort of expanding the vision

633
00:25:33,259 --> 00:25:38,089
for what firm can do it maybe increase

634
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:41,029
participation and those sorts of things

635
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:49,579
and increase visibility for now Ashley

636
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:52,009
yeah so Hawaii this fall and we talked a

637
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:56,449
lot about that how our club doesn't

638
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:59,150
really seek professional then

639
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:00,830
opportunities per se and how it would be

640
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:02,960
so great to bring students to events

641
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:04,609
like that where we can make professional

642
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,110
connections and learn about the research

643
00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:08,240
and horticulture that's going on across

644
00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:11,808
the country so that's definitely an

645
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:14,150
opportunity maybe even through the next

646
00:26:11,808 --> 00:26:17,329
big travel um

647
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:18,980
opportunity that comes up or I don't

648
00:26:17,329 --> 00:26:20,509
know but that's definitely kind of a

649
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:23,450
direction that we've been thinking about

650
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:25,009
and talking about a lot yeah we do run

651
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:27,500
into the problem though is that we're a

652
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:29,480
widespread Club so we have students who

653
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,250
are not just in plant sciences we have

654
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,319
people who are engineers communication

655
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:35,259
majors and some even like all the way

656
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:39,109
down in Arts and Sciences for info side

657
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:42,558
when we try to just allocate our own

658
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:44,029
funding to that specific of an event it

659
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:46,308
kind of leaves out all of those other

660
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:47,960
people so it's kind of like even if

661
00:26:46,308 --> 00:26:49,759
you're working sales you might not get a

662
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:53,179
majority of the funding towards what you

663
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:54,200
want to do because a SHS is very heavily

664
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:56,780
plans

665
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,789
research and it's maybe not so

666
00:26:56,779 --> 00:27:02,029
applicable to an info science person or

667
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:04,460
a calm person in their direction SAF C

668
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:07,339
funding is going to become a good friend

669
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:08,779
to us hopefully next semester that's

670
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:10,549
going to help us with a lot more of the

671
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:11,960
local trips that we're going to do so if

672
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:14,299
we're going down to the Philadelphia

673
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,650
Flower Show SAF C funding can help with

674
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:18,200
some of the transportation kind of

675
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:21,320
lighten that cost load see you next year

676
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:25,960
speed is washing seats of Transportation

677
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:25,960
it is much easier to do Washington DC

678
00:27:44,259 --> 00:27:48,829
and that's why we're adding dr. Lam

679
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:59,180
because we do have an ignorance about

680
00:27:48,829 --> 00:28:00,980
stuff that's not going on around us was

681
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:03,950
supported by this engaged

682
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:08,569
Cornell grant cannot become sustainable

683
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:10,789
each year activity so in our grant we

684
00:28:08,569 --> 00:28:13,579
actually wrote that we were having the

685
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:16,099
sale the same time as like the donation

686
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:17,750
so that that sale would perpetuate the

687
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:19,490
funding for the donation the next year

688
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,930
so even though we're gonna still

689
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,400
continue with some of the practices that

690
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:24,230
were under train a new leaf

691
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,759
we're not going to require any funding

692
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:28,819
next year for it because we had that

693
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:35,019
startup capital upfront to do all the

694
00:28:28,819 --> 00:28:35,019
plants for the sale Marshalls

695
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:45,679
contributed so much in so many ways what

696
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:49,629
are your thoughts about how you can

697
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:53,539
ensure a continuation of this kind of

698
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:55,340
ESTJ forthright energy that you're

699
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:56,659
bringing to the you know really like

700
00:28:55,339 --> 00:29:00,159
what can you do in the spring semester

701
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:03,980
to ensure that this positive strong

702
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:06,200
leadership continues I've definitely

703
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:08,269
looked into some new programs that are

704
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,240
like online to help with

705
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:12,109
kind of organization of the club itself

706
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,690
definitely going to start doing the

707
00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:16,189
whole top-down enthusiasm push when we

708
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,539
have those working teams and we can

709
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:20,360
actually see those working teams

710
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:23,659
function it might be more of an emotive

711
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:25,039
ational aspect for our officers I'm

712
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,240
hoping that we can have a good

713
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,670
reflection at the end of the fall

714
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,480
semester I think our next meeting is the

715
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,550
end of this month

716
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,319
so we're gonna actually talk about what

717
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:35,149
we're going to do for the spring that's

718
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:37,009
kind of a little bit different from this

719
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:38,830
fall semester as I said it's still

720
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:44,450
evolving it's still gonna be malleable

721
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:46,220
as a personal thing for me I can stand

722
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:48,529
up here and say like we can do this we

723
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:51,140
can do this we can do this but just like

724
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:52,849
in any educational system if the people

725
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:54,980
who were supposed to implement it don't

726
00:29:52,849 --> 00:29:56,629
enact it it's not going to catch at all

727
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,670
so that's one of the fears that we have

728
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:00,530
thought about while writing this grant

729
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:02,450
is we can do this for the duration of

730
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:03,950
the grant and said that we did it but is

731
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:05,840
it going to be sustainable after we

732
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:08,000
leave we do have the problem that we

733
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:09,019
have a lot of seniors as officers and

734
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,940
people who have been doing it for

735
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:12,319
continuous years all you heard that

736
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,269
sarah was an officer for two years

737
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:15,799
before she didn't do it this year I've

738
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:18,230
been in officers for two years I'm not

739
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:21,079
going to be here next year so we have

740
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:24,019
some people who are younger officers who

741
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:25,579
will take over hopefully next year and

742
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:28,009
we're trying to cultivate more people

743
00:30:25,579 --> 00:30:29,178
who are either freshmen or sophomores to

744
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:32,000
join the club and kind of take that

745
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:35,500
leadership initiative in there hopefully

746
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,500
train them in the way that we want them

747
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:42,589
go ahead so first of all the two of you

748
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:46,579
coordinated the presentation really well

749
00:30:42,589 --> 00:30:49,579
I was very impressed sitting here my

750
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:52,220
question is about public outreach to

751
00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:54,109
save your current public outreach

752
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,539
involves science outreach to school

753
00:30:54,109 --> 00:31:02,599
systems or is that among the list of

754
00:30:56,539 --> 00:31:05,420
things you've considered okay well thank

755
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:07,579
you for the question um we are outreach

756
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:09,500
is trying to be a step forward we have

757
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:11,449
been invited into school programs before

758
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:14,210
trying to do just like a little bit talk

759
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:16,039
about how you grow plants however that's

760
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:17,990
never been a strong component just yet

761
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:22,099
it was one of the ideas was hey wouldn't

762
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:25,250
it be cool if that the outreach thing

763
00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:26,959
is held strong by some of our members so

764
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,740
like myself and then the current

765
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,710
greenhouse grower

766
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:32,419
manager miles but it's something that

767
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:33,980
we're trying to look forward to if we

768
00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:35,929
have connections from anybody in the

769
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:38,000
audience that would like to do some

770
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:39,950
outreach with us let us know and we'll

771
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,548
be able to partner with you any other

772
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:42,548
questions

773
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:59,319
this has been a production of Cornell

774
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:59,319
