1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,040
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,960
University so this is gonna be a little

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,570
bit different from the more usual

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,388
hundred percent research seminar as you

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,519
can hear from our affiliations so this

6
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:16,559
is a combination of research especially

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,140
the first section that I'm presenting

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:21,989
and then extending into a conversation

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,000
so we want to invite you all to join a

10
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,799
conversation that the three of us have

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,660
been having for a couple of years about

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:34,950
exactly this topic so along those lines

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,750
I'd like to invite you to jump in get

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:41,280
your hand up interrupt with a question

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,469
or correction or an observation or if

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,320
we're using some jargon that you're not

17
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:54,960
sure about so so please chime in it at

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:58,320
any time so for part one I'm gonna cover

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,539
all these topics but fairly quickly so

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,000
trying to talk about what do we mean by

21
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,909
idle lands and it's a little trickier

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,579
than you might think and then another

23
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:12,299
term is marginal lands doing the same

24
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:17,158
applies to that so the research portion

25
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:19,409
that we did was looking at what land

26
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,140
might be available that's not currently

27
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:26,100
in in any type of commercial production

28
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:29,250
and how much hay and forage could be

29
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:30,959
produced on that and the research part

30
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,868
that I'm talking about is assuming a

31
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,629
high intensity management on that so

32
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:38,670
kind of what's the technical high end

33
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:41,670
potential for for production and that's

34
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:44,189
I should say that's not typical for a

35
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:48,090
lot of land in New York it's not managed

36
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:54,719
at that high intensity and then some

37
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:56,700
some very broad estimates of what could

38
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,399
we produce on these lands how much beef

39
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,350
could we produce how much bioenergy

40
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,349
feedstock and bio energy could we

41
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:09,659
produce and how much hay and forage

42
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:12,000
could we produce and then then Mike and

43
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:13,199
Aaron are going to jump in with some

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,389
reality checks

45
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,669
on this kind of technical potential and

46
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:19,619
say what are some of the challenges and

47
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:24,479
barriers that are in the way of

48
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:27,450
achieving this technical potential so

49
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,969
here's a nice photo courtesy of Mike so

50
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:31,859
what are we talking about with idle

51
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:32,400
lands marginal lands what's this all

52
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,560
about

53
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,920
so typically if you're driving around

54
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:41,370
New York State you often see the bottom

55
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:45,030
land which often is in it can be an

56
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,439
annual crop production if you can see

57
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,180
the hay bales here there's hay

58
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:54,180
production on some of the sloping land

59
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:57,060
and then the further up you get this all

60
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,980
this shrub land could be pasture could

61
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:07,409
be who knows what could be transitioning

62
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:10,919
slowly back into forest so what we mean

63
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:13,229
by idle lands for especially my portion

64
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:15,629
of the talk is it as I mentioned it's

65
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:19,289
not currently in you know commercial

66
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:23,039
production but it's really a wide

67
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:26,009
variety of land cover so it could be

68
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,400
more or less kind of look like hay or

69
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:33,959
pasture it might look more like shrub

70
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,939
scrubland it's not a forest and it's not

71
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,329
annual cropland but there's a there's a

72
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:40,979
lot of territory in between there and

73
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:43,530
it's hard to quantify this because it's

74
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:46,229
something that's not really counted

75
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:50,250
right it's the agricultural survey gives

76
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:53,399
us the land that's in production there's

77
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,949
an older separate survey of horses in

78
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,069
new york estimating they use about a

79
00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:01,858
million acres of land some of that's on

80
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:03,659
farms and much of it is not but beyond

81
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:05,879
that we have very little survey data

82
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:10,400
about how the land this these lands are

83
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:13,079
being used so an important thing here is

84
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,569
when we say idle that really should have

85
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,819
quotation marks around it because it

86
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:22,399
could be used for hunting it could be

87
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:22,399
used for some non-commercial use

88
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:27,740
so we we can't say that the land isn't

89
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,848
being used for anything you just know

90
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,848
it's not in commercial production

91
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:36,740
okay marginal lands I love this quote

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,538
I'll give you a chance to read it I

93
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,538
think it sums it up very nicely

94
00:04:44,288 --> 00:04:50,848
so the gist of it is we use this loosely

95
00:04:47,978 --> 00:04:53,978
for land that has biophysical problems

96
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:56,949
and if you notice this quotes from 1932

97
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:59,348
but this kind of sloppy thinking and

98
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:04,360
talk about marginality is is still

99
00:04:59,348 --> 00:05:08,079
happening well I think that the real

100
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,479
definition is economic so its marginal

101
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:13,598
for some type of economic production

102
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:20,258
meaning there's little or no possibility

103
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:22,240
of a profit so on good soils as you

104
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:26,110
increase inputs like fertiliser and

105
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:29,590
labour you get a pretty big jump in your

106
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:31,509
return in production on marginal soils

107
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:34,959
you could put in the same amount of

108
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:37,629
effort and inputs but you get a much

109
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:40,180
lower plateau of production and if these

110
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:42,550
are the production costs

111
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,230
on the prime soils you've got lots of

112
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:47,020
room for profitability and on the

113
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:49,240
marginal soils little or none right so

114
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:51,479
that's that's to me what marginal really

115
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,480
means

116
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:58,249
so what why is it marginal so this is

117
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:01,729
where we get back to the biophysical

118
00:05:58,249 --> 00:06:06,499
part often wet stony perched water

119
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:10,610
tables etc and you all may have your

120
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:13,278
your favorite issues of what kind of

121
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:17,930
limitations occur on some lands in New

122
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:20,149
York so an important thing I said is so

123
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:23,240
so some marginal crop lanes are now

124
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:26,528
wineries so they might be marginal for

125
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:29,778
beef production or for hay production

126
00:06:26,528 --> 00:06:32,868
they might be great for wineries so it

127
00:06:29,778 --> 00:06:34,038
marginality is an economic term and it's

128
00:06:32,869 --> 00:06:36,080
related to what the heck you're

129
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:38,348
producing right it's not the same for

130
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:38,348
everything

131
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:43,819
so how did we go about with all those

132
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:46,580
challenges kind of estimate how much

133
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:49,759
idle land there is so we start with

134
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:53,060
spatial data to look at land cover

135
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,949
through the state and that helps us

136
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,709
narrow down and get rid of the forests

137
00:06:54,949 --> 00:07:00,500
and get rid of the annual cropland and

138
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:02,930
the developed land but then we use AG

139
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,850
survey data to tell us at the county

140
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,060
scale how much land is in commercial

141
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,060
production

142
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:16,870
so our result I'm not going to go into a

143
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:20,860
lot of detail about methods here is just

144
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:24,160
under a million hectares or 689 thousand

145
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:29,350
hectares of potentially idle potentially

146
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:37,080
available land so here's a picture of

147
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:37,080
land cover for all of New York State

148
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:45,840
lots of forests fair amount of wetlands

149
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:49,860
and developed land about 9% in annual

150
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:53,159
cropland about 9% in grasslands that are

151
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:55,650
in production of some kind and then this

152
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:58,470
is what we came up with that about 5% of

153
00:07:55,649 --> 00:08:02,279
New York State is idle grasslands about

154
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:08,490
3% is idle shrub and scrub lands so

155
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:11,339
meaning what's what's there now so these

156
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,290
are the I mentioned the total but it's

157
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:16,799
not all all this land may not be

158
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:19,460
suitable or as I mentioned before it's

159
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,629
not necessarily all really available

160
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:24,689
that's what people want to do with their

161
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:26,850
land so how do we then estimate

162
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:31,230
production potential on these marginal

163
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:33,509
lands and we use a combination of soil

164
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,820
properties and climate and that's

165
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:38,129
integrated into something called the

166
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:41,820
national commodity crop productivity

167
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:44,820
index so this is just a map showing this

168
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:47,160
index with the low values in red the

169
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:50,400
high values in green you don't see much

170
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:52,169
green the better AG lands in New York

171
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,889
are showing up in the mid range of

172
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:54,889
yellow here

173
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:02,690
and see this in Ohio there's there's

174
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:04,460
some patches of green there so where do

175
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:12,080
we see a lot of these low productivity

176
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:15,830
or low soil quality lands Adirondacks

177
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:23,720
Catskills and then some of the southern

178
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:26,450
tier as well so this is then the this

179
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:31,970
available potentially available I'll

180
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:35,570
land shown across this soil quality

181
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:39,590
index so the index goes from 0 to 1 so

182
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:41,690
the high values are good so for current

183
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:44,899
hail and we see most of its kind of in

184
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:46,910
this mid range meaning it's not all that

185
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:49,939
different really from a lot of our

186
00:09:46,909 --> 00:09:52,980
annual cropland

187
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:56,090
the land that's currently in herbaceous

188
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,090
cover of some kind

189
00:09:56,149 --> 00:10:06,319
again most of its in kind of this this

190
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:08,950
middle range a shrub and scrubland more

191
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,560
of it is in this lower productivity

192
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:14,120
range but the important thing is it's

193
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:15,829
really all of these are pretty well

194
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,980
spread out so within any of these

195
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:22,000
categories there are some soils that

196
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:25,100
have some heist biophysical soil quality

197
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:32,089
but that's encouraging if we can find

198
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:35,089
those and use them so to to model

199
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:38,690
potential hay and forage production on

200
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:41,810
these lands we have a very simple

201
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:44,360
generic model of productivity potential

202
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:47,419
for for essentially perennial grasses

203
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,360
and we have we created separate ones for

204
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:54,399
warm season grasses meaning c4 and cool

205
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,399
season grasses meaning c3

206
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:02,549
so again this result is a technical

207
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,350
potential assuming a high intensity of

208
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:08,149
management and again that's not typical

209
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,149
but it's but it's possible

210
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:21,000
then we have valuated these models by by

211
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:23,519
looking at how do these models do with

212
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,389
some data that we did not use to develop

213
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:35,220
the models from forage yield trials

214
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:36,930
throughout New York State sorry this

215
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,560
this is a photo of a yield trial

216
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:42,628
courtesy of Julie Hanson who works very

217
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:47,669
hard with the team on conducting these

218
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:49,620
trials for many years so the three lines

219
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:51,929
are models I'm not going to talk about

220
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:55,198
corn silage today but just to point out

221
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:57,239
that it's the model and the data are

222
00:11:55,198 --> 00:11:59,519
higher for corn silage than for any of

223
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,659
these perennials

224
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:09,269
and for the cool-season grasses there's

225
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:11,699
there's a range among sites in years but

226
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:14,458
the data from these yield trials seem to

227
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:18,540
suggest that our our simple models

228
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:21,239
aren't too far wrong meaning that the

229
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:23,579
the data are falling reasonably close to

230
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:28,830
our predictions that were again

231
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:31,200
independent of these data just a quick

232
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:33,209
note on why are the warm season grasses

233
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,259
lower productivity than the cool season

234
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:39,269
grasses and and this is just a really a

235
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:41,610
function of the effort that's gone into

236
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:44,338
breeding and managing cool season

237
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:46,409
grasses in the state so with a great

238
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:49,920
deal of effort and over many years or

239
00:12:46,409 --> 00:12:51,778
decades there's no reason why the warm

240
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,019
season grasses couldn't move up further

241
00:12:51,778 --> 00:13:00,389
but this is what we think is feasible

242
00:12:54,019 --> 00:13:03,028
today so an example of a warm season

243
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:05,519
grasses switchgrass I'm not going to try

244
00:13:03,028 --> 00:13:07,350
to read the whole slide but this was

245
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:13,289
kind of our model grass for thinking

246
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:16,620
about bioenergy production or the for

247
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:22,259
the forage we were looking more at the

248
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:24,980
cool season grasses but we also

249
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:27,629
translated essentially our effort was on

250
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,970
what's the forage production potential

251
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:32,578
and then we just used a simple very

252
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:34,920
crude calculation to say a certain

253
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:39,838
number of pounds of forage in a beef

254
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:43,588
stocker operation meaning beef foraging

255
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,760
throughout the growing season you know

256
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:47,250
how many pounds of forage would

257
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:52,708
translate into a pound or a kilogram of

258
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:54,690
beef and we've done a lot of work

259
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:57,299
historically on bioenergy so we also

260
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:59,370
looked at again the warm season grass is

261
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:03,519
turning those into industrial quality

262
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:08,990
pellets and using them for heat

263
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:12,289
and and also for ethanol so these are

264
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:16,100
our results and this is just a summary

265
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:18,799
for the entire state so the very small

266
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:22,190
bars are beef because we're looking at

267
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:27,379
total millions of kilograms per year on

268
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:29,949
all of this idle land base so so beef

269
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:32,360
production is is very low in terms of

270
00:14:29,948 --> 00:14:38,049
kilograms or terms of millions of

271
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:41,360
kilograms and then the highest

272
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:44,179
production potential is the hay so

273
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:48,639
essentially with the with the pellets

274
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:48,638
we're losing some through the process of

275
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:52,839
manufacturing them and they're also

276
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:55,578
being made from the c4 grass which

277
00:14:52,839 --> 00:15:00,620
according to our modeling is a likely be

278
00:14:55,578 --> 00:15:02,388
a little less productive if we look at

279
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:05,360
these in terms of the value of that

280
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:08,379
product not profit but just the value of

281
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,850
that production at the wholesale level

282
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:12,919
not to surprisingly all these bars

283
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,269
switch direction right so that's all

284
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:21,198
amount of beef production has the

285
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:23,350
highest dollar value actually all these

286
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:28,099
other options haven't had a similar

287
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:35,720
roughly similar sorry dollar dollar

288
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:40,930
value so here are a few challenges and

289
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:43,250
barriers what are the landowners goals

290
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:47,269
are you in a location where it's

291
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:49,909
feasible to actually use this land do

292
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:53,929
you need fencing do you need drainage do

293
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:57,379
you need barns its capital available

294
00:15:53,929 --> 00:16:02,388
even if it's a viable business model etc

295
00:15:57,379 --> 00:16:04,639
and my kin and Erin are gonna talk about

296
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:07,039
a little more about some of these and I

297
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,629
hope you'll all think and chime in if

298
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,818
you think of other challenges and

299
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:12,948
barriers and of course opportunities as

300
00:16:10,818 --> 00:16:16,169
well

301
00:16:12,948 --> 00:16:18,028
so summarizing 4.1 there's there's quite

302
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:19,979
a bit of land out there that's not in

303
00:16:18,028 --> 00:16:21,689
commercial production and some some

304
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:25,680
fraction of that could be available for

305
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:28,850
increased production and some fraction

306
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:33,120
of those lands actually have decent

307
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:35,730
biophysical soil properties so there's a

308
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,528
technical potential with high-intensity

309
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:41,789
management to produce quite a bit on

310
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:43,439
these lands but of course there are a

311
00:16:41,789 --> 00:16:45,958
lot of challenges and barriers that mean

312
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:53,100
it's not able to achieve all of that

313
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:55,169
technical potential I have a few

314
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:59,120
citations that will come up at the at

315
00:16:55,169 --> 00:17:02,009
the end of the talk and I haven't really

316
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,810
it looks like we could take a few

317
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:06,328
questions right now before we move into

318
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:08,399
the second part if anyone has anything

319
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:15,720
right now

320
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:19,620
Peter go hear him yes genius a lot of

321
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:22,740
margins may not be continuous but in

322
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:32,519
order to have cows or to produce there

323
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:37,079
is a little bit we we removed pieces of

324
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:43,379
land that were that were less than five

325
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:45,149
hectares I believe so we were trying to

326
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,430
get rid of those small pieces of land

327
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:51,990
that would be hard to to bring into

328
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:54,600
production Peter did you look at all

329
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:57,029
into why these lands are not being used

330
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:59,279
now I mean we'll see the constraints

331
00:17:57,029 --> 00:18:01,680
later on but I mean did anyone know or

332
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:05,519
is anyone looked at why is it I don't

333
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:07,049
know okay essentially we have no we're

334
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,000
doing everything by difference right

335
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:11,129
identifying the idle land because it's

336
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,839
not something else so we know almost

337
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,220
nothing about it I mean it could be

338
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:17,459
because there's not enough labor in the

339
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,839
earth or there's other aspect I mean

340
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,730
what are the reasons that no one is

341
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:22,859
using it now interesting yeah I think

342
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,720
you know all we can say about that is

343
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:27,629
the slide I showed of sort of a

344
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,690
histogram of the soil quality showing

345
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:35,490
that in fact quite a large portion of

346
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:39,570
these lands are of reasonable production

347
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:42,660
potential according to this that's why I

348
00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:44,879
asked the question yeah thank you but I

349
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:49,620
mean so another clue you can look at is

350
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,600
landowner surveys and most many

351
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:54,179
landowners are not interested in

352
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:58,379
commercial production of any kind so

353
00:18:54,180 --> 00:19:00,960
that's another quick answer right and as

354
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:03,510
lands change hands they tend to be

355
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:07,140
moving out of farmer hands and into

356
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:11,009
other landowner hands so that's another

357
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:12,840
trend that there's some data about

358
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:14,430
either a good question of you come

359
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:16,470
across what you know what is the

360
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,910
intrinsic value of these lands I mean

361
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:20,009
they're marginal but they could have

362
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:22,170
other you know conservation those

363
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:24,690
externalities do they come into play I

364
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:26,340
mean I realize for production but this

365
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:28,590
might be an argument that somebody might

366
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:33,449
said what's wrong with having described

367
00:19:28,589 --> 00:19:37,319
her life you don't know yeah so I think

368
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:40,890
I would so i yes these lands have lots

369
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:43,529
of value for lots of things hunting you

370
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:45,720
know there's some endangered there's

371
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:50,700
some least threatened bird species that

372
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:52,920
nest in grasslands so some some operate

373
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,759
like switchgrass production is

374
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:58,170
compatible with spring breeding birds

375
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:59,390
because you just harvest in the fall too

376
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:04,740
baby

377
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:06,780
but but yes there are competing current

378
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:10,410
uses that are non commercial there are

379
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:12,180
other values to these lands so that's

380
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:17,519
why sort of the Idol is in quotation

381
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:20,759
marks yeah riff on something that David

382
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:22,859
was saying and I think Accenture sort of

383
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:25,619
selling yourself short on the idle land

384
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:27,089
question because I would perceive that

385
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:30,929
the idle land of today is going to

386
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:33,720
become forested land of tomorrow and so

387
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:35,130
I'm wondering if maybe you should sort

388
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,890
of think that some of the forested land

389
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:40,740
of today was in fact idle land of

390
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:43,560
yesterday and so I'm wondering if the

391
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:47,759
acreage that you're looking at may be

392
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:50,369
actually an underestimate and denied yes

393
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:56,420
there has been a Greek ultra land that

394
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:58,919
has transitioned back to forests so so

395
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:01,890
depending on the location and what's

396
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:04,320
going on and seed sources for the forest

397
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:07,320
and deer pressure etc it can take a

398
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:10,740
surprisingly long time you know decades

399
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:14,460
or more or never to get back to sort of

400
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:16,529
an intact valuable forest there's a very

401
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,000
long period of time and it may be kind

402
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:20,879
of indefinite that it can be in this

403
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,230
shrub scrub you know Hawthorn I'm sure

404
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,420
we've all walked through this kind of

405
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:27,599
land

406
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:30,750
I don't know if that answers it at all

407
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:34,079
no I am just thinking from from a land

408
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:35,519
potential obviously you have today the

409
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,189
scent is clear to put it back kind of

410
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,839
land but you know it's in a potential

411
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:44,279
Weiser I would think that there'd be a

412
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:45,209
lot more land available that would fit

413
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:49,740
into this model

414
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:52,319
sure right so intentionally we did not

415
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,870
look at forest land and we did not look

416
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:57,960
at wetlands both of those potentially

417
00:21:54,869 --> 00:22:01,439
could be brought into production but our

418
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:05,640
thinking is there's a lot more conflicts

419
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:08,130
with that and it's also a lot more

420
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,830
effort and challenge to actually achieve

421
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:14,970
that so that's why we focus on the lands

422
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:17,970
that are not forest not wetlands great

423
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:22,920
well let's move on to to Mike and and

424
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:25,049
part two deal I've just add a few

425
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:28,200
comments to that if we think about what

426
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:30,779
this plan was used for 50 years ago it

427
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,289
was in dairies so what has changed as

428
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:36,299
these dairies have moved as a dairy

429
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:39,389
structure has changed even though that

430
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:41,579
land may be productive it's as one

431
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:45,540
person mentioned here they're in smaller

432
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:48,000
acreage is harder to use with larger

433
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:49,710
equipment and so these dairies have gone

434
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,869
to land more suitable for crop

435
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:53,490
production so that's that's a big part

436
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:55,859
especially in southern tier why there's

437
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:58,620
so much Idol playing in that area and

438
00:22:55,859 --> 00:23:02,339
the other thing I would argue is that we

439
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:04,169
want open land for aesthetic reasons we

440
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:06,720
don't want to look like New Hampshire at

441
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:10,680
least I don't where it's all trees and

442
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:25,950
so I think very strong argument is is to

443
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:29,250
keep open land all right so when we look

444
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:30,690
at the I like this slide because when we

445
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:33,059
look at whether a business can be

446
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:35,430
profitable or not it's based on what

447
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:36,799
their local resources are in making the

448
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:41,060
Bessy so so they

449
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:45,500
a logger in Maine was smart enough to

450
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:48,909
know that he's well-endowed with with

451
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:52,480
moose in the area and so he used him to

452
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:55,070
to move his logs I've never been able to

453
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:59,960
confirm or deny whether this is

454
00:23:55,069 --> 00:24:02,179
photoshopped or real alright so you know

455
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:05,650
we all know this we're in the pasture

456
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:09,110
region right forage reason we can grow

457
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:10,490
forages extremely well we're not in the

458
00:24:09,109 --> 00:24:13,299
Corn Belt region

459
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:16,220
so growing corn really doesn't fit our

460
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:18,289
environment and so consequently we need

461
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:20,809
to again if we're going to have

462
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:22,460
profitable agricultural businesses we

463
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:27,079
need to focus on what we have lots of

464
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:29,090
and that's forage this is a picture this

465
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:32,389
is just some data from the southern tier

466
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:33,859
of vacant land that the doctor if put

467
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:38,140
together for me

468
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:40,609
this is Steuben County there was a

469
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:44,210
glitch in the data collection Lester

470
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:46,339
been isn't that would fit in very well

471
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:48,170
with all the other counties and that you

472
00:24:46,339 --> 00:24:51,109
can see very visually there's a lot of

473
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:54,710
vacant land in this southern tier area

474
00:24:51,109 --> 00:24:56,509
and if she had done the the northern New

475
00:24:54,710 --> 00:25:00,920
York area and actually even some of that

476
00:24:56,509 --> 00:25:03,740
central New York is the same way so what

477
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,990
are the resources that we have in in New

478
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:09,710
York to make beef cattle work

479
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:12,140
we've got markets the and a whole

480
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:16,579
variety markets in terms of

481
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:19,190
grass-finished organic GMO free free

482
00:25:16,579 --> 00:25:21,529
range but we also do have some grain

483
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:25,070
finished markets natural is growing

484
00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:28,399
quite often which is often grain

485
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:32,509
finished but no use of growth furrow d

486
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:34,759
hormones or antibiotics so because of

487
00:25:32,509 --> 00:25:37,250
the consumer demand those are resources

488
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:40,269
that we can take advantage of and the

489
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:42,619
reason for that is is consumers you know

490
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:44,119
Montana has an advantage where they have

491
00:25:42,619 --> 00:25:46,829
lots of cows but they don't have any

492
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:51,419
consumers and so

493
00:25:46,829 --> 00:25:54,419
that gives us lots of opportunity to to

494
00:25:51,420 --> 00:26:01,140
diversify our portfolio if you will and

495
00:25:54,420 --> 00:26:02,490
meet that demand so one of the

496
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:05,460
advantages and I'm going to talk

497
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:07,980
specifically about this stalker that was

498
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:10,500
mentioned that's the N it's a youngish

499
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:13,019
animal that's put on grass grazes for

500
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:15,079
the summer and then goes into a

501
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:17,940
finishing program which can be

502
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:20,519
historically grain finish but also can

503
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:23,509
go into a grass finish system so it's

504
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:27,379
that short period of time from made of

505
00:26:23,509 --> 00:26:30,629
October Titan so it's one of the few

506
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:32,400
enterprises AG enterprises that you can

507
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:35,280
get into with very little capital

508
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,650
upfront if you're going to try to start

509
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:41,389
a dairy it's nearly impossible unless

510
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:45,090
you and marry into it or inherit it so

511
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:47,790
that provides a huge advantage a cost of

512
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:52,429
production is low here in the Northeast

513
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:55,079
our calves are cheap much to the

514
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:58,019
disgruntlement of our cow-calf producers

515
00:26:55,079 --> 00:27:00,089
but there's reasons for that which we

516
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:02,160
talk about another time

517
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:04,769
we've got relatively good production per

518
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:07,019
acre in terms of forage and that's

519
00:27:04,769 --> 00:27:09,809
extremely important for ruminants those

520
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:12,240
that can take that we have inexpensive

521
00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:14,579
land I know a lot of people don't

522
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,769
believe that but I came from West

523
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:18,240
Virginia and believe it or not land in

524
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:22,349
West Virginia is more expensive than

525
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,579
here in New York and and you go out and

526
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:26,759
the corn States

527
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:29,159
forget it believe it or not for full

528
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:32,789
time farmers we have a relatively

529
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:34,800
favorable tax environment because if you

530
00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:37,589
get more than 50 percent of your gross

531
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,509
income from agriculture your taxes are

532
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:45,240
greatly reduced in terms of school and

533
00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:48,589
property taxes so the the disgruntlement

534
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:53,069
with taxes is really not entirely true

535
00:27:48,589 --> 00:27:55,019
with this stocker operation we don't

536
00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:57,899
need much equipment which is why you can

537
00:27:55,019 --> 00:28:00,009
get into it without a lot of money you

538
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:03,040
don't need much facilities obviously

539
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:05,529
and by doing custom operations that is

540
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,210
owners of cattle will pay you to graze

541
00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:09,970
them you don't need a lot of capital

542
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:12,069
upfront for the animal purchase so

543
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:15,069
there's real good opportunities for

544
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:19,359
getting yet labor flexibility is a great

545
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:21,909
thing that's a beauty of all beef cattle

546
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:24,039
operations is if you're a dairy

547
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:26,860
operation you're tied to that dairy

548
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:28,539
twice a day plus but the beef operation

549
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:30,819
you've got a lot more opportunity I was

550
00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:32,170
talking to a meeting last night and he

551
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:34,779
was going to be away for three or four

552
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:36,759
days he just filled the hay feeders over

553
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:38,379
full and they'd be fine he had someone

554
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:41,500
check on the cows obviously but he

555
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:43,480
didn't have to feed them every day and

556
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,849
and with the grazing operation you can

557
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:48,579
do the same so instead of giving them

558
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:50,740
two acres like you do every day you know

559
00:28:48,579 --> 00:28:52,629
you've got a schedule that's going to

560
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,940
conflict maybe four or five acres

561
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:56,350
production goes down a little bit but

562
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,570
it's not gonna really impact

563
00:28:56,349 --> 00:29:00,609
profitability for that short period of

564
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:03,279
time it can be started as a part-time

565
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:05,589
enterprise again if you're working off

566
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,950
the farm a way to get into the business

567
00:29:05,589 --> 00:29:11,889
and it can be incorporated with other

568
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:14,049
interests such as Agri Forestry maple

569
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:17,440
syrup production in the winter those

570
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:20,019
kinds of things you can and should

571
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,269
probably utilize purchase feeds for

572
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:24,099
anything you do on most beef operations

573
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:27,309
and I can argue pretty strongly on that

574
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:29,769
one even though you see way too much

575
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:33,250
equipment on beef operations and then

576
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:36,250
for our current skill force which is

577
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:39,180
dairy a lot of the skills that they have

578
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:42,279
and producing high quality forage and

579
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:45,670
having facilities and equipment can fit

580
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:47,410
in very nicely with this especially in

581
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:49,029
the wintertime when we're trying to grow

582
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:53,350
these calves until they're ready to go

583
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:55,480
to grass so has a lot of good deal we

584
00:29:53,349 --> 00:29:57,579
can do it with dairy we can do with beef

585
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,380
you can do it with heifers they can do

586
00:29:57,579 --> 00:30:01,059
with cows I mean there are times of the

587
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,830
year where you can buy cows cheap enough

588
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:05,259
that you can put weight on them

589
00:30:02,829 --> 00:30:08,789
inexpensively on grass and then resell

590
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:09,980
them so you've got a lot of flexibility

591
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:12,950
the

592
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:16,640
thing that's real had been pages to us

593
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:18,410
is the price cycles if we look at so

594
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,470
that the top line which is the blue line

595
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:23,600
is over the last 20 years this is the

596
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:26,179
index of five hundred and fifty pound

597
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:28,099
feeders you can see in the spring of the

598
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:30,410
year they're very expensive and or

599
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:32,769
that's the highest price their lowest in

600
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:35,870
the fall well look what happens with the

601
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:38,389
750 pounder which is basically the

602
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:42,439
result of background our stalker in that

603
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:44,870
calf it's highest in the fall so you can

604
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:48,500
buy the calves cheap and put the weight

605
00:30:44,869 --> 00:30:50,869
on by using this cycle and this this is

606
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:53,058
a pretty strong cycle of not true every

607
00:30:50,869 --> 00:30:55,808
year that nothing is true every year but

608
00:30:53,058 --> 00:31:02,349
it's a pretty consistent historically

609
00:30:55,808 --> 00:31:04,369
system this is the grazing potential and

610
00:31:02,349 --> 00:31:08,319
unfortunately I've not been able to find

611
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:12,529
any enterprise data past 2014 and ignore

612
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:13,909
2014 that was a very odd year and those

613
00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:15,918
in the stocker business made a lot of

614
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:17,840
money but it's not normal but you can

615
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,150
see over the last 10 years or so it's

616
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:22,519
been about a $70 per head and when you

617
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:26,210
look at beef enterprises the stocker

618
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:28,759
operation has more bars above the profit

619
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:31,910
line than below as compared to cow calf

620
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:33,769
or finishing so the stalker has a lot of

621
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:37,190
opportunities the biggest challenge is

622
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:39,259
that there's not a good market

623
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:43,490
infrastructure for moving those calves

624
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:45,829
so we know that the larger the number to

625
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:47,599
sell the better price we can get which

626
00:31:45,829 --> 00:31:49,789
means that producers need to work

627
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:51,649
together and any of you that have worked

628
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:55,159
with farmers knows getting in to work

629
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:57,769
together is a huge challenge Aaron and I

630
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:59,960
spent 30 years trying to do it and we'll

631
00:31:57,769 --> 00:32:02,539
retire not getting it done so for the

632
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,400
next generation but cooperation is

633
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:08,089
something that really needs to happen

634
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:11,269
and we have a very antiquated if you

635
00:32:08,089 --> 00:32:13,750
will mark auction market system some

636
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:17,000
states have a very good marketing system

637
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:19,750
and and so there's just a that market

638
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,579
infrastructure probably is our biggest

639
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:23,869
drawback to getting this done but

640
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:30,079
everything else is

641
00:32:23,869 --> 00:32:33,319
all in place pretty nicely leave any

642
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:49,789
questions that I use any terminology Ken

643
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:51,950
smiling so I'm waiting for his yep we

644
00:32:49,789 --> 00:32:56,960
that's a great question was had to do

645
00:32:51,950 --> 00:33:00,620
with slaughterhouses and the perceived a

646
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:03,500
limited number we're just finishing up

647
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:05,479
another project looking at the barriers

648
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,849
to a ruminant production and north east

649
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:11,539
and along with that is a survey of

650
00:33:07,849 --> 00:33:17,719
packing plants mostly in new york in new

651
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:20,119
england and while there is areas of the

652
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,950
state that are I'm talking about

653
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:23,719
specifically in New York where there are

654
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:25,789
areas of the state they're short on

655
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,920
Packers it has more to do with

656
00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:30,889
seasonality than it does with supply

657
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:33,950
because if you look at a small processor

658
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:37,520
they're really busy from about September

659
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:39,110
to January and then they're really slow

660
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:43,519
from then on out

661
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:46,479
and so Packers and producers need to

662
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:49,220
work together that terrible word again

663
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:52,120
to try to even that out Packers need to

664
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:54,740
charge a little less in the summer

665
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:57,558
producers need to to match their

666
00:33:54,740 --> 00:34:05,599
production with availability so but

667
00:33:57,558 --> 00:34:08,389
there are some issues sheep could work

668
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:11,960
to you bet that's not my background but

669
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:14,120
she certainly there's some predator

670
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:17,000
challenges and some internal parasite

671
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:31,690
challenges but you don't have a beef

672
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:34,690
cattle but yes market was largely cold

673
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,690
consumption

674
00:34:37,378 --> 00:34:45,818
and there's some of that and I think for

675
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:47,918
to have a large economic impact on with

676
00:34:45,818 --> 00:34:51,338
beef cattle or sheep for that matter

677
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:55,179
I think assist the system is going to be

678
00:34:51,338 --> 00:34:57,400
both direct sales using smaller plants

679
00:34:55,179 --> 00:35:00,130
as well as some more commodity type

680
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:03,068
agriculture because I'm you know farmers

681
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:05,140
do not like the market and so to say the

682
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:07,449
only way you can do this is to sell

683
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:10,539
direct to the consumer we're not going

684
00:35:07,449 --> 00:35:16,899
to expand the market I'm a farmer I hate

685
00:35:10,539 --> 00:35:21,818
marketing now ken is a great marketer

686
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:23,800
and and has built up a business and and

687
00:35:21,818 --> 00:35:29,139
I can point to a lot of farmers that do

688
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:31,180
that very very well yeah is there

689
00:35:29,139 --> 00:35:32,889
something like crop insurance for beef

690
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:35,078
production because I see a lot of

691
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:36,670
variability year to year and you had its

692
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:39,400
average but there were some years I

693
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:42,130
would be suffering not for the animal

694
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,318
but there is crop insurance for pasture

695
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:50,170
and hay land for the actual production

696
00:35:44,318 --> 00:35:53,079
of feed stock there's no the only

697
00:35:50,170 --> 00:36:00,970
subsidy if you will again is based on

698
00:35:53,079 --> 00:36:05,829
the seed feed stock and I will say as

699
00:36:00,969 --> 00:36:08,409
far as the grass-finished market that we

700
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:10,630
have some organizations now that are

701
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:13,899
putting into place because I said

702
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:15,490
farmers don't like to market they like

703
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:18,639
to produce but I don't like to market so

704
00:36:15,489 --> 00:36:20,889
I think if we had a good steady

705
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:22,750
year-round market where I could say okay

706
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:25,019
I've got twenty grass-finished steers

707
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:28,150
and I know they're gonna be ready and

708
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:30,940
April and I don't have to worry about

709
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:33,280
selling them direct I'll take a little

710
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:34,809
less money but I'll get a premium over

711
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,450
the commodity market and those are

712
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:45,759
starting to get in place and I think as

713
00:36:37,449 --> 00:36:47,500
I grow we'll see the grain like that

714
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:52,810
and now there's a feel around but they

715
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:54,909
struggled so I guess there is there kind

716
00:36:52,809 --> 00:37:01,840
of an opportunity for somebody as a

717
00:36:54,909 --> 00:37:12,219
business proposition and you know maybe

718
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:16,769
the finishing yeah

719
00:37:12,219 --> 00:37:16,769
I think some coordination would work i

720
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:24,369
personal opinion but finishing cattle

721
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:29,950
whether it be on grain or on grass is a

722
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:32,589
pretty skillful activity and so I think

723
00:37:29,949 --> 00:37:35,349
the way this will work eventually it'd

724
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:38,829
be most efficient is that we will have

725
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:41,710
professional grass finishers and then

726
00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:46,719
they will be much easier to fill in

727
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:49,539
these gaps but the farm with 25 cows and

728
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:50,230
finishing 10 calves a year just as it's

729
00:37:49,539 --> 00:37:51,820
not gonna work

730
00:37:50,230 --> 00:38:10,480
he or she's never going to gain the

731
00:37:51,820 --> 00:38:14,200
skills to be really good ad to be here

732
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:16,240
today I would say one reason to keep

733
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:18,250
land open is because it's an awful lot

734
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:23,079
of work to clear overgrown land because

735
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:26,969
they've done it so I'm going to talk

736
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:29,139
about hay production and again and my

737
00:38:26,969 --> 00:38:33,909
experience we're talking about hilly

738
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:35,949
rocky clay soil if I were dictator of

739
00:38:33,909 --> 00:38:38,859
the world I would force everyone to have

740
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:41,049
a garden on hilly rocky clay soil so

741
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:46,210
they could appreciate good soil and

742
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:48,640
happy farmers so if you were to go to

743
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:51,789
the farm newspaper and buy some hay and

744
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:53,049
look at the classified ads what kind of

745
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:56,039
hay would you be looking at well how

746
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:56,039
would it be described

747
00:38:56,349 --> 00:39:03,369
first cutting second cutting alfalfa and

748
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:07,120
grass and I'm trying to get my farmers

749
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:09,339
to expand their imagination of hey and

750
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:12,429
think more about its and new so they can

751
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:14,289
market it for a target so when we're

752
00:39:12,429 --> 00:39:16,599
when we're selling hay we have local

753
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:18,369
markets and within the country and we

754
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:20,860
also have markets outside of the country

755
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:25,150
which we'll talk about a little bit so

756
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:27,010
of lay addressing the the horses that

757
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:31,510
are metabolically challenged they need a

758
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:35,200
low sugar hey we're grass finishing beef

759
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:37,150
and sometimes too much protein is not

760
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:40,509
the way to finish beef we need some high

761
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:42,550
energy hay some dairy farmers actually

762
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:45,310
buy straw and stick it in there totally

763
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:48,490
mixed rations to add a little fiber to

764
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:50,739
the diet speaking of sheep we have

765
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:54,729
bird's foot trefoil that can suppress

766
00:39:50,739 --> 00:39:56,619
parasites then we have other you know

767
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:58,990
animals and different stages of growth

768
00:39:56,619 --> 00:40:02,739
and production that needs specific

769
00:39:58,989 --> 00:40:04,509
nutrients and then also we have our

770
00:40:02,739 --> 00:40:06,849
young livestock that needs something

771
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:09,490
that's palatable to eat and I have a

772
00:40:06,849 --> 00:40:12,599
particular affinity for Kentucky

773
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:15,309
bluegrass that I know hey I just think

774
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:17,949
you know farmers actually call Kentucky

775
00:40:15,309 --> 00:40:19,420
bluegrass dog hair because it's a fine

776
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:21,250
grass and they don't like it and

777
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:23,920
sometimes the bales don't hold together

778
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:28,210
but nutritionally it's actually a pretty

779
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:30,990
pretty decent pretty decent forage so

780
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:33,789
has anyone ever heard of Western hay

781
00:40:30,989 --> 00:40:35,949
okay so when farmers think of Western

782
00:40:33,789 --> 00:40:38,679
hay they even in the East here they've

783
00:40:35,949 --> 00:40:41,109
got an image in their head of what

784
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:43,809
Western hay is it's nice and green

785
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:48,160
there's no weeds and it's usually pure

786
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:50,440
grass or pure alfalfa so I guess what I

787
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:53,409
want to propose is why don't we produce

788
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:55,720
something why don't we brand New York

789
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:57,009
hey why don't we think outside the box a

790
00:40:55,719 --> 00:41:01,989
little bit and be a little bit more

791
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:04,060
creative so my affinity for Kentucky

792
00:41:01,989 --> 00:41:06,069
bluegrass the Dino hey I have a little 1

793
00:41:04,059 --> 00:41:08,349
acre field outside my house that I've

794
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:11,789
been playing around with and when we

795
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:15,509
look at some of the

796
00:41:11,789 --> 00:41:18,090
nutrient values of this it's really

797
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:20,250
quite good in a particular we're looking

798
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:21,750
at low lignin so in this column if I

799
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:26,309
went the dairy one and went to their

800
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:30,000
library this is mixed mostly grass hay

801
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:32,369
and this is the range of values so when

802
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,820
we look at like lignin you know it's

803
00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:37,829
fairly low in lignin this hay here was

804
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:39,240
sitting outside for five days before I

805
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:42,119
finally bailed it because the weather

806
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:45,689
and machinery so that's the worst of the

807
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:47,909
law our water soluble carbohydrates are

808
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:51,480
quite high okay at the high end of the

809
00:41:47,909 --> 00:41:54,500
range this is simple sugars again at the

810
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:58,139
high end of the range of Grass Hayes

811
00:41:54,500 --> 00:42:00,599
total digestible nutrients you know

812
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:03,929
we're at the high end again and our in

813
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:07,909
vitro total digestibility you know looks

814
00:42:03,929 --> 00:42:10,259
pretty good so I think we just need to

815
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:13,309
get out of our box a little bit and

816
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:16,140
think about forage a little differently

817
00:42:13,309 --> 00:42:17,789
the other thing is we we have a pretty

818
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:19,409
difficult environment we have a lot of

819
00:42:17,789 --> 00:42:24,960
humidity out here so sometimes it's hard

820
00:42:19,409 --> 00:42:26,940
to make hay and dry hay so we might need

821
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,150
to add a little technology and so this

822
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:31,800
is from a machine called a macerator I

823
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:33,660
don't remember figure out a picture of

824
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,180
it in the next slide or not but it's

825
00:42:33,659 --> 00:42:38,699
basically a roller mill your forage goes

826
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:41,730
through two steel rollers spinning at

827
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:43,949
different speeds and you can see how it

828
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:47,789
scratched the wax off this grass leaf

829
00:42:43,949 --> 00:42:50,849
and that so that helps the hay dry in

830
00:42:47,789 --> 00:42:53,309
good conditions up to a day quicker than

831
00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:56,130
normally and then if you have some old

832
00:42:53,309 --> 00:42:57,570
reed canarygrass the farmer that sells

833
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:58,619
these was telling me he can take old

834
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:01,019
reed canarygrass

835
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:02,789
and run out through his macerator and it

836
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:05,239
softens it up quite a bit to make it

837
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:05,239
more palatable

838
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:12,500
so hey four so that's the domestic

839
00:43:10,429 --> 00:43:16,608
market I think you know we can expand

840
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:18,170
and be competitive if we can farmers

841
00:43:16,608 --> 00:43:19,969
don't like the market but if we can get

842
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:22,068
them to market and think about the end

843
00:43:19,969 --> 00:43:28,899
use of their hey maybe they can have

844
00:43:22,068 --> 00:43:28,900
more loyal customers so hey for export

845
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:37,160
alfalfa Timothy oh hey rye grass straw

846
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:39,980
when they produce seed out in Oregon and

847
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:43,250
Washington they take that straw and send

848
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:47,809
it to Japan for their Wagyu beef

849
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:50,838
we export grass hay we export straw most

850
00:43:47,809 --> 00:43:56,930
of this is going out from the western

851
00:43:50,838 --> 00:43:59,000
part of the u.s. we had a the National

852
00:43:56,929 --> 00:44:01,940
hay Growers Association meeting here in

853
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,670
in Canandaigua about two years ago and I

854
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:06,889
attended and met a farmer from

855
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:12,920
Pennsylvania that actually exports hay

856
00:44:06,889 --> 00:44:17,568
out of the out of Philadelphia so hay

857
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:18,588
exports of course of late markets have

858
00:44:17,568 --> 00:44:23,440
changed quite a bit

859
00:44:18,588 --> 00:44:26,989
but hey exports do have been increasing

860
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:30,380
most of them go to Asia but the Middle

861
00:44:26,989 --> 00:44:33,889
East also is buys a lot of our hay

862
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:35,809
and in fact Saudi Arabia is buying a

863
00:44:33,889 --> 00:44:38,298
bland in Arizona so they can produce

864
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:40,339
alfalfa because they have a policy where

865
00:44:38,298 --> 00:44:42,798
they don't want to be using their water

866
00:44:40,338 --> 00:44:45,108
and Saudi Arabia for growing alfalfa

867
00:44:42,798 --> 00:44:47,059
because there's better better and higher

868
00:44:45,108 --> 00:44:50,558
uses for it there so they're coming to

869
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:50,559
our country to produce their hay

870
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:57,240
so this is just some of this is you know

871
00:44:53,300 --> 00:45:03,060
2017 information here but those are some

872
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:06,659
of our hay exports and I just figure why

873
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:12,119
can't we get in here in New York we have

874
00:45:06,659 --> 00:45:15,929
the port of Albany we have us we go and

875
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:21,389
we have Buffalo why don't we export some

876
00:45:15,929 --> 00:45:23,849
things out of our ports so China was

877
00:45:21,389 --> 00:45:26,759
going to build an alfalfa protein

878
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:30,089
extraction plant in Canada and this is

879
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:33,510
some information I read in 2014 I went

880
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:36,120
back and I don't think they ever came

881
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:40,110
through with it but as I read it back in

882
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:44,039
2014 I was thinking you know alfalfa is

883
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:46,950
50% leaves and 50 prints sent stems you

884
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:50,219
know why are we why are we shipping

885
00:45:46,949 --> 00:45:54,299
lignin across the ocean it doesn't make

886
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:56,879
sense and that's why I love Ladino hay

887
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,680
so much is because the way it grows

888
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,170
you're really just harvesting the leaves

889
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:04,919
and the stems or Stallone's that run

890
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:07,320
along the ground and if you get a rainy

891
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,800
day a couple rainy days or rainy week

892
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:12,539
and you can't get to it when you want to

893
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:15,330
you're not getting the increase in a

894
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:19,170
neutral detergent fiber that lignin like

895
00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:21,029
you do in alfalfa or grass so it holds

896
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:23,269
its quality pretty well even in bad

897
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:23,269
weather

898
00:46:23,469 --> 00:46:28,699
so can we produce a canoe York produce

899
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:31,340
hay for export

900
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:34,789
probably not alfalfa the West certainly

901
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:38,380
has the edge but we can produce Timothy

902
00:46:34,789 --> 00:46:42,320
and mix grass hay we can produce oh hey

903
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:44,510
and maybe there's some other options rye

904
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:46,519
grass is also an extra has excellent

905
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:49,040
forest quality to it so that's something

906
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:51,380
else we could think about and do we need

907
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:54,199
to think about some more technology you

908
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:56,150
know some conditioning machinery or

909
00:46:54,199 --> 00:47:04,659
maybe some inoculants to help us beat

910
00:46:56,150 --> 00:47:08,420
the weather so again the the

911
00:47:04,659 --> 00:47:13,039
transportation part of it so we have the

912
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:15,230
climate for hay Western companies might

913
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:17,360
want to spread their risk because out

914
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:20,090
there they have water issues and I did

915
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:22,250
talk to a couple of them they haven't

916
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:25,269
spread their risk by coming out east but

917
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:25,269
they have considered it

918
00:47:26,059 --> 00:47:30,199
and then we do have a rail system here

919
00:47:27,889 --> 00:47:33,559
in New York that goes throughout the

920
00:47:30,199 --> 00:47:38,199
state different companies own the

921
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:40,610
different rail lines so I live here in

922
00:47:38,199 --> 00:47:43,099
Washington County and up in Salem

923
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:45,680
there's a feed plant and you think they

924
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:47,809
would get their corn by rail from Albany

925
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:49,190
but actually they don't they have to get

926
00:47:47,809 --> 00:47:52,250
it from East Springfield Massachusetts

927
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:56,630
so we have a rail system but it's a

928
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:59,929
little bit tricky and the port of Albany

929
00:47:56,630 --> 00:48:03,530
we take in calcium chloride from Europe

930
00:47:59,929 --> 00:48:05,419
and you know just in the back of my mind

931
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:06,380
I'm thinking why don't we do a back haul

932
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:08,150
of hay

933
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:10,369
maybe some hay cubes and some totes

934
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:12,210
something they can manage with their

935
00:48:10,369 --> 00:48:14,699
ships

936
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:23,369
and plus we have two other ports in New

937
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:25,528
York so the challenges unfortunately I

938
00:48:23,369 --> 00:48:28,769
don't think many you New York farmers

939
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:31,940
take hey very seriously at the New York

940
00:48:28,769 --> 00:48:36,028
State Fair there was only 18 contestants

941
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:38,760
that was probably 2017 when I looked it

942
00:48:36,028 --> 00:48:40,619
up we don't really have we don't have a

943
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:43,980
chapter of the American forage and

944
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:45,660
grassland council here in New York and I

945
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:52,519
think that's just indicative of our

946
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:54,838
attitude towards forage the other I

947
00:48:52,519 --> 00:48:56,969
think this here is probably our biggest

948
00:48:54,838 --> 00:49:00,778
challenge is that many of our acres are

949
00:48:56,969 --> 00:49:02,699
managed by part-time farmers and they're

950
00:49:00,778 --> 00:49:05,940
doing it on the side they're doing it

951
00:49:02,699 --> 00:49:08,278
after work and for them to step up their

952
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:09,539
game make their business a little bit

953
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:12,269
more intensive there I don't think

954
00:49:09,539 --> 00:49:13,950
they've got the energy or the interest

955
00:49:12,269 --> 00:49:15,940
to do that they just kind of want to

956
00:49:13,949 --> 00:49:18,980
cruise along

957
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:22,010
we do have small field sizes and that

958
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:24,500
does reduce a lot of our efficiency no

959
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:27,040
matter what even out west and in the

960
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:30,260
East profit margins are quite tight

961
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:33,769
weather will always be a challenge to

962
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:35,690
have consistent quality but that's

963
00:49:33,769 --> 00:49:39,559
something we can we can work with a

964
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:41,659
little bit and again we just need for

965
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:42,949
export we either need an entrepreneur

966
00:49:41,659 --> 00:49:43,519
that really knows how to make things

967
00:49:42,949 --> 00:49:46,819
happen

968
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:48,679
or we need to maybe subcontract with

969
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:52,580
someone that's already in the export

970
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:54,649
business to move Eastern hay across the

971
00:49:52,579 --> 00:50:00,259
ocean so those are just some of my

972
00:49:54,650 --> 00:50:03,650
thoughts on it again I think there's

973
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:08,950
long term I think exporting hey there

974
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:13,070
the markets are gonna be there so that's

975
00:50:08,949 --> 00:50:15,469
not a lot of data but a lot of thought

976
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:18,710
so as I Drive around my counties I see

977
00:50:15,469 --> 00:50:21,079
this idle land and I the hardest part

978
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:23,570
like my said was getting people to get

979
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:24,860
the entrepreneurial spirit and thought

980
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:33,370
in their head to really make things

981
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:33,370
happen any questions for any of us

982
00:50:49,670 --> 00:51:00,490
do you consider it when you're looking

983
00:50:54,528 --> 00:51:11,028
at putting one is there any risk of

984
00:51:00,489 --> 00:51:14,239
crime so is there a risk of degrading

985
00:51:11,028 --> 00:51:16,068
the soils basically well you know when

986
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:18,949
we want to build our soils we usually

987
00:51:16,068 --> 00:51:20,929
put them into forage so I think you know

988
00:51:18,949 --> 00:51:24,828
forage is a great way to build soils and

989
00:51:20,929 --> 00:51:30,199
maintain maintain and build soil quality

990
00:51:24,829 --> 00:51:32,028
and prevent corrosion so I don't I guess

991
00:51:30,199 --> 00:51:34,219
you know if you have shrubs like in my

992
00:51:32,028 --> 00:51:36,440
my little 8 acre field I had to pull up

993
00:51:34,219 --> 00:51:39,318
you know four inch pine trees and

994
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,639
honeysuckle bushes and so you know

995
00:51:39,318 --> 00:51:43,969
there's a little bit of disturbance

996
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:46,068
there but it's a short-term disturbance

997
00:51:43,969 --> 00:51:48,039
but I think that would be the only risk

998
00:51:46,068 --> 00:51:50,619
there really

999
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:52,750
yeah I would just chime in and say again

1000
00:51:50,619 --> 00:51:55,840
kind of marginal and what you're doing

1001
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:58,630
with it so I think most of these lands

1002
00:51:55,840 --> 00:52:00,820
better many of these things are not at

1003
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:06,608
all suitable for annual production on an

1004
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:10,380
ongoing basis but most of them are you

1005
00:52:06,608 --> 00:52:10,380
know biophysically suitable for

1006
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:15,670
production but strikes me the biggest

1007
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:17,618
problem

1008
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:19,930
you mentioned the variable weather in

1009
00:52:17,619 --> 00:52:22,030
you know when you're going to harvest a

1010
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:24,549
and the quality and it's so variable in

1011
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:27,420
New York State and in the West they can

1012
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:30,070
guarantee a quality for better way

1013
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:31,750
irrigate it's hot you're in the Central

1014
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:34,780
Valley you guarantee a quality to your

1015
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:39,099
buyer here that's you know quite

1016
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:41,560
difficult for an export market as I'm it

1017
00:52:39,099 --> 00:52:44,618
is I I think the West has an advantage

1018
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:47,320
but I think I think if we really want

1019
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:49,960
the two we could do it if we added maybe

1020
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:52,030
a little bit more machinery maybe some

1021
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:54,070
inoculants well this is why I was

1022
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:55,869
thinking more of what Peter said you

1023
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:58,269
know back to the something like the

1024
00:52:55,869 --> 00:52:59,829
pellets or something that maybe is not

1025
00:52:58,269 --> 00:53:02,710
as economic that that's much less

1026
00:52:59,829 --> 00:53:06,279
dependent on you know having good

1027
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:07,900
quality forage it's more biomass and

1028
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,700
fellas not that I'm in favor of it I'm

1029
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:12,160
just trying to point out since this

1030
00:53:09,699 --> 00:53:14,230
seems like a really difficult thing for

1031
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:16,839
someone to invest even the Westerners

1032
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:19,329
come here they want to diversify but

1033
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:21,070
then they say yeah but it's really hard

1034
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:26,079
to make projections because the weather

1035
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:28,059
is so variable here well so agreed and I

1036
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:30,670
think you're right we wouldn't be doing

1037
00:53:28,059 --> 00:53:33,190
alfalfa but if you have Kentucky

1038
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:34,809
bluegrass and Ladino clover and it rains

1039
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:37,358
all week I'm just gonna leave it there

1040
00:53:34,809 --> 00:53:40,420
no the only thing that changes if some

1041
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:43,150
leaves die and some new leaves grow so

1042
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:45,250
the quality doesn't it's not like oh if

1043
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:47,079
it was alfalfa for a whole week you'd be

1044
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:51,849
gaining it like a percentage point of

1045
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:54,730
NDF a day okay or a couple days so I

1046
00:53:51,849 --> 00:53:55,618
think if we if we think outside the box

1047
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:58,300
a little bit

1048
00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:59,950
we're not gonna maybe be as competitive

1049
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,920
as the West but I think we've got a I

1050
00:53:59,949 --> 00:54:07,849
think we can play with them

1051
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:10,500
you know there was another question yet

1052
00:54:07,849 --> 00:54:12,719
try to formulate this into a question

1053
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:16,340
just looking at the three conversations

1054
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:19,019
here we have about somewhere north of

1055
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:21,690
three billion dollars worth of assets

1056
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:24,659
sitting out there not being used bigger

1057
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:28,400
you know a million plus million acres

1058
00:54:24,659 --> 00:54:30,779
you have this industry which is

1059
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,420
potentially profitable this evening if

1060
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:36,360
you're anything in this tree but it's

1061
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:38,519
just kind of not happening and you know

1062
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:40,470
it has quite huge a critical mass or

1063
00:54:38,519 --> 00:54:43,619
industrial cluster or whatever wherever

1064
00:54:40,469 --> 00:54:45,439
it has to be and here we have all this

1065
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:48,989
hay production and we're thinking about

1066
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:51,240
exporting it when we have this enormous

1067
00:54:48,989 --> 00:54:52,589
market that's eating beef in New York

1068
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:57,000
City is eating like a million v

1069
00:54:52,590 --> 00:55:00,750
panelists here so it's you know it seems

1070
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:04,739
like hard to quite put this together and

1071
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:07,380
explain it and maybe it's just an

1072
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:10,799
economic development question maybe this

1073
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:13,200
land really isn't profitable maybe it's

1074
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:17,190
just like Bitcoin just some money in

1075
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:21,239
that is it not virtual but it's a store

1076
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:23,639
of value I mean that's not my sense my

1077
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:26,489
sense is we can run profitable grazing

1078
00:55:23,639 --> 00:55:28,859
operations and get the land more

1079
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:32,359
productive but negative in perennial

1080
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:36,090
pasture but I guess the question then is

1081
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:40,110
why is this the situation I mean what is

1082
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:43,920
the solution is this is an economic

1083
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:48,780
development job for for our government

1084
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:53,180
or I can give you mine on Cooperative

1085
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:55,680
Extension Aaron Gabriel point of view I

1086
00:55:53,179 --> 00:55:59,279
know we keep talking about feeding the

1087
00:55:55,679 --> 00:56:01,889
population in 2050 but honestly we have

1088
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:05,880
way too much food around you know

1089
00:56:01,889 --> 00:56:10,079
there's the the real the real source of

1090
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:13,680
this issue is markets you know if there

1091
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:14,909
was a profitable efj market consistently

1092
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:17,038
profit obese

1093
00:56:14,909 --> 00:56:19,348
market or a consistently profitable

1094
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:22,530
Haymarket there wouldn't be any idle

1095
00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:25,500
land in New York or anywhere okay so

1096
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:28,680
honestly we have an an overproduction in

1097
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:30,780
our system and there's plenty of food I

1098
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:32,578
know in some parts of the world it's not

1099
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:34,859
but it's not a matter of supply it's a

1100
00:56:32,579 --> 00:56:37,019
matter of you know Civil War and all the

1101
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:40,969
other sociological things that are going

1102
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:44,038
on so so I mean I don't want to be

1103
00:56:40,969 --> 00:56:48,000
depressing you know but we have a lot of

1104
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:49,770
food and there's it's hard to market it

1105
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,798
so my neighbor has sold their dairy

1106
00:56:49,769 --> 00:56:54,389
animals right I just visited a farmer

1107
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:58,219
yesterday who's gonna be selling his

1108
00:56:54,389 --> 00:57:03,710
animals in a couple months our holes a

1109
00:56:58,219 --> 00:57:17,038
health production system is is a

1110
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:19,798
challenge a lot less and the market is a

1111
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:22,740
lot closer the rest of the components of

1112
00:57:19,798 --> 00:57:27,719
the system are not here you know the low

1113
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:30,358
cost processing the finishing their

1114
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:31,679
human capital around the world even

1115
00:57:30,358 --> 00:57:33,239
though we have a lot of dairy people

1116
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:39,328
it's really kind of two different

1117
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:42,769
species actually so I don't know well I

1118
00:57:39,329 --> 00:57:46,859
agree with you because I just bought

1119
00:57:42,769 --> 00:57:49,318
grassland right I just bought grass-fed

1120
00:57:46,858 --> 00:57:52,409
hamburger in the store from Australia

1121
00:57:49,318 --> 00:57:54,210
and there actually is a group a guy he

1122
00:57:52,409 --> 00:57:57,568
spoke at our wintergreen up meeting him

1123
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:59,429
and forgetting his name and the name of

1124
00:57:57,568 --> 00:58:01,858
his business but he's trying to get

1125
00:57:59,429 --> 00:58:03,899
farmers he's trying to get two types of

1126
00:58:01,858 --> 00:58:06,119
farmers cow-calf operations and

1127
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:11,849
finishers do grass-fed beef here in the

1128
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:13,559
Northeast you know and so I hope that

1129
00:58:11,849 --> 00:58:15,778
works but it's getting farmers to work

1130
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:18,269
together it's getting that entrepreneur

1131
00:58:15,778 --> 00:58:20,309
that like this person and yourself

1132
00:58:18,269 --> 00:58:25,579
that's got the vision to actually make

1133
00:58:20,309 --> 00:58:25,579
it work so yes

1134
00:58:27,949 --> 00:58:45,629
transition it's um you I think you can

1135
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:48,210
do it it's a totally different financial

1136
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:51,088
structure though I would say you know

1137
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:53,068
they're going from you know high-value

1138
00:58:51,088 --> 00:58:57,659
milk is pretty high value compared to

1139
00:58:53,068 --> 00:59:00,838
beef you know and you know 70 bucks a

1140
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:06,318
head profit so if you want to make a

1141
00:59:00,838 --> 00:59:06,318
living you'd need a thousand cattle

1142
00:59:08,989 --> 00:59:14,159
right so the you know my neighbors I

1143
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,659
think he had a herd of about a hundred

1144
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:20,848
and fifty dairy cows he's got 300 acres

1145
00:59:17,659 --> 00:59:22,828
you know to go to a thousand head of

1146
