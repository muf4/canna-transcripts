1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,960
University thanks we're going to lower

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,160
the lights because some of the slides I

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,960
think will show up better um thank you

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,640
Claus um and I'd like to thank Claus for

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,039
inviting me to talk with you today this

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,760
is my very first plant biology seminar

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,840
and I'm happy to have the opportunity to

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,039
tell you about some of our work now in

10
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,679
the title I include the word art you

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,840
know Art and Science because I I found

12
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:32,719
over the years that working in plant

13
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:35,238
tissue culture and transformation

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,359
there's definitely an art to it there is

15
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:39,599
a feel for with experience for what

16
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,719
should be done next and there's also a

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,359
lot of creativity involved but you know

18
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:46,000
as I think about it I think the same is

19
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:47,600
true for other areas of research as well

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,039
okay so these are some points that I'm

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,520
going to cover during uh during my

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,239
presentation I'll give you some

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,079
background on tissue culture and plant

24
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,038
transformation I thought giving you some

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,039
of the basics would be uh you know

26
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,600
really good before I launched into how

27
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,600
we develop the methods and giving you

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,159
examples of the projects Lisa Earl um as

29
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,478
class mentioned I did my graduate work

30
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,520
in her lab and before her retirement she

31
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,319
taught an entire class on tissue culture

32
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:12,359
and transformation so I have just a few

33
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,679
slides um to you know kind of put you on

34
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:16,959
that level so you understand why we do

35
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,799
what we do I'll use these current uh

36
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,478
projects as examples of how we develop

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,079
those methods um grape is the most

38
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:27,000
recent one in our lab we've been working

39
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:28,279
with Anor aall in at Cornell on esus and

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,879
um also as classus mentioned we're

41
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,478
working with sataria viridus which is

42
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:34,798
which is a C4 photosynthesis grass that

43
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,478
we're developing as a model species and

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,320
then I'll end by telling you some of the

45
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,679
next steps for those

46
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:43,879
projects so the way I see it there are

47
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,600
four components to development of these

48
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:47,920
methods um there's the plant tissue

49
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,919
culture and plant regeneration even

50
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,159
before we go into transformation we have

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,680
to have an efficient method for plant

52
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,520
regeneration and these are some examples

53
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,118
so this is potato so for potato we start

54
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,118
with plants that are growing in tissue

55
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:03,759
culture in test tubes which is referred

56
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:06,280
to as inv vitro and we put those stem

57
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,080
pieces on a medium that induces this

58
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,479
growth called Callis which is an

59
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,239
unorganized mass of cells somewhat

60
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,440
analogous to a tumor and then we tweak

61
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:17,319
that Medium to give the cells the signal

62
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,199
to produce plants and these little

63
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:21,159
potato plants are then removed from the

64
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,439
callus and transferred to a rooting

65
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:26,639
medium this is tomato um tomato we start

66
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:28,639
with Calon pieces that from seedlings

67
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:31,878
that are grown in culture and these are

68
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:34,000
all examples of plant regeneration after

69
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:35,399
transformation so you'll see that not

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,680
every piece of plant material is

71
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,400
regenerating choots and then for sateria

72
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,159
we start with callus that is induced

73
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,360
from mature seeds and I'm going to tell

74
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:47,158
you about that in more detail later and

75
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,400
this is what we use for the

76
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:51,919
transformation and again that callus is

77
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,640
put onto regeneration medium to um

78
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,000
induce these plants to grow once we have

79
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:57,559
you know a good system worked out for

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,479
the plant tissue culture then we move

81
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,199
into the gene transfer methods a

82
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,318
critical part of this and can sometimes

83
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:06,759
be a stumbling block is in the rooting

84
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,839
and acclimation to Greenhouse conditions

85
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:11,560
we of course work all this out before we

86
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,439
even try Gene transfer methods and

87
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,000
patients lots of patients um it takes a

88
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:19,120
long time to go from start to finish and

89
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,239
as you'll see when I uh talk about grape

90
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,719
we're sometimes working with very small

91
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,439
plant material that we have to use a

92
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,439
dissecting scope in order to do the

93
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:32,238
work so um when we start with

94
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,080
working out a new method we'll first go

95
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,200
to the literature to see if anything has

96
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,400
been reported for that particular plant

97
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:40,039
species if we don't find anything then

98
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,239
we look to see what is the most you know

99
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:44,120
the most closely related relative see if

100
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,959
there's anything reported for that if we

101
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,438
don't find anything which happens

102
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,680
sometimes we then go based on experience

103
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:53,318
and also a lot of trial and error to

104
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,079
find out the best combination to use so

105
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:57,479
for plant material we have a number of

106
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:00,120
choices um but for monocot what works

107
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:02,679
best are immature inflorescences mature

108
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,719
seeds and immature embryos for diecuts

109
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,280
you can pretty much try um any one of

110
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,759
these types of plant material uh one

111
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,759
part where we do spend quite a bit of

112
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:12,959
time also is working out methods to

113
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:14,878
clean up that material now that culture

114
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,798
medium I showed you in the slides

115
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,639
contains sugar because they need a

116
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,638
carbon Source since they're growing in

117
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,680
laboratory conditions and if you don't

118
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,360
clean up that material there a lot of

119
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,600
you the material will be overgrown by

120
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,759
bacteria and fungi and it will kill the

121
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,720
material so we use bleach um ethanol

122
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:35,240
sometimes antifungal antibacterial

123
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,280
compounds but there's really a fine line

124
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,639
sometimes between finding the right

125
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,599
method that will clean up the

126
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,720
contaminants yet not kill the plant

127
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,639
material um some of these systems are

128
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,800
easier than others but U for something

129
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,519
like um for the esus we spent a lot of

130
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,720
time trying to find the best method for

131
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:54,399
cleaning up the

132
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,680
material for culture medium components

133
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,560
um not every medium contains all these

134
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,120
components it's just an example of what

135
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,959
you can include in the med medium um the

136
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,319
major part of the U medium it are salt

137
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:08,439
formulations and those salts are like

138
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,240
nitrogen phosphorus potassium whatever

139
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:13,038
is needed to support plant growth and

140
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,280
culture there are a number of standard

141
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:18,199
salt formulations that we use one common

142
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:21,119
one is called migi and skoo or Ms but

143
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:23,800
there are even modified versions of Ms

144
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,478
so you can find um you can purchase an

145
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,918
MS medium that doesn't contain any

146
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:29,719
ammonium nitrate because some plant

147
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,439
species are sensitive to the ammonium

148
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,080
nit trate so there you know there are a

149
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,959
lot of parts to those salts that can

150
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:37,680
also affect the plant material one of

151
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:39,638
the most critical parts of the medium

152
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,639
are these plant growth regulators and

153
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,960
there are two um categories there are

154
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,400
oxin and cyto canines and these are an

155
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:48,359
example of some oxin and these are some

156
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,198
cyto so when we're working with these

157
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,639
methods it's not only the choice of an

158
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,400
oxin or cyto that can make a difference

159
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,960
it's the combination it's the

160
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,758
concentration it's the ratios sometimes

161
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:01,279
we'll start out in an oxin but then move

162
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:03,680
to a cyto so it really depends on the

163
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,879
plant species that we're working with

164
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,000
for a carbohydrate Source sucrose is the

165
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:10,478
most common but we do work with some

166
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,598
systems where maltose or glucose works

167
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:14,359
better jelling agents there are

168
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:17,240
different types of augers and gel and

169
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,000
gum and it sometimes it's really hard to

170
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,759
convince people that jelling agent can

171
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,319
really make a difference I think some

172
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,520
people think it's just not an important

173
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,439
part of the medium until we give them a

174
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:28,799
protocol and we say you have to use you

175
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:30,918
know a gel and gum to start out with

176
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,280
even though it's in it in its red and

177
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:33,799
then they'll contact me and they'll say

178
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:35,478
the method's not working and say all

179
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,360
right let's start troubleshooting and

180
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,399
then I find out that they substituted a

181
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,199
jelling agent that we didn't recommend I

182
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,439
like well really trust me you know the

183
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,079
jelling agent can make a difference um

184
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,800
there are also amino acids and vitamins

185
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:49,800
that are sometimes

186
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,520
required um activated charcoal kind of

187
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,319
like acts like an antioxidant when some

188
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,560
of the plant material will turn brown

189
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:57,960
when we cut it and put it in culture and

190
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,918
the activated charcoal helps absorb that

191
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,598
it also absorbs inhibitors that might

192
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,758
prevent plant uh

193
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:05,279
regeneration and um I you know I worked

194
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,160
at geranium when I when I was at

195
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,519
Sanford's and when we would cut the

196
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,720
pieces of geranium and put them in

197
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:12,038
culture they would just turn black so we

198
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,960
ended up looking at a number of

199
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:16,120
different types of antioxidants and

200
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:18,279
concentrations in order to prevent the

201
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,160
um the you know the phenolics from

202
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:22,559
taking down the material and there's

203
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,840
also coconut water now I don't see this

204
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,000
as as you know often now in recent

205
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,758
literature but in the earlier days

206
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,519
coconut water was used and you can still

207
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,720
purchase coconut water um through some

208
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:34,598
of the companies and it contains you

209
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,720
know a number of sugars growth

210
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:39,038
Regulators amino acids and some

211
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,440
undefined components that really can

212
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:42,598
make a difference in getting plant

213
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:46,120
regeneration or not getting

214
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:47,839
it now in developing a transformation

215
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,879
method where we spend the majority of

216
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,439
our time is in the plant regeneration

217
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:55,080
phase we don't start plant um

218
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:57,719
transformation until we feel that the

219
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:59,758
Regeneration part is very efficient and

220
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,159
what I would recommend is that at least

221
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,360
30 to 40% of your plant material are

222
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:06,959
regenerating shoes and that's because

223
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,520
when you do it an

224
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,638
agrobacterium infection not every cell

225
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:14,038
is

226
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,000
infected so if you have a system that's

227
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:17,439
regenerating a lot of shoes you have a

228
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,598
greater chance of recovering

229
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:20,759
transformance in the end so that's why I

230
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:22,959
would say if you have something that's

231
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:26,158
less than 30% don't even try it until

232
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:28,878
you get that percentage up so I'm just

233
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:30,158
going to all right um there are three

234
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,519
different meth that you can use for

235
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:34,759
transformation agrobacterium biolistics

236
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,639
which the gene gun and as um Claus

237
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:38,799
mentioned the gene gun was invented here

238
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,519
at Cornell and basically what there what

239
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,559
happens is there are Micron siiz

240
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,480
particles gold or tungsten that are

241
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:47,079
coated with DNA and blasted into the

242
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,639
plant cells there's also a DNA uptake

243
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,839
into protoplast if you have a leaf um

244
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:53,480
you treat it with enzymes that takes

245
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,839
away the cell wall you're left at the

246
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,039
protoplast and then there are methods to

247
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:01,000
um increase that DNA uptake into the

248
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:03,000
protoplast and our lab we use um

249
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,159
agrobacterium for all of our work we

250
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,039
find that it works perfectly fine um

251
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:10,519
it's a soilborne bacterium about 30

252
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:12,399
years ago a group of scientists um

253
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:14,480
decided that since agrobacterium is

254
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,000
engineering plants in nature it

255
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,839
transfers genes into plant cells to

256
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,799
produce the metabolites that it needs to

257
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,880
growth you know can they take that

258
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,359
bacterium from the soil and use it in

259
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,759
the lab to transfer genes of interest

260
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,879
and it worked and that was like the

261
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:30,519
whole start of plant biotechnology um

262
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,879
from there number of reports just

263
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:34,679
increased dramatically there are

264
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,399
different strains um that you need to

265
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,239
consider when you're doing the um

266
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,440
transformation you need to think of it

267
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,680
in a in a in a a plant pathogen

268
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,560
interaction there are antibiotics

269
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,239
depending on the um strain that you're

270
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:50,319
using that eventually will REM you know

271
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,680
eliminate that bacterium because if we

272
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,720
don't do that after a transformation the

273
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:57,120
agrobacterium overgrows the material and

274
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,800
kills it and um there's also different

275
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,159
phases of growth we need to look at and

276
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,799
concentration

277
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,958
so after we when we make an overnight

278
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:07,078
culture of AG bacterium we'll read the

279
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:09,879
optical density and um in general it's

280
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:11,799
about a 0 6 to 7 but for some species we

281
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:14,679
found we have to decrease that by 10

282
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:16,799
times U so we're using like 006 or 007

283
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:18,919
because it's just very sensitive to the

284
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,919
um

285
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,720
agrobacterium now vectors Um this can

286
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,120
really make or break a plant

287
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,720
transformation system um those are the

288
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,078
shuttles that were used in the

289
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,920
agrobacterium to transfer the DNA into

290
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,399
the cells we use um electroporation

291
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:36,360
there are different methods that you can

292
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,078
use to introduce that plasma DNA and

293
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,680
that Vector but we find that

294
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:42,239
electroporation works just fine for us

295
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:43,759
there are different selectable marker

296
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,360
genes and I'm going to go into more

297
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:48,078
detail on this when I talk about vectors

298
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,039
and those are genes that confer

299
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,638
resistance to antibiotic and also

300
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:54,199
herbicides and then we include those

301
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,399
components either an antibiotic or

302
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,560
herbicide in component into our medium

303
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:00,278
and there are different types and

304
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,359
concentrations and you have to look at

305
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:03,958
timing and you know there's a lot of

306
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,360
parts of this that you need to look at

307
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,879
for your particular plant species when

308
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,399
we're working at a new method we use

309
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:11,200
something called a reporter Gene we

310
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:13,480
don't jump into to just start using our

311
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,480
Gene of interest because sometimes genes

312
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,800
of interest can have a negative effect

313
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,039
on the Regeneration of plants it affects

314
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:22,319
the development so we start out with

315
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:25,360
these reporter genes there's one called

316
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,040
Gus which is beta glucuronidase and the

317
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,240
way this works is that if you have this

318
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:30,519
in your vector you do your

319
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,120
transformation the plants you recover

320
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:35,039
you can take pieces of leaves put them

321
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,039
into an assay solution if it turns blue

322
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,120
it's successful if not it's back to the

323
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,639
drawing board and there's also the green

324
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,959
fluoresence protein gfp the nice thing

325
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:46,959
about gfp is it's um as compared to Gus

326
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:49,479
when you put your material in gust it it

327
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:51,159
kills it but with gfp you can actually

328
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,079
monitor the progress of that

329
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:55,958
transformation by using a fluorescent

330
00:11:53,078 --> 00:12:00,638
scope and we're starting to use more gfp

331
00:11:55,958 --> 00:12:00,638
um construct vectors in our lab now

332
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,600
and then um the other part of the aggro

333
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:07,399
bacterium is the length of time with the

334
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,320
AG with with it um when we're doing a

335
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,399
transformation say we have those pieces

336
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,440
of potato stem pieces they're just

337
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,320
dipped for five minutes it used to be in

338
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,720
the older protocols they would leave

339
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,720
that material in for like half an hour

340
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,120
but that ends up having a negative

341
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,199
effect it stresses the plant material so

342
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,399
we find that a five minute dip is

343
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:28,919
perfectly fine and then it goes back

344
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,559
onto the medium for 2 to three days and

345
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:32,519
that's when the AGR bacterium attaches

346
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,599
to the cells and does the gene transfer

347
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,879
at that point most often it's in the

348
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,759
dark we do all of our um co-cultivation

349
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:41,000
in the dark but there are some reports

350
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:43,120
where they use light and it's also the

351
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,919
temperature during that period is also

352
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,519
important it's not surprising that

353
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:49,159
around 19 to 22 degrees Celsius works

354
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,600
best because again it is a soil

355
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:53,240
bacterium that's how it evolved and we

356
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,399
find that we've done comparisons of

357
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,680
temperatures and found that that range

358
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:01,320
um works the best okay so for vectors um

359
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:04,039
this is some examples of vectors and the

360
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,000
pambu one is a more complicated diagram

361
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:08,879
it's showing the restriction enzymes

362
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,879
that can be used for

363
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:13,958
cloning and then I have a more

364
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:15,679
simplified Vector down here called Panic

365
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:17,559
this was developed for switch grass or

366
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:19,198
panicum that's why they're called panic

367
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:20,439
and we've been using these panic vectors

368
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:22,838
for

369
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,680
sataria you can see that on this plasma

370
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:27,399
DNA there's this segment here that I'll

371
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,638
um discuss a little bit more in the next

372
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:33,159
slide and then on that back bone there

373
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:35,680
are also um a bacterial resistant Gene

374
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:38,039
for canamy and also this origin of

375
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:40,039
replication this origin of replication

376
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:42,078
can also be very important depending on

377
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:45,240
what plant species you're working on and

378
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:45,239
we found that to be true for

379
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:52,120
sataria this is a closer up view of a

380
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:54,599
vector and um what you see here is there

381
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,839
is a left and a right border and th

382
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,360
that's the sequence that the

383
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,360
agrobacterium recognizes agrobacterium

384
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,440
has endonuclear AES and those are the

385
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,278
sequences it recognizes to cut that DNA

386
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,480
at those points and transfer it into the

387
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:10,240
plant cells those vectors also contain

388
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,199
promoters I'm just using these as an

389
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,959
example there's all sorts of different

390
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:17,078
types of vectors that you can use this

391
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:19,879
is the NOS promoter driving the npt2

392
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:22,359
gene now the npt2 gene is a selectable

393
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:25,159
marker Gene and it confers resistance to

394
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,800
canamy the antibiotic so when we do our

395
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:29,958
transformation we'll put that canyin

396
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:31,599
into the medium and the reason we do

397
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:33,399
that is you know implant so say we're

398
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,720
doing a tomato transformation and we

399
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:39,120
have calan pieces just about every cell

400
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,920
in that Caledon has the potential to go

401
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,000
on and to make

402
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:47,240
plants and with a selectable marker Gene

403
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,759
only the cells that receive that npt2

404
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,039
Gene go on to make plants because we

405
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:54,440
have canamy in the medium if we didn't

406
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:56,879
do that we would have a lot of plants to

407
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,240
screen in order to find those few that

408
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:01,320
are really transformed and it can also

409
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,240
affect the efficiency of the system so

410
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,160
we do need to include um um a selectable

411
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,000
marker Gene and again it could be for

412
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:11,319
antibiotic resistance or herbicide

413
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,078
resistance this is another promoter that

414
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,240
is a common one called 35s you could put

415
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:17,919
your Gene of Interest here I've put Gus

416
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,480
there um because that's what we use for

417
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:22,599
developing methods we then electroporate

418
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,240
that into agrobacterium we grow an

419
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,440
overnight culture and we do a

420
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,440
transformation

421
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,240
experiment so these are some tools of

422
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,680
the trade for doing that there overnight

423
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,480
cultures we do the electroporation we

424
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:36,198
plate it onto the medium we use

425
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,399
toothpicks to transfer those colonies

426
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:41,519
into the liquid medium this is a freshly

427
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:45,519
inoculated culture it goes onto a Shaker

428
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:47,839
um overnight and then hopefully it um

429
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,240
you get growth and then we take this

430
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,120
solution centrifuge it down we get a

431
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,839
pellet and we wash it with a plant

432
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,159
tissue culture medium because the um

433
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,199
salts that are used for growing the

434
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:00,719
bacteria are much too concentrated can

435
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:03,240
have a negative effect on the plant

436
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,079
material so we wash that pellet with a

437
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,759
plant-based culture

438
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,318
medium um the next you know we as I

439
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,919
mentioned we'll work out the rooting and

440
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:14,039
acclamation to the greenhouse even

441
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:15,479
before we do transformation we certainly

442
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:19,120
don't want to be working out this out

443
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:21,079
with our precious transgenic lines um we

444
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,318
um always we prefer that we get the

445
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:25,599
rooting in culture before we transfer it

446
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:28,198
to soil we sometimes need to use a lower

447
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,399
salt formulation um oxin something like

448
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:32,359
tomato we don't need to use any oxin in

449
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,399
the rooting medium because it it Roots

450
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,360
readily um and also we uh there are some

451
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,360
systems where we use activated charcoal

452
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,720
because if we don't see rooting there

453
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,560
might be an inhibitor there that's

454
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,920
causing it to not root so we'll use

455
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:46,198
activated charcoal for the acclamation

456
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:47,919
to the greenhouse you know there are a

457
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:50,519
number of factors to consider not

458
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:52,000
surprising um soil type lighting you

459
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,198
different plant species that we work

460
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,639
with we have to use different types of

461
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:58,318
soil and um you'll see that these are

462
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,440
some sataria plants that are covered

463
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:01,958
with water bottles and the reason that

464
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,720
they're covered is that when we take

465
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:05,519
plants out of culture you know they're

466
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,679
in test tubes or they're in magenta

467
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:10,720
boxes and which are a culture vessel

468
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,919
that we use and um there's it's a 100%

469
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,439
humidity and the cuticle isn't well

470
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:17,120
developed the stomates are wide open and

471
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,519
if we transfer those to soil and we

472
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,399
don't cover them they'll wil and die so

473
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:24,240
um we had been using plastic bags in the

474
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,600
beginning but then someone had the idea

475
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,558
that you know people in the lab are

476
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:30,599
drinking water having bottled water and

477
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:33,558
Gatorade so we'd let's try those and we

478
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:35,918
cut the bottoms off the bottles and we

479
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:38,119
cover the plants after a few days we'll

480
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,640
simply remove the cap and then after a

481
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:42,558
few days more we'll take off the bottle

482
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,038
and then we wash those bottles and reuse

483
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:45,558
them so it's much better than plastic

484
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:47,119
bags because it was difficult to reuse

485
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:49,200
the plastic bags we had to cut holes in

486
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:51,038
the bags to gradually acclimate them and

487
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,038
then discard those bags so now we have

488
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:55,038
um a good supply of bottles um in the

489
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,440
lab so this is um a listing of the

490
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:04,000
plants that we have worked with and

491
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,720
those that are current the those listed

492
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,079
in the black text are those which are

493
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,759
current projects those in red text or

494
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:12,439
ones that were doing uh transformation

495
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:15,919
as a service so in my group I have

496
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,640
support from bti for two and a half um

497
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,080
two and a half people um to do

498
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,880
Transformations as a service and the way

499
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:23,960
this works is if someone is interested

500
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,400
say in tomato like Jim we do a lot of

501
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,960
work for Jim um they'll give us the

502
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,000
construct and we'll do the

503
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,798
transformations in the tomato and then

504
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,720
we'll you know give them the plants back

505
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:35,918
for their work and it's B it's a fee

506
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,038
recovery system um because we have to

507
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,159
repay that loan back to bti for what

508
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:41,558
they you know the money that they give

509
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,000
us to support this um service component

510
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:44,960
but then the other projects in the lab

511
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,359
are funded through different um funding

512
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,000
agencies and these um in Blu text are

513
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,158
ones that we have worked on on the past

514
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,679
but they're no longer active

515
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:56,760
projects so um I thought you might be

516
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,240
wondering like how long does the whole

517
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:01,440
process take from when I do the inection

518
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,960
until I can get plants back and when we

519
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,558
do our Transformations as a service

520
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,519
people are really anxious to get the

521
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,558
plants back and you know we do our best

522
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:09,798
to be able to you know to um give them

523
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:12,359
the plants and then they want to know

524
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:14,440
how long it takes so from the time saer

525
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:17,479
tomato that we do an infection of the

526
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,840
Calen pieces it takes about six weeks to

527
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,400
go from the infection phase to having

528
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:23,240
these little choots

529
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,360
regenerating then we transfer those

530
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,759
shoots to a rooting medium and if you're

531
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,798
interested in Fruit it takes about a

532
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,960
total time of five to six months to

533
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:33,319
recover red ripe fruit if you're

534
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,360
interested in just looking at the plants

535
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:37,599
for disease or insect resistance you

536
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:40,399
know it's obviously it's a much shorter

537
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:42,639
time for potato it's roughly the same

538
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,159
time frame um this month difference here

539
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,320
is because some potatoes take longer in

540
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:49,720
the greenhouse to produce tubers but

541
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:52,038
again we start with um infecting plant

542
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,600
potato stem pieces and then in about

543
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:55,679
eight weeks we have these little potato

544
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:57,158
plants that we can cut and root and then

545
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,240
we'll put them into the greenhouse and

546
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:00,440
produce tubers in pots but again if

547
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,159
you're just interested in the plants

548
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,159
it's a much a much shorter time

549
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,520
frame so that's it for your instruction

550
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:11,359
and plant tissue culture and

551
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,319
transformation um and now I'm going to

552
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:15,759
jump into the three projects to use

553
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:18,038
those as an example of how we develop

554
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,720
those methods so as I mentioned grape is

555
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:21,679
one of the most recent um projects that

556
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,558
we have in the lab and I wanted to work

557
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,320
on Grape since we started um the

558
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:27,359
transformation service specialist

559
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:29,200
knowing that grape is such an important

560
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,759
crop in New York state

561
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,159
and that I and you know there's work

562
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:35,279
going on in Geneva and I thought we

563
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:38,360
could really help um help those projects

564
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:41,000
along so this um started as a

565
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:42,798
collaboration with Gan Juan in Geneva

566
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,960
and he suggested that we work with two

567
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:48,000
model grap plants um one is called pixie

568
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,759
it's a dwarf Vine and these were

569
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,640
developed to help you know help

570
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,079
accelerate the great breeding programs

571
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,880
instead of having to go out to the field

572
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:56,158
and working with vines in the field

573
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,720
these lines can be grown in the

574
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,200
greenhouse pixie stays small it's a the

575
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,679
sport of Pon Noir and the reason it's

576
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,960
short it's because it's you know there's

577
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,919
a it's a mutant GI mutant and it affects

578
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,880
the gibberellin pathway so these plants

579
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:11,200
stay small the inner nodes are very

580
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,600
close um they're really dark green um

581
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,360
green leaves Scout is an experimental

582
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:19,158
line that was released by the USDA and

583
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:21,038
ARS in 2010 it flowers continuously in

584
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:22,679
the field in Greenhouse so you can see

585
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:24,480
how this would be an advantage for

586
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:26,960
research programs you have a continuous

587
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,159
supply of flowers it was developed by a

588
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,038
cross between ruby red and Asian an

589
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,039
Asian species and this is the makeup

590
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:35,640
here of the

591
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:37,119
scalp um and then genan Juan also

592
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,120
recommended that we start working with

593
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:40,879
Concord because it's again it's an

594
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:43,278
important one in New York state and it's

595
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,080
often used to make jellies and jams and

596
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:47,798
if you're interested in reading more

597
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:49,558
about um pixie and Scout there is a

598
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:51,158
publication that was put out by Cornell

599
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,440
that describes the background on that

600
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:53,440
plant

601
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:01,600
material so for grape there are two

602
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:05,320
possible sources based in the literature

603
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:08,240
on um for starting plant cell cultures

604
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:10,558
the one is immature infloresence and

605
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,679
that is what works best for wine grapes

606
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:15,158
and some others this method for the

607
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:17,720
leaves from plants in vitro does not

608
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:20,320
work um for the grapes they're used for

609
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,000
wine making but it's mostly seedless

610
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,639
grape types that work through this

611
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,200
method but again not all of them and

612
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,679
I'll show you why there are advantages

613
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,720
to using the leaf system as compared to

614
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:33,159
the immature INF fluorescent system so

615
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,558
we've been doing our work based on

616
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:38,799
reports by gray and Dey um we start by

617
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:39,960
inducing callus on the plant material

618
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:42,480
and then we look for something called

619
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,880
sematic embryos there are two meth two

620
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,798
ways where plant regeneration can happen

621
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,640
there's a sematic embryogenesis and an

622
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:52,119
organogenesis um I'll show you examples

623
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,440
of organogenesis later but for grape

624
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:58,639
it's through the sematic embryogenesis

625
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:03,278
meth um mode and when we started this we

626
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:05,240
ended up testing 14 different media um

627
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:06,720
formulations based on what we found in

628
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,319
the literature to find something to work

629
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,440
for Scout and Concord we're not doing

630
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:12,678
pixie yet but for Scout and Concord um

631
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,919
we had to look at different salts

632
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:16,159
different growth regulators and other

633
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,360
media components once we have that

634
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,559
callus and we have the sematic embryos

635
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:22,558
the sematic embryos or SE are

636
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:24,319
transferred to a maintenance medium and

637
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:27,399
this maintenance medium contains a high

638
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:29,399
level of sucrose um sucrose generally is

639
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,360
around 20 to 30 grams per liter in a

640
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,960
culture medium but for this medium we

641
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:36,319
needed a higher level at 60 there are no

642
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,360
growth Regulators in the medium and as I

643
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,720
mentioned before your jelling agent can

644
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:43,479
make or break a system um in talking

645
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,440
with um Dennis gray he said it's very

646
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,240
important to use this augur called TC

647
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,798
augur throughout the whole system to get

648
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,679
a good response for

649
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:54,038
gra okay now here's the fun

650
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,840
part so um so these are this is an

651
00:23:54,038 --> 00:23:58,679
immature infloresence from Scout and

652
00:23:56,839 --> 00:24:00,519
this is a dime we used as a size

653
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:03,759
reference so you can imagine with that

654
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:05,960
immature infloresence the size of that

655
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:08,319
um and what we end up doing with these

656
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,798
is we we treat the inflorescence with a

657
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:13,200
bleach solution to clean it up and

658
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:15,319
there's a lot of dissecting scope work

659
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,400
that has to be done because what we need

660
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:20,200
to do is take a Bud from this

661
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,559
inflorescence cut it open and then take

662
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,759
out the inside flower parts and what is

663
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:28,558
most important in this system is that

664
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:30,398
the filament stay attached to the anther

665
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:32,000
because that is where you get the right

666
00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:33,558
type of callus the callus that's going

667
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,200
to give you that

668
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:39,000
embryogenesis it's difficult to keep the

669
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,880
filament with the anther um you know and

670
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,759
what we found is by taking out the

671
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,960
entire part here and putting that on the

672
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:48,200
medium we were much more successful at

673
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,679
keeping the anther um with that filament

674
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,840
we put it on the callous induction

675
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,559
medium the callus forms at the

676
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:56,599
connective tissue and then that callus

677
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,000
we again we're using a dissecting scope

678
00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:00,480
and we're looking for these tiny little

679
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,919
white embryos that pop up these tiny

680
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,159
embryos are then moved to that

681
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,640
maintenance and it's actually a

682
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:07,039
proliferation medium and you can see all

683
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,360
these little embryos these sematic

684
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:11,440
embryos that have come up this in here

685
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:14,240
these little ones are what we called a

686
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,200
preemo and these are the sematic embryos

687
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,679
and it's these sematic embryos that are

688
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,440
used for the

689
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,720
transformation I don't know I'm really

690
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,120
fascinated um in a kind of a nerdy Way

691
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,159
by um by embryos by sematic embryos I

692
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:26,879
think they're really cute you know

693
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:28,440
they're very white and um it's really

694
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,278
it's fun to work with the systems where

695
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,038
getting sematic embryos so as I

696
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:34,720
mentioned there's a lot of um work at

697
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:36,798
the scope and this is Kate pigeon Kate

698
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,360
spends a lot of her time you know ex um

699
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:40,519
taking out the flower parts looking for

700
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:41,918
the sematic embryos and I asked her to

701
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:43,960
look at the camera to show that she can

702
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,799
still be smiling after all this all this

703
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,038
scope work but um you know in talking

704
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:50,639
with Dennis gray he said that you know

705
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:52,158
when he gives his protocol to people and

706
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,000
they then say we're having problems he

707
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,159
finds out that they're not using a scope

708
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,798
they're just trying to do it without

709
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:58,799
using a dissecting scope and it's an

710
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:00,158
important part of the process

711
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,759
so this is a closeup of some of the

712
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,919
somatic embryos that are on that

713
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:06,720
proliferation maintenance medium and you

714
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:09,520
can see these are more which as you lose

715
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,319
the term mature embryos and down here

716
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:12,119
and this is a closeup these are some of

717
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:14,798
the

718
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:17,359
pre-embryos so what we do to keep the

719
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:19,440
embryogenic system going is again using

720
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,519
the scope we'll select out these tiny

721
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,558
little embryos put them back onto the

722
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:24,839
medium and this isn't a black background

723
00:26:23,558 --> 00:26:26,960
this is actually the charcoal in the

724
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:28,319
medium the activated charcoal and then

725
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,079
we'll take these embryos for

726
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:31,439
transformation and then leave these as

727
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:35,079
you know the source for getting more

728
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,679
embryos for for our

729
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:39,398
work so we haven't done a transformation

730
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,720
yet but we will be doing one in about

731
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:43,719
three weeks we needed to be able to bulk

732
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,000
up those sematic embryos until we had

733
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,919
enough to do a transformation and

734
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,599
according to um people I've talked with

735
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,320
and through the literature what we're

736
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:54,119
going to do is we're going to take one

737
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:56,119
gram of the Scout embryos the sematic

738
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:57,759
embryos um the more well-developed ones

739
00:26:56,119 --> 00:27:00,119
we'll take one gram of those they go

740
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:02,519
into a liquid medium for two weeks on a

741
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:05,519
Shaker and then that solution is poured

742
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:07,759
through a c the smaller embryos will go

743
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,480
back into a liquid and then we'll we'll

744
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,519
pick off those larger embryos and use

745
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,200
those for transformation we're going to

746
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,599
use an agrobacterium string called agl1

747
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,558
agl1 is what's called a hyper virulent

748
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:20,199
um Agro bacterium there are other

749
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:21,918
virulent Agro bacterium out there that

750
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,880
you can use that you can get a you know

751
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,240
transformation but what we found is with

752
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,278
some of those other virulent

753
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,200
agrobacterium that they're really

754
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,640
difficult to eliminate from culture but

755
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,880
we find that with agl1 we get a good

756
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,159
transformation efficiency we don't have

757
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,080
a problem with eliminating the bacterium

758
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,799
and it also results in a lot of plants

759
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:41,519
that are single copy so it's important

760
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:43,200
to not have multiple copies in your

761
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:46,200
transgenic lines of your introduced

762
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,798
genes and agl1 um that you know we find

763
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,519
that we get a really high number of

764
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:51,359
single copies sometimes two copies of

765
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:53,558
the introduced Gene in our plant

766
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:56,519
material so for the vector we're going

767
00:27:53,558 --> 00:27:58,480
to use the npt2 selectable marker Gene

768
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:01,200
we use gfp because we really want to

769
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,960
monitor the progress and Dennis gray

770
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,159
told me that within a week we should if

771
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,480
it worked we should be able to see the

772
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:08,840
green fluoresence protein expression and

773
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,679
then we're going to hope for the best

774
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:13,359
and and see what happens before we can

775
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:16,679
before we can move on so I I mentioned

776
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:19,479
that another method is um for doing

777
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:21,559
invitro leaves from you plant leaves

778
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,399
from invitro plants and we decided to

779
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:25,038
use this for Concord and the reason we

780
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:27,359
decided to use that for Concord is

781
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:29,919
because getting a source of IM um

782
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:32,558
immature inflores Ence was difficult

783
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:35,080
they're only at the right stage one time

784
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:37,639
per year so Gan someone in Gan Juan's

785
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:40,359
group would go out to the field to get

786
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,440
those inflorescences for us Ganan l in

787
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:44,439
itha he would drive to itha at the end

788
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,200
of the day I would meet him out front of

789
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,919
bti he would hand off a box of

790
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,278
inflorescences and we had that one shot

791
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:52,840
at getting you know trying all this

792
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:54,640
different media to get it to work so I

793
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:57,359
started looking in the literature to see

794
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,440
what else can be used and I found that

795
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:01,719
leaves can possibly use as I mentioned

796
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,159
before it's more successful for seedless

797
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,440
grapes but we're going to try it for

798
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,919
Concord and the way this works is we

799
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,320
take an A young chot from conquer plants

800
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:13,640
which actually we have now growing in

801
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:15,519
the greenhouse and then more dissecting

802
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,440
work um we go in here and take out the

803
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:21,120
small apical meristem that apil Mar

804
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,759
apical marem goes onto a medium and when

805
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,158
this plant is bigger we'll go ahead and

806
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:26,679
we'll take those leaves we'll put them

807
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,480
on in um a callous induction medium and

808
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:30,399
see if we can get embryos that way this

809
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,558
way we can have more of a supply of

810
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:36,000
material to bulk up the sematic embryos

811
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:36,000
that we need for our

812
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:39,479
Transformations okay that's great that's

813
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,440
where we're at and I'll tell you some of

814
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:46,839
the next steps later uh we're working on

815
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:49,080
Aus with anoro in um at Cornell and the

816
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:50,519
purpose is developed anog is interested

817
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:53,240
and he thinks that a community would be

818
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:55,278
interested in having um you know

819
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,000
milkweed as a model system and

820
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:58,640
transformation is an important part of

821
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,759
that being a model system

822
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,519
he identified seven different species

823
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:04,839
based on their chemical composition and

824
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:06,278
their insect interactions um so we

825
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:09,079
started with these seven different

826
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:11,480
species we really wanted to be able to

827
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:13,119
use invitro grown plants so they would

828
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,480
be clean we wouldn't have to worry about

829
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:17,759
cleaning up leaf or stem material every

830
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,519
time we wanted to do a transformation

831
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:22,158
but we couldn't get them to root the

832
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:23,798
milked just would not root in culture

833
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,840
and it used to kill me when I'd be on a

834
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:28,119
walk and I'd see a milk Reed growing in

835
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:29,720
a space between the sidewalk and a wall

836
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:31,278
I was like are you kidding me you're

837
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,679
going perfectly fine there and we can't

838
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:35,480
get you to root and culture um so I

839
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,360
could give a whole seminar on what we

840
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,759
tried um for rooting but we just we gave

841
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:41,839
up and we said all right we're going to

842
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:43,398
have to use plant material grown in a

843
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:45,918
growth chamber or a greenhouse for our

844
00:30:43,398 --> 00:30:48,439
starting material cleaning it up was a

845
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,679
challenge um it was a challenge finding

846
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,558
that that kind of sweet spot where it

847
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:54,440
cleans up the contamination but yet

848
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:56,319
doesn't kill the plant material there's

849
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,038
nothing more you know disconcerting as

850
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:00,278
coming in and seeing a fungus growing

851
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:03,679
all over your

852
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:05,638
plates okay so these are some images of

853
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,159
the species that we're working with this

854
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:08,918
is the common one that you might be

855
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:11,600
familiar with that the monarch butterfly

856
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:14,399
goes through its life cycle on this is

857
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:15,759
um a tuberosa or butterfly weed and I

858
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:17,798
think they're just they're beautiful

859
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:20,759
here's some other images I've actually

860
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:22,319
started um a milkweed Garden at home

861
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:23,158
because they're really pretty I really

862
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:25,480
like the

863
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:27,919
kurava but this is how we get to see

864
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,720
them on a daily basis um these are some

865
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,639
some of the stem pieces that are you U

866
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,278
making callus on this callus induction

867
00:31:32,638 --> 00:31:37,079
medium we use the Scopes to scan that

868
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:39,119
callus to look for the starts of plant

869
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:41,359
regeneration to make sure we're on the

870
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:43,638
right track with everything that we're

871
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:45,278
trying so when we see something like

872
00:31:43,638 --> 00:31:47,959
this we get really excited because this

873
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:50,119
is the start of um the production of

874
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,880
choots now unlike grape which is sematic

875
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:53,839
embryogenesis this is

876
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,919
organogenesis and when we see this we

877
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:56,519
know that we're you know we're getting

878
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:58,399
to that point where we could recover

879
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:59,880
plants although sometimes were fooled

880
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:01,918
and they're actually roots and that's

881
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,480
pretty disappointing but um but this was

882
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,440
pretty exciting when we after trying all

883
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,720
sorts of different methods that we came

884
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,038
up with these little these little

885
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,240
shoots so because working with seven

886
00:32:10,038 --> 00:32:14,359
different species was difficult and

887
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,759
plant tissue culture and regeneration

888
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:19,678
there's a definite genetic component to

889
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:22,720
it um you know species even closely

890
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:25,440
related species they they require

891
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,558
different um conditions and culture so

892
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,159
we decided to just focus on the three

893
00:32:27,558 --> 00:32:31,359
now um that gave us the plant

894
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:34,120
regeneration first a key part of the

895
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:36,759
medium was using an antioxidant we used

896
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:40,038
DT um we used agrobacterium strain

897
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:42,558
lba4404 this is showing some Gus

898
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:45,398
response in the cultures and we've done

899
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:46,720
some recent real Gene Transformations

900
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:49,599
where we're looking at knocking down

901
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,519
koi1 expression and koi1 is involved in

902
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:53,879
defense um and right now Amy um who

903
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:55,798
works on the project is doing

904
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,240
characterization to see how far down

905
00:32:55,798 --> 00:32:59,759
that koi one is is knocked down and then

906
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,278
we'll continue doing Transformations

907
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:03,919
with the other species the last project

908
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:06,720
I'm going to talk about is um the

909
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,480
sataria veritus project this started out

910
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,880
as a collaboration with Tom brell when

911
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,839
he was at bti and as I mentioned the

912
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,799
interest is because it's a model species

913
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:17,359
it has a small stature compared to

914
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:19,879
something like ma sorghum or sugar cane

915
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:22,319
and it's a C4

916
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:26,080
photosynthesis this is a fogy of the

917
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:28,359
grasses uh sataria viridus is here it's

918
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:30,480
a wild it's a wild relative of the

919
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:32,678
cultivated fox tail Millet and it's a

920
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,079
close relative of

921
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:36,759
switchgrass it has a lot of attributes

922
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:39,879
that make it attractive for a model

923
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:41,319
species it's a small stature you can

924
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,799
grow a lot of plants it's kind of like

925
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:46,319
the arabidopsis or the dcut world we can

926
00:33:43,798 --> 00:33:48,398
grow a lot of plants in a small area and

927
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:50,319
what really we needed at this point was

928
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:52,079
to have a transformation method worked

929
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,839
out and Tom asked me if I was interested

930
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:56,278
and I said definitely you know we'll

931
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:58,079
take on that on that challenge so what I

932
00:33:56,278 --> 00:34:00,720
did was I went to the literature first

933
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:02,480
to see um what uh if there was anything

934
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,079
reported for viridus and there wasn't

935
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,480
but there were reports for its

936
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:08,759
cultivated relative italica and they

937
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,000
started with mature seeds the only

938
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,000
problem with viritus is there's a dorcy

939
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,280
issue if the seeds are younger than 3

940
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,599
months old so we found that we had to

941
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,200
break the dormy we tried all sorts of

942
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,760
methods to break the dormy and what

943
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,678
worked out the best was removing the

944
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,000
seed coats and I'll show you in the next

945
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:28,358
couple slides how we do that the seeds

946
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,519
are then cultured on a um induction

947
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:32,559
medium we then clean up the coleoptiles

948
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:34,759
and The Roots and we transfer that to um

949
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:36,599
fresh medium and as I mentioned before

950
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,839
the importance of jelling agent when we

951
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:40,760
started out you know the italica reports

952
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:42,320
they used augur in the medium and what

953
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,079
we were getting with viridus was this

954
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,599
really sticky gelatin this

955
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:49,000
non-regenerable callus and um we just we

956
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,240
what we really wanted was this more

957
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,320
defined callus and I knew from my

958
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:55,678
experience prior experience with monot

959
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,240
that sometimes a gel and gum in this

960
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,400
case phyto gel actually works and when

961
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:02,679
we switched to that phyto gel we

962
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,920
recovered more of this more well-defined

963
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:06,879
regenerable callus you couldn't ask for

964
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,159
anything better for plant regeneration

965
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,400
just about every piece of callus

966
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:12,358
regenerates multiple choots we took one

967
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,480
choot and put it on rooting medium it

968
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:16,639
rooted well it tillered a lot and you

969
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,960
know it grew just fine so we knew that

970
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:20,719
we were now ready to do plant

971
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,800
transformation so as I mentioned to

972
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,919
remove the seed coats um we came up with

973
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,560
this nearly simple but it works um we

974
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,519
took a tray we have a rubber St ster we

975
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:32,719
got some rid plastic material out of my

976
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:34,759
kitchen drawers and we take put the

977
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:36,598
seeds and we rub that rubber stopper

978
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,119
over the seeds we were concerned that

979
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:39,838
maybe we would break a lot of the seeds

980
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:43,039
and wouldn't get good germination but we

981
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:45,078
got close to 100% germination and then

982
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:47,279
this is where more patients comes in

983
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:48,680
those seeds are um selected away from

984
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,119
those that have the seed coats and this

985
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:54,759
is what we use for the callous induction

986
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:57,640
medium for the transformation we started

987
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:01,000
with use this Vector this Vector has a

988
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:03,920
Gene for hygromycin resistance npt2 and

989
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,639
canamy don't work that well for monocots

990
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,760
as compared to dicots we infect the

991
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:12,199
callus with the agrobacterium they then

992
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,760
go to a selective regeneration medium

993
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:16,199
that has hygromycin in it this is a very

994
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,920
happy day in the lab when we have this

995
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:20,838
is our non-transformed control we put it

996
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,720
in gust no blue but when we put one of

997
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:24,838
the putative transformance into Gus

998
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:27,000
solution it turned blue and this is

999
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:29,119
showing some Leaf material from a a

1000
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,318
control did not turn blue and this is

1001
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,960
some these are some leaves from some

1002
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:34,800
older uh transgenic lines now as I

1003
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,440
mentioned we use that selectable marker

1004
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,079
Gene because if we didn't this is what

1005
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,760
we would end up with after we did a

1006
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:42,720
transformation so we would have to

1007
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,920
analyze a lot of plants in order to find

1008
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:48,159
these precious few that are are really

1009
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,838
transformed we wanted to see if we could

1010
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:52,719
get this to persist into the Next

1011
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:54,599
Generation so we um took some we let

1012
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:56,679
some of those transgenic lines go on to

1013
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:58,440
make seed grew them in the greenhouse

1014
00:36:56,679 --> 00:37:01,598
harvested that next generation which is

1015
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,838
called the T1 AUM for Gus solution for

1016
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,400
Gus with using the aate solution and you

1017
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:09,559
can see again non-transformed control

1018
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:13,599
and Gus expression in those

1019
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:16,078
pry so it's um this is a timeline for

1020
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,400
how long the whole process takes from

1021
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,920
culturing the seed on callous medium to

1022
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,639
having seeds harvested from your

1023
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,519
transgenic lines takes about 21 weeks

1024
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:27,358
but if we had that callus already we

1025
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:29,599
could cut off six weeks off that process

1026
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:32,838
and with monocot it's really difficult

1027
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:34,359
to maintain callus long term and still

1028
00:37:32,838 --> 00:37:36,279
have it maintain that high

1029
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:38,078
regenerability and when you do get

1030
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,200
regenerants you sometimes see a large

1031
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:43,519
percentage of albinos because the

1032
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:45,598
transposons are activated but we um

1033
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:47,480
we've decided to try it with sataria and

1034
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,000
so far what we've seen is we're just

1035
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,240
testing taking callus keeping it

1036
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,079
longterm and putting it on regeneration

1037
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:55,239
medium and it seems to be acting

1038
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:57,519
differently than maze or rice callus and

1039
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:59,159
that we're not seeing that hit on plant

1040
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:01,960
generation and now we're going to try

1041
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:03,639
some of that longer term callus on um

1042
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,119
for

1043
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:07,279
transformation okay so um I'm not I

1044
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,559
didn't go into I'm not going to talk

1045
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,480
about I have time to talk about our

1046
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:14,279
crisper work in sataria but we have um

1047
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,240
tried the genome editing by targeting

1048
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:19,000
this flowering time Gene called

1049
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:21,519
indeterminant one and what you can see

1050
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,400
here is that these are the controls

1051
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:26,159
empty Vector no Target in them and these

1052
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,559
are two lines that were recovered you

1053
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:29,719
can see there's a definite difference

1054
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:30,960
and the flowering time so that was you

1055
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:32,838
know a really good indication

1056
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,318
phenotypically that we hit the right

1057
00:38:32,838 --> 00:38:37,679
Gene and it it's working and all the pro

1058
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:39,960
all the lines now both the primary ones

1059
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:42,358
and progyny are being analyzed to see

1060
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,679
what types of mutations we had and the

1061
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:46,239
and the frequency on know so that that

1062
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:48,118
was been it's been a lot of fun working

1063
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:50,719
with the crisper cast 9

1064
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:53,000
systems so in summary I hope I've

1065
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:54,519
impressed upon you all the work that it

1066
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,318
takes um sometimes people don't

1067
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:57,759
appreciate it and we you we do a

1068
00:38:56,318 --> 00:38:58,920
transformation service and like what's

1069
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,280
taking so long how come we don't have

1070
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,800
our plants I me that's rare but you know

1071
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,920
there really is a lot of work that goes

1072
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,240
into the system I have a great group

1073
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,358
they're very patient they're very

1074
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:11,199
creative and that's why we are

1075
00:39:08,358 --> 00:39:13,000
successful in in what we do so for the

1076
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:16,118
next steps

1077
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,358
um for grape we are going to do I

1078
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:20,440
mentioned the transformation with gfp as

1079
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:21,598
soon as we have enough embryos from

1080
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,639
Concord we're going to try

1081
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,079
transformation of Concord for the

1082
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:28,679
esclipus we'll you know characterize

1083
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,519
those koi one um knockdown lines and

1084
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:32,000
we're trying to recover more of those so

1085
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:34,400
we can have different levels of

1086
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,239
expression and different transgenics um

1087
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,000
improve the rooting and soil we've given

1088
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:40,318
up on initro rooting and we're looking

1089
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,318
at rooting in soil it's not great but

1090
00:39:40,318 --> 00:39:44,358
it's better than what it used to be and

1091
00:39:42,318 --> 00:39:47,000
we're also starting to work on the other

1092
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:48,559
species of of the seven species for

1093
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,639
sataria viritus we're actually looking

1094
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:52,799
at other accessions besides the

1095
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:55,598
a10.1 because you know I mentioned that

1096
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,079
there's a genetic component to um plant

1097
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,838
regeneration and also for transformation

1098
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,359
and that we feel that if we can find

1099
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:03,799
another accession where we can get

1100
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:05,759
higher than 5 to 20% transformation

1101
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,400
efficiency that would make it more high

1102
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,720
throughput for us and as you know we're

1103
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,760
looking at the long-term callous

1104
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:13,838
maintenance so that we can cut off about

1105
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,280
six weeks off the process and we're

1106
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:18,279
going to expand our genome editing um

1107
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,920
efforts so right now we're just using it

1108
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,519
for mutagenesis to knock out genes but

1109
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,599
we're looking at some of the new crisper

1110
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:26,559
technologies that have come along to

1111
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:29,280
activate endogenous genes and do some

1112
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:31,039
Gene replac basement in those systems

1113
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,040
and we're doing that both in sataria and

1114
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:35,800
in tomato as well so with that um I have

1115
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:37,880
acknowledgements this is my group who

1116
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,960
make it all possible they're they're

1117
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:43,880
great um patient and just put up with

1118
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,639
some of my crazy ideas uh Cornell um Amy

1119
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,400
is working with an Hog's group she works

1120
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:50,118
with us as well she's very talented um

1121
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,358
this is Gan Juan's group who've been

1122
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:54,599
helping us with the grape uh the group

1123
00:40:52,358 --> 00:40:56,799
at Danford Center and in Minnesota have

1124
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:58,280
been involved in the crisper work with

1125
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,240
satar

1126
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,800
and I um have a collaboration with the

1127
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:04,719
group at the John inis Center and we're

1128
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,359
some of that funding has helped support

1129
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:08,078
our Improvement of sataria because we're

1130
00:41:06,358 --> 00:41:10,078
using sataria as a model for that

1131
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,360
project and these are the sources of

1132
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:17,240
funding for our group and thank you

1133
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:19,680
[Applause]

1134
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:22,318
guys um

1135
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:23,960
medicago takes a long time to go from

1136
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:25,719
start to finish that's one of the most

1137
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,800
difficult parts and there's one genotype

1138
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:31,879
that works best um so in the beginning

1139
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,400
we had some problems because um they

1140
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,920
were recommending one of the groups is

1141
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:38,160
recommending using this eha 105 super

1142
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,760
virulent Agri bacterium and we lost a

1143
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:42,639
lot of material from overgrowth but when

1144
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,400
we switched to agl1 we're able to

1145
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:45,480
eliminate that so as long as you're

1146
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,480
working with that one particular

1147
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,318
genotype and you're willing to wait for

1148
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:54,039
quite a while it um it's it's workable

1149
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:56,599
it's doable not as easy as tomato um but

1150
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:59,880
um but doable Randy you know what it is

1151
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:59,880
about the different jelly

1152
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:05,559
media yeah um you know I basically what

1153
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:08,239
I've seen in the reports it's it's a

1154
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:12,039
chemical composition but also a physical

1155
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:14,679
composition to it ability uh exactly

1156
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:18,318
like like um jite one of the gelang gel

1157
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:21,199
gelang gums um it needs to it binds the

1158
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:23,440
dilic cation magnesium and calcium in

1159
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:25,118
order to gel and I learned this the hard

1160
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,519
way when I was a graduate student and I

1161
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,800
was trying some experiments with the

1162
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:30,280
gelling agent I thought why should I

1163
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,839
make up a whole batch of salt you know

1164
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,960
medium with salts in it I'll just use

1165
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:35,318
water and the gelling agent and I

1166
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,639
couldn't get it to gel I was like why

1167
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:38,920
isn't it gelling augre gels in water and

1168
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:40,318
then when I did some more searching I

1169
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,599
found out that you do need some of the

1170
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:46,400
salts in there um and something like

1171
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:49,079
tomato is does not do well on the gel

1172
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,480
and gums because it doesn't have those

1173
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:53,480
calcium and magnesium ions available to

1174
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,519
it so we end up having to use an augre

1175
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,318
based for that but again it's a chemical

1176
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:59,039
and a physical a lot of it has to do

1177
00:42:57,318 --> 00:43:02,000
with concentration you know we look at

1178
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:04,960
that also not just a

1179
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,358
type with regard to your charcoal I can

1180
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,280
say why you put that in to pull out some

1181
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:11,799
of the phenolics but doesn't it also

1182
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,640
bind some of the hormone material it

1183
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,318
does right so if we're if we're working

1184
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:18,400
with the medium and we see that you know

1185
00:43:15,318 --> 00:43:20,239
IAA works really well I'm sorry sorry

1186
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,960
I'm sorry so um so Peter was wondering

1187
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:23,479
he asked about the activated charcoal

1188
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,960
that it can also bind some of the

1189
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,358
hormones in the medium and it does so we

1190
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,800
find that you know we'll work out a

1191
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:31,039
system and we find out that something

1192
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,160
like IA a certain concentration works

1193
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:34,719
really well but if we then decide oh

1194
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:36,078
there's some Browning or we want rooting

1195
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:39,318
and we switch to using activated

1196
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,559
charcoal we don't see the same response

1197
00:43:39,318 --> 00:43:42,279
as we did with the original

1198
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,000
concentration so then we have to bump

1199
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:48,079
that up and look at other concentrations

1200
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:50,280
so yeah it can have an effect I ask does

1201
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,359
the Maro butterfly feed on any of

1202
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:54,319
species of milk weed that you're doing

1203
00:43:52,358 --> 00:43:56,440
and I asked because they saying my

1204
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:57,759
butterflies are declining because people

1205
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,280
are destroying

1206
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,599
milked in their in their in their home

1207
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,839
oh okay yeah I don't know if it does on

1208
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:06,280
other other milk weeds I know that it

1209
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:08,239
uses that one primarily but I don't know

1210
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,119
I don't know about the others but but

1211
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:12,239
I'm planting it in my garden now so I'm

1212
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:13,880
trying to I'm trying to help out and and

1213
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:15,239
we'll see but yeah they're very pretty

1214
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,358
they're very beautiful but think people

1215
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:19,879
think you know it can be a weed but um

1216
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:22,519
in some Gardens but um the guy across

1217
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:25,079
the street has wild milk weed and it's

1218
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:27,480
just spewing the white stuff all over oh

1219
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:30,079
yeah it can be pretty messy too I don't

1220
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:33,719
but anything for the mon yeah that's

1221
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:35,640
right yeah exactly so jyn is asking

1222
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:36,959
about pyy level in the plant material

1223
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:38,799
and when we go through that callus and

1224
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,440
regeneration can that have an effect in

1225
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,400
the end product and yes it can and some

1226
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,000
plant species are more prone to it than

1227
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,880
others so you'll see I think something

1228
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,960
like pineapple where you'll see more of

1229
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,160
a platy problem in regeneration and

1230
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,679
transformation than some other systems

1231
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:54,039
but um what some what some people are

1232
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:55,799
doing is looking at doing chromosome

1233
00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:58,039
counts or doing some sort of an analysis

1234
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,920
to see what the py level is is in the in

1235
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:01,759
the resulting plants so so you have to

1236
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,800
be aware of that for some plant species

1237
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:07,160
because it can it can be an issue ises

1238
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,720
that answer your question is it yeah

1239
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:12,239
kind of a followup do you ever use

1240
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:14,358
pollen to get a halfway cam we do so I

1241
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:15,838
didn't talk about that but we have done

1242
00:45:14,358 --> 00:45:18,000
um you know cultures to be able to get

1243
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:20,318
haid material and using pollen or

1244
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,800
culturing anthers at a certain stage of

1245
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:23,639
where the pollen development so we we

1246
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,839
did we had a project with rice where we

1247
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:27,799
were developing haids and actually I was

1248
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:29,719
talking with um a great reader just

1249
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,200
yesterday who asked me if we would

1250
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:33,078
consider doing that with grape is

1251
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:35,199
looking at haploids for grape because

1252
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:37,519
and using a pollen system because you

1253
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:39,159
grape is such a heterozygous um material

1254
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:40,920
it makes it difficult but for both

1255
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:42,639
sequencing and for doing their work but

1256
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,559
if they had a Hao type grape that it

1257
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:47,078
would really help Advance their work so

1258
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:49,319
so yes definitely that that'll take some

1259
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:52,160
work to try to get that

1260
00:45:49,318 --> 00:45:56,199
out don't any maze

1261
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:58,239
orice I did maze is an undergraduate um

1262
00:45:56,199 --> 00:46:02,199
and um that was enough of an exposure to

1263
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:03,919
maze no um the the pro um so actually

1264
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:06,679
yeah sataria now but actually was

1265
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,318
actually I kind of enjoyed it because we

1266
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:10,199
um at certain times of the year they

1267
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:11,800
would pull everybody in into a lab it

1268
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:14,279
was an undergraduate you know work study

1269
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:17,359
student and um from for Maze the

1270
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,839
starting material are immature embryos

1271
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:20,719
from and you have to have the plants at

1272
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:23,558
a certain stage to have these immature

1273
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:25,639
ears and then what you do is you cut the

1274
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:27,359
um kernels and you go in you scoop out

1275
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:29,440
the little immature embryo and it

1276
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:30,440
depends on how it's you know oriented

1277
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,440
that you'll get the right type of

1278
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:34,880
callous and when we started our

1279
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:36,720
transformation service someone David

1280
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,358
Stern said what about doing maze I said

1281
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:40,639
oh that's really tricky because you

1282
00:46:38,358 --> 00:46:43,639
basically have to dedicate Greenhouse

1283
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:45,358
space to have the plants to be able to

1284
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:47,879
do get your ears to get your immature

1285
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:49,799
embryos so it kind of becomes a you know

1286
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:52,559
financially difficult space difficult to

1287
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,920
be able to do maze um so you know and

1288
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,519
sometimes you grow those plants and you

1289
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,358
don't have any requests for doing the

1290
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:59,920
Transformations but you need to have

1291
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:01,960
that constant supply of ears so what's

1292
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:05,440
the difference between ma in CIA then if

1293
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,639
you can use CIA just the seed not from

1294
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,838
yeah it's something genetic and

1295
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:12,078
physiological about about maze versus

1296
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:14,199
Saria yes and rice and rice um you can

1297
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,760
start with mature seed so mature seed

1298
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:19,399
you culture it like um sataria and you

1299
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:21,480
get that you know um you know you get

1300
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,599
that embryogenic callus from it someone

1301
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:26,519
asked me have you considered doing

1302
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:28,480
immature embryos from sataria you saw

1303
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:30,159
how those seeds are and I said I think

1304
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,519
I'd have a mutiny on my hands in the lab

1305
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:33,440
if I asked people to take immature

1306
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:35,039
embryos out of those small seeds but

1307
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,240
fortunately like rice the mature seeds

1308
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:40,000
forar works you been asked to do Rice we

1309
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:42,000
um did yeah we just did rice as part of

1310
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,039
an NSF project a number of years ago but

1311
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,480
I I haven't been asked um otherwise here

1312
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:48,159
big deal yeah so nobody has asked us to

1313
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,760
do it so so and what we did when we you

1314
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:51,440
know when David asked me to start up the

1315
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,200
transformation service is part of my

1316
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,960
research program um I talked with the

1317
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:57,639
project leaders at bti and I said what

1318
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,159
are you interested in you know what you

1319
00:47:57,639 --> 00:48:01,078
know what type of crops would be

1320
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:02,838
important for you and we based it on

1321
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:04,079
their interest first and since that time

1322
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:06,679
we've done work for people with like

1323
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:08,318
Cornell and also outside of Cornell um

1324
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:10,838
but rice hasn't been one of those that

1325
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:12,639
we've done you know um I can't remember

1326
00:48:10,838 --> 00:48:15,558
which species it was where you used the

1327
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:17,400
fil

1328
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:21,160
yes

1329
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:23,358
grap is there any particular sell that's

1330
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:25,118
giving rise I'm sure there is I just

1331
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:27,719
don't know if anyone has looked at it

1332
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:30,039
because like in in rice um they've shown

1333
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:32,480
and in in maze as well it's the skellum

1334
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:33,920
where the callus originates from so I'm

1335
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,599
I'm sure there's got to be a particular

1336
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,760
cell type in that connective tissue the

1337
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:40,318
reason I asked too is because um when I

1338
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,599
want my students to look at myotic

1339
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:45,039
chromosomes but we fail because we don't

1340
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:47,200
have the right State what we can always

1341
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:50,039
look at are the shape of the nuclei in

1342
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:51,199
the fil they're so different there's

1343
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:54,000
such a

1344
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:55,679
variety oh that's interesting mhm yeah

1345
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,239
so there must be something to that a

1346
00:48:55,679 --> 00:49:01,399
great Cor out in left field but in in

1347
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:04,078
March it was announced that all

1348
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:06,160
cultivated sweet potatoes have the genes

1349
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:08,599
for aggro bacterium in them I was

1350
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:11,480
thrilled and the wild ones don't so

1351
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:14,079
there must and it was they thought it's

1352
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:17,920
thousands of years ago that it got

1353
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:20,920
infected what possible Advantage could

1354
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,680
that agrobacterium have I agree I wonder

1355
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,318
the same you know what you know what was

1356
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:25,879
it through you not the wild species but

1357
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:29,519
the more cultiv oh sorry I'm sorry I'm

1358
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:32,200
sorry um I get so excited um there was a

1359
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:34,159
there's um there was a recent paper that

1360
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:36,118
showed um actually it's from the

1361
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:38,078
international potato Center where they

1362
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:40,079
were looking at sweet potato and doing

1363
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:42,039
you know um kind of transcription

1364
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:44,798
profiling to find out and they found

1365
00:49:42,039 --> 00:49:46,279
sequences from Agri bacterium in some of

1366
00:49:44,798 --> 00:49:49,838
the sweet potatoes I think I tested like

1367
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:51,798
300 different types of sweet potato1 291

1368
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:54,400
and that was every variety that they

1369
00:49:51,798 --> 00:49:56,759
tested that was a cultivated variety but

1370
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,599
not the wild one so there must have been

1371
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,720
some you know I don't know if the

1372
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:03,318
cultivated ones or this Wild Ones had

1373
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:05,039
some sort of resistance to the infection

1374
00:50:03,318 --> 00:50:07,000
cultivated ones that resistance broke

1375
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:08,358
down um and then they were infected I

1376
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,440
don't know if there's an evolutionary

1377
00:50:08,358 --> 00:50:11,960
benefit you know for the for the Agro

1378
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,480
bacterium and the wild sweet potato and

1379
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:15,519
the cultivated but um I got you know I

1380
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,599
was happy because I thought okay what

1381
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:19,000
are they going to do about GMOs now you

1382
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,599
know with sweet potatoes and they have

1383
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,079
these components of agrobacterium how

1384
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:23,599
are they going to classify how are they

1385
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,280
going to classify that so but it was

1386
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:28,240
interesting incorp the genome one yeah

1387
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:31,680
mhm yeah it's incorporated into the

1388
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:36,318
genome it's true for mistl toes and

1389
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:39,118
Oaks right mistl toes really there's um

1390
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:43,679
at least five different uh segments of

1391
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:46,280
the oak host that's now integrated into

1392
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:48,358
the missile toe genome oh interesting

1393
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:52,720
and it it might be this kind of notion

1394
00:50:48,358 --> 00:50:55,480
of recognizing s and

1395
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:57,039
immunological yeah that could be oh

1396
00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:00,480
that's a question how easy sweet

1397
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:02,199
potatoes to transform them should be

1398
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,679
think it' be easy just get the tuber mix

1399
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:06,000
it with aggro you're done oh guess you

1400
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:07,558
to get plants back from it um but um but

1401
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,239
we haven't worked with sweet potato but

1402
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:11,880
you I think certain species are easier

1403
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:12,838
than others but might be more amenable

1404
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:17,240
to

1405
00:51:12,838 --> 00:51:17,239
it okay well thank you everyone

1406
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:24,400
thanks this has been a production of
