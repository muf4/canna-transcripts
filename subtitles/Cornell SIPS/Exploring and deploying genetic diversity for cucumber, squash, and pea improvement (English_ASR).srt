1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:09,240
[Applause]

3
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:11,439
University all right well good morning

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,320
uh it's great to be back uh again after

5
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:16,000
almost a year away uh this morning uh

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,399
I'll be sharing some of the highlights

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,759
of the work uh that I've done as a PhD

8
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:23,079
student over the last six years uh these

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,599
are I'll be covering three different

10
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:26,839
projects that uh are fairly unrelated uh

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,079
the first two in a little more depth

12
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:32,320
than the last one just very briefly um

13
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:35,039
specifically I'll be talking about the

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,840
progress that we've done to uh develop

15
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,759
cucumbers with resistance to Downey

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,920
mildew which is the uh most widespread

17
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:44,558
and devastating disease on cucumbers uh

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,120
in the US and around the world uh then

19
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,919
I'll be sharing some of the work we've

20
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:50,759
been we've done to uh map the major

21
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,600
powdery mildew resistance Locus and

22
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,960
squash which is one of the most widely

23
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,280
used genes uh in squash breeding but uh

24
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,878
which to date uh didn't have any markers

25
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,640
available for it uh and last lastly uh

26
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,280
I'll briefly talk about a collaborative

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,118
effort we've been doing with the USDA uh

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,560
to develop some genomic resources for an

29
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:13,640
important USDA uh PE core collection

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,920
that's used by uh PE breeders not only

31
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,960
uh in North America but around the

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,040
world so uh first off I'll talk about uh

33
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,118
the work we've done in cucumbers uh I

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,600
was really got involved in this project

35
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:28,200
from day one uh and this project was

36
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:30,519
started uh in response to an urgent need

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,920
from the Cucumber industry uh to solve a

38
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:35,078
new disease crisis and I say new not

39
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,879
because Downey milde is new in cucumbers

40
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:40,158
because uh it had been around since the

41
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,798
1800s but uh for many decades Growers

42
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,118
had never really had to worry about dowy

43
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:45,479
Milo at all uh and that's in large part

44
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:48,159
thanks to the efforts of breeders here

45
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:50,239
at Cornell and um Wisconsin and Clemson

46
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,920
and some other places at really

47
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:55,000
developing uh robust disease resistance

48
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,920
packages in cucumber uh including to

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,718
Downey

50
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,399
mildew well that all Came Crashing Down

51
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,959
uh right around 2000 6 uh and you can

52
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:05,359
see from this headline in the American

53
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,478
vegetable grower magazine an old enemy

54
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,878
reemerges uh suddenly Growers were

55
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:12,878
seeing what to many of them was almost a

56
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:15,878
new disease uh many were not uh really

57
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:19,120
sure what it was um but it came in a

58
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:20,759
very quick and dramatic fashion uh so

59
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,719
here you can see some of the symptoms of

60
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:26,679
Downey mildew on cucumbers uh Downey

61
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:30,598
milu uh you'll often see Downey Milo

62
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:32,640
first uh characterized by angular

63
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:35,280
chlorotic lesions it's a folar disease

64
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:38,359
so you see it on the leaves and and

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,158
those uh chlorotic areas eventually

66
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,480
coales and turn necrotic until you have

67
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:45,919
total plant death and the time that you

68
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,598
first see a chotic lesion on one leaf of

69
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,839
a plant to the time it's completely dead

70
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,679
and crispy uh can be as little as 3

71
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,640
weeks without any sort of intervention

72
00:02:51,680 --> 00:03:01,280
so uh it happens uh really really really

73
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:03,199
quickly and uh in 2006 alone uh it it

74
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,799
was just caused devastating production

75
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,238
losses individual states were reporting

76
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:09,439
losses and tens of millions of dollars

77
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:11,640
and you know that's a pretty big deal

78
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:15,719
considering the total production value

79
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:15,719
uh in the US is around $350

80
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:24,239
million so uh another reason this was uh

81
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:26,598
such uh a bad disease was that uh Donnie

82
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,480
Milo was present is is aerially

83
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:33,560
dispersed uh by asexual zoospores it's

84
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:36,238
an old my seat and uh it can travel for

85
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,360
hundreds of miles so uh in the time in

86
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,878
the 3-we span that your plant is dying

87
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,680
uh the pathogen can uh reproduce from an

88
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:46,798
initial Spore Landing to to producing

89
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,799
millions of spores in 10 days those can

90
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,040
travel to nearby plants nearby farms and

91
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,879
uh if the wind is Right hundreds or even

92
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:56,878
thousands of miles away in some cases

93
00:03:54,878 --> 00:04:00,000
and it's not a pathogen that over

94
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:02,919
winners um in cold places but it will

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,158
over winter in um Southern Florida where

96
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:08,759
they don't have a frost and it marches

97
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:11,120
up the coast uh as spring temperatures

98
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,878
get warmer uh which also happens to

99
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,399
coincide when people are planting their

100
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:19,439
cucumbers and uh 90% of cucumber

101
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,279
production is in eastern states in kind

102
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,000
of this area where you see um the Downey

103
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:26,559
Milo and and to give you an idea all of

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,959
these green and blue spots are uh areas

105
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,120
that at one time or another throughout

106
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:31,239
the season uh reported dowy mil do and

107
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,840
these are just the areas where it's

108
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,800
reported uh pretty much you can fill in

109
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:39,719
that whole map in the eastern US of

110
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:42,840
where the disease actually was but um

111
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,080
for uh 90% of production in eastern

112
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,638
states of pickling cucumbers Michigan is

113
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:49,800
a big place uh in Florida North Carolina

114
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,439
and Wisconsin are important and for

115
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,160
slicers Florida Georgia and North

116
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:56,918
Carolina so these places get dowy M do

117
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,919
extremely early in the season uh in the

118
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:02,198
in the North Atlantic area and the Great

119
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:04,399
Lakes region uh where we are uh we also

120
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:07,759
have a onew punch not only from disease

121
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:09,519
coming up from the South but also from

122
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,280
green houses and hot houses that have

123
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,279
cucumber production all year

124
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:16,359
round so there's really no escaping this

125
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:18,279
disease if you grow cucumbers you will

126
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,240
have Donnie mildew on your

127
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:25,079
cucumbers so not surprisingly uh in 2008

128
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,840
there was a survey uh from basically for

129
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:28,279
basically everybody involved in the

130
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:30,599
Cucumber industry and one of the

131
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:33,159
questions was what can public research

132
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,639
institutions do and not surprisingly uh

133
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,960
Downey M do research was ranked the

134
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,160
number one priority um we need to find

135
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,519
fungicides we need to develop resistance

136
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,720
we need to develop forecasting protocols

137
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:47,079
anything related to Downey mildew so in

138
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,520
response to that uh we started a

139
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:51,800
breeding program uh the first thing we

140
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,599
had to figure out was is there any sort

141
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,560
of acceptable resistance out there right

142
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,360
now so uh and and this was the year

143
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,000
before I joined so I can't take credit

144
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,720
for this but um Michael and company

145
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,839
started this uh effort with uh looking

146
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,720
at USDA accessions looking at heirlooms

147
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:12,799
uh going back into the Cornell seed

148
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,919
voles pulling out old lines that at one

149
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,720
time uh were reported to have dowy maer

150
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:19,079
resistance and just growing really as

151
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,400
many things as we could uh with as many

152
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:25,439
tips and as much data as we could um uh

153
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:30,198
dig up and what we found was that there

154
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:31,639
were no Cult of ours that had uh

155
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,400
what would even approach acceptable

156
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:38,240
levels of resistance but we did find a

157
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:40,239
few um old varieties air looms and some

158
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,160
of the lines that had been developed at

159
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,000
Cornell in the past that had um more

160
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,000
resistance than none they might hold on

161
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,240
a week two weeks three weeks longer than

162
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,560
the most susceptible cultivar so we

163
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,759
decided that was the point where we were

164
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,038
going to start we were going to start

165
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,960
Crossing some of those together and see

166
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,120
uh if we could develop anything with

167
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,560
Superior

168
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,280
resistance and as as 2010 uh we had

169
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,680
great promise so this is an F2

170
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:10,198
population of a cross between two of

171
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,560
those uh moderately resistant lines and

172
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,079
most things out in the field were dead

173
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,038
but every once in a while we came across

174
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:18,159
a plant that uh looked pretty good now

175
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:19,759
in this season uh we weren't to a point

176
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,360
yet where we had great resistance

177
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,639
everything died by the end of the season

178
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,720
but uh you can you can clearly see

179
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,840
there's there's a difference there and

180
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,319
uh when we grew out the parents uh

181
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:32,399
individuals did much better than the

182
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,280
parents which indicated to us that we

183
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,638
were actually combining genes from these

184
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,799
various sources so uh we were on the

185
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,199
right

186
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,840
track so our general breeding strategy

187
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,158
from that point forward was basically to

188
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,439
plant large populations into heavy

189
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:48,439
pathogen pressure in this area Downey

190
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:50,839
mildew comes in or the dowy mildew

191
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:52,839
pathogen I should say comes in uh Late

192
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:55,399
July early August so that's when we

193
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:57,038
wanted to plant um and we wanted to

194
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:58,638
plant young plants in the field so that

195
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,038
when we were doing disease ratings we

196
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,000
didn't have to worry about any

197
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:03,759
complicating effects from natural plants

198
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,879
in essence you know if a plant was

199
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,639
turning necrotic dying we knew it was

200
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,400
from Downey

201
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,680
mildew uh we harvested fruit regularly

202
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:15,679
uh so that we didn't have any fruit load

203
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,199
effects compounding uh resistance we

204
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,560
piled them by the plant so that we could

205
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,680
get you know a rough plant-by-plant

206
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,839
yield estimate uh we would flag early

207
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,918
selections we had harsh selection

208
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,758
intensity at the beginning of the

209
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,079
program uh the pathogen really did all

210
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,000
the the work for us you know there

211
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,559
wasn't there weren't many things alive

212
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,479
at the end of the season as we uh

213
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,518
increased the frequency of resistance LS

214
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,719
in our population we got to the point

215
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,519
where everything was surviving to the

216
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:45,120
end of the season so we uh continued to

217
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:48,000
select the best of the best and we we

218
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,278
did all phenotypic selection uh and

219
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,720
found that the Downey M resistance was

220
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:54,879
highly heritable and that our phenotypic

221
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,278
values were very predictive of the

222
00:08:54,879 --> 00:09:00,838
breeding value uh and the performance of

223
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:03,600
the uh line in future

224
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,279
years we took cuttings uh there was

225
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,320
simply no time for pollinations in the

226
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,600
field before Frost so we would take uh

227
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,720
cuting from the field and bring them

228
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,800
into the greenhouse to advance the

229
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,360
generations uh which was very easily

230
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:18,399
done with cucumbers you just slice off a

231
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,879
growing tip stick it in some media make

232
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:24,200
sure it stays warm and moist and you can

233
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:27,159
have 90% rooting uh or even

234
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,079
better and at first we did uh a pedigree

235
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:32,159
selection approach as is very common in

236
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:33,559
cuc C breeding programs but then added a

237
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,958
recurrent selection approach with some

238
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:38,879
intermating in the greenhouse which uh

239
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:40,119
we needed to capture and retain all of

240
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,159
the resistance alals that we were

241
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,200
bringing in together um because there

242
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:47,759
was just too many to capture with

243
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,839
moderate size populations uh in the

244
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:54,639
field so by 2012 we had some lines that

245
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:58,880
we were ready to trial uh up top is DMR

246
00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:02,319
n264 which was our uh top uh breeding

247
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:06,078
line and below it are the two parents so

248
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,680
uh 264 stayed green uh all the way till

249
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,919
Frost produced fruit all the way till

250
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,639
Frost uh you can see here that it was

251
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,958
doing better than its parents which

252
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:17,000
would eventually die uh in the course of

253
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:19,278
the season and all this compared with

254
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,159
one of our susceptible checks uh

255
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:24,320
piccalino which uh died almost right out

256
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,240
of the gate and this is very uh typical

257
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,240
of a lot of cultivars that Growers were

258
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,759
growing you just whisper the words dowy

259
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:36,919
mil do and they you know

260
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:41,120
Wilt um here is 264 again with uh two

261
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:45,078
cultivars that were identified in um the

262
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:48,278
late 2000s so uh some folks at North

263
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:50,479
Carolina did some trials to figure out

264
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:52,078
uh were was there any resistance in

265
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,600
cultivars they included over 80

266
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:57,559
cultivars that uh Growers were commonly

267
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,800
using at the time or were historically

268
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:04,638
important and these two

269
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:06,519
uh made it to the top of the list so uh

270
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,000
this was the most resistant single-ear

271
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:09,480
multi-state cultivar and this was the

272
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,440
most resistant multi-year multi-state

273
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:16,399
cultivar so uh as you can see they're

274
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,800
not very good uh to to Really highlight

275
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:23,278
that uh there were no uh options for

276
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:25,039
Growers uh at this time so and I should

277
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:26,360
say in the trial these were not reported

278
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,719
to be very good either they were just

279
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,959
the best of the worst um you know they

280
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,759
they acknowledg that yeah these aren't

281
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,119
very good but you know they might

282
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:37,240
survive a week

283
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,839
longer we also included uh they did

284
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,720
another study uh looking at all the USDA

285
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,800
accessions and there was one that stood

286
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:47,519
out uh this Pi 19788 that we also

287
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:49,838
included in our trial and it it held up

288
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,159
pretty well uh it had very similar

289
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,240
levels of resistance to some of our top

290
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:58,600
lines um but resistance is about the

291
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:01,000
only thing you can say for it uh it's a

292
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,800
wild accession that was collected in

293
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,240
India um as far as I know nobody really

294
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:10,559
eats it or would want to it's this very

295
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,720
uh netted Hollow bitter fruit that is on

296
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:17,399
a plant that has a lot of sticky sap and

297
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:21,959
is highly male and is late to flower so

298
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:23,440
um it has a lot of really negative uh

299
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:26,000
agronomic and Horticultural

300
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,320
characteristics that uh we didn't have

301
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,480
to deal with by not using it uh right

302
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,480
the

303
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:36,879
gate so one thing we were really

304
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:40,320
interested in is uh do we have high

305
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:43,159
enough level of resistance to uh reduce

306
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,879
or even avoid the use of fungicides

307
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:48,519
because this was a huge deal for Growers

308
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:51,720
um I have a case example here Michigan

309
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:54,198
grows uh 30,000 Acres of

310
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,360
cucumber they were spending uh Growers

311
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:59,278
collectively were spending $6.4 million

312
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:02,079
a year on fungicide on cucurbits most of

313
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:04,838
that was for uh fungicides for Downey

314
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:07,159
mildew on cucumber and uh this was

315
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,199
costing Growers up to $600 an acre which

316
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,719
was uh completely eliminating the

317
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:13,479
profitability for a lot of them and they

318
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,560
really had no choice on the fungicides

319
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,639
they used uh because Downey mildew uh

320
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:19,919
had overcome so many fungicides they

321
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,799
were forced to use the latest and

322
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:26,519
greatest most expensive and because it

323
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:28,278
uh reproduces so quickly and is so

324
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:31,000
virulent they were spraying on a weekly

325
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:33,360
basis and spraying even before the

326
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,120
pathogen uh came into the area because

327
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,839
once you see it you know it's game over

328
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,078
and even with uh fungicides you know

329
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:42,959
they were gaining uh or they are I

330
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:44,958
should say you know uh fungicides are

331
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,198
still important they gained some time

332
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:50,919
and often it is enough time to to get a

333
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:52,838
harvest but uh Growers really want uh

334
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:54,719
something resistance that they can add

335
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:57,199
to their fungicide

336
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,278
programs so what we did was we did a

337
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:03,078
split plot trial where we had four uh

338
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:05,278
cultigens we had two cultivars uh a

339
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:07,879
slicer and a Pickler that are very

340
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:11,159
common in production uh and then we had

341
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:13,320
two of our breeding lines including 264

342
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:16,120
which is our was our Top

343
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,160
Line in one of the plots we had a no

344
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,759
treatment uh trial we didn't spray

345
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:23,919
fungicide at all and the other one we

346
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:26,278
used what is a standard uh grower

347
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:29,519
application of fungicides so we we

348
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:31,480
sprayed weekly alternated between two of

349
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,679
the most effective fungicides at the

350
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,480
time and what we found not surprisingly

351
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:39,559
was uh this is a measure of uh area

352
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,480
under disease progress curve uh a

353
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:44,758
measure of a total amount of disease

354
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:49,360
that the plants have the higher numbers

355
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:52,720
are worse you want a lower number uh

356
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:56,560
without uh any sort of treatment uh

357
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,560
dashu and Eureka uh died pretty quickly

358
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:59,919
um they accumulated a lot of disease

359
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,399
very quickly

360
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:05,799
um and we we still saw some effect of

361
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:09,639
using fungicide with our lines but this

362
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:12,639
Top Line uh was statistically not

363
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:14,120
different between the uh Fungicide and

364
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,560
no fungicide applications which

365
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,078
indicated to us that uh Growers could

366
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,479
use this line without in in areas of

367
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:24,758
moderate pressure uh could use this line

368
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:28,680
without fungicide or with uh reduced

369
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:31,959
fungicide applications so uh this was a

370
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:34,638
a really significant finding for us so

371
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:36,838
we released uh this line and it was

372
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,278
immediately picked up by uh small Seed

373
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:40,639
Company in the South where it really

374
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:42,799
gained traction because of the heavy

375
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,680
disease pressure there and uh the lack

376
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:47,719
of any time at all to grow cucumbers

377
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:49,599
before the disease moves into the area

378
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,519
uh but it still had some some flaws that

379
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:57,079
we needed to work on um we wanted to

380
00:15:52,519 --> 00:16:00,198
improve earliness we were about 10 to 15

381
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:02,838
264 is about 10 to 15 days later than uh

382
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:04,719
commercial cultivars which uh with

383
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:08,040
cucumbers when you're talking about a

384
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:11,440
crop that uh usually starts producing

385
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:12,278
fruit in about uh 55 days that's that's

386
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,240
pretty

387
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:17,519
significant uh we wanted to improve

388
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,959
yield it's always a goal uh reduce the

389
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,240
male flowering um it it had a little bit

390
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:26,758
skewed ratio that we wanted to change

391
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:31,680
and improve the fruit size so 264 really

392
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:34,560
was a uh Slicer in a pickler's body um

393
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:38,559
it was a small four to six inch fruit

394
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:42,439
but had uh the skin of a slicer so we

395
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:45,000
wanted to change that so we started

396
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,800
Crossing uh you know went back to

397
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,519
Crossing uh 264 with some Elite lines

398
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:54,719
and cultivars using the same approach

399
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:58,198
that uh I described earlier

400
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,199
so as of last year we had some new lines

401
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:04,359
that uh we again trial and this is

402
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:06,318
courtesy of uh Lauren who uh I worked

403
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:08,279
with last year to set up uh the trial

404
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:12,959
and she took all this data after I had

405
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:15,199
left um and our most promising line 401

406
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,199
did extremely well in the field here's a

407
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:21,679
picture of it um that uh we took for a

408
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:25,720
publication uh we now have an 8 to 10 in

409
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:27,559
Fruit as opposed to 5 to six uh it has a

410
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,440
similar disease resistance in this First

411
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:31,558
Column as 264

412
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,640
and much better than everything else we

413
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:36,440
compared it to and I should point out

414
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:39,240
that um this SV line Darlington and

415
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:42,120
centella are cultivars that have been

416
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:46,200
released by uh seed companies with

417
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:48,319
purported dowy M tolerance or um

418
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,679
resistance so we wanted to compare our

419
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:52,119
material with what was considered the

420
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,640
best on the market at the time and uh

421
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:55,319
there was really no comparison uh for

422
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,480
the

423
00:17:55,319 --> 00:18:01,000
resistance the uh fruit under disease

424
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,599
pressure was much higher than everything

425
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,159
else and like I said it was bigger fruit

426
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:08,119
uh not only more but bigger and days to

427
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:09,280
harvest was right where we wanted it to

428
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:12,918
be right in line with the other

429
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:15,599
commercial Cult of ours so um and here

430
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:19,000
you can see um the plants growing out in

431
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:21,158
the field uh our two lines here the

432
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,159
marmore 97 which kind of represents this

433
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:26,559
B group here and then straight 8 which

434
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:28,080
is another very susceptible variety uh

435
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:30,759
was completely dead at the time all

436
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:30,759
these pictures were

437
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:39,799
taken so um we've released uh

438
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:42,639
401 uh and look forward to it being uh

439
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:46,200
trialed by seed companies as a line uh

440
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:48,038
to be sold by itself or in a hybrid uh

441
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,600
and one question I get a lot is how

442
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:52,079
durable do you think the resistance is

443
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:54,719
and that's a good question it's a hard

444
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:57,759
question to answer um there's some

445
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,440
anxiety about any new uh line that is

446
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:02,640
produced because

447
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,440
uh this this is a really nasty pathogen

448
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,159
in terms of its ability to to mutate and

449
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,759
overcome uh plant host resistance and

450
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:13,200
and uh develop resistance to fungicides

451
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:16,640
so here's just a couple uh articles that

452
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:19,159
have been uh released uh since this new

453
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:24,000
strain came on board uh showing new

454
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:28,000
avenues for uh pseudo peros cubensis the

455
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,240
the pathogen to uh mutate change and uh

456
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,558
cause infection so uh mostly the

457
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:37,159
pathogen is spread via asexual zoospores

458
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:39,480
but uh a new mating type has been found

459
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:41,640
in the US which could open the door for

460
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,720
sexual reproduction and recombination

461
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:48,038
that comes with that uh there's

462
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,919
different populations of the pathogen uh

463
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:52,519
there's a lot of genetic variability out

464
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,600
there uh which if it starts recombining

465
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:58,440
could uh be very problematic we've now

466
00:19:55,599 --> 00:20:00,839
found evidence of seed transmission so

467
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,320
this is extremely important because

468
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:05,558
before you know we could predict where

469
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:07,000
it was going to be based on wind

470
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:09,960
currents

471
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,880
now it just depends on where seed is

472
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,159
moving potentially um and also there's

473
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,880
been some new host discovered uh that

474
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:19,760
might actually allow the pathogen to

475
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,200
overwinter so uh it's a problem that we

476
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,759
still have to work on there's still a

477
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,319
lot of unknowns but one of the great

478
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:26,919
things about the line that we've

479
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:29,759
developed or the lines that we've

480
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:31,840
developed is that they're really a

481
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:33,558
combination of resistance genes from

482
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,839
different sources uh we don't know

483
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:37,798
exactly how many we know it's more than

484
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:42,399
can be easily determined by uh

485
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:44,400
segregation ratios in in um Family

486
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,320
populations but we don't know how many

487
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,440
it is but it's my hope that it's enough

488
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,918
that uh if we keep working on this we

489
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,440
can stay ahead of the

490
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:55,799
pathogen so the next steps obviously are

491
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,000
to continue triing these lines in

492
00:20:55,798 --> 00:21:00,918
numerous locations um uh development of

493
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,240
more commercial cultivars with the

494
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:05,080
Cornell material in it uh we need to

495
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,759
incorporate resistance into other Market

496
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:09,399
types so the the pickling sector is

497
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:14,319
actually larger than the slicing

498
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:16,038
cucumber sector in the US and um uh we

499
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:18,359
they are also desperate for some Downey

500
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:19,679
M do resistant material and and I know

501
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:21,839
that's one thing that Lauren is working

502
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,679
on um that you might hear about in the

503
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:28,000
future we need to continue to improve

504
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:29,200
resistance um maybe by identifying new

505
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,558
sources of

506
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,319
resistance um such as 19788 could we use

507
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:37,158
that does it have different resistance

508
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:41,399
genes that could be combined with the

509
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:44,720
Cornell resistance genes um to to really

510
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:47,400
produce almost immunity and then uh

511
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,960
depending on uh how many genes are

512
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,720
involved you know the development of

513
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,000
markers and either a marker say

514
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,200
selection or even a genomic selection

515
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,079
approach could help us more easily move

516
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,080
these genes into new material

517
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:05,240
so uh that was cucumbers now I'm going

518
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,159
to switch gears a little bit and uh talk

519
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,480
about the work we've done to map the

520
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:13,559
powdery milde resistance uh Gene pm0 and

521
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,000
cucurbita and cucurbita is the genus of

522
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:17,798
squash and

523
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,359
pumpkins first a look at the disease

524
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:25,918
powdery mildew uh so powdery mildew uh

525
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:28,839
is a disease that can occur on uh a lot

526
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:32,038
of very taxonomically diverse plant

527
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:33,599
species uh the disease is caused by a

528
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:35,679
number of different pathogens all from

529
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:37,439
the same fungal family so we're dealing

530
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,000
with a fungal disease instead of an old

531
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,798
my SE and this is pretty common symptoms

532
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
you know it'll range depending on the

533
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:47,038
pathogen and the host but often times

534
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,798
you'll see these white fuzzy spots on

535
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:53,319
leaves uh poter m a folar pathogen and

536
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:55,679
those fuzzy spots are the signs of the

537
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:58,119
pathogen they're the colonies of uh

538
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,720
canidia fores which are the reproductive

539
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:03,439
structure

540
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:06,159
eventually uh these colonies will coales

541
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,200
so that you have a a fuzzy mat on the

542
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:12,760
upper Leaf surface and potentially the

543
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:16,880
lower Leaf surface and uh in the course

544
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:19,519
of infection you can often get chlorotic

545
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,960
areas at the point of or nearby the

546
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:26,278
colonies um which is a sign of the the

547
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:29,600
pathogen uh using the plants resources

548
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:32,599
so it's um the most prevalent disease on

549
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:34,678
squash and pumpkins like the dowy milu

550
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:37,079
pathogen it's dispersed aerially so it's

551
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:38,360
pretty much everywhere that squash and

552
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:41,079
pumpkins are

553
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:44,119
grown uh unlike Donnie milw it typically

554
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:46,558
results in slow plant death um but can

555
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:49,678
definitely reduce uh fruit quantity

556
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:52,319
quality and storability uh so it's it's

557
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,600
really uh the number one disease that

558
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,879
squash pumpkin Growers are asking about

559
00:23:54,599 --> 00:24:00,959
and talking

560
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,840
about so uh Potter mildew can occur on

561
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,120
uh all of the

562
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:07,519
cultivated uh species uh that we use and

563
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:08,839
I just wanted to introduce them because

564
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:11,519
you'll hear me talking about these

565
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:17,480
different species uh a little bit later

566
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:21,000
on so uh one of the species that uh is

567
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:23,079
common in the US is cucur aipo and that

568
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,079
includes your Jackal lantern pumpkins

569
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:29,319
your spaghetti squash acorn squash uh

570
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:31,319
zucchini summer squash uh then there's

571
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:33,678
cucur mosada which includes your

572
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:36,759
butternuts uh some sometimes your cheese

573
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:39,000
type pumpkins and also uh processing

574
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:42,000
type pumpkins so uh there's the

575
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,359
Dickenson variety among others that uh

576
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,278
are typically used to make canned

577
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:51,319
pumpkin pie filling um and then there's

578
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:53,000
uh cucurbita Maxima uh which includes

579
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:55,918
the Buttercup

580
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,359
types and your giant award-winning

581
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:02,600
pumpkins uh modeled by Chris and Kyle

582
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:05,678
right here you're going for a number

583
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:05,678
that beats that this year

584
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:11,038
right and uh once again most squash and

585
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,278
pumpkins are produced in eastern states

586
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,440
about 80% of the production is east of

587
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:18,759
the Mississippi River and a production

588
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:22,480
value of about $335

589
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:25,038
million so as you can imagine uh this is

590
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,240
such an important disease in squash and

591
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:28,839
pumpkins that breeders and geneticists

592
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,558
have been looking for a long time for

593
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:33,359
sources of resistance uh unfortunately

594
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:35,960
there's no known resistance native

595
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:39,240
resistance in cucurbit aipo back in the

596
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:41,960
early 1970s some uh researchers grew out

597
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,839
the whole USDA collection of all three

598
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,079
of these species and found nothing that

599
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:49,959
even approached acceptable resistance in

600
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:52,918
cucurbit aipo they found some moderate

601
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,798
resistance in both uh urb mosada and

602
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:58,919
Maxima but it wasn't really robust it it

603
00:25:55,798 --> 00:26:01,759
it wasn't what uh would even approach

604
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:03,960
what was desired by the industry and

605
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:05,798
Marketplace

606
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,360
however

607
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:11,119
there is known to be powdery M

608
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:14,398
resistance in several wild cucurbita

609
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:17,319
species and uh here are some of the

610
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:20,119
cucurbita species shown here and with

611
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:22,918
this is a a Crossing polygon showing

612
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:24,119
what things are sparingly compatible a

613
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:26,600
line doesn't mean it's readily

614
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:28,759
compatible but it means that if you work

615
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:31,678
hard enough at it and long enough you

616
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:36,240
can often get a few seeds from the cross

617
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:40,559
so one of these species hurb okobi Enis

618
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:43,720
here uh is resistant and uh was

619
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:46,480
collected in Mexico uh a long time ago

620
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:50,519
and sent to Cornell uh with the hope

621
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:54,599
that it could be crossed with uh mosada

622
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:58,359
and pipo to to bring resistance in and

623
00:26:54,599 --> 00:27:02,558
that was ultimately very successful uh

624
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:05,319
after a lot of effort uh resistance was

625
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:08,480
transferred from this wild gourd-like

626
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:11,558
plant to cucur mosada and then

627
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:14,319
eventually into cucurbit aipo through a

628
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:17,119
mosada bridge so it needed a little help

629
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:18,519
there but but they made it and uh it

630
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,079
wasn't complete resistance that was

631
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:22,798
transferred because we've never seen any

632
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:25,240
powdery mildew on this plant in the

633
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:28,918
field it's completely

634
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:32,159
resistant in cucur mosada and pipo

635
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:33,679
um we don't see that and the reason for

636
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,919
that is that a single Gene was

637
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:39,240
transferred uh we we now know that this

638
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:41,600
has many genes that contribute but a

639
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,200
very important Gene was transferred pm0

640
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:48,519
and that Gene confers enough resistance

641
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:50,679
that uh Growers often need reduced uh

642
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:53,640
Growers use reduced fungicide

643
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:55,320
applications and in a moderate year of

644
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,919
pathogen pressure don't need any at all

645
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:59,960
so it's it's adequate to get them to the

646
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:02,919
end of the season and the single Gene

647
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,960
was confirmed back in the 1970s using

648
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:08,919
segregating

649
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,919
populations so from there um at Cornell

650
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:12,840
this Gene was transferred into a lot of

651
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:16,440
different materials it was transferred

652
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:19,079
into to both subspecies of cucurbit aipo

653
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:22,159
uh into pumpkin uh and these varieties

654
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:25,278
are all names uh of varieties developed

655
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:27,720
at Cornell uh into zucchini including

656
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:30,798
Romulus here which has been uh the

657
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,798
source of resistance for uh a lot of the

658
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:33,918
things we've done historically in in the

659
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:36,558
breeding

660
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,799
program uh it was transferred into the

661
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:43,158
other subspecies of cucur aipo into

662
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:43,158
straight neck squash and acorn and

663
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,720
delicata it was moved into different

664
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:52,119
butternuts in cucur mosada a large

665
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:55,798
butternut and a smaller Butternut bugle

666
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:59,678
which is uh you can find in a number of

667
00:28:55,798 --> 00:29:01,440
seed catalogs and one interesting

668
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:05,320
cultivar that lost resistance it was

669
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:07,240
transferred into uh a cucurbita poipo

670
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:10,759
cocelli which is is kind of like a

671
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,440
zucchini but later uh we found lost the

672
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:13,919
resistance so that'll be important in

673
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:18,640
just a

674
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:21,519
minute so from from here

675
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,440
uh these were disseminated to seed

676
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:26,079
companies that use these as sources of

677
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,798
the PMZ Gene uh use these or their

678
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:32,038
progenitors uh as we shared uh as the

679
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:34,319
Cornell program shared along the way and

680
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:38,158
uh continue to be extremely important

681
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:41,200
pretty much every uh variety that is

682
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:43,960
powdery mil resistant today uh has its

683
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,558
roots in these efforts uh and has the PM

684
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:49,319
Z

685
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:51,319
Gene um it's an incredibly widely used

686
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:53,960
Gene but a problem to date is that there

687
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:55,879
are no markers for it uh and one of the

688
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,600
reasons for that is a lot of the squash

689
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,278
and breeding squash and pumpkin breeding

690
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:01,359
efforts are done by small to mediumsized

691
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,519
companies that just don't have the

692
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:07,879
resources for mapping and Market

693
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:09,640
development uh and actually we have uh

694
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,278
many of you might know that we host the

695
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,320
vegetable breeding Institute Field Days

696
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:15,440
every year where Seed Company

697
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:17,678
Representatives will come in and see the

698
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,558
resources that uh the Cornell breeding

699
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,919
programs have developed and and kind of

700
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:23,879
pitch their ideas and what they want to

701
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:26,519
see in the future and one of my favorite

702
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:29,880
things to ask them every year was if you

703
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:33,159
could pick one thing for a public

704
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,600
research institution to develop that

705
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:36,679
would have utility for your breeding

706
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:39,759
program what would it be and without

707
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:42,159
fail every year uh for squash the two

708
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:43,640
answers were markers for powdery Miler

709
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,399
resistance and markers for virus

710
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:49,120
resistance so it was it was a huge

711
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:52,319
need uh that we wanted to to solve right

712
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:56,038
away so we got to

713
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:58,918
thinking what can we um how can how can

714
00:30:56,038 --> 00:31:01,679
we we map this Gene uh quickly without

715
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:04,799
developing new populations without um

716
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,360
waiting additional seasons and using uh

717
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:09,319
The Germ plasm that we already have

718
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:11,959
available we have uh what we termed a

719
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:13,638
shared trait ingression panel they were

720
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:17,360
things that were very diverse in very

721
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:19,439
different species uh subspecies and

722
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:22,479
Market classes but they all had one

723
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:26,399
thing in common and that was a single

724
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,399
Gene from a wild species

725
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:38,038
so what we decided to do was um we

726
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:40,319
sequenced uh cucurbita uh okobi

727
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:43,679
subspecies Martini the original source

728
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:47,638
of the pm0 gene uh using genotyping by

729
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:50,600
sequencing and um we

730
00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:54,599
also uh got together a bunch of heirloom

731
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:58,199
varieties in cucuro and one in um kcur

732
00:31:54,599 --> 00:32:00,959
mosada things that were around before

733
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,399
the ingression event took PL took place

734
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,798
uh things that had no chance of having

735
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:08,959
any of the wild species in them and uh

736
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:13,319
we genotyped these also with GBS and

737
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,079
then we filtered all of the markers uh

738
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:19,599
so that we only kept the set that had

739
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:22,798
one Al for Martin E ey and one Al for

740
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:24,240
all of the heirlooms uh together and

741
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:25,119
then we sequenced quite a large number

742
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,880
of

743
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:32,199
heirlooms um

744
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,919
and uh we anchored all of these markers

745
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,000
using uh an F2 population that was being

746
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:38,960
grown at the time the study was done at

747
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,679
rup seeds so we we partnered with them

748
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,919
on this project uh and they they shared

749
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,720
some of their data this was an inner

750
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:47,759
specific population so it was really a

751
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:52,038
great for uh developing lots of

752
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:55,119
markers from there uh we genotyped uh

753
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:58,398
the Cornell shared inra ingression panel

754
00:32:55,119 --> 00:33:01,879
that I was uh referring to e earlier

755
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:04,119
uh all of these uh inbred lines inbred

756
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,159
cultivars that were diverse but shared

757
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:08,158
something in common and we looked across

758
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:12,360
the genome uh each one of these bars

759
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:15,880
represents a chromosome from 1 to 20 and

760
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:17,759
uh we looked at whether they had the

761
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:21,120
heirloom alil or whether they had the

762
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:26,119
maresi or opensis alil so gray is

763
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:28,558
heirloom and blue is um

764
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:31,439
martini and you can see

765
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:33,398
uh the chunk of cucura Martini just

766
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,360
lights right up right on linkage group

767
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:39,079
10 so we were pretty confident uh that

768
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:40,798
we had found something there when we

769
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:43,038
zoomed in on the region so this is a

770
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:47,319
zoomed in uh

771
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:50,638
pictograph uh on linguage group 10 once

772
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:53,720
again we have uh the wild species up top

773
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:56,278
we found that uh there was some

774
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:58,200
recombination around the area uh not

775
00:33:56,278 --> 00:34:00,000
surprisingly

776
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,038
you remember me talking about the line

777
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,359
that had resistance that lost

778
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:07,319
it uh was right here still had part of

779
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:09,639
the Martin easi ingression it just

780
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:11,398
didn't have the resistance and all of

781
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:13,480
these up here had resistance so we were

782
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:16,878
able to use that to identify a

783
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:19,280
relatively small 500 kilobase region uh

784
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:21,960
that we were pretty confident had the

785
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,359
resistance Gene it had to be somewhere

786
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:27,119
in here because these had it and it

787
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:29,719
couldn't be here because this one um

788
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,720
didn't have the

789
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:37,039
resistance so uh once we had this

790
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:40,240
interval we uh followed up with uh a

791
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:42,878
pretty small jwas study but um there's

792
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,759
only so many cultivars that are out

793
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:46,598
there right now you know since uh the

794
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,480
first cultivar started appearing in the

795
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:51,039
late

796
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:54,159
1990s um but we found about 81 cucuro

797
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:56,079
cultivars many with the pm0 resistance

798
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,880
um in both subspecies and all

799
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:03,039
morphotypes so here you have the Texana

800
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:06,200
subspecies here is the pipo

801
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:09,358
subspecies and we had pumpkins uh

802
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:11,838
zucchini acorns delicata uh anything

803
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:15,319
that we could find any Market type that

804
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:17,000
had the resistance Gene and uh where we

805
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:20,359
had heirlooms that lacked

806
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:24,400
it we uh grew them all out in the field

807
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:27,799
in uh replicated plots and we use pedial

808
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,039
ratings as our phenotype and one thing

809
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,720
we've learned over many years is that

810
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:33,199
pedial ratings are the easiest way to

811
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:35,480
determine if something is carrying the

812
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:38,559
pm0 gene

813
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:41,159
um leaf leaves can vary a little bit but

814
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:43,119
almost invariably uh something that is

815
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:45,279
homozygous for the resistance alil will

816
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,760
not have any colonies on its pedal

817
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,560
something that is homozygous for the

818
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,440
susceptibility alal will be just covered

819
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:55,159
and usually something that heterozygous

820
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:57,760
will have colonies at its base and taper

821
00:35:55,159 --> 00:36:01,519
off and the tips will be clean and and

822
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:04,000
then we added two other classes just to

823
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:05,719
um be able to represent some sort of

824
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,199
intermediate phenotypes that we saw in

825
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:12,559
the

826
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:15,480
field what we found uh was uh pretty

827
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:19,400
clear uh on linkage group

828
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:21,960
10 uh right over the interval we had our

829
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,318
Peak uh so for those of you not familiar

830
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,240
with these types of plots this is called

831
00:36:23,318 --> 00:36:30,400
a Manhattan plot where the linkage

832
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:32,519
groups are uh on bottom and the negative

833
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,960
log of the P value which represents the

834
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:37,199
significance of the AL relating

835
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,400
to the trait or the

836
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:44,318
phenotype um and so we had very

837
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:47,559
significant uh hit right at the interval

838
00:36:44,318 --> 00:36:50,960
um where where we assumed the locus was

839
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:54,559
at as one more confirmation um we teamed

840
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,519
up with rup again who uh did a simple

841
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:58,559
binary rating on their F2 population

842
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:05,079
this was the same F2 that we use to

843
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:08,318
Anchor our Snips and um we took four uh

844
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:10,280
markers these uh two inside the interval

845
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:13,880
and these two flanking the interval to

846
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:17,800
see if uh they used a different

847
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:19,760
excession of okobi Enis if if the PMZ

848
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:24,039
Gene was in that one as well and what we

849
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:25,839
see is uh very much what we expected uh

850
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:29,119
we see an additive or incompletely

851
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:32,199
dominant gene action here uh where the

852
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,800
plants the group of plants that had uh

853
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:36,078
were homozygous with the susceptibility

854
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:39,079
levs had higher disease ratings the ones

855
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:41,440
that uh were homozygous for the

856
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:44,480
resistance Le had signif statistically

857
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:48,119
significant lower ratings and as we

858
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:52,760
moved outside of that interval um the

859
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:56,039
difference in PM scores uh was

860
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:58,760
reduced so uh we did some fine mapping

861
00:37:56,039 --> 00:38:02,559
uh and narrowed that 500 KB region to

862
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:07,319
about uh a little less than 80 K uh

863
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:10,119
KB and we found a number of interesting

864
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:12,559
candidate genes so uh I've highlighted

865
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:16,358
four of them here uh we found a

866
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:18,838
predicted peroxid days which uh is known

867
00:38:16,358 --> 00:38:22,159
to uh contribute to powdered mildew

868
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:25,960
resistance in uh barley uh there's the

869
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:28,639
salicylic acid binding protein uh which

870
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,880
contributes to powdery M resistance in

871
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:33,759
arabidopsis uh this one I think is

872
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:37,119
particularly interesting this is a uh an

873
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:39,240
NBS lrr that uh is a powdery mildew

874
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,960
resistance protein in

875
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:45,159
arabidopsis and then uh zinc finger

876
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:47,119
there's a zinc finger protein here um

877
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:50,279
and those are involved in a lot of

878
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:53,160
biotrophic pathogen resistances

879
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:55,880
so it could be any number of these uh

880
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:57,480
this is as far as we are at to date uh

881
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,200
it presents a lot of interesting

882
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,000
questions moving forward for someone to

883
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:03,399
follow up on uh and we definitely don't

884
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,800
rule out the possibility that's a number

885
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:10,119
of these genes acting in tandem um it

886
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:11,519
could be uh multiple of these or um you

887
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:13,240
know in the case of the r genene it's a

888
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:16,719
very big r genene maybe it's actually a

889
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:19,519
raft of R genes uh connected to each

890
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:22,279
other and so the last thing we did um

891
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:24,480
and this credit goes to Kyle uh was to

892
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,560
take some of our markers and and or take

893
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,159
some of the the Snips and develop

894
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:30,400
markers into them

895
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:32,000
uh we released the sequence information

896
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,639
so that those can be adapted to any

897
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,079
platform that the Breeders want and uh

898
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:40,519
ran some caps here where we had perfect

899
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:42,599
segregation between uh the phenotype and

900
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:42,599
the

901
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:51,000
marker so the next steps um evaluate

902
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:53,838
candidates to identify the causal Gene I

903
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,039
think that will be a very uh interesting

904
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:57,639
exercise uh we need to continue to

905
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:59,920
improve powdered milde resistance and

906
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:01,480
Commercial cultivars this isn't directly

907
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,880
related to what I was talking about but

908
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:09,318
it's very important uh as I said the pm0

909
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:13,519
gene doesn't confer immunity into

910
00:40:09,318 --> 00:40:17,719
uh into the tolerant um

911
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:19,679
genotypes uh and there has been more

912
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:21,679
reports in recent years that the

913
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:23,318
resistance isn't holding up as well as

914
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:24,719
it had in the past and that's not at all

915
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:26,759
surprising we're talking about a single

916
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:29,358
Gene resistance eventually that's going

917
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:31,760
to break down so we need to be on top of

918
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:34,440
uh finding other sources of resistance

919
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,800
um using recurrent selection approaches

920
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,079
to combine these small effect alals that

921
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,640
might be natively in cucur pipo or

922
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:43,800
especially cucura mosada uh we could

923
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:46,519
also revisit some of these wild species

924
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,200
to pick up uh the genes that were left

925
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:49,960
behind in the beginning and we have a

926
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:53,318
lot more tools and Technologies now to

927
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,318
do that than they had in the

928
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:59,358
1970s so uh really briefly I'm going to

929
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:03,000
uh talk

930
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:06,318
about um a collaborative effort with the

931
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:09,079
USDA on uh doing some genetic

932
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:12,239
characterization of uh what we term the

933
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:14,119
USDA pisome diversity collection and

934
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:17,239
this collection really has its roots in

935
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:18,079
a core collection uh developed in the

936
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:21,279
early

937
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:23,160
1990s that was assembled to maximize

938
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,200
geographical and morphological diversity

939
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:28,559
within the collection uh in accessions

940
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:32,159
were collected all around the world and

941
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:34,920
this map shows uh the 238 accessions of

942
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:38,318
the updc as we call it uh that were

943
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:40,960
collected in addition uh there's almost

944
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:43,639
200 accessions that were uh developed by

945
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,240
breeding programs or donated by

946
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:50,559
institutions but have unknown collection

947
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:51,919
Origins and um one thing one thing in

948
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:54,920
particular to note is that this

949
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:57,838
collection includes uh breeding material

950
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:01,838
from uh the USDA and Washington State

951
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:05,318
breeding programs and uh field peas and

952
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:09,119
uh snap peas uh developed by uh Jim

953
00:42:05,318 --> 00:42:09,119
Myers and his predecessors at Oregon

954
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:14,280
State so um oh I should I should say

955
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:18,159
that this

956
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:21,440
collection uh is used widely by pe

957
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:23,199
breeders to find uh new traits so uh the

958
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,639
collection's been grown out the core

959
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:28,679
collection and its derivatives including

960
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:32,358
the updc have been grown out in various

961
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:35,639
permutations uh many times by um

962
00:42:32,358 --> 00:42:39,799
breeders looking for new traits and uh

963
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:42,400
there's been a lot of uh traits that

964
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:45,280
have been uh phenotypes that have been

965
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,880
recorded in our publicly available one

966
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:51,319
big thing that was missing was any sort

967
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:53,640
of highdensity molecular data um and

968
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:55,599
this was needed to be able to map those

969
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:57,639
traits a lot of the traits that are

970
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,640
important in P are single Gene tra traes

971
00:42:57,639 --> 00:43:01,279
that would be relatively simple to map

972
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:03,440
with enough markers and enough

973
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,720
individuals um the phenotype data is

974
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,920
already there and another thing we

975
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:11,719
wanted to do was be able to um get a

976
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:15,800
genetic snapshot uh of what the

977
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:18,759
collection looked like uh often times um

978
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:20,480
morph uh the phenotypes could look

979
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,880
similar but they could be very

980
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:26,440
genetically unrelated so this would help

981
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,838
us to to tease out where uh diversity is

982
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,800
for breeding

983
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,920
programs so one of the first things we

984
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,400
did was look at the structure of the

985
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,800
collection and

986
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:40,440
um here we have a principal components

987
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:43,200
uh diagram showing uh each one of these

988
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:46,599
dots represents an accession uh that was

989
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:49,279
genotyped uh here are the Oregon State

990
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:52,480
snap peas snap and snow peas here are

991
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:56,000
the Washington State field peas and then

992
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,719
these other colors um were used based on

993
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,800
previous studies that included these

994
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:05,439
materials so this uh study or this color

995
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:08,800
here yellow represents uh the cultivated

996
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:13,358
type P uh pism sativum subspecies

997
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:16,280
sativum here are uh in blue are the two

998
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:17,679
recognized subspecies of pism sativum

999
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,519
elus and

1000
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:23,318
absum and what is perhaps the most

1001
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:26,480
interesting is this area of green here

1002
00:44:23,318 --> 00:44:29,159
so these P's here come from Central Asia

1003
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,199
and and really all of these do too um

1004
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:32,440
these were just the ones that were

1005
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:34,919
included in in previous

1006
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:37,920
studies uh and these are not recognized

1007
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:40,358
as a separate uh

1008
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,440
subspecies uh many people have noticed

1009
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:46,480
that peas from Central Asia seem to be

1010
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,480
different than cultivated peas but no

1011
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,199
one has really looked too much into it

1012
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,159
so one of the things we were interested

1013
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:54,759
in doing with the genetic data is trying

1014
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:56,639
to see if we could uncover anything

1015
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:59,440
about this this very different group of

1016
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:02,000
peas and it should be said that um these

1017
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,358
peas are often found in mountainous

1018
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,440
regions in Central Asia so if you think

1019
00:45:04,358 --> 00:45:11,318
of the mountainous areas in Iran and

1020
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:13,639
Afghanistan India Nepal um they tend to

1021
00:45:11,318 --> 00:45:17,159
be more cold tolerant they have

1022
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:19,039
different uh uh they tend to be low

1023
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:23,558
growing basil branching so there's a lot

1024
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:27,318
of um phenotypic differences as well one

1025
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:31,000
of the questions we had and which um

1026
00:45:27,318 --> 00:45:34,759
hasn't really been addressed is um is it

1027
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:38,920
possible that that these uh

1028
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:42,240
accessions had some ancient or maybe

1029
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:44,119
more recent uh ingression from pison

1030
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:47,679
fulam which is the only other sister

1031
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:51,079
species of pism sativum so we went to

1032
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:54,239
the USDA collection and and genotyped uh

1033
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:56,240
with GBS some Pyon fuls to see if they

1034
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:58,199
clustered nearby these Central Asian

1035
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:00,838
peas and those included at Red at the

1036
00:45:58,199 --> 00:46:02,118
top and we found out that they don't uh

1037
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:03,318
and one of the reasons we thought they

1038
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:06,240
might was because there are some

1039
00:46:03,318 --> 00:46:08,079
phenotypic similarities so uh there

1040
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:11,838
still is work that needs to be done to

1041
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:14,160
figure out where do these peas come from

1042
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:18,078
and

1043
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:21,639
um these these peas have a lot of

1044
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:24,318
genetic diversity we looked at

1045
00:46:21,639 --> 00:46:26,519
um how much diversity they have to offer

1046
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:30,639
to breeding programs and so on on the

1047
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:33,599
left we have uh each group Pym fulum the

1048
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:37,400
subspecies elus the cultivated types the

1049
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:39,720
sativum and um the Central Asian piece

1050
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:41,200
and we looked at how many Snips they

1051
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:43,558
have that are unique to each of those

1052
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:46,358
groups versus these groups here so we

1053
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:49,040
found uh and and we corrected for

1054
00:46:46,358 --> 00:46:52,239
different um population sizes within

1055
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:55,358
each each of these groups we found that

1056
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:57,598
the Central Asian piece had over 6,000

1057
00:46:55,358 --> 00:47:02,358
Snips uh and this is

1058
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:04,280
uh out of uh around 68,000 Snips total

1059
00:47:02,358 --> 00:47:07,440
that were different than anything else

1060
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:09,400
and when we compared that to the

1061
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,079
breeding program P's Washington State

1062
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:14,039
and Oregon State we found that they

1063
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:17,839
actually had more unique alals than even

1064
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:20,239
the pison fulam and

1065
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:21,960
one very important key here is that

1066
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:25,078
these Central Asian PS have not really

1067
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:27,599
been used in breeding efforts uh as far

1068
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:29,920
as I know anywhere but they are fully

1069
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,519
compatible with cultivated sativum

1070
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,079
whereas pison fulum is a different

1071
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:35,119
species and there's a lot of Crossing

1072
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:37,318
barriers that exist there to bring in

1073
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,318
that

1074
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:44,679
diversity so uh in

1075
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,839
conclusion uh We've developed the first

1076
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:48,480
slicing cucumber with high resistance to

1077
00:47:46,838 --> 00:47:54,799
a new strain of Downey

1078
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:57,318
mildew we have uh resistance genes in uh

1079
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,359
very diverse moderately resistant uh

1080
00:47:57,318 --> 00:48:01,960
material that we know can be combined to

1081
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:04,598
provide high levels of

1082
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:07,679
resistance with resistance we can reduce

1083
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:09,680
or eliminate the need for uh

1084
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:11,919
fungicides we found that this shared

1085
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:13,799
trait integration panel mapping approach

1086
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:17,159
is very effective and we think it can be

1087
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:19,359
used a lot in vegetable crops where this

1088
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:21,719
whole model of bringing in a single Gene

1089
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:23,558
from wild species is very common there's

1090
00:48:21,719 --> 00:48:26,358
been a lot of disease resistance genes

1091
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:27,319
that have been introduced um from a

1092
00:48:26,358 --> 00:48:30,960
single

1093
00:48:27,318 --> 00:48:33,079
wild species and we think this approach

1094
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,920
uh could really illuminate those in in

1095
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:38,359
short order we now have markers for pm0

1096
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,760
which is the most widely used Gene in

1097
00:48:38,358 --> 00:48:43,119
squash and pumpkin breeding and which a

1098
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:45,880
lot of uh seed companies have already

1099
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:48,440
started implementing into their uh

1100
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:50,358
breeding pipelines we have a highdensity

1101
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:52,200
snip data set that's now available for

1102
00:48:50,358 --> 00:48:55,199
genetic characterization and hopefully

1103
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:57,239
trait mapping uh in a very diverse

1104
00:48:55,199 --> 00:49:01,318
collection of P

1105
00:48:57,239 --> 00:49:03,598
and uh were particularly interested in

1106
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:06,440
um the application of this data to use

1107
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,599
this group of peas from Central Asia for

1108
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:10,798
bringing in additional diversity to to

1109
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:14,240
breeding

1110
00:49:10,798 --> 00:49:15,719
programs so uh there's lots of people to

1111
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:18,439
acknowledge for all of these different

1112
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:22,318
projects I want to uh say special thanks

1113
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:26,280
to my graduate committee um Michael and

1114

they've been tremendously supportive uh

1116
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:33,318
throughout the time I've been here and

1117
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:36,838
I've uh you know I've been able to

1118
00:49:33,318 --> 00:49:39,599
bounce a lot of ideas off of them and um

1119
00:49:36,838 --> 00:49:42,400
special thanks to uh all the current and

1120

former members of the Missour lab group

1121
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:48,798
um you know as we were figuring things

1122
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:52,358
out uh we really helped each other uh

1123
00:49:48,798 --> 00:49:54,838
with various uh skills and expertise uh

1124

who have been very instrumental in in

1126
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,960
all of these different studies um in

Get Enough thanks for everything they do

1131
00:50:10,798 --> 00:50:15,759
to keep things going throughout the year

1132
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:18,838
in the season um Mary kinger at the

1133
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,839
vegetable breeding Institute uh has been

1134
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:22,480
very helpful all the time uh has

1135
00:50:20,838 --> 00:50:24,880
answered a lot of questions over the

1136
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,440
years um when we first got started in

1137
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:30,079
genotyping Sharon Mitchell and Charlotte

1138
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:33,720
uh charia spent a lot of time helping us

1139
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:36,318
get going uh in those directions uh we

1140
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:38,759
had some collaborators at other

1141
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:41,960
institutions as well uh yesun and John

1142
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:48,040
Murphy and rup seeds uh that donated

1143
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:51,798
seeds or uh uh resources along the way

1144
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:53,759
and also um thanks and large part to all

1145
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:56,480
of the funding that allowed us to be

1146
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:59,040
able to do all of these things so with

1147
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,039
that that I'll take

1148
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:09,960
questions this has been a production of

1149
