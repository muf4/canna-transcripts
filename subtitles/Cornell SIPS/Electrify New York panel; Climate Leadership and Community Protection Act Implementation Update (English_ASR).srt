1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,440
University hi everybody thank you so

3
00:00:09,558 --> 00:00:15,798
much for uh accommodating me to

4
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:18,000
participate virtually and to wrap up

5
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:19,759
this seems like a very rapid fire

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,679
session lots of a lot of information

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,640
happening really fast I'm going to talk

8
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:27,039
very quickly um and hopefully stay on

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,160
time about the climate leadership and

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,800
Community protection act and what the

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,920
state is doing on

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,239
implementation um so just a quick very

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,640
quick overview because I know we don't

14
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:38,320
have a ton of time on the climate

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,239
leadership and Community protection act

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,640
it was passed in 2019 so it's a veteran

17
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:49,238
law nowadays um it set us up for

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:52,159
emissions reductions requirements um 85%

19
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:55,919
below 1990 Levels by 2050 with an interm

20
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:58,198
Target of 40% by 2030 and we have a lot

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,160
of clean energy and Energy Efficiency

22
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:02,000
requirements that are now part of that

23
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,438
law that we are Marching steadily

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,560
towards achieving and there's also very

25
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:09,079
strong requirements around climate

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,840
Justice and just transition included in

27
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:12,920
that

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,478
law um

29
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,640
our the climate act requires New York

30
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:18,560
state to look at our emissions

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,519
differently than other jurisdictions or

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,079
how we had even done it in the past it

33
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,920
requires us to look at the Upstream

34
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:26,639
outof state emissions related to fossil

35
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,040
fuels that come into our state and are

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,118
combusted for end uses and it also

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,600
require us to use the 20-year global

38
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,719
warming potential versus this 100-year

39
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,000
global warming potential which is all

40
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:40,280
how different gases of persist in the

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,040
atmosphere relative to carbon dioxide

42
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:46,519
which is typically the The Benchmark

43
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,799
greenhouse gas the uh result of all of

44
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:51,798
this was a bit of a shift in terms of

45
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,439
the magnitude each sector contributes to

46
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:55,560
our Statewide emissions with buildings

47
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:59,239
and transportation taking up more than

48
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,118
half and our electricity sector being uh

49
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:03,078
What was a relatively smaller

50
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,718
contributor in terms of percentage and

51
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:07,559
our waste sector being a larger

52
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,719
percentage which is mostly related to

53
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,560
the use of methane use of natural gas or

54
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:15,039
methane from landfills and the global

55
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,759
warming potential of methane you'll also

56
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:20,239
see these bod is showing the aggressive

57
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,959
step down that we need to realize in

58
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,920
order to achieve the requirements of the

59
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,680
ACT where we were in

60
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:29,039
1990 uh where we are in 2021 which is

61
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,480
our most recent year of data and where

62
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:35,400
we need to be 2030 and

63
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:37,679
2050 the climate act put the the uh

64
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,920
created a climate Action Council whose

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,280
job it was to create a plan on how we're

66
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,759
going to achieve those emissions

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,080
reductions and the council worked for

68
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:49,039
two years on a draft draft was published

69
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,840
it went out for public comment we've got

70
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,479
thousands and thousands and thousands of

71
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,759
comments um it was also a large

72
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:58,000
analytical body of work was undertaken

73
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,399
to look at the costs and benefits of the

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,360
actions within the plan and that plan

75
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,080
was finalized at the end of

76
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,879
2022 and every 5 years we have to re

77
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,280
refresh that plan so now we are in deep

78
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:14,120
in the implementation

79
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,000
section one of the one of the larger

80
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,799
components of the scoping plan was a

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,519
recommendation that New York State go

82
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:26,280
forth with a CPP invest program so this

83
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,719
is a large economy-wide program that

84
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,640
sets emissions reductions targets or

85
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,519
requirements and also o brings in

86
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,438
Revenue in order to reinvest in the

87
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:38,200
economy and Emissions reductions

88
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:40,719
Technologies so governor hokel in off

89
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:42,959
the bat recommended in 2023 state of

90
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,759
state that the agencies get to work on

91
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,560
developing this program and then again

92
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:48,199
in

93
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,560
2024 the again when the state budget

94
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:53,280
Advanced a structure in terms of how the

95
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,400
proceeds um we would structure the sale

96
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,280
the investment of the proceeds from the

97
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,560
program so very briefly how the cap and

98
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,719
invest program works if there is an

99
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,519
annual limit on the amount of greenhouse

100
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:08,639
gases Statewide that can be emitted it's

101
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:10,799
not a sector specific cap but it's a

102
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:14,679
it's a Statewide blanket cap for the

103
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,918
year the greenhouse gas emission sources

104
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,798
or sources of fuels for heating or for

105
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,319
transportation are required to obtain

106
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,839
allowances at auction for the emissions

107
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:29,120
associated with their

108
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:30,758
activities so those auctions the the

109
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,120
proceeds from from those

110
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:36,759
allowances are then reinvested into the

111
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,399
economy into technologies that reduce

112
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,560
emissions to minimize costs and

113
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:43,959
supporting this great transition that

114
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,519
the state is undertaking in terms of

115
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:48,038
building decarbonization and electric

116
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,359
sector decarbonization and

117
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:52,240
transportation

118
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,720
decarbonization and the program is uh

119
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,759
prioritizes Frontline disadvantaged

120
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,280
communities uh the climate act all

121
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,080
throughout has a large focus on ensuring

122
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:02,839
that the transition to a clean energy

123
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,680
economy and reductions of greenhouse gas

124
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:09,038
emissions prioritizes disadvantaged

125
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,519
communities the governor also set forth

126
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,918
principles that guide the development of

127
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,198
this cap and invest program the agencies

128
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,159
are structured Within These principles

129
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,400
of affordability ensuring that this

130
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,960
program is Affordable for New Yorkers

131
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,679
that we are demonstrating climate

132
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,599
leadership regionally nationally that it

133
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,400
creates jobs and preserves

134
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,560
competitiveness of the New York State

135
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,038
economy again again that the

136
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,720
prioritization of investment and

137
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:35,959
disadvantaged communities is always

138
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,800
front and center and that these funds

139
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:39,959
are being invested in a sustainable

140
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,639
future for the state of New

141
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:45,079
York so this as I mentioned this process

142
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,000
has been in place the development of

143
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:49,399
these regulations this is not a small

144
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,959
undertaking it's quite a large program

145
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:56,159
to develop and there has been a a

146
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:58,599
transparent and public process over the

147
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,160
past year and a half two years on the

148
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,879
development of the draft regulations so

149
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,960
we we kicked off a process of putting

150
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:07,918
out to the public you know what has been

151
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:10,079
done in other jurisdictions California

152
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,839
and Washington and the province of

153
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,598
Quebec uh have have similar programs in

154
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,119
place looking at what they have done

155
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:17,759
what what what works in New York what

156
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,879
doesn't work in New York and receiving

157
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,919
all this this feedback having technical

158
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,959
webinars to gain Insight uh conducting

159
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:26,719
learning

160
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:29,239
sessions uh putting out some preliminary

161
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,880
analytical work to help ground some of

162
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,160
the discussion having direct Roundtable

163
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:35,319
discussions with Equity stakeholders and

164
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,319
labor

165
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:39,160
stakeholders um and all that has been

166
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,639
going on and there's been a public

167
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,000
intake process to receive input to help

168
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,120
craft those regulations in a way that's

169
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,720
going to work well for New

170
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:53,639
York as I mentioned in the

171
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,599
2024 uh state budget the governor set

172
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,680
forth the structure for the investment

173
00:06:56,598 --> 00:07:01,399
how the the where the proceeds will be

174
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:05,759
directed it's a highlevel breakdown

175
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:07,439
where there's she that budget created

176
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,879
what's called a consumer climate action

177
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:14,639
account so 30% of proceeds from those

178
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,639
auctions of allowances will go directly

179
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,759
back to New Yorkers they'll flow through

180
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,800
the climate action account and they'll

181
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:23,680
go back to New Yorkers and and that also

182
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,800
was a direction to proceed with a an

183
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,639
affordability study whose outcome was to

184
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,478
see what's the best mechanism by which

185
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:33,439
to deliver that those proceeds back to

186
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,878
New Yorkers to help reduce their costs

187
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:36,719
there was also an industrial small

188
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,560
business climate action account that was

189
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,039
set aside 3% of future proceeds to

190
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,560
mitigate costs for that sector and then

191
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:45,959
the remaining goes into a climate

192
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,158
investment account which is supports the

193
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:50,598
transition so that's a large portion of

194
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:52,240
the funding that goes into all sorts of

195
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:55,639
clean energy program clean

196
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,439
Transportation um community support you

197
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,840
know large variety of different

198
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:02,719
activities so some highlighted projected

199
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,399
effects of the New York cap and invest

200
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,479
program so when we look at currently

201
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:10,120
enacted policies and there's a lot of

202
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:11,680
modeling going on to understand what are

203
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,158
what are the costs what are the benefits

204
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,240
of the program what are the right cost

205
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:18,918
uh triggers in order to see certain

206
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,800
remissions reductions there's a high

207
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:25,000
body of analytical work up out there um

208
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,680
but we do see that this program

209
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,839
accelerates our progress towards meeting

210
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:32,759
our emission limits so we will achieve

211
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:35,038
pretty significant greenhouse gas

212
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:37,200
emissions reductions but we're also

213
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:40,278
going to need a lot of other current and

214
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,320
new programs to complement the cap and

215
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:43,679
invest program because our emissions

216
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,600
reductions requirements state of New

217
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,799
York are very very

218
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:52,440
aggressive um reducing greenhouse gas

219
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:54,199
emissions improves air quality there's

220
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,399
health benefits that are outcomes of

221
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:59,519
those that are benefits for all regions

222
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,078
of the state but they tend to provide

223
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,360
greater benefits in disadvantaged

224
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:07,519
communities that have traditionally been

225
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,919
more burdened by you know poor air

226
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,519
quality so we the program is expected to

227
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:15,639
Pro you know to generate large volumes

228
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,120
of of money to support the clean energy

229
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:20,120
transition and to support program

230
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,039
affordability uh and that's important

231
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,600
because we have a lot of very there's a

232
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,719
lot that needs to happen you know there

233
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,399
was just a recent discussion around heat

234
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,240
pumps in manufactured homes um in order

235
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,679
to achieve building decarbonization

236
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,879
there's going to need to be a lot of

237
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:36,439
heat pumps installed in lots of homes

238
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:39,240
across the state of New York to

239
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,959
transition us off of um fossil fuels for

240
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,799
for home heating and cooling for beer

241
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,599
the Electric

242
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:47,919
System then the

243
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,800
affordability benefit payment along with

244
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:53,120
these Investments are modeled to really

245
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,639
manage household costs and they're

246
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,480
really directed

247
00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:00,078
towards managing greater costs for

248
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,800
lowincome households so low-income

249
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:07,679
households um will be under the modeling

250
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:10,199
scenarios better off under a cap invest

251
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:13,039
program so as I mentioned the equity

252
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,600
considerations are you know a huge part

253
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:18,240
of the climate act and New York's work

254
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,519
in greenhouse gas emissions reductions

255
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,278
so the climate act requires that the

256
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,519
Department of Environmental Conservation

257
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:25,799
and I guess I never took a second

258
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,278
introduce myself but I'm Morin Ley I'm

259
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:28,519
the director of the office of climate

260
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,519
change at the Department of

261
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:35,560
Environmental con a that everything that

262
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:38,039
we do in terms of regulations to to um

263
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:40,000
implement the climate act do not result

264
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:41,480
in an increase in co-pollutant emissions

265
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,120
or disproportionately burden

266
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:48,120
disadvantaged communities it requires

267
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:51,399
that our actions prioritize reductions

268
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:54,399
in disadvantaged communities and like

269
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:58,159
every state agency and authority and so

270
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,799
on at least 35% with a goal of 40% of

271
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:03,159
our investments will directly benefit

272
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,240
disadvantaged communities so as I

273
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:06,919
mentioned there's been a lot of

274
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,200
information shared publicly it's all on

275
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:13,078
the cap invest website a a pre-proposal

276
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:16,160
outline created a lot

277
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:18,479
of points to consider in terms of how we

278
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,480
can address impacts and disadvantaged

279
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,360
communities either within or

280
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:27,079
complimentary to the New York cap and

281
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:30,079
bestest program so um Nikki does not

282
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:33,000
allow reg no um does not allow offet so

283
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:34,799
a lot of other cap invest programs allow

284
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,278
obligated entities to comply by

285
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:40,599
purchasing offsets and that's as

286
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:43,078
proposed under our current public

287
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,040
information not to be a component of the

288
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:47,799
program for cap invest and that's an

289
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:49,879
important consideration for Equity

290
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:51,240
stakeholders because they want to see

291
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:53,919
those reductions happen they don't want

292
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,440
to see offsets

293
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,879
happen so there's a quick snapshot

294
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,040
timeline of where we are in this large

295
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,559
process

296
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:05,120
so the top bar blue is the regulation

297
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:07,479
development there's three regulations

298
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,519
that make up the program one is a

299
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,159
greenhouse gas reporting rule that's how

300
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,679
we get the information on how much

301
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:17,360
emissions is occurring the next is the

302
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:20,239
cap and invest rule which sets the cap

303
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,959
and the how the cap declines over time

304
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,680
it sets who is an obligated entity and

305
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,719
lots of other considerations around the

306
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:29,319
structure and function of the program

307
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,639
and the third rule is the auction rule

308
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,879
and that sets out the framework and the

309
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:37,240
procedures under which the auctions of

310
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:39,600
allowances occur so we have put out a

311
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,519
lot of initial information and have been

312
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,600
receiving feedback from the public and

313
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,839
stakeholders for a really long time now

314
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,959
and we are in this right at the cusp of

315
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:50,880
being ready to issue the regulatory

316
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:53,799
proposal so we're very hopeful that will

317
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:56,919
happen very soon and then that will kick

318
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:59,240
off a formal comment period and hearings

319
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:00,719
and we anticipate there being a lot of

320
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,799
interest and a lot of feedback and a lot

321
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,320
of comment received over the coming

322
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:07,919
months and years on how the program

323
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,760
should look um and then the FI the we

324
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:12,078
issue final regulations the reporting

325
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,559
program begins the data intake occurs

326
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:19,439
and compliance begins in green we have

327
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:21,919
the timeline for the work around

328
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,199
Investments so there's been a draft

329
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,439
framework for the Investments posted

330
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:28,879
publicly also on the cap invest website

331
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,519
we're receiving public input um to be

332
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,519
clear clear agencies are not in charge

333
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,600
of deciding where the Investments go

334
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,759
it'll all be decided through the

335
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:42,839
legislative and budget process but we

336
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:46,439
are we do want to have a framework and a

337
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:49,120
decision Point that's informed by public

338
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,959
information by public feedback on what

339
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,600
are the what are the Investments that

340
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:55,119
are important to New Yorkers like how

341
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,920
much should go to Transportation how

342
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,560
much should go to buildings in large

343
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:01,278
share like that so all that information

344
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:04,159
is also available and comments is being

345
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:06,360
um accepted on that too and then Our

346
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:09,039
intention is to develop an investment

347
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,039
proposal that we submit to the governor

348
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:11,958
so that she can incorporate that into

349
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,319
her

350
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:15,638
2025 budget process because as I

351
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,440
mentioned then this all goes on to

352
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:20,079
negotiation with the legislature as part

353
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,880
of finalizing the state budget and

354
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:25,679
hopefully we want to set forward a like

355
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:28,559
a long-term planning Horizon so Nikki

356
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:32,078
Investments have some certainty over a

357
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:35,000
rolling five year whatever multi-year

358
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:37,799
planning process so there's a a runway

359
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,519
for us to work with him so as I

360
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:41,439
mentioned the cap and invest program is

361
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,120
Big it's a large part of what the state

362
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,839
is doing but there's also a lot of other

363
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,639
policies and regulations underneath that

364
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:51,360
large umbrella program that are all

365
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,360
necessary and important to um to helping

366
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,800
us achieve the emissions reductions of

367
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,120
the climate leadership and Community

368
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:58,879
protection

369
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,879
act um and here is our my last slide

370
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:02,720
here here with all the websites and

371
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,159
email addresses and all that good stuff

372
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,360
so you can find all this great

373
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,919
information it's a lot right like it's

374
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,199
this is a lot of information it's a

375
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,519
really big program but we have posted

376
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:13,958
everything that we have that's available

377

up on the web you can see all the

378
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:18,198
comments that have been receed they're

379
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,879
all available publicly on the web you

380

on time and I'll pass the mic back to

389

Jenny I

390
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:50,318
suppose thank you Moren that was

391
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:53,360
fantastic all right thank you so

392
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:57,039
much I think that is does anybody have

393
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:00,399
any questions from Moren before we lose

394
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:04,519
her what is your biggest hope for cap

395
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:07,078
and invest for for facilitating both

396
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:09,440
greenhouse gas mitigation and Equity at

397
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:12,679
the same

398
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,199
time um that's a that's a really great

399
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:17,318
question I mean we're just we want to

400
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,399
ensure we we feel like there's a lot a

401
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:21,120
good body of evidence that demonstrates

402
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:22,958
that the emissions reductions benefit

403
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,480
the entire state of New York but they

404
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:28,078
are definitely higher in disadvantaged

405
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,440
communities but we also hear from

406
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:31,399
disadvantaged commun communities the

407
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,800
desire for a lot of certainty they

408
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:35,440
really want to know this is going to

409
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:38,240
happen and modeling is modeling right um

410
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,519
so there's a lot of other parallel work

411
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,480
that we don't are not losing sight of to

412
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:44,198
ensure that those reductions will happen

413
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,278
in those communities and that they will

414
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:48,838
realize those benefits you know we have

415
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:51,278
other requirements under the law that

416
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,600
moderate our per our permitting not just

417
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:55,159
DEC but all agencies are are any

418
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,240
administrative decisions that are

419
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:58,879
required to you know to consider

420
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,360
disadvantaged communities to put those

421
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,159
front and center so there's all sorts of

422
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,679
other mechanisms in place that we want

423
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:07,078
to use as much as possible complimentary

424
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:09,400
to Nikki to make sure that

425
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:12,279
happens okay I just want to say thank
