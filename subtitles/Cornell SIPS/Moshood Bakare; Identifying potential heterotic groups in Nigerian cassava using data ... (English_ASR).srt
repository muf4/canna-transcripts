00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,849
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,849
University

3
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:16,399
it is a pleasure to share with you for

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:19,710
the first time part of my research work

5
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:22,079
the title of my talk is RJ identifying

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,740
potential at a little group in Nigeria

7
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:29,549
cassava using using data from IT a

8
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:32,939
breeding program cassava my milk my

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,878
favorite crop belongs to a family of

10
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:40,408
four the osseous that is flowering

11
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:43,468
plants it is predominant predominantly

12
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:46,439
classified as at cost at crossing

13
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:51,689
species despite having both male and

14
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:56,039
female reproductive organ it is Llanelli

15
00:00:51,689 --> 00:01:00,408
propagated crop cassava is extremely

16
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:04,799
heterogeneous because of this

17
00:01:00,408 --> 00:01:07,289
heterogeneity nature of this crop to

18
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,500
improve the performances of publishin

19
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,530
cross is always a big challenge in

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,709
identifying the optimum parental

21
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:21,228
combinations it one possible way to

22
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:25,858
address this obstacle is to use

23
00:01:21,228 --> 00:01:29,519
reciprocal recurrent selection to wish

24
00:01:25,858 --> 00:01:33,449
you catified to through to Authority

25
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:38,280
group to optimize the performances of

26
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:41,490
the cross so the there are two main

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,228
objective of this study to estimate

28
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:46,919
additive unknown additive genetic

29
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:50,489
variance and assess the relative ability

30
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,359
in genomic medicine so the result from

31
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:56,998
this objective will be used to simulate

32
00:01:53,358 --> 00:02:01,949
progeny from parent upon Benicia know

33
00:01:56,998 --> 00:02:06,679
very well that to evaluate thousands of

34
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:09,750
progeny from a pair of cross is always

35
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:12,199
impractical in the field evaluation so

36
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:15,120
there is need for us to do two

37
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:17,789
simulation so based on this simulation

38
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,439
we are going to use USO to predict

39
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:23,069
genetic merit

40
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:26,400
of parents taught identifying authority

41
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:27,569
group so this is the general concept of

42
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,740
the host story

43
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:34,079
so we tend to have two population the

44
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:37,740
training population so this will consist

45
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,740
historical data from next gen project in

46
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:43,650
ITA breeding programs so we are going to

47
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:46,710
use those historical data to predict

48
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,140
performances of the progeny simulator

49
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:51,810
from the candidate population for the

50
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:55,229
candidate population we have to start by

51
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:58,830
identifying existing germ plasm in the

52
00:02:55,229 --> 00:03:02,489
breeding program from there we are going

53
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:04,140
to simulate F dial L among the clones so

54
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,900
we are going to simulate one their

55
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:09,569
progeny per family and we are going to

56
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,580
predict their performances by using the

57
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:14,129
historical data from the training

58
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:17,690
populations so based on the me

59
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:20,609
performances of those progeny and

60
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:24,949
genetic similarity we are going to

61
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:29,930
classify them into two Authority group

62
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:31,908
so what is name so

63
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,159
have started to pull a number of trans

64
00:03:31,908 --> 00:03:37,128
together so we have a total number of 30

65
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:41,479
trials across different evolution stages

66
00:03:37,128 --> 00:03:45,560
brony evaluation phenology TRAI advanced

67
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:48,500
atreya a uniform you try across two

68
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,269
location Ibarra Andy Keenan so we have a

69
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,509
total number of seven thousand three on

70
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:56,718
there are 42 data points so we see half

71
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:59,468
snip data's so there's need for that in

72
00:03:56,718 --> 00:04:03,049
order to capture the segregation among

73
00:03:59,468 --> 00:04:07,370
individuals within the same family so

74
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:10,159
after doing all the quality checks so we

75
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:14,299
end up having training publishing size

76
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:19,459
of 684 samples by Jeff thousand three

77
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:21,470
hundred and seventeen stigmata so we do

78
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:24,050
all sort of analysis using different

79
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:28,460
kind of applications so one of them is

80
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:30,560
similarly in our so to start with the

81
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:34,310
traditional practice for it analyzed

82
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,550
data is to do some exploratory analysis

83
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:40,668
to have idea of what your data looks

84
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,560
like so this is the boss plot and

85
00:04:40,668 --> 00:04:46,060
Instagram showing the distribution of

86
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,158
fresh fruit as you can see the data

87
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:51,978
seemed to approximate normal

88
00:04:49,158 --> 00:04:54,469
distributions and set that of Crennel

89
00:04:51,978 --> 00:04:56,779
evaluation which is a little bit skewed

90
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:59,539
to the right as you can see the point

91
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:05,899
which is the mean is a little bit higher

92
00:04:59,538 --> 00:05:08,060
than the median so for this new beta you

93
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:11,629
know is always characterized which arrow

94
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:16,280
knows value to out that it is sequence

95
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:20,120
so this is the pipeline we follow to get

96
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:23,448
rid of ireneaus values so me theta based

97
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,610
on site business Manali frequency feet

98
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:29,538
are no dead samples

99
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:32,360
main web sites and the treshold I use is

100
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:35,629
the one in parentheses so after

101
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:39,259
filtering the data so we have to impose

102
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:39,879
this claim data using bigger so I also

103
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:42,129
you

104
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:45,279
plink to convert you to dosage form us

105
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:47,490
and the still have upper formats so that

106
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:52,299
we can use that to get a genetic

107
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:54,269
distance so this is the detail of how we

108
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:58,900
went about clinical data

109
00:05:54,269 --> 00:06:01,509
Kesava be a diploid organism this data

110
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:03,579
is by allelic so this is the frequency

111
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:08,949
of the first allele frequency of the

112
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:11,560
second allele so we use just a manner we

113
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:15,879
fit a formal allele frequency using one

114
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:18,670
percent for deciding on signals we use

115
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:25,050
stress hood of twenty cents so that

116
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:27,520
those sites that of 10 and above across

117
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,530
the sample should be removed

118
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:32,259
likewise we did the same thing for the

119
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:37,029
sample so we use HS order of 10 percent

120
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:39,639
so that those samples that of tempie set

121
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:42,539
and are both missing data across the

122
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:47,439
size should be removed to be excluded

123
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:54,040
for this site depth the DJ Pia is the

124
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:58,509
number of sequence rate besides so we we

125
00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:01,420
history a sort of ten a hundred soon as

126
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:04,509
those samples between ten are on

127
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:09,670
disability so those below ten rows are

128
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:13,060
the sites with low sequence error so

129
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:16,270
there are some sites that of high depth

130
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:18,519
due to probably repeat region so those

131
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:22,509
ones are also admitted so we are

132
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:25,810
interested in this region here so after

133
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:32,139
all these filtering criteria so we hand

134
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:34,000
up having na nan dasi 262 samples by

135
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:34,750
twelve thousand three hundred seventy

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,819
Marquez

137
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:44,560
so I think gaudí cleans the beta's so I

138
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:48,339
use some alhabi in our because it has a

139
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,949
kernel to stress the

140
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:55,719
relationship masteries so using the

141
00:07:50,949 --> 00:08:00,220
formula adapted from an Delma 2011 on

142
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:05,110
fire and a 2008 so is the relationship

143
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:08,350
matrix as you can see here the so the

144
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,189
question is from these three component

145
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,160
of epistasis

146
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:14,800
which ones will I use in my models so I

147
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,320
try to come up with this correlation

148
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,020
matrices by a stretching or diagonal

149
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:24,699
element as you can see a DT by additive

150
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:26,949
is less as the list prevalence with

151
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:29,469
additive and dominance so I try to use

152
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:31,629
this as some may hug you why do you have

153
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:36,028
to use additive by additive knowing that

154
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:38,889
cassava is an artisan species so unlike

155
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:42,309
cellphone a drop like wheat where Aditi

156
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:45,340
by Heidi chief is well pronounced our

157
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:48,339
talk more on that later

158
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,970
so to start with the analysis of the

159
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,730
data

160
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:54,460
I used two stage approach so the first

161
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:57,430
approach is to analyze the phenotypic

162
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:59,950
data so frantic luna evolution trial is

163
00:08:57,429 --> 00:09:02,259
the model I used so prune evolution try

164
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:05,440
is early stage of breeding program where

165
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:07,120
we have so many lines to evaluates it

166
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:15,010
because of insufficient planting

167
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:17,289
materials so we have to use checks just

168
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:20,019
also be replicated in a few blocks and

169
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:22,179
for the other evaluation stages we have

170
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:25,329
enough planting material so you normally

171
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:28,028
use randomized design this is the border

172
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:31,839
fitted so where the JUnit herbs are

173
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:35,169
taken to be random to admit the did not

174
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:38,410
appearance and this is the prop model

175
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:41,139
fitted so you can see this is the fresh

176
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:43,750
seed is the intercept part of the Monday

177
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:46,240
and this is additive effect so the same

178
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:49,779
thing for the so we use this as a

179
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,940
baseline model so the order multiple

180
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:54,730
kernel models the in addition to

181
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:57,520
additive effect we have dominance here

182
00:09:54,730 --> 00:10:01,289
we have epistatic effect and luminous

183
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:04,588
and epistatic effect here so

184
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:06,719
so this is student eyes receiver from

185
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:09,779
the phenotypic data which is a very good

186
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:14,420
statistics to detect an outlier and this

187
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:18,120
is the the variance component estimated

188
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:20,939
from those different evolution stages as

189
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,399
you considered the receipt of a

190
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,560
landscape decline from any state to

191
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:29,759
Matassa and this is because at least

192
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:33,419
your bidding we have kind of a crowd

193
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:38,339
with a large plus size so I visited

194
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:41,838
those develop models so the feed

195
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:44,040
statistics reveal that the model which

196
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,940
incorporates additive dominance IP

197
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:50,549
status seemed to give the best petition

198
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,860
abilities so as you can see here and

199
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:56,189
this is Instagram showing the

200
00:10:52,860 --> 00:11:00,990
distribution of those prediction

201
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:05,069
accuracy so this is the I try to

202
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:06,870
partition the total variance to take the

203
00:11:05,068 --> 00:11:09,719
data Vera's in two different sources as

204
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:11,789
you can see here the terminus and the

205
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,940
piston system to contribute a very light

206
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:17,958
effect so so meaning that we cannot

207
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:21,510
ignore the importance of non-terminals

208
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:24,599
effect and which means that the model

209
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:28,799
that has additive a non additive is

210
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:31,170
likely to give you good producer for

211
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,208
genetic marriage so the lesson learned

212
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:35,429
from this lesson does the murder that

213
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:38,068
include additive and not additive effect

214
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:41,009
the degenerative mary's awkwardly and

215
00:11:38,068 --> 00:11:44,759
the dimness effect is not completely

216
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:47,610
independent of additive effects so we

217
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:49,759
need as the overlap and luminance

218
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:53,009
offends him to play a major role in

219
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:56,088
inflation fresh sheet so if future work

220
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:59,220
is to consult with ITIL research team to

221
00:11:56,089 --> 00:12:03,730
assemble the candidate pools from which

222
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:07,119
you have to from which the authority

223
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:10,089
Ruby defiles so as they need to explore

224
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:13,418
what I did the new me traditional method

225
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:14,819
to compare the result with the assisting

226
00:12:13,418 --> 00:12:17,918
ones so I need to simulate

227
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:21,159
approachability one their progeny for

228
00:12:17,918 --> 00:12:24,428
each pair of parental combinations so I

229
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:26,379
give special tasks to my special

230
00:12:24,428 --> 00:12:29,078

231
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:32,168

00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:34,409
member of general group friends for

233
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:39,418

UK here for the financial support toward

236
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:50,750
toward this research work thank you all

237
00:12:48,698 --> 00:12:56,029
for listening

238
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:56,029
[Applause]

239
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:13,669
questions have you tried these models so

240
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:15,500
you do the additive fit and then you add

241
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:17,479
it on this kernel and then you add an

242
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,610
episodic kernel you actually try to fit

243
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,610
just a dominance or Justin at the static

244
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:27,278
and compare that to the additive itself

245
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:27,278
[Music]

246
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,909
so the question is so you have this

247
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:33,860
thing where you're doing like a nested

248
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:35,778
right so you start with an additive only

249
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,759
then you have an additive plus dominance

250
00:13:35,778 --> 00:13:39,980
then you have added plus dominance plus

251
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:42,649
epistasis a question is have you tried

252
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,839
to fit just dominance or just epistasis

253
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:47,028
it's been my experience that you end up

254
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:49,700
with really similar prediction at least

255
00:13:47,028 --> 00:13:51,320
in an inbred by modeling only up the

256
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:59,600
stasis I could end up with really

257
00:13:51,320 --> 00:14:03,230
similar prediction actresses as the only

258
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,230
T I try to do is I did that early this

259
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:10,550
morning so instead of using the additive

260
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:12,950
by additive as a epistatic components I

261
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:14,719
tried to use I did buy dominance to see

262
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:18,470
what is going to happen but what I

263
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:22,190
observe is that the the process

264
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:26,120
heritability is much higher around 0.67

265
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:30,220
but when I additional policy is almost

266
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,220
the same thing with that of a DT by DT

267
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:46,169
