1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,439
This is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:12,559
University. So the title of my work is

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,638
evaluation and development of ecosystem

4
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:17,919
models to understand carbon and

5
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:20,640
hydraological processes.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,240
So as we all know uh soil it is the

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,800
largest reservoir in the terrestrial

8
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,640
ecosystem which is more than the

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,199
vegetation and atmosphere. Carbon

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,799
dioxide combined and even a small change

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:36,399
in soil carbon stock can influence a big

12
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:39,439
impact on uh climate or ecosystem. So

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,160
what is really happening in soil? Um we

14
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:45,119
want to understand to understand uh it

15
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:47,279
we use process based models and there

16
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,359
are several process based models being

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,200
developed to explain what is really

18
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:54,119
happening in the soil for like

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,920
decomposition u soil organic carbon

20
00:00:54,119 --> 00:01:00,718
decomposition but still um lots of

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,359
uncertainties still exist as we can see

22
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,079
here in the graph um no earth system

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,359
models are able to accurately estimate

24
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:11,400
or predict um solar organic carbon in

25
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:16,640
the uh terrestrial

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:19,680
ecosystem. So uh to explain um to

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,400
address these uncertainty I studied

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,640
couple of u uh processes in the

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,118
terrestrial ecosystem like microbial

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,040
models and hydraulic redistribution. My

31
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,438
first project uh chapter was a review

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,520
work which I reviewed more than 70

33
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,039
microbial models and the next two

34
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,759
chapters I studied hydraulic

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,159
redistribution which um I'm very excited

36
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,560
to present

37
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:46,719
today. So first uh microbial

38
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,320
models. So what is a microbial model? uh

39
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:51,039
when we compare it with conventional

40
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,758
model conventional model they don't have

41
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,240
microbial biomass pool here as we can

42
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,079
see but in microbial model they are

43
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,359
explain representation of microbial

44
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:04,239
model microbial

45
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:07,000
biomass and uh in the recent uh uh

46
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:09,919
decades because of the advancement of

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,479
microbiology we can see uh there is a

48
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:16,479
recent a very high number of development

49
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:19,119
of microbial models um yeah in latest

50
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:21,280
20th century we have more than 60

51
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,920
microbial models developed. So it was

52
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,959
very important to review what is

53
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:28,958
happening uh in the microbial models uh

54
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:35,159
scenario. So to put forward I developed

55
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,000
these ident

56
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:40,079
objectives that is to identify and

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,439
characterize the major microbial

58
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,280
processes incorporated in microbial

59
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:47,680
models to elucidate the environmental

60
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,519
factors influencing microbial processes

61
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,719
and to identify the challenges

62
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,640
associated with microbial

63
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:57,039
models. So after reviewing more than 70

64
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,518
models, I found that there are four

65
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:02,000
micro major microbial processes that has

66
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,560
been incorporated in microbial models

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,639
that is microbial biome microbial

68
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,640
mediated decomposition, mineral

69
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,119
interaction, microbial necroass

70
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,359
recycling and active and dormant

71
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,719
microbial

72
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,360
dynamics. One by one I would like to

73
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:20,719
explain all these microbial processes.

74
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,640
Uh the first major process is microbial

75
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:25,280
mediated decomposition of solonic

76
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,079
carbon. uh there are several

77
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,598
mathematical equations how these

78
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,440
microbial uh mediated decompositions

79
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:32,439
have been represented in microbial

80
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:36,799
models

81
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:39,280
like so I I am trying to explain here u

82
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,159
like zero order the first one is zero

83
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,000
order microbial model as the name

84
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:47,120
suggest even there is a representation

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,759
of microbial biomass in the model this

86
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,080
biomass does not actively participate in

87
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:55,439
the decomposition equation so the

88
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,599
decomposition rate uh does not depend on

89
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:02,158
microbial biomass. So I named it zero

90
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:04,000
order microbial uh model. Then um then

91
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,919
the next one first order microbial

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,560
model. Here the microbial

93
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:12,559
biomass was directly related with the

94
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,799
decompositions as a linear fashion. So

95
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,959
uh the decomposition was linearly

96
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,918
related. So I named it as first order

97
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,959
microbial bio model. Then there are

98
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:25,959
several nonlinear microbial model. um

99
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:29,319
that are represented by forward mikles

100
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:32,560
mainten. Uh in the forward mucus

101
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:35,839
mainten the decomposition is u limited

102
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,600
by substrate s here represents uh the

103
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:42,239
amount of solonic carbon present in the

104
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,720
soil. So the decomposition rate it um it

105
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,280
is limited rate limited by substrate

106
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,560
whereas in reverse makement the

107
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:53,519
decomposition is um rate limited by

108
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,519
enzyme microbial

109
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,120
enzyme. Then uh combining all together

110
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,319
most of the microbial models they are

111
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,560
represented by

112
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:06,319
nonlinear equation. So like here we can

113
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,800
see most of them are represented by

114
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,439
nonlinear and only few models were

115
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:16,240
represented by linear models either

116
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:19,800
first order or zero order model.

117
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:23,478
So what um in the conventional model

118
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:27,280
again conventional model assumes that

119
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:30,599
the Z the decomposition of any solar

120
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:34,559
carbon it is not limited by microbial

121
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,720
biomass and uh they implicitly assume

122
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,959
that the decomposition of carbon

123
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:44,560
substrate um is different than like

124
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,839
active soil carbon pool slow carbon soil

125
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,918
carbon carbon pool and passive soil

126
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:53,119
carbon pool. So these uh these are

127
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:56,918
conceptual biomass soil biomass uh yeah

128
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,759
soil carbon pool in the soil

129
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:02,560
um those have different decomposition

130
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,960
rate. But in microbial biomass uh the

131
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,038
soil organic carbon they have different

132
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,279
decomposition rate because some solici

133
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:11,599
carbon are attached to microbial

134
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,399
attached to mineral component and they

135
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,240
are not actively available for

136
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:19,159
decomposition that's why they have they

137
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,759
are not taking part in the

138
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,479
decomposition. Then um if there is a

139
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,360
microbial biomass in the model what is

140
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,959
happening with the microbial

141
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:34,160
biomass in some microbial model they

142
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:36,399
pushed forward um they added sorry

143
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,039
uh they added one more carbon pool that

144
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:41,519
is microbial necroass that that contains

145
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,519
dead organic dead microbial biomass and

146
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,399
also enzyme secreted by microbial

147
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,159
biomass because these dead microbial

148
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,198
necroass they have different

149
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,240
decomposition rate than uh plant residue

150
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:57,478
or other sologic carbon pool uh because

151
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,720
of different carbon nitrogen

152
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:03,439
ratio. Then uh some models also assume

153
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,639
that some microbes they are smart. uh

154
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:09,759
when the environment is not favorable

155
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,000
they can go into dormant uh phase and

156
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,639
the these dormant microbial biomass they

157
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,800
will not actively participate in

158
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,879
decomposition and when we have favorable

159
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,879
environmental condition they again

160
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:25,639
switch to active microbial biomass and

161
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,639
start to decompose so organic carbon

162
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:33,199
uh in microbial model um these processes

163
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,280
are also influenced and affected by

164
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,160
environmental controls. Most of the

165
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:40,559
models they uh use three main

166
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,800
environmental controls soil temperature,

167
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:49,199
moisture and pH uh with varying u

168
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:52,879
functions um to represent in the model.

169
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:56,720
But uh even these cons uh these are very

170
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,399
like um microbiology based microbial

171
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,639
model development still there are

172
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,598
several challenges associated with

173
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,720
microbial models like first one uh

174
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:09,199
microbial model core biggest assumption

175
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,800
is that uh the decomposition of soil

176
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,919
organic carbon it is limited by

177
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,879
microbial biomass. But some studies they

178
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:20,318
suggest that micro that some organic

179
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:23,120
carbon they are limited by abiotic

180
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,680
factors like mineral in the soil. So we

181
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,840
need some experiment to prove that the

182
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,639
decomposition of sol organic carbon is

183
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:33,360
limited by microbial biomass and more

184
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,240
observation data is needed to constrain

185
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,879
more microbial models parameter. And the

186
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,200
third incorporation of more processes

187
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:45,439
makes the model too complex to constrain

188
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,399
parameters. So in conclusion u I found

189
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,880
these four processes microbial mediated

190
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,120
decomposition mineral uh interaction

191
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:57,600
microbial necrom active and dormant

192
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,360
physiological states and um like even

193
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,959
these four processes they are

194
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,879
represented by several mathematical

195
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:07,359
equations. It means same uh processes uh

196
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,439
we have very difficulty and they are

197
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,159
uncertainty in translating these

198
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,000
knowledge into model and the highest

199
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,159
biggest recommendation is we need

200
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,720
datadriven model development and

201
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:22,519
parameterization for highly recommended

202
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:26,399
to improve uh prediction of microbial

203
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:28,879
models. So uh now next two chapters I'm

204
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,120
very excited to present my modeling work

205
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:33,278
that is uh hydraulic grid distribution

206
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,959
chapter 2 and chapter 3. Uh in the

207
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:37,838
chapter two I will discuss about

208
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,599
hydraulic red distribution um decreases

209
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,240
with precipitation magnitude and

210
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,680
frequency in a dryland ecosystem. It is

211
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,680
a uh data model fusion approach. So

212
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:52,559
first what is hydraulic redistribution?

213
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:56,399
Um it is a vertical movement of water um

214
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:59,439
among soil layers u by root from wet to

215
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:02,559
dry soil layers at night time mostly

216
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:06,240
diven by water potential gradient water

217
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:08,958
can move from deep soil layer where we

218
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,200
have more water to shallow soil layers

219
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:13,599
at night time preferably mostly at night

220
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,079
time when we don't have transpiration

221
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,560
and downward hydraulic redistribution

222
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:20,639
can happen when there's a rainfall and

223
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,278
top soil layer have more water water

224
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:25,799
than the deep soil layers. So downward

225
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:28,958
hydraulic red distribution can

226
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:32,559
happen. So it is not a conceptual based

227
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:36,078
uh process. Uh we it is really

228
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:39,278
identified in the field. It can be seen

229
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:41,919
by using root slux uh measurement where

230
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:45,039
we install some sensors in the uh in the

231
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:48,000
lateral roots and we detect water is

232
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:50,039
moving from away from root uh to the

233
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,919
soil. So these

234
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:56,000
negative these negative lines um below

235
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,879
zero they represents that water is

236
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,799
moving away from the root that we found

237
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:05,439
um the presence of hydraulic

238
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:07,439
redistribution in our study site but uh

239
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,440
this is one tree location. Uh the

240
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,519
magnitude of hydraulic redistribution is

241
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,000
still uncertain and there has been

242
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,519
several studies conducted and still

243
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,919
magnitude uh is a debatable

244
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:23,278
topic. So uh to improve hydraulic red

245
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:27,439
distribution representation in model um

246
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:30,720
I use uh one classic uh hydraulic red

247
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,480
distribution model to my to uh process

248
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,639
based ecosystem model that is chico

249
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,039
which I will explain. Uh the main

250
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,679
purpose of this study was to uh

251
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:43,039
realistic uh implementation of hydraulic

252
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:45,359
redistribution in a model. So for the

253
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,199
objectives of this study was to

254
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,919
incorporate hydraulic redistribution

255
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,000
process into an ecosystem model

256
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,000
constrained by observational data

257
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,159
through data estimation technique and

258
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
then to identify the key mechanisms uh

259
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,559
determining the presence and magnitude

260
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,559
of hydraulic redistribution then to

261
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,119
quantify the dynamics and hydro of

262
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:07,679
hydraulic redistribution across multiple

263
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,919
soil depth.

264
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,479
So this is uh some uh information about

265
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:16,000
the study site. Uh the mean annual

266
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:19,440
temperature was uh 10.5° C. Annual

267
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,639
precipitation 170 to 400 mm. The soil

268
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,639
type is uh sandy

269
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:32,000
loom and the vegetation mostly 60 to 80%

270
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:35,200
is juniper pinion in our study side. So

271
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,720
to implement a realistic process in a

272
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:42,079
model, we need uh these three steps to

273
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,399
fulfill that is first structure uh we

274
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:46,799
should have a correct representation of

275
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,440
equation in our model that I added

276
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:52,399
hydraulic redistribution process in our

277
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,279
ecosystem model. Then parameterization I

278
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,320
use data simulation technique u to

279
00:12:55,278 --> 00:13:01,360
optimize parameters to represent our

280
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,240
study site and external forcing uh like

281
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,680
precipitation temperature uh for the

282
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,079
realistic

283
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:12,799
projection. So this is the toco model uh

284
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:15,759
that is terrestrial ecosystem model uh

285
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:19,199
it presents an ecosystem for a field

286
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:21,200
fail study site. uh it has all the uh

287
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,680
components like canopy model

288
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,160
photosynthesis where is happening

289
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:29,519
photosynthesis transferring to leaf stem

290
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:31,078
and roots then um these biomass going

291
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,320
into the

292
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:36,799
soil liter formation and then we also

293
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,480
have soil water dynamics. So I added

294
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:43,519
hydraulic redistribution uh in our soil

295
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,879
water dynamics module. The soil water

296
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:49,759
module was balanced by unsaturated water

297
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:52,480
flow, evapor evaporation, transpiration

298
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:52,480
and hydraulic

299
00:13:53,159 --> 00:14:00,159
redistribution. This is a very important

300
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:02,720
uh uh unsaturated water flow. How water

301
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,799
usually flow in the soil. uh this is

302
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,440
represented by Darcy equation or also

303
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,479
known as U Richard's equation where

304
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,959
water moves because of this u water

305
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,720
potential gradient and plus one here

306
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:18,399
represents the gravity. So water is

307
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,079
moving among the soil layers uh like

308
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,519
deep in the soil layer through two uh

309
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:25,278
two processes u based on water potential

310
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,000
difference it can move upward and

311
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:32,198
downward and plus one uh it will al

312
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,360
always go downward through gravity. So

313
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:37,039
uh and this uh this K represents

314
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,000
hydraulic conductivity which was

315
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:44,719
represented again by uh Brooks and Corey

316
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,958
model. Um uh the Z colorcoded parameters

317
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,000
I used data simulation to optimize these

318
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:54,000
parameters using soil water content data

319
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,839
I had uh from the yeah from the field.

320
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,120
Then the this process uh all about this

321
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:03,600
process hydraulic distribution

322
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:06,399
model it is represented by CRT that is

323
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,000
maximum radial soil how much uh plant

324
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:13,919
root is allocated in the soil layers.

325
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,839
Then u it is difference between water

326
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:19,039
potential gradient between the soil

327
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,360
layers. Maximum u yeah the ci represents

328
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,198
relative soil root conductance how much

329
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,480
soil and root they are connected with

330
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:29,359
each other and RI they are the root

331
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,560
fractions available in each soil layers.

332
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,879
DAN it control it is a switch because

333
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:37,679
hydraulic rate distribution it happens

334
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:40,958
only night time. So

335
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:43,120
uh this dan has two values zero or one.

336
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:46,159
At night time it will become one. At day

337
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,560
time uh it will be zero. And this is

338
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:49,600
controlled by solar

339
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:52,078
radiation. So if there is a solar

340
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,480
radiation it will assume the model will

341
00:15:52,078 --> 00:16:00,359
assume it is a daytime. If not then

342
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:03,360
nighttime. So uh this is the model

343
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,800
lizard. Uh the black line it represents

344
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,320
observation. blue it is to plus

345
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,198
hydraulic red distribution that is

346
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,600
modified model and default TCO means

347
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:16,159
without adding hydraulic red

348
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:18,480
distribution. Here we don't see the much

349
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:21,198
improvement but if we see more closely

350
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,519
we can see the blue line that is

351
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:25,198
modified model it is aligning well with

352
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,600
the observation

353
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:30,639
um and also hydraulic redistribution

354
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,480
model does not is not active all the

355
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,720
time. we need to find out what time

356
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:39,480
period at what environmental condition

357
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:42,560
it is active. So if we see RMSSE error

358
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:46,480
here the first column is it represents

359
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:47,919
the RMSSE for whole time period. Um not

360
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,959
much improvement, little bit improvement

361
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:53,679
but not much. Mostly at dry period we

362
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:55,919
see a major improvement in model uh

363
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:58,359
performance for soil for volumetric

364
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:01,439
water content and again wet

365
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:04,959
period not much improvement because this

366
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,759
dry land does not have very high amount

367
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,400
high volume of rainfall. So water is not

368
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:12,640
moving uh like hydraulic redistribution

369
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,000
is not contributing much moving water

370
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,839
from top soil to deep soil layer. But uh

371
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,078
because of dryland ecosystem water is

372
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:23,759
moving from deep soil layer to top soil

373
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:25,599
layers that what we expected here. We

374
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,038
can see here in dry period we have

375
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:30,798
improved model

376
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:33,319
prediction. This is total model

377
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:37,038
simulation. Here we can see dal

378
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:38,279
um uh dial HR simul hydraulic

379
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:41,440
redistribution

380
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:44,720
simulation. Uh one note I would like to

381
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,038
say TCO model it has 10 soil layers. So

382
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,839
here it represents 10 soil layers from 5

383
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:52,640
cm to 180 cm and this is the

384
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:56,399
representation how water is moving how

385
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,400
this is how hydraulic redistribution is

386
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,360
moving water from deep soil layer to top

387
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,840
soil layer. So when we don't have

388
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,678
precipitation, water is moving from deep

389
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,319
soil layer to top soil layer. These

390
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,360
these lines they are the top soil layers

391
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:13,119
of 5, 15 and 30

392
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:14,798
cm. And at the same time we are seeing

393
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,599
the deeper soil layers they are losing

394
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:20,960
water. So it also represents the water

395
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:23,918
mass balance. Similarly here u yeah when

396
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,400
we have precipitation u very little

397
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,280
amount of precipitation still hydraulic

398
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,759
redistribution is moving water from top

399
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:35,038
soil layer to deeper soil layer that is

400
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:38,079
shown in negative direction and the deep

401
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:40,798
like 30 cm soil layer it shows some

402
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:43,119
increase in water content uh in

403
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:45,440
hydraulic distribution which represents

404
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,759
deep soil layer means top soil layer is

405
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,759
moving to a deeper soil layer because of

406
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,759
precipitation

407
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:52,879
Here we see

408
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:54,960
daily hydraulic redistribution

409
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,440
simulation at different soil depth

410
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:03,240
mostly at 55 30 60 cm which I had data

411
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:06,080
to compare with. So here we can

412
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,880
see when we have precipitation hydraulic

413
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:12,558
red distribution is coming close to zero

414
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,039
and when we have dry water is like

415
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:17,759
hydraulic redistribution getting in the

416
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:19,720
very positive side. water is being moved

417
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:22,960
from deep top soil

418
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:25,679
layers. So uh again uh we wanted to know

419
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,640
h how this which mechan how how

420
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:31,600
hydraulic redistribution is working in

421
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,520
the ecosystem. So we found a uh

422
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,119
significant correlation between

423
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:37,918
precipitation and hydraulic

424
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:42,239
redistribution magnitude in the top soil

425
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:44,160
layers. we see um there's a decrease um

426
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,519
there's a negative relationship between

427
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,240
hydraulic redistribution and

428
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:51,440
precipitation. uh but in the deep soil

429
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,240
layer when we have uh much uh

430
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,679
precipitation high volume of

431
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,880
precipitation deep soil layer hydraulic

432
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,480
redistribution is getting positive which

433
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:03,559
means at high precipitation it is

434
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,798
gaining water from the top soil layers

435
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:09,519
and not only precipitation the drought

436
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:13,359
period at the in the environment also

437
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:15,519
controls um how controls the magnitude

438
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:18,319
of hydraulic redistribution so the

439
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:21,119
x-axis uh represents dry dry spell

440
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:23,519
length. How long the dry period was in

441
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:27,199
that uh between two precipitation

442
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:29,279
events. So if we have longer dry spell

443
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,080
between two precipitation events, we

444
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:34,240
have high hydraulic redistribution. What

445
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:37,079
means more water is moving from deep

446
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:40,240
soil layer to top soil

447
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:42,960
layers. Then uh because this water is

448
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,079
moving so we want we wanted to see how

449
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:50,240
it is influencing overall soil moisture.

450
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:53,599
So when we have dry condition persistent

451
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,599
dry condition water is getting so top

452
00:20:53,599 --> 00:21:01,759
soil layer is gaining more water. This

453
00:20:55,599 --> 00:21:03,918
is a heat map graph. So at persistent uh

454
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:06,960
dry condition we see increase in soil

455
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,440
moisture up to 30 cm in top soil layers.

456
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,079
But if we go deeper in the soil this

457
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:15,360
volume is decreasing.

458
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:17,678
So uh the conclusion of this uh chapter

459
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:20,079
was hydraulic redistribution improved

460
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:23,120
soil moisture prediction especially in

461
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:25,359
the top 30 cm with greatest impact

462
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:28,639
during dry periods. Surface soil

463
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:31,678
moisture increased by up to 30% during

464
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,759
dry periods. Hydraulic red distribution

465
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,159
decreased with increasing precipitation

466
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,400
magnitude and frequency but was also

467
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,039
influenced by length of dry spells

468
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,080
between rainfall events. Uh in this

469
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:45,679
ecosystem because of dry land ecosystem

470
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:49,000
we have upward hydraulic red

471
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:52,200
distribution in top 60 cm soil profile

472
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,640
became more pronounced as dry condition

473
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:59,440
progressed with rates ranging from 03

474
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,440
to2 mm per

475
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:05,280
day. Uh then the third and final chapter

476
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,880
that is investigating the influence uh

477
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,399
the uh influence of hydraulic

478
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,640
redistribution on carbon and water

479
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,880
dynamics. The overall objective of this

480
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,120
project was to quantify how much

481
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,320
hydraulic redistribution is influencing

482
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:20,558
on carbon and water dynamics of

483
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:23,839
ecosystem. So to conduct this study I

484
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:26,960
used data from two study sites. One is

485
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:29,918
from US MPJ New Mexico site. It is a

486
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:34,319
flux site where we had data for soil

487
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:36,640
water content at 5 10 30 cm and NE net

488
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:39,678
ecosystem exchange data to compare and

489
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:43,240
validate our model. Again this ecosystem

490
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:46,640
also similar pinion and juniper sandy

491
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:50,960
soil 385 mm average precipitation and

492
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,799
10.5 average temperature. Whereas the

493
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,519
second side alpine meadow it is a

494
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:58,918
grassland ecosystem having mean annual

495
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:02,000
temperature 1.5 annual precipitation

496
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:04,280
760 different type of soil lom soil

497
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,440
vegetation yeah against

498
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:11,200
grassland we have soil water content at

499
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,120
5 10 20 and 40 cm. So the model was

500
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:17,000
calibrated using soil water content and

501
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:19,918
net ecosystem uh using data

502
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,079
simulation. So u this is very

503
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,720
interesting finding uh from the both if

504
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:27,599
we compare both sides. The first one is

505
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,319
uh still dryland ecosystem but we have

506
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:32,719
very frequent precipitation u not very

507
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:35,200
seasonal throughout the year we have a

508
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,519
small amount volume of precipitation

509
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,600
throughout the year. So we did not see

510
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:41,440
much hydraulic redistribution in this

511
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:44,000
area.

512
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,679
So hydraulic um mostly it was still

513
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,679
upward hydraulic redistribution because

514
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:54,240
it is positive but very minimal 0 to 0.5

515
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:57,400
mm water per day moving from deep to top

516
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,599
soil layer whereas this alpine

517
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:03,200
meadow here we can see we have seasonal

518
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:06,959
precipitation only mostly at the growing

519
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,279
uh period. So um we see a significant

520
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,159
negative hydraulic redistribution means

521
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:14,480
water is moving from top soil layers to

522
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:17,960
deep soil layers that is downward

523
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,960
hydraulic redistribution.

524
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,880
So uh again uh if we see if we compare a

525
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:35,440
model result with observation at US MPJ

526
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:38,000
site we don't see much u effect in ne

527
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,360
data uh ne simulation model simulation

528
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,240
with and without hydraulic red

529
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,240
distribution red color line is uh

530
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,120
modified model with hydraulic red

531
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:50,640
distribution blue is without uh we see

532
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:52,839
little bit change um but not much

533
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,720
substantial so

534
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:58,639
u we also see some improvement in model

535
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,640
simulation when we added hydraulic

536
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,400
redistribution but again not much

537
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,038
hydraulic redistribution decreased

538
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:10,240
carbon dioxide uptake from atmosphere

539
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:12,759
during April to June by 0.03 to 0.2 2 g

540
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:16,640
carbon per meter squared per day in

541
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:18,879
average.1 g u. Yeah. So at this site

542
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,720
because of uh very frequent

543
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,559
precipitation we did not see much effect

544
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,640
of hydraulic redistribution happening in

545
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:30,639
this site. But uh if we see u second

546
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:33,320
site alpine meadow uh we see some

547
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,320
difference in with and without hydraulic

548
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:36,319
redistribution.

549
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:42,240
Um after adding hydraulic distribution

550
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:44,879
in the model we saw a little bit

551
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:49,880
improvement overall improvement in hydro

552
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:53,200
model simulation R square value 044 to

553
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,960
A48 but uh if we see at particular time

554
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,558
period because hydraulic redistribution

555
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,960
does not work all the time throughout

556
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:01,918
the year we need some particular time

557
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,319
when it is most prominent in the uh

558
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,600
ecosystem. So I found these two time

559
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:10,960
periods.

560
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:13,038
Um so this uh here we see hydraulic

561
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,960
redistribution decreased carbon dioxide

562
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:17,119
uptake from atmosphere during April to

563
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,679
June that is early growing season by

564
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:24,239
0.07 to 0.53 g carbon per meter squared

565
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,240
per day. Uh if we compare with the

566
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,120
hydraulic redistribution because water

567
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,359
is moving from top soil to deep soil

568
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:33,519
layers. So hydraulic redistribution is

569
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:36,079
reducing water content in the top soil

570
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:39,720
layers. That's uh that is the reason we

571
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:42,960
see reduced carbon dioxide

572
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:46,558
uptake. But if we see here there was a

573
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:50,240
gap um even in this growing period if we

574
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:52,399
have a gap of precipitation we see model

575
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,558
um during late growing season hydraulic

576
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:58,400
redistribution increased uh carbon

577
00:26:54,558 --> 00:27:02,158
dioxide uptake by 0.4 4 to 0.31 g per

578
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,400
meter squared um per day because we can

579
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,640
see there is reduced in downward

580
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,320
hydraulic

581
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,559
redistribution water there is not much

582
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:13,519
change in

583
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:15,918
water. Yeah. So again we wanted to see

584
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:17,519
how how hydraulic redistribution is

585
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,559
affecting water dynamics of the

586
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:23,158
ecosystem. At US MPJ site we did not see

587
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:26,158
much um influence of hydraulic

588
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:29,200
redistribution but at alpine meadow we

589
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:31,600
see at early growing season there is a

590
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,880
reduce in available soil moisture

591
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:34,639
because of downward hydraulic

592
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,919
redistribution and then hydraulic

593
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,520
redistribution reduced ET that is evapo

594
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:45,440
transpiration here red line represents

595
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:48,480
um modified model that is TCO plus HR um

596
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,320
yeah it is matching with the data and uh

597
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:58,159
hydraulic redistribution reduced ET by

598
00:27:51,319 --> 00:28:00,398
0.7 mm uh water per per day.

599
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,640
So the conclusion of this chapter was to

600
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:04,319
um no significant hydraulic

601
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,600
redistribution and its influence on

602
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:10,398
ecosystem functions was detected at US

603
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:12,398
MPJ site likely due to two main reasons

604
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:14,239
because of frequent precipitation

605
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:16,398
there's no prolonged dry period. So

606
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,960
hydraulic red distributor did not get

607
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:21,759
activated much and also because of sandy

608
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,399
soil uh sandy soils the water moves very

609
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:26,798
fast uh through the through the soil

610
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:29,359
profile. So there was not much retention

611
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:30,839
of water in the sandy soil. But at the

612
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,798
alpine meter due to seasonal

613
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:35,678
precipitation model pred prediction

614
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:38,720
suggest downward hydraulic

615
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:42,480
redistribution of magnitude of up to

616
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:46,600
0.22 22 mm water per day and decrease in

617
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:50,720
carbon dioxide uptake ranging from 03

618
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:55,599
to.32 g carbon and it also reduced at

619
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:57,000
some time period of ET up to 7 mm water

620
00:28:55,599 --> 00:29:00,879
per

621
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,038
day. Uh and the take-home message from

622
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,760
all of my three chapters like first

623
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:06,839
chapter it is microbial models. uh the

624
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:09,480
biggest

625
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:11,439
uh recommendation or suggestion was to

626
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,440
datadriven model development and

627
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,440
parameterization are highly recommended

628
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,240
to improve the prediction of microbial

629
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:21,519
models. from uh second and third

630
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,000
chapters. Uh precipitation pattern and

631
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:26,558
soil texture are the stronger drivers of

632
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
hydraulic redistribution than biome

633
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:32,798
itself because we saw a two uh same kind

634
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,880
of biome precipitation is influencing

635
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:36,200
hydraulic redistribution. And then the

636
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,200
incorporation of hydraulic

637
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,960
redistribution could

638
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,240
improve

639
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,480
somewhat little prediction of uh

640
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,839
ecosystem functions at extreme

641
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,839
environmental condition.

642
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,600
Yeah, I would like to thank uh my

643
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:57,839
adviser and committee uh Dr. Lu, Dr.

644
00:29:53,599 --> 00:30:02,079
Santosu and Dr. Scott Stein Snider, Dr.

645
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:03,158
Leen Jang and all uh my collaborators

646
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:06,720
and

647
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:08,840
friends. Yeah, if we have time, yeah,

648
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,640
I'm happy to take question. Thank

649
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:15,158
you. Yeah, thank you Anish. Um, I was

650
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,799
wondering mostly regarding your second

651
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:20,880
chapter. So, how would you say if we

652
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:24,000
think about the potential for climate

653
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,919
change to have longer dry periods and

654
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,359
and um, you know, potentially having

655
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:32,159
those, you know, droughts that are are

656
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:34,639
are for longer? So how would you say

657
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,360
that would I guess it would increase the

658
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,200
importance of including um the hydraulic

659
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:42,079
bre distribution in models but how do

660
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,200
you think that would be likely to affect

661
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:46,960
uh anything? So your question is how it

662
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,120
will affect uh when we have climate

663
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,960
change longer drought period. Yeah,

664
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:52,879
besides that we should maybe include it

665
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:56,240
more in models like it seems like more

666
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:58,960
important then to include

667
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,240
means if uh yeah if we have more drought

668
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,240
period I think uh that is beneficial to

669
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,200
add hydraulic redistribution because as

670
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,839
we have more uh drought period as we go

671
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,000
further in the dry condition the

672
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:14,720
hydraulic redistribution is more

673
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,480
activated so it is adding more water

674
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,798
from deep soil layer to soil layers So

675
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,440
it is only beneficial we have really

676
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:25,679
longer dry period and also if we have

677
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,159
short dry period adding it is it not

678
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,480
also harmful uh it is also matching well

679
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:35,120
without adding hydraulic redistribution.

680
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:37,360
So adding is not harm yeah harmful and

681
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:40,879
yeah but it could help when it's drier.

682
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:44,158
Yeah thank you. Yeah.

683
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,559
Yeah. Anisha probably ask you before um

684
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,720
do you have soil moisture data do does

685
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:51,359
top layer so moisture increase at night

686
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,079
time in the observational data if

687
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:56,199
hydraulic retribution is a has a big

688
00:31:54,079 --> 00:32:00,398
impact we should see that

689
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:02,080
signal. So in uh in the soil moisture as

690
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:03,918
other literature says there should be

691
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:08,079
increase in soil moisture exactly at

692
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:11,440
night time. Uh we do see amplitude uh

693
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:13,519
like increase uh in the like 24 time

694
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,000
period we see increase and then decrease

695
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:19,200
of moisture but not exactly at night

696
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:23,839
time. our data there is some lag time

697
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:26,000
lag which shows um yeah but in the in

698
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:28,000
the hydraulic distri we assume it

699
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,839
happens mostly at night time but there

700
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,558
is some

701
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:36,959
lag soil moisture is getting highest at

702
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:39,519
11:00 a.m. like that but we do see there

703
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,558
is a amplitude fluctuation of soil

704
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:44,798
moisture. Yeah. Without without rainfall

705
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:46,480
in dry condition.

706
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:48,398
Yeah.

707
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,919
I just had a question about your

708
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:54,558
perspective on chapter one. So uh the

709
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,480
McKelis Menon style models when they're

710
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:58,240
looking at microbial biomass they're

711
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,679
usually substrate driven. So the

712
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,759
activity is sort of dependent on the

713
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,759
substrate concentration. From an

714
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:06,079
ecological point of view, we describe

715
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:08,158
that as as bottom up. So you're limited

716
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:11,278
by the substrate. But there's another

717
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,440
model where you could be top down where

718
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:15,679
the growth of the activity is driven by

719
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,440
consumption by like a predator or a

720
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:22,000
virus, ciliates, neatodes. So in a top

721
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:25,038
down system, you sort of uncoupled from

722
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,960
aisment kinetics because now it's the

723
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:29,200
rate of consumption and the microbes

724
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,600
grow to keep up. So it could change the

725
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,840
efficiency and then change basically the

726
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:35,759
amount of necroass that you get. Did you

727
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:38,398
encounter any models or were there any

728
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:40,398
sort of recognition of this top down

729
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:42,558
versus bottom up issue in the models

730
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:46,798
that you explored?

731
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:50,678
Uh u uh unfortunately no I did not see

732
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:54,000
uh this u maybe it is more

733
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:56,720
bio microbiology side paper I have to

734
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,919
review. uh this was more uh ecological

735
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,000
side pure modeling works so I think more

736
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,399
time we will need a modeling side they

737
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,960
need more time to incorporate those

738
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:08,878
understanding u my my sense is that

739
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,280
they're mostly based on Michaelis meton

740
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:14,719
but you've read many more papers on this

741
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,960
topic than I have so value your opinion

742
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:21,480
thank you yeah thank you right thank you

743
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,480
so much and thank you all

744
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:29,800
this has been a production of Cornell
