1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,879
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:10,230
University thanks for having me

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:13,019
I just told Greg I need to apologize

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,269
that this is a veggie focused talk so my

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,448
appointment is all specialty crops I

6
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:21,269
plan on working in perennial perennial

7
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:23,130
fruits and small fruits as well but I

8
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:25,469
would say my thinking is a little more

9
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:36,948
mature when it comes to what I might do

10
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:39,478
in vegetable crops focus so rather than

11
00:00:36,948 --> 00:00:41,460
kind of walk through and give you the

12
00:00:39,478 --> 00:00:43,079
details of what I'm thinking about doing

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,539
what I've already started

14
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,939
maybe so what I've done in the past I

15
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,039
thought it might be a good approach to

16
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:52,858
share with you kind of how I think about

17
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,889
weed management problems in a more

18
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:59,118
general way and kind of dive into some

19
00:00:55,889 --> 00:01:02,069
concepts and some theories that really

20
00:00:59,118 --> 00:01:05,810
inform my thinking about about weed

21
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:09,149
management and so that's my plan and

22
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:10,859
we'll see I typically talk to extension

23
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:13,259
audience and so you don't really dive

24
00:01:10,858 --> 00:01:15,239
into theory when you're talking to two

25
00:01:13,259 --> 00:01:17,489
growers but I thought this might be a

26
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:18,739
nice opportunity to do some of that with

27
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:24,419
you guys

28
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:26,310
so you know you would think that you

29
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,890
know there's really only one goal when

30
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,070
it comes to management and that's we

31
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,829
want to kill as many weeds as possible

32
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:37,169
but there is some underlying theory and

33
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:39,868
how we design tactics to do that and

34
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,539
from an ecology standpoint we have

35
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:44,009
broader goals as far as what we want to

36
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:48,748
get out of our weed management programs

37
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:51,629
so we want to maintain low population

38
00:01:48,748 --> 00:01:54,748
equilibrium densities and/or weed seed

39
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:56,818
banks and re-emerge populations we want

40
00:01:54,748 --> 00:02:01,078
to avoid population Peaks so we want to

41
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:04,740
avoid bad years where we have you know a

42
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:07,169
huge yield loss and and huge weeds heat

43
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:09,439
rain events especially in herbal

44
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:14,689
communities and then also we want to use

45
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:17,120
tactics that prevent us from seeing

46
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:20,270
patience so specific wheeze becoming

47
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:24,080
adapted to our systems or specific weed

48
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:28,490
communities and so if that's the primary

49
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,040
goal there we go

50
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,689
we have this some we kind of have this

51
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,579
organizing framework called weed

52
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:36,439
community assembly and this has been

53
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:39,650
around for four years

54
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:41,240
a couple scientists rich Smith's up in

55
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,090
New Hampshire in Des Moines and it been

56
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,920
state of recently put a little a

57
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,550
different spin on weed community

58
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:51,139
assembly by connecting kind of the

59
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:53,540
ecological niche theory that underlines

60
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:56,119
this framework with kind of successful

61
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:58,609
ecologists ecology or disturbance a

62
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:02,659
disturbance framework and they the way

63
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:05,450
they conceptualize that is the way that

64
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:08,870
we communities come about they go

65
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:10,459
through a series of filters and so you

66
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,680
know in kind of classical ecology you

67
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:15,070
think about the niche theory is a series

68
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:19,189
of an abiotic filter that constrains

69
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:20,989
populations due to limiting environments

70
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:24,590
or disturbance or particular soil types

71
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:26,330
and biotic filters right so the

72
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:30,530
interactions between species

73
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:32,930
top-down/bottom-up but in arrabal system

74
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:35,060
so in a in a you know highly managed

75
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:37,159
system there's these additional filters

76
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,990
that we think about so the cropping

77
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:41,569
system filtering of a management filter

78
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:45,469
and they're hierarchical so the

79
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:47,209
higher-level filters constrain the

80
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:49,280
communities that pass through and then

81
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:53,449
also kind of constrain what options we

82
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,270
have for management at lower levels so

83
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:57,859
if we think about what the important

84
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:59,689
factors are and this is not an

85
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,239
exhaustive list of kind of what

86
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:05,050
encompasses these filters but when I

87
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,879
think about this hierarchical filter

88
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:09,469
here I think about the factors that

89
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:12,620
contribute to the weed species pool that

90
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:15,729
we have at the field level and so that's

91
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:18,649
a function of both tropical pressure so

92
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:22,120
species coming into the environment sea

93
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:25,159
bank legacies of annual weeds and then

94
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,740
perhaps shifting climate patterns you

95
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,588
see some of that already occurring as we

96
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,439
see some

97
00:04:28,588 --> 00:04:34,468
new species meaning moving north and

98
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,959
latitude property or pressures a big one

99
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:39,528
now typically we think that it's really

100
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:43,559
the seed bank legacy that matters but

101
00:04:39,528 --> 00:04:45,358
with this kind of emerging problem of

102
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:48,389
herbicide resistant weeds they're

103
00:04:45,358 --> 00:04:51,318
getting spread over the region proc

104
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:56,249
you'll pressure is an important

105
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:58,319
important factor so the cropping system

106
00:04:56,249 --> 00:04:59,999
so that's really what is the design of

107
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,499
your crop rotation

108
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:03,869
how many crops you have a notation

109
00:05:01,499 --> 00:05:06,539
whether they're life cycles winter

110
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:09,089
annual summer annuals they're growing

111
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:11,428
season length the type of fertility

112
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:14,668
inputs that are particular to that

113
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:17,038
system and then really this is this is

114
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:18,598
kind of the important one so that when

115
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,748
you think about kind of the management

116
00:05:18,598 --> 00:05:23,699
filter this is where we kill the weeds

117
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:25,349
right and so typically we're either

118
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:28,699
using herbicides broad-spectrum

119
00:05:25,348 --> 00:05:31,168
herbicides selective herbicides or

120
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:36,899
tillage and cultivation or a combination

121
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:39,228
those those tools and these are high

122
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:43,829
disturbance intensity and frequency

123
00:05:39,228 --> 00:05:46,459
events and so those create the very

124
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:50,699
conditions in which leads are adapted to

125
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:54,348
so weeds become adapted to disturbance

126
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:57,899
and they also are adapted to these

127
00:05:54,348 --> 00:06:03,199
events which which we see slicing in

128
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:05,699
available resources and so you have this

129
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,649
filter below it and this is really the

130
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,658
internal internal dynamics this is the

131
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:13,098
this is where the ecology happens that

132
00:06:09,658 --> 00:06:18,569
crop competition bottom-up top-down

133
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:21,658
level processes and so if we're thinking

134
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:24,199
about achieving those goals of

135
00:06:21,658 --> 00:06:27,658
preventing adapted species in our system

136
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:30,119
what we really need to do is lower the

137
00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:34,709
intensity of these disturbance events so

138
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:38,899
rely less on herbicides or tillage the

139
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:42,870
combination of both and rely more on

140
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:44,550
these filters above that

141
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:48,930
these processes so at the cropping

142
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:51,480
system level by diversifying crops and

143
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:55,019
the rotation the life cycles that we use

144
00:06:51,480 --> 00:07:01,980
and then also increasing kind of the

145
00:06:55,019 --> 00:07:04,079
biotic control control levels so once

146
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,509
you start tinkering with the cropping

147
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,759
system to only achieve

148
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:10,349
butwe management objective that's where

149
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,019
you run into issues because once you

150
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:16,550
start doing that you start tinkering

151
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:18,930
with that type of thing you are

152
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:21,569
influencing other components of the

153
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:24,990
system that we care about so that's why

154
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:26,670
when you think about taking that type of

155
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,829
diversified weed management approach

156
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:32,310
it's important to look at that in the

157
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:36,000
context of kind of the entire system and

158
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:40,170
so using kind of the agro ecology system

159
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,259
framework is really important for doing

160
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:44,790
that so you know I really ecology

161
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:47,129
principles are really based on just

162
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:51,300
minimizing and reducing external inputs

163
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:54,600
and relying more natural processes or

164
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:57,060
ecological processes to achieve both

165
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,640
pest management objectives and and soil

166
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,889
management or totality management

167
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,979
objectives so if we're changing tactics

168
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:08,430
to manage weeds in order to really

169
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:10,759
enhance biotic pest regulation we may be

170
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,720
producing trade-offs for other

171
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,860
components of the system that we care

172
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,780
about so increasing soil quality

173
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:22,740
increasing the efficiency of cycling

174
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:27,389
nutrients water conservation all those

175
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:30,090
factors and so the way I see it is you

176
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:32,639
know thinking about designing new ways

177
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:35,429
to manage weeds diversifying weed

178
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:37,889
management tactics the response to the

179
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:41,609
weeds is just as one response it's

180
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:43,100
really a multivariate response surface

181
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:46,470
that includes

182
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:49,950
dynamics related to soils and and other

183
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:53,730
pests and so these are these are the

184
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:55,278
goals that we think about when we're

185
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,188
thinking about adopting more

186
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:01,188
really ecologically based pests and

187
00:08:58,188 --> 00:09:02,778
fertility management and this is the one

188
00:09:01,188 --> 00:09:06,498
I think about a lot these days and

189
00:09:02,778 --> 00:09:09,730
that's how do we design systems that are

190
00:09:06,499 --> 00:09:11,899
resilient that have capacity to adapt to

191
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,319
disturbance and so we think about this a

192
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:18,828
lot in terms of climate change so

193
00:09:14,318 --> 00:09:20,948
systems that that can adapt to changes

194
00:09:18,828 --> 00:09:26,328
in the climate but also it could be

195
00:09:20,948 --> 00:09:32,208
pests so that our resilience against new

196
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:34,448
pest problems so if that's the goal for

197
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:37,969
you know if the if the goal is to design

198
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:39,490
and evaluate we management practices

199
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,350
that accomplish those types of

200
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:45,769
objectives that's much different than

201
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:47,629
traditional weed science work and it's

202
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:50,350
because you know we can if we're

203
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:54,170
thinking about evaluating new herbicide

204
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:56,839
product we can pretty confidently come

205
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:59,568
up with what we think is the response

206
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:03,500
from a weak community standpoint this

207
00:09:59,568 --> 00:10:06,458
particular herbicide controls these weed

208
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:10,100
species with similar functional traits

209
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:13,039
but if we're using diverse tactics or

210
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,230
creating a lot of trade-offs and I think

211
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,399
that's the real challenge for

212
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:19,579
incorporating that type of research into

213
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,528
an extension program and that how do you

214
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:23,448
how do you evaluate what those

215
00:10:21,528 --> 00:10:25,250
trade-offs are how do you prioritize

216
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:28,519
what the trade-offs are and then how do

217
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:30,289
you communicate you know how do we think

218
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:33,500
about those trade-offs to a grower

219
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:37,370
audience and the other thing is that's

220
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:40,490
the processes that play out are really

221
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:43,159
just their context dependent because the

222
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,688
ecology of each system is a little bit

223
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:46,428
different and it's going to produce a

224
00:10:44,688 --> 00:10:48,458
series of different trade-offs so

225
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:50,889
there's really a high level of context

226
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:53,239
dependency and so we don't get that

227
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:55,879
predictable response that we might see

228
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:59,178
with the herbicide if we're using the

229
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:00,589
burst tactics so I think that's that's

230
00:10:59,178 --> 00:11:03,110
something I think about and I think it's

231
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:08,180
you know we're moving into kind of a new

232
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:10,730
era of extension weed science research

233
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:13,549
away from herbicide based programs and

234
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:16,070
so thinking about what a good extension

235
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:20,089
program looks like around diverse weed

236
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:25,940
management tactics is you know a

237
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:27,889
challenge okay so I mentioned this this

238
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,500
idea that we're thinking about building

239
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:33,139
our ecosystems are resilient they have

240
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:37,450
the adaptive capacity to disturbance

241
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:41,269
weather climate or related to pests and

242
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:45,110
I've been thinking about food system

243
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:50,269
resilience lately and so that really

244
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:52,759
just broadens our thinking related to

245
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:55,519
Agra the ecosystem resilience to kind of

246
00:11:52,759 --> 00:12:00,549
socioeconomic processes and so the goal

247
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:03,710
of food system resilience is not just -

248
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:08,299
it's not about production but also about

249
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:10,070
access to foods and so it couples the

250
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:12,859
production process with distribution

251
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:16,100
channels and ties that to the consumer

252
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:18,070
and it's all about if we're if we're

253
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,899
going to have resilient food systems

254
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:24,710
people need to have access to the

255
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:26,659
diversity of products and it really

256
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:29,440
points towards redesigning our systems

257
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:35,449
around kind of locally or regionally

258
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:38,090
food economies and so you know if you

259
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:39,170
look at the factors or the processes

260
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,810
that are going to contribute to food

261
00:12:39,169 --> 00:12:44,059
systems resilience it's not just

262
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:46,129
increasing diversity in our agro

263
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:50,079
ecosystems but also increasing diversity

264
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:52,399
of distribution networks increase

265
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:55,610
dietary diversity so they're thinking

266
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,850
about nutrient-dense healthy food

267
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:02,779
systems and so the reason why I've been

268
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:04,279
thinking about this is when I start off

269
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:07,429
talking about the hierarchy of

270
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:09,649
management filters that cropping system

271
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:11,750
filter really shapes what we have as far

272
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:14,929
as available management tools for weed

273
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:17,659
management and decisions at that level

274
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:20,389
are driven by economics they're driven

275
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:21,740
by do we have a market for that

276
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:24,289
particular crop

277
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:27,289
it may make sense from breaking pest

278
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:29,149
cycles or increasing soil quality but

279
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:32,149
it's it's a non-starter if it doesn't

280
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:35,870
make economic sense and so this this

281
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:37,759
kind of framework presents kind of a

282
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:43,419
normative case for redesigning a system

283
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:43,419
that diversity is really the core focus

284
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:50,440
so that that might seem fairly academic

285
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:59,210
and in some respects it may still be but

286
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,680
there's this really interesting book

287
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,990
that was published by Lauren Lange like

288
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:04,789
a couple of years ago I was called

289
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:08,570
resilient agriculture and she went

290
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:10,669
around the country and talked to she

291
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:14,110
talked to kind of leading-edge growers

292
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:17,089
across all types of production systems

293
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:20,450
so field crops vegetables food

294
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:22,430
production systems and asked how they

295
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:27,410
think about designing their system and

296
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:31,219
in the context of resiliency in the face

297
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:33,559
of changing climate and the way she

298
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,389
summarized almost all the growers when

299
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:37,669
they talk about resilience they talked

300
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:40,069
about resilience from you Kevin hydro

301
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:44,329
ecosystem standpoint so introducing crop

302
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:46,430
diversity they all prioritize practices

303
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:49,190
that build soil quality but they also

304
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:52,609
identify these economic components so

305
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:56,960
access to high value markets diverse

306
00:14:52,610 --> 00:15:00,110
capital assets and so I've been thinking

307
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,850
about that so you know what are what are

308
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,440
the advantages and disadvantages and

309
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:07,009
challenges and opportunities in new york

310
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:10,900
if that is a long-term goal to build

311
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:13,039
more resilience in our food systems and

312
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:15,169
everybody knows new york is a

313
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,929
wonderfully diverse state when it comes

314
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:20,449
to the number of agricultural products

315
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:23,299
that we produce and so build into that

316
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:26,990
is this infrastructure this capital

317
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:28,939
infrastructure that supports all these

318
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:32,810
products we have the distribution

319
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:36,040
channels the value chain

320
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:40,129
and it's and it's pretty heterogeneous

321
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:43,219
spatially so up in around Geneva it's

322
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:46,220
pretty easy to go from a dairy farm to a

323
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:51,050
vineyard to a vegetable crop system

324
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:53,540
within just a mile or two and so that

325
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:56,809
heterogeneity perhaps presents some real

326
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:59,779
opportunities the other thing New York

327
00:15:56,809 --> 00:16:01,429
has going for of course is it's it's got

328
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:03,730
some comparative advantage when you

329
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:06,469
think about location of the consumer so

330
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:09,470
being being in the Northeast close to

331
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:12,730
the eastern seaboard where we have a

332
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:17,750
very large percentage of our population

333
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:19,879
is another advantage and we're and we're

334
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,710
thinking about this so you know I'm a

335
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:24,230
big fan of the work that Christian

336
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:27,830
Peters did hear about a decade ago

337
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:31,159
thinking about these this concept of

338
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:33,889
food sheds in New York so there's

339
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:36,169
there's kind of in this kind of a some

340
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:38,269
thinking along those lines when we see

341
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:40,789
that popping up in different different

342
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:44,179
areas as far as thinking about local

343
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:52,699
aggregation Regional Food Network's in

344
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:57,859
New York so I just wanted to try to put

345
00:16:52,700 --> 00:17:00,700
a finer you know provide some examples I

346
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:04,670
guess of what that might look like and I

347
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:07,400
you know if I haven't gotten everywhere

348
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:09,700
I wear what I would like to see in New

349
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,509
York yet but I've seen some interesting

350
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:14,450
operations and I just wanted to point

351
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:18,079
out a couple which I think demonstrate a

352
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:21,830
local adaptation to what I consider kind

353
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,899
of this resilience thinking and so both

354
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:26,019
of these examples are just down the road

355
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:30,160
from the Experiment Station in Geneva

356
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:33,379
maybe two or three miles away and so

357
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:36,590
here's one example is the hemdale farms

358
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:40,600
so Dale ham injure just outside of

359
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:46,159
Geneva and Hema jurors operate at 1200

360
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:49,409
Cal dairy and they're very invested

361
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,160
technology so they are moving more and

362
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:57,120
more of their production system to

363
00:17:52,160 --> 00:18:00,800
robotic milking parlors so they have to

364
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:04,199
rely less on labor and then they also

365
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:07,230
specialize in specialty crops and really

366
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:10,019
cabbage so these this operation is

367
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:12,240
diversified it's a dairy and a

368
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:15,750
specializes in the cabbage I didn't know

369
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:21,450
of any dairy cabbage / cabbage

370
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:25,650
operations before I came to New York but

371
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:28,140
that level of diversification is really

372
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:32,190
important so right now there's

373
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:38,160
tremendous Fox in northeastern dairies

374
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:41,070
no prices are really low and small dairy

375
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,160
producers are really struggling right

376
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:46,250
now and so you think about how from both

377
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,390
in economics from an economic standpoint

378
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,880
diversification provides sort of

379
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,230
resilience so operations like the

380
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,440
hemming juries are probably going to be

381
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:59,880
able to ride out those periods of low

382
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:02,029
milk prices and also that level of

383
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,710
diversification also it makes sense

384
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:07,529
because they've worked out on really

385
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:10,019
closing nutrient cycling loops so doors

386
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:12,049
going back out onto fields ahead of

387
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:14,940
cover crops they're heavily invested in

388
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:18,240
soil quality practices integrating cover

389
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:21,860
crops reducing tillage so when we think

390
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:26,420
about what the previous slide what makes

391
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:28,649
systems resilience crop diversity

392
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:32,009
prioritizing soil quality diverse

393
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:35,070
capital assets I think I think the

394
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:39,480
hemdale farms is a good a good example

395
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:41,669
of that the other one is Rick Peterson

396
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:45,299
and the Peterson family farms just down

397
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:47,789
the road from Dale and he's very

398
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:50,308
diversified I'm not sure how many total

399
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:52,730
acres he has but he really specializes

400
00:19:50,308 --> 00:19:56,190
in fresh market vegetable production

401
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:58,900
also grows field crops he's in close

402
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:01,750
proximity to a lot of dairies and

403
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:05,890
yes oh he can he can so field crops

404
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:08,920
locally he's also one of the largest hoc

405
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:10,780
growers in New York and he is starting

406
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,650
to grow more and more small grains major

407
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:16,649
grains in his rotation malting barley

408
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:21,009
hybrid rye those types of small grains

409
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:24,100
and his operation is about 50% certified

410
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:28,839
organic and the other 50% is non-gmo

411
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:31,719
crops so here he's diversified in crops

412
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:34,449
he grows and then also premium markets

413
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:38,200
so he has access to these really high

414
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:41,710
quality premium markets and he just like

415
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:45,130
Dale was very heavily invested in kind

416
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:47,529
of soil building practices so he thinks

417
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:49,660
about and integrates a cover crop

418
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:54,190
wherever you can in the rotation and

419
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:56,140
he's he doesn't do no-till but he's very

420
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:59,220
serious about reducing the intensity of

421
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:07,960
tillage system so he does this low till

422
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:11,200
kind of practice so to tie those things

423
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,880
together so the way I'm thinking about

424
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,750
designing a research and extension

425
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,490
program around developing diversified

426
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:22,599
weed management systems is that two

427
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:25,120
levels and it kind of corresponds to the

428
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:28,659
community assembly framework I shared

429
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:30,849
with you so at the lower level I'm gonna

430
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:35,160
be thinking about developing a diverse

431
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:37,779
set of we control tactics so combining

432
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:41,860
combining things like herbicides reduced

433
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:43,649
tillage cover crops with the goal of the

434
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:47,049
kind of overall goal of minimizing

435
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:50,500
external inputs where we can and then

436
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:52,990
also making sure that the combination of

437
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:56,109
those tactics still produce robust

438
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:58,390
weed control outcomes and then also

439
00:21:56,109 --> 00:22:02,169
thinking about all those agro-ecosystem

440
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:03,790
trade-offs so understanding and

441
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:07,019
evaluating what those trade-offs might

442
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:11,379
be related to to new tactics and then

443
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:12,730
kind of a higher level and also want to

444
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,580
work in the development

445
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:19,420
or diversified cropping system practices

446
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:21,730
um that kind of build on the strengths

447
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:26,019
of of New York and the diversity of Ag

448
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:28,450
that we have as well as kind of you know

449
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:30,519
understanding and utilizing some of the

450
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:34,420
local adaptation that are already going

451
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:38,589
on like the Peterson farm or or or the

452
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:41,140
hemdale farm and then thinking thinking

453
00:22:38,589 --> 00:22:44,519
about both you know ecological and

454
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:57,790
economic resilience by kind of using

455
00:22:44,519 --> 00:23:00,099
agro ecology practices so I thought I

456
00:22:57,789 --> 00:23:02,920
thought that I would run through an

457
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:05,169
example my previous work at Penn State

458
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:07,150
that kind of illustrates some of these

459
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:13,390
concepts let's kind of put a finer point

460
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:16,240
on that so I was at Penn State as a

461
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:19,770
postdoc for three and a half years prior

462
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:22,180
to coming here and principally my

463
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:23,950
responsibilities was as a project

464
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:27,460
coordinator for this long term cropping

465
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:29,650
systems experiment at Penn State I was

466
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:34,180
called the reduced till organic systems

467
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:36,940
experiment or rose and I came in this

468
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:38,799
project it was in his 30 years so it had

469
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,590
almost completed one three-year rotation

470
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:45,159
and then kind of helped the product

471
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:48,159
project transition into another funding

472
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:51,880
cycle where we kind of redesign the

473
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:54,519
system a little bit but the overarching

474
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,500
objective of this project was thinking

475
00:23:54,519 --> 00:24:01,150
about how we can reduce the intensity or

476
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:05,140
frequency of tillage in organic annual

477
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:07,750
field crop rotation and so when we think

478
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:11,170
about these high disturbance weed

479
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:13,869
control tactics organic field crop

480
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:17,230
production is a pretty classic case so

481
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:19,869
we rely on intensive conversion tillage

482
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:22,930
followed by frequent cultivation events

483
00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:26,529
to manage weeds and so those are the

484
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:28,539
conditions where we create adapter

485
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:30,700
we'd species are adapted we communities

486
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:32,559
so the project was really about how do

487
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:35,529
we diversify our tactics and move away

488
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:38,859
from that high intensity high high

489
00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:42,309
frequency kind of weed management

490
00:24:38,859 --> 00:24:47,129
practices so the way we did that was by

491
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:49,809
integrating and relying more on biotic

492
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:52,960
weed control measures and so the way we

493
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:55,269
did that was by growing really high

494
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,579
biomass cover crops and rolling them

495
00:24:55,269 --> 00:25:01,180
down with the roller crimper and

496
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:04,869
planting cash crops into the rolled

497
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:08,019
killed cover crop and so this is just an

498
00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:09,939
example we did this both in corn and in

499
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:13,480
soybean and so in front of corn we would

500
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:15,340
grow a batch and triticale mixture and

501
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:20,049
we would roll that down and no-till

502
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:21,849
plant field corn into it and then in

503
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:24,879
front of soybeans we would plant

504
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:27,329
Syrio rye allows your O'Ryan to get

505
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,760
really big roll that down and plant

506
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:36,149
soybeans in the end of that road mulch

507
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:38,710
and so here we're moving away from

508
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:41,290
intensive tillage conversion tillage and

509
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:44,860
we're moving away from in crop

510
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:49,409
cultivation or at least frequent in crop

511
00:25:44,859 --> 00:25:55,240
cultivation and relying on this biotic

512
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:58,650
we control measure and then we also

513
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:01,509
looked at integrating tactics so in

514
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:03,940
combination with growing high residue

515
00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:07,059
cover crops we used high residue

516
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:12,279
cultivation and so high res new

517
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:15,309
cultivation it's it doesn't convert the

518
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:18,970
soil so it leaves the residue on top

519
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:21,609
whereas traditional cultivation we kill

520
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:24,819
weeds by really mixing soil between the

521
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:26,740
rows so cultivation high res of the

522
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:29,019
cultivation is these broad flat sweets

523
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:32,650
that allow you to come in not invert the

524
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:34,650
soil but sever roots of weeds so we're

525
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:37,750
looking at that in combination with

526
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:39,820
different levels of residue and so the

527
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,599
way we were getting that is by delaying

528
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:42,759
turning

529
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:45,429
so if we terminated earlier we would be

530
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:47,970
working with lower levels of cover crop

531
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:50,710
biomass and so you can see this is a

532
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:53,350
determinate late we had lots of biomass

533
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:56,410
here we terminated about three weeks

534
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:58,269
earlier in this case lower levels of

535
00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:04,180
biomass you can see we have already

536
00:26:58,269 --> 00:27:06,609
established the cash crop so here's some

537
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:08,470
of the results from that study we just

538
00:27:06,609 --> 00:27:11,500
published some of this work and indeed

539
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:13,420
science and so I'm just gonna be talking

540
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:18,309
about the soybeans just to kind of

541
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:19,779
narrow down down the story so we we

542
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:21,779
replicated these studies at three

543
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:26,129
different locations in the mid-atlantic

544
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:29,170
Delaware Maryland and Pennsylvania and

545
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:32,680
on the x-axis here you have this would

546
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:35,950
be the different termination dates so as

547
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:37,600
you move across the x-axis you'd

548
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:39,160
beginning into later termination dates

549
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:43,029
where we'd have greater levels of

550
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:46,500
biomass and then the two shades of gray

551
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:48,639
or with or without cultivation and so

552
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,609
you know we can run this through some

553
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,320
null hypothesis testing and we were able

554
00:27:51,609 --> 00:27:55,809
to separate some means but I think just

555
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:58,869
looking at the effect size averaged

556
00:27:55,809 --> 00:28:02,259
across years and locations is really

557
00:27:58,869 --> 00:28:06,149
more informative because it points to

558
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:09,250
one of the challenges that I suggested

559
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:12,640
at the beginning of the talk and that we

560
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:16,200
see the response of these tests the

561
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:19,530
response to be really location specific

562
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:22,569
so we didn't see the same trend with

563
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:26,259
delaying terminations across three sites

564
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:30,129
we saw each each location really had its

565
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:32,650
unique response to those tactics so

566
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:35,980
that's that's one take-home and then I

567
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:38,500
think the other take-home is you know we

568
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:42,819
had a more consistent response at least

569
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:44,829
in directionality maybe not magnitude by

570
00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:47,889
with the high residue cultivation in

571
00:28:44,829 --> 00:28:51,069
comparison to delaying termination dates

572
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:54,160
and so that's pretty typical in which

573
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:56,859
and what we see we see a more robust

574
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:59,620
on sand using a herbicide or using a

575
00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:04,059
cultivator and we would see in relying

576
00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:09,879
on a kind of a biotic control measure

577
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:11,349
like cover crops so the other thing

578
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,270
we're interested in looking at is all

579
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:15,339
the trade-offs that were associated with

580
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:17,019
this so you know we were we were

581
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:20,409
delaying termination so that was a

582
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:23,049
three-week delay between the early

583
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:24,670
termination and the late termination and

584
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:27,159
we were generating different levels of

585
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:28,810
cover crop biomass and so you can

586
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,279
imagine that this create potentially

587
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:33,279
creates trade-offs related to other

588
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:35,799
pests and so one of the pests that we

589
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:38,440
had identify identifying as a trade-off

590
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:41,129
was there was this interaction with

591
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:44,049
termination date and the level of

592
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:47,520
termination efficacy with the roller

593
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:51,789
crimper and so when we terminated later

594
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:53,829
we we were terminating cereal ride

595
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:56,589
plants that eventually would produce

596
00:29:53,829 --> 00:29:58,559
motor seed and we started dealing more

597
00:29:56,589 --> 00:30:01,709
and more as we followed the rotation

598
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:05,139
with volunteer cover crops and so this

599
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:06,940
this panel here is just the rank

600
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,880
abundance of the leek community and the

601
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:12,009
seed banks and you can see between the

602
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,740
two different planting dates as we

603
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:17,710
decrease we delay termination all of a

604
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:20,890
sudden we get cereal rye popping up as

605
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:23,890
the primary species or the most abundant

606
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:27,009
species in the weed seed bank and that

607
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:31,060
produced effects in in the subsequent

608
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:34,119
cash crop so when we terminate late and

609
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:37,059
we sampled the winter wheat crop that

610
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:40,989
followed we saw higher levels of grain

611
00:30:37,059 --> 00:30:42,909
contamination so if you're taking winter

612
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:46,569
wheat as a cash grain and you take to an

613
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:49,390
elevator you're going to get docked at

614
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:50,319
the elevator for sure having that level

615
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,480
of contamination

616
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:54,558
so that was one pest management

617
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,940
trade-off

618
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:58,999
another pest management trade-off was

619
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:03,590
related to the insect community so we

620
00:30:58,999 --> 00:31:07,579
were tracking both predatory arthropods

621
00:31:03,589 --> 00:31:10,730
and also early season insect pests and

622
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:14,298
so this is a structural equation model

623
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:16,249
that I was fitting to each site and and

624
00:31:14,298 --> 00:31:18,558
each cash crop or we are trying to

625
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:20,600
identify what the yield limiting factors

626
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:24,408
were and what the interactions were

627
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:28,548
between these different variables in the

628
00:31:24,409 --> 00:31:30,139
system and so at Pennsylvania when we

629
00:31:28,548 --> 00:31:33,259
delayed the planting day we were

630
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:36,378
increasing our crab biomass but we were

631
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:39,618
also decreasing the number of predatory

632
00:31:36,378 --> 00:31:43,969
arts prawns we had in the community and

633
00:31:39,618 --> 00:31:45,769
and you know an organic system we're

634
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:49,298
relying on those predatory arthropods

635
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:52,878
for Biological control early season HFS

636
00:31:49,298 --> 00:31:57,798
so there's this dynamic where we control

637
00:31:52,878 --> 00:32:05,418
tactics are influencing pest management

638
00:31:57,798 --> 00:32:08,720
of different pests one more trade off

639
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:11,538
and again so the other thing is is all

640
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,759
these things that I'm highlighting and

641
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:16,759
all the structural equation models were

642
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:19,819
really coming out to be very location

643
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:24,230
specific and so the dynamics that were

644
00:32:19,819 --> 00:32:25,668
playing out or we're vastly different so

645
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:28,700
this example is from the Maryland

646
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:30,288
location and so this is one of the one

647
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:33,048
of the issues that we thought we would

648
00:32:30,288 --> 00:32:35,690
see but we only saw at the Maryland

649
00:32:33,048 --> 00:32:38,148
location is that when you delay

650
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:41,179
termination to really get more weed

651
00:32:38,148 --> 00:32:44,479
suppression out of your cover crops you

652
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:46,220
have more issues with consistent stay in

653
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,960
establishment so it's just tougher to

654
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,319
get a no-till drill through higher

655
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:54,740
levels of biomass and you run into

656
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:57,470
issues of not being able to open and

657
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:59,599
close the seed furrow reduce stands and

658
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:02,569
so we actually saw that to be the case

659
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:04,969
at the Maryland location where as cover

660
00:33:02,569 --> 00:33:07,379
crop biomass increased soybean

661
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:10,740
population with decreased

662
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:13,710
so again I'm just I'm providing all

663
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:17,460
these examples to really demonstrate

664
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:21,240
that while diversifying lead to fill

665
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:22,259
taxes is a really important goal if

666
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,480
we're going to develop and evaluate

667
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:25,349
those tactics we have to take really a

668
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,200
multi-variant

669
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:30,509
approach to that research and understand

670
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:36,150
what all the what is doing all the

671
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:37,980
components of the system the great when

672
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:42,269
its terminated or is it just bending it

673
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:45,360
down so it's it's a good question the

674
00:33:42,269 --> 00:33:47,039
question was about the roller the roller

675
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:50,669
crimper how does actually kill the cover

676
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:54,720
cop so it kills in two ways

677
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:56,700
sheer weight and then it actually crimps

678
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,700
the stems in multiple locations

679
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:02,460
so that chevron pattern it's going to

680
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,680
crimp the vascular tissue and and if

681
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,950
it's if the Rye is standing up nice and

682
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:11,610
tall it's gonna crimp it in three or

683
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:14,610
four spots but it doesn't always kill it

684
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:17,460
yeah it's it's it's the termination

685
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:21,180
efficacy is related to the chronology of

686
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:27,949
ceará Ryan is the grain contamination

687
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:31,859
related to cranes that do survive yes

688
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:35,519
well yeah so if you terminate too late

689
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:38,430
yeah you're at a point if you're at an

690
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:41,070
thesis and if it doesn't you don't get a

691
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:44,449
good kill it goes you know the seed

692
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:50,309
matures yeah yeah

693
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:52,859
okay so then we transition into the next

694
00:34:50,309 --> 00:34:55,860
three years and this is really I started

695
00:34:52,860 --> 00:35:00,090
really managing the project at this

696
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:02,789
point and so we we kind of made some

697
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:05,670
adaptations based on what we learned in

698
00:35:02,789 --> 00:35:11,670
the first three years and one of the one

699
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:14,849
of the changes we made was to try to get

700
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:17,280
around the trade-offs related to having

701
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:18,929
high levels of meet suppressive cover

702
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,140
crop loss but also making sure that we

703
00:35:18,929 --> 00:35:22,359
can establish

704
00:35:20,139 --> 00:35:25,210
cash crop and so we changed the way in

705
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:27,309
which we were roller crimping we went

706
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:28,900
away from the large roller crimper and

707
00:35:27,309 --> 00:35:31,570
went to these integrated rollers that

708
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:34,269
run ahead of a no-till planter and had

709
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:36,850
these really heavier-duty row cleaners

710
00:35:34,269 --> 00:35:40,599
and what that did was open up

711
00:35:36,849 --> 00:35:43,630
consistently open up a wider referral

712
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:46,630
for us to get the seed pearl open and

713
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:48,400
closed and we were still using high

714
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:49,840
residue cultivation we were using and

715
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,110
adaptively we didn't have a no

716
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,550
cultivation cultivation treatment and

717
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:57,490
the treatments that we did changed as we

718
00:35:54,550 --> 00:36:00,430
actually moved and we had this no-till

719
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:03,809
soybeans phase and in a different system

720
00:36:00,429 --> 00:36:06,099
we managed the soybeans as a tilled

721
00:36:03,809 --> 00:36:09,849
system using kind of conventional

722
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:13,239
techniques so moldboard plow ahead of

723
00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:15,039
the cash crop this is an order you would

724
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:16,989
fly and called the bait before the crop

725
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:19,019
is up and then internal cultivate

726
00:36:16,989 --> 00:36:21,189
several times and so we were comparing

727
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:23,889
what are the trade-offs between the

728
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:28,179
notes health system and full tillage

729
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:30,730
system in this case so here's some of

730
00:36:28,179 --> 00:36:33,250
the data this is so much eliminating

731
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:36,460
word honor the three years have been

732
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:41,530
completed a master's student Rebecca

733
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:43,690
champagne just finished up and so this

734
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:46,900
is totally biomass compared to the

735
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:50,860
no-till system and the tilled system in

736
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:52,150
soybeans and so you can see that we got

737
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:54,820
pretty comparable levels of lead

738
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:57,010
suppression and I should note that we

739
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,780
have different standards in organic gel

740
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:01,410
crops anything below a thousand

741
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:03,640
kilograms per hectare is pretty good

742
00:37:01,409 --> 00:37:05,649
that's probably not what you're shooting

743
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:07,900
for in a conventional system in

744
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:12,220
vegetables you definitely can't handle

745
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:13,599
that level of weed pressure but where we

746
00:37:12,219 --> 00:37:15,069
did see some differences which was

747
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,190
interest and we started collecting data

748
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:20,670
are we data between the row and in the

749
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:22,900
row it's because we really had different

750
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:25,110
between the tilled system in the notes

751
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:28,150
Hill system we had different mechanisms

752
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:30,610
going on and we saw a difference we saw

753
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:31,970
a greater proportion of the total

754
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:36,590
biomass

755
00:37:31,969 --> 00:37:39,069
was in the role in the Tilt system so I

756
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:43,490
the other thing I think is important is

757
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:44,750
again we're not decisions about what

758
00:37:43,489 --> 00:37:46,219
type of approach we're going to adopt

759
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:49,449
may not be driven by weed control

760
00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:52,730
performance in some respects they may be

761
00:37:49,449 --> 00:37:55,279
driven by how variable these systems are

762
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:57,980
from year to year so we may prioritize a

763
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,660
system where we see less we control

764
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:04,070
failures over a five or a ten year

765
00:37:59,659 --> 00:38:05,779
period and so one of the things that

766
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:08,420
we're trying to do is to partition the

767
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:10,910
variance out of the weed biomass to

768
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:12,858
understand what factors are contributing

769
00:38:10,909 --> 00:38:16,190
to the variability that you see in total

770
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:19,069
weed biomass and so so this is the

771
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:20,990
tilled system between the row and in the

772
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:24,650
row the no-till system between the row

773
00:38:20,989 --> 00:38:27,739
and integral and these are factors in a

774
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:30,440
multiple regression and these are this

775
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:32,509
is semi partial correlation so you can

776
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,710
think of it as the unique contribution

777
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:36,619
to the variance for each of these

778
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:38,329
factors and so I just want to point out

779
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:43,010
you know a couple of things that we saw

780
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:45,319
was the C Bank legacy seemed to be more

781
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:48,890
important in the tilled system and

782
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:52,849
highly disturbed system for both between

783
00:38:48,889 --> 00:38:56,118
the row and in the road then so that's

784
00:38:52,849 --> 00:38:59,480
that's an interesting pattern that

785
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:01,369
popped out there we saw a pretty

786
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,858
predictable response for in a row where

787
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:06,530
the main contributor the variability was

788
00:39:03,858 --> 00:39:09,319
how well we did as far as crop

789
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:10,400
establishment which makes sense it crops

790
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,599
for the row they were more wheat

791
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,130
suppressive they canopy close sooner and

792
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:19,700
that's what drove variability in the

793
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:22,070
toad system but environmental conditions

794
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:25,429
so just the year-to-year variability is

795
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:29,420
what really drove we control performance

796
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:31,519
in the no-till system which is

797
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:34,970
interesting because I think what it

798
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:36,858
really is is the soil conditions and how

799
00:39:34,969 --> 00:39:39,079
much disturbance we really did with

800
00:39:36,858 --> 00:39:44,079
those broke layers that was really

801
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:46,480
driving the response and weed pressure

802
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,219
and so if we can identify where that

803
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:56,010
variability is then we can make

804
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:59,199
modifications to the system okay I

805
00:39:56,010 --> 00:40:00,910
better finish up I'm gonna run through

806
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:02,589
this so that was the week and fell

807
00:40:00,909 --> 00:40:04,149
tactics and now I'm gonna have to run

808
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:07,960
through the diversified cropping

809
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:09,970
practices quickly so even if we're you

810
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,470
know we have those events and it's often

811
00:40:09,969 --> 00:40:13,839
the case in organic systems where we

812
00:40:11,469 --> 00:40:16,239
have high weeds he during rain events we

813
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:19,240
have some weed control failures like

814
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:22,089
this example with giant Fox to illness

815
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:25,089
this year and the bees this is where the

816
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:27,370
rotation the cropping system comes in so

817
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:31,990
we're rotating to a winner annual cash

818
00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:34,960
crop and we want to harvest a profitable

819
00:40:31,989 --> 00:40:36,399
crop in this case but we one of the

820
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,949
principal factors that's going on here

821
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,930
is it potentially we wanted to drive

822
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:42,399
weed seed banks down so we want to

823
00:40:40,929 --> 00:40:44,589
utilize that wary and you'd say

824
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,750
wintering any life cycle to drive down

825
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:50,289
weed seed banks so that we can go back

826
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:54,099
into summer annual or profitable cash

827
00:40:50,289 --> 00:40:56,800
crop but we are also interested in well

828
00:40:54,099 --> 00:41:00,819
can we do that and still reduce the

829
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:03,340
intensity of tillage in that phase of

830
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:08,380
the rotation so we had a system where we

831
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:11,380
actually no-till planted spelt into a

832
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:13,829
soybean stubble and we supplied the

833
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:17,289
fertility by using manure injection and

834
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:20,380
then frost seeded with a high with a

835
00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:22,480
no-till drill our cover crop into the

836
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:24,190
winter grain so we had the cover crop

837
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,679
there when we took off the grain and

838
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:28,389
that was a de foliation event which is a

839
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:30,639
weed management tactic or a we control

840
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:33,519
tactic and then we either took a forged

841
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:37,719
cut or adaptively managed it and mowed

842
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:40,690
it to eliminate weed seed production and

843
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:43,209
we had systems where with different

844
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:45,730
levels of intensity as far as tillage

845
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:48,190
goes so we had a system where we had a

846
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:50,289
moldboard plow ahead of the spelt and

847
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:52,090
then also ahead of the cover crop we had

848
00:41:50,289 --> 00:41:54,639
a system where we reduced the intensity

849
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:56,230
with the chisel plow all the way down to

850
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:57,338
this system I just described word for

851
00:41:56,230 --> 00:42:00,579
two years

852
00:41:57,338 --> 00:42:02,588
we had no-tillage in the system and this

853
00:42:00,579 --> 00:42:04,660
is what the weeds he banks the play so

854
00:42:02,588 --> 00:42:08,588
you can see each one of the systems in

855
00:42:04,659 --> 00:42:10,478
both in two different starts we were

856
00:42:08,588 --> 00:42:14,679
driving weed seed banks down a lot of

857
00:42:10,478 --> 00:42:18,038
variability but in each case regardless

858
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:20,588
of the intensity of tillage means feed

859
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:22,390
banks were declining which indicates

860
00:42:20,588 --> 00:42:25,808
that this may be a phase of the cropping

861
00:42:22,389 --> 00:42:28,598
system where we can reduce intensity of

862
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:32,798
tillage frequency of tillage and still

863
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:42,099
manage weed seed banks I'm going to skip

864
00:42:32,798 --> 00:42:46,088
this one just so I can wrap up so just

865
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:51,460
to bring it back to kind of the my plan

866
00:42:46,088 --> 00:42:53,349
I guess and so just to summarize and I

867
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:56,528
think this is a this is a rough plan

868
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:59,200
this is an evolving plan but I'm really

869
00:42:56,528 --> 00:43:02,498
thinking about if we think about kind of

870
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:04,718
the original community community

871
00:43:02,498 --> 00:43:08,078
assembly the goal is to reduce the

872
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:10,210
intensity those high intensity control

873
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:12,309
events so that's that would be one of

874
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:14,079
the goals of my research and so that's a

875
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:15,670
multi-pronged approach includes

876
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,380
herbicide stewardship so we're using

877
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:19,920
right herbicide at the right time at the

878
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:24,400
right rate there's opportunities for

879
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:26,048
precision lead control using precision

880
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,969
and edge technology that's coming along

881
00:43:26,048 --> 00:43:28,719
very interested in reduced tillage

882
00:43:27,969 --> 00:43:30,400
practices

883
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:33,909
I knew this program is that I want a

884
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:38,710
great work in this area which I hope I

885
00:43:33,909 --> 00:43:40,598
can I can work with her on and then

886
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:42,670
developing these biotic based we control

887
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:44,410
tactics so thinking about how we can

888
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:46,599
effectively integrate cover crops into

889
00:43:44,409 --> 00:43:48,969
the rotation what that means for grading

890
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:51,700
them with other weed control tactics

891
00:43:48,969 --> 00:43:55,358
like herbicides or cultivation and then

892
00:43:51,699 --> 00:43:57,608
finally evaluating and developing

893
00:43:55,358 --> 00:44:00,578
different kind of cropping system level

894
00:43:57,608 --> 00:44:03,909
diversification strategies and so my

895
00:44:00,579 --> 00:44:06,759
first I went big for my first grant

896
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:11,109
proposal and just just submitted an REI

897
00:44:06,759 --> 00:44:13,000
I submit an REI with Marc Farrell's

898
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:15,340
and Gary Bergstrom and Sarah Etheridge

899
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,550
and Miguel Gomez and so that's going to

900
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:21,309
look at thinking about ecological

901
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:25,120
resilience and economic resilience by

902
00:44:21,309 --> 00:44:27,219
utilizing these high-value winter annual

903
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,710
grains that work has been working on I

904
00:44:27,219 --> 00:44:31,419
was reading programs so the heritage

905
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:33,880
grains the ancient grains he's been

906
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:37,659
working on mantle barley all these

907
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:40,780
winter grains have premium markets they

908
00:44:37,659 --> 00:44:46,299
have secondary premium secondary markets

909
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:48,250
feed feed grade quality rings and so the

910
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:49,810
economics potentially makes sense and

911
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:52,289
then we want to look at where the

912
00:44:49,809 --> 00:44:55,389
cultural practices that kind of increase

913
00:44:52,289 --> 00:45:00,940
our ecological resilience and vegetable

914
00:44:55,389 --> 00:45:03,129
crop rotations so I about talk through

915
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:42,880
the entire time but I'll stop there and

916
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:45,670
take questions in the species

917
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,890
composition or function type composition

918
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:54,369
in your weed communities in relation to

919
00:45:47,889 --> 00:45:57,759
any of your control strategies yeah yeah

920
00:45:54,369 --> 00:46:00,179
we so the question was about shifting

921
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:14,080
either community composition or the

922
00:46:00,179 --> 00:46:16,179
functional traits so that last slide you

923
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:19,860
know this we have a really good meaty

924
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:22,449
bank data for these last three years and

925
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:24,430
so I'm just starting to dive into the

926
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:24,848
community level analysis and the first

927
00:46:24,429 --> 00:46:28,348
shot

928
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:31,059
this particular analysis indicated that

929
00:46:28,349 --> 00:46:35,650
we we were we weren't seeing dramatic

930
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:40,150
shifts in the week between in that phase

931
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:44,588
of the rotation along a disturbance that

932
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:48,039
tillage gradient and I think it could be

933
00:46:44,588 --> 00:46:50,858
for two reasons one is there's a pretty

934
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:54,759
well-established eBay legacy at this

935
00:46:50,858 --> 00:46:57,400
point and the other reason is we might

936
00:46:54,759 --> 00:47:02,469
not have sampled at the intensity we

937
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:05,318
needed to to to identify a shift in

938
00:47:02,469 --> 00:47:07,598
communities I actually think that when I

939
00:47:05,318 --> 00:47:08,889
cut the week me a question is

940
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,778
interesting from an ecological

941
00:47:08,889 --> 00:47:14,469
standpoint if we see a shift in the

942
00:47:10,778 --> 00:47:16,659
community but Biron what happens is you

943
00:47:14,469 --> 00:47:21,009
get a lot of innocuous needs in a week

944
00:47:16,659 --> 00:47:23,228
that may be jumping out and indicate you

945
00:47:21,009 --> 00:47:25,210
know showing a shift personally and

946
00:47:23,228 --> 00:47:28,509
speed well that's not a species that's

947
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:30,728
going to be yield lemonade so I think I

948
00:47:28,509 --> 00:47:33,210
what I was doing was pulling out weed

949
00:47:30,728 --> 00:47:36,639
species that we knew we know to be

950
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:39,400
abundance and potentially yield limiting

951
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:41,650
in the corn crop in the next phase of

952
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:45,608
the rotation and looking at see Bank

953
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:48,460
chef's transition rates so I think it's

954
00:47:45,608 --> 00:47:51,578
a better approach would be to look at

955
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:53,380
functional traits so mid season summary

956
00:47:51,579 --> 00:47:55,900
annual weed species what are they what

957
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:59,920
are they doing rather than looking for a

958
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:02,858
shift so we're not applying but anyone

959
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:06,219
who has further questions or would like

960
00:48:02,858 --> 00:48:09,268
to dialogue with Professor Wallace that

961
00:48:06,219 --> 00:48:15,338
you'll be around for a few minutes and

962
00:48:09,268 --> 00:48:18,368
speak to it thank you this has been a
