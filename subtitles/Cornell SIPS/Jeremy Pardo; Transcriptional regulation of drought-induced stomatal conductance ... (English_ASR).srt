1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,309
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,309
University

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:13,650
I lost identity Jeremy Pargo

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:19,259
he's from Westeros we marketed bona fide

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,920
earn bodily and improper graduates in a

6
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:22,439
couple weeks

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,310
Jeremy could go on to a ph.d program in

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,390
college at Michigan State which is great

9
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:29,219
instead our kind of transition

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,109
regulation of drugs is from our clothes

11
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:36,149
and amazed and population transcend time

12
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:41,879
this is a tiny bit of his data we really

13
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:47,700
like to work with you see within this is

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:52,560
like a creates deep pockets so thank you

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,880
as Mike said my name is Jeremy and I for

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,130
the last couple years have been working

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,500
on my honors thesis under the

18
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:01,590
supervision of Ed buckler and turn

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:07,129
barley and so what I really wanted to do

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:11,689
is look at how the transcriptome is

21
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:11,688
involved in regulating stomata closure

22
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:16,099
see how this works

23
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:26,299
there we go so let's choose the computer

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,430
because it works better and so what I

25
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:31,940
want to do is look at these three

26
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:35,868
aspects of how a plant works so the

27
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:39,228
physiology and then the transcriptomic

28
00:01:35,868 --> 00:01:41,509
so mrna and then try and integrate that

29
00:01:39,228 --> 00:01:44,478
together with some genetic mapping to

30
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:50,540
really get at how stomata closure under

31
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:52,189
drought is working and so what is this

32
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,880
d'amato closure that i'm talking about

33
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:59,000
so stow mates are pores on leaves and

34
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:04,728
plants can close them in response to

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,489
water stress to limit water loss but by

36
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:09,590
closing them they also limit

37
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:13,310
photosynthesis so it's a trade off and

38
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:16,370
the plant hormone up sighs gasps 'add is

39
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:19,129
very much involved in mediating this

40
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:21,709
response however that hormone is also

41
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:25,310
really important in controlling other

42
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:28,400
genetic responses to drought and I

43
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,319
should mention that there are drought

44
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,780
response mechanisms that are independent

45
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,759
of obsessive casted for example the

46
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,650
hormone ethylene plays a major role too

47
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:40,489
but for today I'm going to focus on

48
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:43,939
absurd gas 'add and so the plant

49
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:47,569
material that I used for my experiments

50
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:51,289
was taken from the maze nested

51
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:55,150
Association mapping population and the

52
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:58,400
lines that you see up on your screen are

53
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:02,629
the founders of the of this population

54
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:06,439
and so it's 27 in bread corn lines from

55
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:09,349
around the world that sort of represents

56
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:12,769
the diversity of maize as best as you

57
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:15,469
can with 27 lines and then you see the

58
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:17,870
two that are highlighted in red were the

59
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:22,039
parents for the mapping population for

60
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:24,319
that portion of my experiment I mean so

61
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:26,569
I conducted two separate experiments one

62
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,150
I'll refer to as the quantitative trait

63
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:31,068
mapping experiment and the other as the

64
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,590
RNA sequencing experiment

65
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:36,229
and for both of them I group plants for

66
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:38,420
three weeks and then I took the

67
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:40,548
seedlings and I start to drought stress

68
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:44,929
then and so for the quantitative trait

69
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:47,870
mapping experiment on what I called a

70
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:50,090
zero so I had three week old plants they

71
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:53,389
were well watered and I started

72
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:56,269
measuring some physiological traits and

73
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:59,000
then by day one I stopped watering them

74
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:01,549
and I kept measuring those traits each

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,620
day and finally on day four of that

76
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:06,230
experiment irie watered them and then

77
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,780
measured again see how the plants

78
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:10,548
responded and for the RNA sequencing

79
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,519
experiment it was a very similar design

80
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:16,038
but here I had two groups so the control

81
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,858
group was always well watered and the

82
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:21,529
drought stress group very similar so day

83
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:23,930
zero they're well watered plants and by

84
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:25,728
day one I withheld water and they're

85
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,310
starting to become drought stressed and

86
00:04:25,728 --> 00:04:31,969
on day one and day three of that

87
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:35,209
experiment I collected leaf tissue to do

88
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:37,400
RNA sequencing and so those

89
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:39,168
physiological measurements here's just

90
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:42,649
an example of some of the things I

91
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:45,288
measured so the white little clamp

92
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:48,079
device is a called a parameter and it

93
00:04:45,288 --> 00:04:50,060
measures the model conductance so it's

94
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,769
basically measuring the flow rate

95
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,228
through this dough mates which is a

96
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:56,288
measure of how open they are so the more

97
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:58,490
open the skull mates

98
00:04:56,288 --> 00:05:02,180
general the less drought stress the

99
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:04,639
plants are and then the other device on

100
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,400
there the little prongs is not a torture

101
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,710
implement it's a soil electrical

102
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:13,848
conductivity meter and then so I use

103
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:16,310
that to measure the water content of the

104
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:20,658
soil to get an idea of how drought

105
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:24,319
stress my plants actually were and then

106
00:05:20,658 --> 00:05:27,500
for RNA sequencing I used a method that

107
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:31,610
was adapted to plants by Carl Kremmling

108
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,810
to do 3-prime RNA sequencing and

109
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,569
basically all you need to know about

110
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:39,949
that is it's a way to cheaply and

111
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:42,879
quickly profile the RNA from a whole

112
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:42,879
bunch of samples

113
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:51,100
yeah okay so back to this physiology

114
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:53,590
mRNA and genetic mapping so first I'm

115
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:57,850
going to discuss the physiological

116
00:05:53,589 --> 00:06:01,119
results that I got and so this graph is

117
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:06,700
showing the still model conductance of

118
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:08,769
those NAMM parents and the red boxes are

119
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:12,279
the control groups so those were always

120
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:14,049
well watered and the blue boxes are my

121
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:16,329
drought stress treatment so I withheld

122
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,490
water from that when you can see is by

123
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:20,500
day one of my experiment there's a

124
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:23,590
significant decrease in stomata

125
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,839
conductance in the drought stress group

126
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:27,669
but you might also see that there's

127
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:33,009
still a lot of variation on day one

128
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:34,660
between genotypes and so this spot is

129
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:37,149
very similar it's just showing the data

130
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,760
the same trait the stromal conductance

131
00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:42,399
but in my quantitative trait mapping

132
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,680
experiment and again by day one of the

133
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:47,379
experiment there's a significant

134
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,480
decrease in stomata conductance but

135
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:52,779
there is also still a lot of variation

136
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:54,910
between genotypes I'm going to look a

137
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:57,669
little bit at that variation between

138
00:06:54,910 --> 00:07:00,970
genotypes so this plot is showing the

139
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:04,240
ratio of stomatal conductance on day one

140
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:07,000
to day zero for all of those lines in my

141
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,949
RNA sequencing experiment I think the

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,079
battery and this is dead so the pointer

143
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:16,990
won't work but what you can see is that

144
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:19,899
yes there's a lot of variation within

145
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:22,870
genotypes but also between genotypes so

146
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:24,819
the red line represents a ratio of one

147
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:28,449
so that would mean that there is no

148
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:30,430
change between day zero and day one and

149
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:32,860
anything below that line means that the

150
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,240
stomatal conductance decreased anything

151
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,300
above that line would mean that it

152
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,370
increased and see that basically all of

153
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,100
the genotypes are decreasing their

154
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:45,340
stomata conductance but some of them are

155
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,870
right around that red line whereas some

156
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:49,949
of them have decreased dramatically

157
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,949
already by day one

158
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:57,040
so to sum up my physiological results I

159
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,439
found that thermal conductance decreases

160
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,120
significantly under drought stress but

161
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:05,410
there is a lot of variation between

162
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:09,430
genotypes and so to sort of get at what

163
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:12,400
that variation means I wanted to look at

164
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:15,400
the transcriptional control of this

165
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:20,079
so I started wading into my RNA seek

166
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:25,029
data and so what this plot is showing is

167
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:29,579
that it's a principal component analysis

168
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:33,098
and so what that is is a way of reducing

169
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:34,809
very high dimensional data down into two

170
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:37,810
dimensions so you can put it on a grass

171
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:41,139
and sort of make sense of it and so all

172
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:44,739
of the points in purple are the day

173
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:47,470
three drought conditions in green are

174
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:50,649
the day 1 drought conditions and then

175
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:56,259
red and blue are the control samples and

176
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:58,360
we can see is that on day 3 there's sort

177
00:08:56,259 --> 00:09:01,480
of a cluster all the way over on this

178
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:04,060
side of the graph whereas the controls

179
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,039
are on the opposite side and the day 1

180
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:08,469
samples their expression is somewhere in

181
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:11,079
between and so basically the gene

182
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:14,980
expression of my samples is clustering

183
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:17,860
by treatment and that kind of leads me

184
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:21,450
to believe that the treatment is having

185
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:24,899
a major effect on that gene expression

186
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:27,310
and so when I look at genes that were

187
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:29,079
differentially expressed between the

188
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:32,529
control group and the drought stress

189
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:35,950
group on day one of the experiment what

190
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:38,860
I found is a lot of enrichment for genes

191
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:41,350
that are involved in stress tolerance so

192
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:44,529
this makes sense it seems that the

193
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:49,690
plants are responding to drought stress

194
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:52,049
which is what I was hoping and then to

195
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:55,600
go from sort of general overviews of the

196
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:58,569
expression to highly specific one gene

197
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,930
and so this plot is showing the

198
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:04,250
expression of the rate-limiting enzyme

199
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:07,639
in upsizing acid biosynthesis

200
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:09,620
what you can see is that on both days

201
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:13,340
during drought stress it is

202
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:15,350
significantly more expressed than under

203
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,090
controlled conditions and so that

204
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,580
suggests to me that if the plant is

205
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:22,310
upgrading and lighting the expression of

206
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:26,290
an ABA biosynthesis enzyme that is

207
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:29,389
probably producing more obsessive acid

208
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:32,959
and so as I mentioned earlier absurd

209
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:35,439
gases is really important in a model

210
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:38,170
closure and it works through this

211
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,770
complicated signal transduction pathway

212
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:45,169
that ends in stomata closure

213
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:49,850
at the end of it but what's interesting

214
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:52,519
highlighted in that red box is a protein

215
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:56,470
phosphatase and what that does is it

216
00:10:52,519 --> 00:11:01,519
negatively regulates the episodic acid

217
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:04,610
signaling pathway and so this is the

218
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,379
expression of just one of those protein

219
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:08,870
phosphatase genes it's actually a whole

220
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:10,580
family and I found that nine of them

221
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,830
were differentially expressed under

222
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,420
drought and this is just one of them

223
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:17,240
which has already been shown to be

224
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:20,120
important negative regulator of that

225
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,789
pathway and interestingly it's also

226
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,950
expressed more under drought so the

227
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:27,319
plant is making more up Cizek acid but

228
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:30,320
it's also making more of a negative

229
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:35,660
regulator of the episodic acid signaling

230
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:38,600
pathway and so I wanted to know like

231
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:42,319
what is coordinating this like delicate

232
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:45,830
balance between the negative regulation

233
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,440
of this pathway and the up regulation of

234
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:52,129
the pathway and so the answer I think

235
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,810
lies in transcription factors and so I

236
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:55,279
looked at all of the transcription

237
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:57,889
factors that were differentially

238
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,949
expressed under drought and I found that

239
00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:02,809
there were 500 different transcription

240
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:04,550
factors that were differentially

241
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:08,359
expressed that lian at least one of the

242
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:11,629
days under drought stress and what I did

243
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,970
is correlate their expression pattern

244
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:16,460
with the stomata conductance and I found

245
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,899
that 30 of them are significantly

246
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:21,700
associated with stomata

247
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:25,610
duck dents and then among those I had

248
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:28,090
enrichment for these two general

249
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:31,460
families of transcription factors so the

250
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:34,580
heat-shock transcription factor family

251
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:37,370
and the B zip transcription factor

252
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:40,129
family and so heat-shock transcription

253
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:43,580
factors are known to be involved in a

254
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:46,399
stress response and the B zip family is

255
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:48,740
one of the largest transcription factor

256
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,539
families in plants but there's a subset

257
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,000
of them that are very important in

258
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:55,039
regulating of size of casted related

259
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,549
processes so I thought I'd look at those

260
00:12:55,039 --> 00:13:01,759
a little more and so this is just one

261
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:04,159
example of one of the VSIP transcription

262
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,870
factors that was differentially

263
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:09,259
expressed under drought and you can see

264
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:11,990
that on both day 1 and on day 3 and

265
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:16,340
there's much higher expression and so

266
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:18,889
this B zip 68 is regulated by AB Cizek

267
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:21,920
acid and what it does is it controls

268
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:24,019
chlorophyll degradation and how is that

269
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:27,199
related to drought well under drought

270
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:29,629
stress as I mentioned the still might

271
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,840
still meets clothes and that limits

272
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:35,480
photosynthesis but it doesn't affect how

273
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,910
light is absorbed by chlorophyll and

274
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,490
that results in damage and so one of the

275
00:13:37,909 --> 00:13:43,279
responses that the plant has is to

276
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:47,960
degrade some chlorophyll to limit the

277
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:50,480
damage okay so that was really

278
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:53,930
interesting hopefully but I want to

279
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,930
integrate that a little more with what

280
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:59,620
is controlling a stomata conductance and

281
00:13:56,929 --> 00:14:03,199
so I looked at my genetic mapping data

282
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:06,740
and if you remember that was a separate

283
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:09,110
experiment using a population that was

284
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:14,870
derived from two of those parents where

285
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:19,039
I had RNA sequencing data for and so I

286
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:22,190
looked on both day 1 and day 3 and try

287
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:26,059
to correlate to model conductance with

288
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:30,560
genetic markers and so this is a

289
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:34,339
Manhattan plot and each dot represents a

290
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:40,039
marker and so we hire the lot the dots

291
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:43,759
are above the line the more associated

292
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:46,689
they are with the stomatal conductance

293
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:49,850
and what I found is that I had a

294
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:52,010
significant region of the genome on

295
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,980
chromosome 8 that was significantly

296
00:14:52,009 --> 00:15:00,379
associated with stomatal conductance on

297
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:03,860
day one then when I looked at day 3 I

298
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:08,120
found something similar again I had one

299
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:12,649
really peak on there that stands out and

300
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:16,639
this time it was on chromosome 2 and so

301
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:18,588
now that have these transcriptional data

302
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,629
and the physiological data as well as

303
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:23,029
this genetic mapping data I want to look

304
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:25,490
at how this all comes together so the

305
00:15:23,028 --> 00:15:29,629
intersection of all of these aspects of

306
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:32,299
the plant some growth in physiology and

307
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:34,159
so what I did is look in my RNA

308
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:37,609
sequencing data which if you remember is

309
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:39,439
a separate experiment but I looked in

310
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:43,190
the regions that were significantly

311
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:46,430
associated with stomata conductance from

312
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:49,160
the genetic mapping experiment and so on

313
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:51,229
day one I did find that there were genes

314
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:53,350
differentially expressed but

315
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,519
unfortunately there uncharacterized

316
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:57,259
proteins so we have no idea what they do

317
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,299
and so I'm not going to talk about them

318
00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:02,600
any further today feel free to ask me

319
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:05,509
about them later but on day three there

320
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:08,120
were two genes within that chromosomal

321
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:09,769
region on chromosome 2 that was

322
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,570
significantly associated with thermal

323
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:13,269
conductance that were awful

324
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:17,810
differentially expressed under drought

325
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:24,730
and so one of them in particular is this

326
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:27,919
HPA 22 like protein and so what that is

327
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:29,149
as you can see is differentially

328
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,579
expressed under drought and it's

329
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:33,199
expressed more under drought stress but

330
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,320
if you look at those little red and blue

331
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:39,379
dots which are the parents of that

332
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:43,860
mapping population it's kind of hard to

333
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:46,220
see but on under control conditions

334
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:50,310
there are sort of opposite ends of the

335
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:52,230
expression spectrum and they don't seem

336
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,879
to be at opposite ends under drought

337
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,009
stress but at least under control

338
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:57,689
conditions there seems to be a big

339
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:59,700
difference between my two parents and

340
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:04,709
this gene is differentially expressed

341
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:09,500
under drought and so what is in barley

342
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:12,959
this hvae 22 is a program cell death

343
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:16,709
inhibitor that is responsive to the

344
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,400
hormone up Cizek acid and so the way

345
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:22,320
seed germination and barley works is

346
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:27,300
there's a layer of seed called the

347
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:29,039
aileron layer and when seed germinates

348
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:30,779
there's programmed cell death and a

349
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,889
bunch of enzymes are released that

350
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:35,490
degrade the seed coat and you see the

351
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:38,130
unfortunately this pointer is not

352
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:40,200
working but if you look at the middle

353
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,790
box on the bottom there you see that you

354
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,100
have these circles with nothing in them

355
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:46,889
because basically the cell has died and

356
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:50,429
all of the goop has been released but

357
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:54,480
when you have over expression of the hva

358
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:56,340
22 protein you can see that the cell is

359
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,099
not dead and it looks the same as the

360
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:01,859
control conditions and so this gene is

361
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:05,939
inhibiting programmed cell death and so

362
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:09,869
I am hypothesizing that and leaves this

363
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:12,410
HPA 22 like protein might inhibit

364
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:15,899
program cell death that's involved in

365
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:20,340
senescence which we know is triggered in

366
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:23,340
part by drought stress so just to sum up

367
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:25,619
what I've told you so far the key aba

368
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:27,689
biosynthesis gene is differentially

369
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:31,049
expressed under drought and it's up

370
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:33,180
regulated but so are negative regulators

371
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:38,849
of the episodes gas and signaling

372
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:40,529
pathway and my best candidate for the

373
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:43,230
chromosomal region that was associated

374
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:46,139
with still model conductance is an

375
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:48,450
obsessive casted responsive protein that

376
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,670
seems to be an inhibitor of program cell

377
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:53,840
death and so in the future what I'm

378
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:57,120
going to do this summer is look for

379
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,799
common motifs in the promoters of all of

380
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,629
the genes

381
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:02,629
I found that were differentially

382
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:06,080
expressed under drought and hope to find

383
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:08,810
it like these sequences that are

384
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:10,909
associated with a binding of

385
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:14,149
transcription factors that maybe are

386
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:15,769
controlling drought tolerance and so

387
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:18,080
finally I would like to thank everybody

388
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:21,379
who made this project possible

389
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:34,000
so especially my two advisors Ed buckler

390
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:38,750
and Taryn barley Prestonsburg Jeremy

391
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:43,119
during an experiment where a dry down

392
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:46,099
cycle has been limited spots long

393
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:48,979
sometimes what can happen is that lines

394
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:52,279
that just generally are run that have

395
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:56,059
very low rates of photosynthesis any low

396
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:59,000
the model conductances will remain well

397
00:19:56,059 --> 00:20:00,639
hydrated even after three days while the

398
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,619
ones that are really healthy in are

399
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:07,360
transpiring rapidly deplete the water

400
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:11,119
very quickly and then you can get from

401
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:13,609
some toy to interpretate or like that I

402
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,829
was wondering whether you feel that your

403
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:17,379
system

404
00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:22,119
some lines that couldn't have those

405
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:24,820
kinds of variations control so there's

406
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:28,089
definitely that variation and so what I

407
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:30,879
did to control for that at least for the

408
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:33,339
genetic mapping experiment I included I

409
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,800
measured plant height and leaf number

410
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:40,899
and then sort of merge that together

411
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:44,440
into a leaf area like factor and I

412
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:47,140
included that in the model when I was

413
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,299
doing the genetic mapping and so that

414
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,970
was my attempt to control for that

415
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:54,369
however it is still a major problem and

416
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:57,279
I were to do the experiment all over

417
00:20:54,369 --> 00:21:01,929
again I would probably use a larger pot

418
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:05,009
volume simply because that would help to

419
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,009
mitigate that factor

420
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,229
[Music]

421
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:44,539
so um they're actually both up regulated

422
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:46,670
by day one and so I didn't have a only

423
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:48,940
had you know two time points so maybe if

424
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:52,610
I had measured expression every hour

425
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:55,250
there could have been like more

426
00:21:52,609 --> 00:21:58,819
differences but the way I didn't go into

427
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:02,890
it but the way that ABA works is it

428
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:07,669
actually inactivates the PP to see

429
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:09,800
inhibitor and so one way reasons that

430
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:12,650
this might be occurring is it's up

431
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:14,389
regulating the negative regulator so

432
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:17,930
that as soon as the drought stress goes

433
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:20,170
away the response can be turned off and

434
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:33,230
it might be more of a drought recovery

435
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:35,269
mechanism so that's just a guess this

436
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:41,049
has been a production of Cornell

437
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:41,049
