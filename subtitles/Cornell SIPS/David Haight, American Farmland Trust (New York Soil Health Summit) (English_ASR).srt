1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,839
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:04,839
University

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:11,149
thank you for that warm welcome it's a

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:12,709
real pleasure to be here and I really

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,150
want to thank Cornell University for

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,070
helping to bring all of us together for

7
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,780
this really important conversation

8
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:21,500
I really have four points I want to make

9
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:23,980
I'm talking about healthy soil I from

10
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:27,230
the American Farmland trust perspective

11
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:30,919
healthy soil it is I've an asset with

12
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:34,070
public and so the healthy soil is vital

13
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:37,009
to farm productivity the resilience of

14
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,628
farmers to severe weather but there are

15
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:39,920
tremendous public benefits that we've

16
00:00:38,628 --> 00:00:41,689
heard from many of our speakers this

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,730
morning that come from healthy soil

18
00:00:41,689 --> 00:00:46,640
slowly connected to our ability to grow

19
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:49,819
food our ability to have clean water and

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,299
an ability to have a healthy climate to

21
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,799
exist in so that's point number one I'll

22
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:56,570
point number two I think when we talk

23
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,149
about healthy soil we need to think

24
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:01,219
about that holistically and from the

25
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:03,109
American Farmland trust perspective the

26
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:06,079
foundation of that conversation is to

27
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:11,540
keep our most productive versatile and

28
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:16,069
resilient soil in farming ie don't pave

29
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:18,290
it over don't cover it with concrete and

30
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:19,938
this is not an inconsequential issue for

31
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,159
the state of New York that we have paved

32
00:01:19,938 --> 00:01:25,879
over the equivalent of five thousand

33
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,229
farms since the early 1980s so the

34
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:29,569
foundation of a conversation about

35
00:01:27,228 --> 00:01:32,150
healthy soil is to protect that land and

36
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:34,578
keep it in farming to start and then you

37
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:37,030
can complement that with discussion many

38
00:01:34,578 --> 00:01:39,469
of you focus on today about stewardship

39
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,439
those two things coming together is

40
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:44,000
really the foundation of a holistic

41
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,709
conversation about healthy soil I think

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,780
there's some valuable lessons that we

43
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:50,449
can learn from the state of California

44
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:54,710
on this approach the state of California

45
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:56,390
in 2015 began allocating funding from

46
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:58,759
their carbon market towards the

47
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:01,340
development of a strategic agricultural

48
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,649
land conservation program they have

49
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:06,799
subsequently allocated seventy million

50
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:09,169
dollars towards permanently protecting

51
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,900
farmland as a way of reducing

52
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:13,609
transportation related emissions in

53
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,830
essence if we keep people living in

54
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,260
cities more compactly we're going to

55
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,500
reduce transportation emissions and then

56
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:20,719
they've

57
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,419
also invested their carbon proceeds and

58
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,669
healthy soils programs that invest in

59
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:27,859
research and technical assistance to

60
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:29,929
farmers with the stewardship of that

61
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,520
land I think there's some really

62
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,189
valuable lessons that we can learn from

63
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,070
California last year the American

64
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:39,770
Farmland trust released research report

65
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:42,049
called greener fields this is a report

66
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,670
that was largely based on data that I've

67
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:46,070
been gathered by the Department of

68
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:47,780
Environmental Conservation looked at

69
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:50,479
greenhouse gas emissions from

70
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,879
agricultural land compared to developed

71
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:55,549
land in new york and we found that the

72
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,090
average acre of farmland in new york

73
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:01,209
emitted 66 times fewer greenhouse gas

74
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,979
emissions than an acre of developed land

75
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:05,750
and that if we could reduce our mission

76
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:09,500
or the amount of farmland that we pave

77
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:11,239
over by 80 percent by 2050 it could have

78
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:15,009
the equivalent effect of taking a

79
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:17,120
million cars off the road in new york

80
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:20,719
who wouldn't want to see a million cars

81
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,549
off the road in new york so we think

82
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:25,069
that there's some valuable lessons that

83
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:28,340
we can as a community and as a state

84
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:30,560
think about for agricultural land as

85
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,840
we're thinking about our state's climate

86
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,299
strategy and that we absolutely should

87
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,610
have a really robust agricultural lands

88
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:39,860
component of our climate agenda so

89
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:42,739
that's point number two point number

90
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:44,810
three it was great to go after Don and

91
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:46,099
Dave and John Paul because I think one

92
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:49,610
of the lessons that I really took away

93
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:51,530
from that is how they are adapting and

94
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,780
learning and applying some common

95
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:57,110
practices but they have to be customized

96
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,819
to their situation and they need to be

97
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,890
customized because of the crops they're

98
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:04,400
producing the landscape in which they're

99
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:07,129
producing also management capacity is

100
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,409
very much an integral part of the

101
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:11,599
conversation so we've been really

102
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:13,159
excited over the last several years the

103
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,109
American Farmland trust has worked with

104
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:17,478
Cornell Cooperative Extension and soil

105
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:21,019
and water districts and others host more

106
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:23,899
than a dozen on-farm demonstrations in

107
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:27,319
Long Island in western New York as well

108
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:28,819
as five swell health field days mat bar

109
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:31,870
next to a health field day on Long

110
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:34,659
Island coming up Debbie

111
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:37,389
August 16th we think that those types of

112
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,669
on-farm in field really applied

113
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:41,620
conversations are really critical to

114
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:44,918
catalyzing this soil health movement in

115
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,990
New York um and to build on that we are

116
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:49,060
very excited a few weeks ago we

117
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:53,110
announced a new program with Cornell

118
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:55,110
University with NRCS with the Department

119
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,759
of Agriculture markets and others a

120
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:00,250
program called the practical soil health

121
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,469
specialists of New York it is a

122
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,850
professional development program that is

123
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,190
going to occur over the next two years

124
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:10,330
and we are looking to develop a network

125
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:12,459
of 20 practical soil health specialists

126
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:14,829
these are people in the public sector or

127
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:16,120
the private sector that really want to

128
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:19,209
provide training and technical

129
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,280
assistance to farmers and using soil

130
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:23,819
health practices successfully so it's a

131
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,099
very field based training program

132
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:29,620
applications for that program are due

133
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:32,229
Friday so if you are interested we've

134
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,418
had a tremendous result already response

135
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:36,969
already but it is an exciting program

136
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:38,469
there are flyers in the back and let's

137
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,570
see just tonight where are you Jeff

138
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,979
Jeff's got his hand raised in the back

139
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:44,800
if you want to learn more about that

140
00:05:41,978 --> 00:05:47,709
program I talked to Jeff Ward a yearand

141
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:51,160
wrist ow at Cornell the last point I'm

142
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:52,859
gonna make is that when we talk about

143
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,780
soil health we need to think about

144
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,750
healthy soil not adjust on farmer owned

145
00:05:55,779 --> 00:06:02,709
farm lands but on the land that farmers

146
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:05,288
rent as well just about 20% of our land

147
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:08,019
in New York is rented land often that

148
00:06:05,288 --> 00:06:10,629
can be the most challenging land to get

149
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:12,759
conservation practices adopted on this

150
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:15,098
land owners are increasingly removed

151
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:17,740
from the farm and may not know as much

152
00:06:15,098 --> 00:06:19,538
about production practices and farmers

153
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:22,030
may not feel like they have the Economic

154
00:06:19,538 --> 00:06:24,629
Security to really invest in these

155
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:27,159
practices that have a longer return life

156
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:28,959
so we are really excited to be working

157
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,000
with Cornell Cooperative Extension at

158
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,728
Wyoming County and other partners to

159
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,709
pilot some trainings technical

160
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:39,550
assistance and communications activities

161
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:42,489
are gated towards women landowners as

162
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,680
well as farmers in the Genesee River

163
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,800
watershed and we've been doing that for

164
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,269
the last two years

165
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,280
experimenting with some different

166
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:51,139
approaches over the next year we're

167
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,029
going to be sharing our results in what

168
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:54,500
we're learning about really think that

169
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:56,299
that is an important part of this

170
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,860
conversation that's often overlooked

171
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,259
because it's not just the farmer owned

172
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:04,129
land that rental land is a really

173
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:07,160
important piece of this conversation so

174
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:09,228
I get just want to close that this is a

175
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,030
really important conversation and it's

176
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:14,750
not a conversation though just for

177
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:16,189
farmers it's with farmers but really

178
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,259
this is a conversation for all New

179
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:20,689
Yorkers because you know for all of us

180
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:23,389

181
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:26,889
the water we want to drink or the water

182
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:29,930
