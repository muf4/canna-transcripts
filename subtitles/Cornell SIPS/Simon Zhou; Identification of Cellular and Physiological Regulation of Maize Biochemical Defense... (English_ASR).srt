1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,060
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:05,060
University

3
00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:14,330
so good morning everybody I'd like to

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,730
welcome you with Simon Joe's thesis talk

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,140
to assignment is presenting his talk

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,079
today but he won't actually have his

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:24,368
defense till December sometime this

8
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:27,019
summer I think the faculty voted to have

9
00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:30,169
imminently graduating students do their

10
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:32,988
talks in the seminar series and so Simon

11
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:34,700
is the test case for this and we seem to

12
00:00:32,988 --> 00:00:36,070
has gotten a very good turnout so thank

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,850
you all for coming

14
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:42,308
Simon came to us from Shenzhen by the

15
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,808
University of Washington in Seattle and

16
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:46,968
is a PhD student plant biology

17
00:00:44,808 --> 00:00:49,849
department he however has more of an

18
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:52,850
ecological background and like many

19
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,859
ecology students he wanted to work on a

20
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,539
project that has absolutely nothing to

21
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:59,870
do with this thesis advisors research

22
00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:01,789
and that also meant then that Simon's

23
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:03,738
thesis has been almost entirely self

24
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:05,150
funded through ta ships and grants that

25
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:08,569
he's written which is also typical

26
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,490
ecology students and specifically Simon

27
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:12,979
came to me wanting to work on pathogens

28
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:14,390
on roots which is not something I have a

29
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,950
lot of experience with so I learned a

30
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:19,640
lot from Simon and that respect

31
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:22,010
and Simon has also really pioneered new

32
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,609
research methods in my lab specifically

33
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:28,609
metabolomics and quantitative genetics

34
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:30,560
or genome-wide Association studies and

35
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:32,780
more importantly has been very creative

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,879
in combining those two research methods

37
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,219
and doing quantitative genetics of

38
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,810
large-scale metabolomics and really

39
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:41,599
doing very nice analysis of large

40
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:43,700
datasets and then applying that as you

41
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,879
see here from this picture and now

42
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:49,609
somewhat shortened title to looking at

43
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:51,799
his areum Mays interactions cos areum

44
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:54,349
infection of routes with that Simon

45
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,420
thank you thank you everyone for showing

46
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:58,699
up today and I just want to make sure

47
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:02,090
everybody hear me all right good good

48
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,590
okay so we can start all right so thank

49
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,780
you George for the surprisingly kind

50
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:08,500
introduction so I guess I have to I have

51
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,818
to revise my acknowledged section now

52
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,250
that's maybe a little bit too mean

53
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:15,560
worded but I was think about that well

54
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,150
I'm giving the talk so today I'm going

55
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,408
to tell you about what I've been doing

56
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,510
for the past three and a half years

57
00:02:18,408 --> 00:02:22,459
which looking at trying to identify

58
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:24,739
cellular and physiological regulation of

59
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:27,079
May's biochemical defense against

60
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:28,908
Fusarium cremini era so as George

61
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:31,159
mentioned when I first joined George

62
00:02:28,908 --> 00:02:33,438
slab I really had no idea a very vague

63
00:02:31,158 --> 00:02:35,719
idea about what I wanted to do so only

64
00:02:33,438 --> 00:02:38,000
as I know is I want to work on brute

65
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:40,579
microbe interaction which George doesn't

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,709
really do any of that so I went to

67
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:44,420
George and I say I want to do this and

68
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:46,310
this and that and George said okay the

69
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:48,378
only possible way you can get some money

70
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,319
from me is if you work on corn

71
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:53,780
so that really narrowed down the things

72
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:55,969
I can do here which is corn root disease

73
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,068
which I know absolutely nothing about at

74
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:59,780
the time so I started from Wikipedia

75
00:02:58,068 --> 00:03:02,750
which surprisingly there's the whole

76
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:05,030
page of giving all the maze diseases

77
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,919
that are possibly out there and that's

78
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,650
how I find out about Fusarium Grameen

79
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:11,388
erm so if you serum Grameen Ihram is a

80
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,879
destructive and widespread fungal

81
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:15,469
pathogen that in fact maze depending on

82
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:18,018
the tissue type at developmental stages

83
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:21,109
of that interaction you can get sidling

84
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:23,930
blight stock rot or ear rot image and

85
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:25,489
every year this three disease is caused

86
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:28,129
by the same passage and collectively

87
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:28,579
give you hundreds of millions of your

88
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,739
loss

89
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:32,510
so in corn so this is a pretty

90
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:36,199
economically relevant passage and to

91
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:38,149
work with so when we first started to

92
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:39,620
work on this pathogen we really want to

93
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:43,609
just have some kind of symptom or

94
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:46,219
phenotype to work with so in a through

95
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:48,620
artificial inoculation experiment we see

96
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:50,628
that Fusarium can induce significant

97
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,090
reduction in the total root grows in the

98
00:03:50,628 --> 00:03:55,459
seedlings so this can be quantified by

99
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:57,199
taking a 2d picture like this and then

100
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:59,598
use a computer algorithm that is

101
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:02,030
developed in Leon coaching's lab we can

102
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:03,679
actually quantify that and compare and

103
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,139
show that this is statistically

104
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,030
significant and this phenotype actually

105
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:10,400
is complete it's repeatable and

106
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:12,408
consistent enough such that we can use

107
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,810
it to screen a natural diversity panel

108
00:04:12,408 --> 00:04:16,879
and see if there's any natural variation

109
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:19,819
in this fungus induced morphological

110
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:23,000
change and indeed when we do that across

111
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:24,918
a diversity panel we see that v73 which

112
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,319
is the reference mates genotype where

113
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:29,658
we've initially started with turn out to

114
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:32,060
be one of the more susceptible genotypes

115
00:04:29,658 --> 00:04:34,189
with its total root growth being reduced

116
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,949
by over 50% after

117
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:38,959
eriell inoculation whereas we also see

118
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:41,930
their four genotypes that does not show

119
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:44,779
any significant reduction in their total

120
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,879
root grows after Fusarium after Fusarium

121
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:50,869
inoculation and they turn out to be our

122
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:52,670
candidate resistant genotypes so for my

123
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,939
work i've been focusing on this genotype

124
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:58,220
mow 17 because it has the most available

125
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:59,810
genetic resources out there and i will

126
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,110
come back to that later to explain what

127
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,910
i mean by that so before we go any

128
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,759
further we really want to confirm that

129
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:09,500
the symptom that we observe actually

130
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,439
tell us something about resistance level

131
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:15,019
so we did that by measuring for example

132
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:16,850
fungal gene expression mycotoxin

133
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:19,689
production as well as visual symptoms

134
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,950
scoring and by all three matrices

135
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:24,829
consistently we see that most of enchain

136
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:27,469
turned out to be more resistant than b73

137
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:30,379
against this area so then we can

138
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:32,630
actually ask the question why what's the

139
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:35,389
genetic and physiological mechanism

140
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:38,089
behind this contrasting resistance level

141
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:40,219
between these two genotypes so we're

142
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:42,560
answering these questions taking a

143
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,000
quantitative genetics approach so for

144
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,418
those of you with less background in

145
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,089
that so we there are genetic populations

146
00:05:47,418 --> 00:05:52,639
that's produced by crossing B 73 and Moe

147
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:54,769
17 are susceptible and resistant

148
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,139
genotype and then produce what we call a

149
00:05:54,769 --> 00:05:59,029
recombinant inbred line populations with

150
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:01,519
shuffled genomes between the true

151
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:02,899
parents and what we can do then is to

152
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,299
measure some kind of quantitative

153
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:07,729
phenotype so that we can statistically

154
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,310
associate this phenotype with a

155
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:13,730
particular locus or low-side within the

156
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,709
genome okay so then the question really

157
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,419
come down to what kind of trait what

158
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,099
kind of quantitative trait do we really

159
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:21,319
want to measure so since we're working

160
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,090
with plan disease supposingly

161
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:25,279
what we really want to measure what

162
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:27,529
actually matter is the disease symptoms

163
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,029
severity in the field okay how does that

164
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:31,729
impact your yield how does that impact

165
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:34,069
your crops so it does come with a lot of

166
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:35,960
advantage of doing that so for example

167
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:37,610
as much the results from such a study

168
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:40,009
will be much easier to translate your

169
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,319
application you tend to identify the

170
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:44,418
low-side was the most major effect you

171
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,038
capture environmental influences and the

172
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:48,139
technique for phenotyping is usually

173
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:50,149
simple however on the flip

174
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:52,249
I love this we can also try to quantify

175
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:54,769
some kind of biochemical or molecular

176
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:57,528
markers in the lab and the advantage of

177
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:59,598
doing that will be you kind of get some

178
00:06:57,528 --> 00:07:02,478
idea about what's the mechanism behind

179
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,158
the resistance you get and the genetic

180
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,109
architecture of this kind of trace are

181
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:08,120
usually much more simple and then you

182
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,650
can very importantly you get very

183
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,930
consistent and accurate quantification

184
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:13,549
which are hard to achieve under field

185
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,620
conditions for disease severity and

186
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:18,259
perhaps more important for graduate

187
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,360
students it's much less work to do okay

188
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:21,919
so if we forget about the less work and

189
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,379
simple technique just say we really want

190
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:26,269
to do it right which kind of phenotype

191
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:29,210
are we going to are we going to choose

192
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:30,948
for our particular passel system so if

193
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:33,079
we come back to see the link blight

194
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:35,360
disease caused by Fusarium specifically

195
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:37,370
we see that consistent scoring of

196
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,699
disease symptom severity is very hard

197
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:43,550
either in either in field conditions or

198
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:45,650
even in lab you know the symptoms are in

199
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:48,860
the root so you what are you going to

200
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:51,588
measure and secondly if we come back to

201
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:54,050
the to the historical statistics we see

202
00:07:51,588 --> 00:07:56,750
that the settling fly severity where is

203
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,490
widely from year to year and by the way

204
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,228
this is when I started working on this

205
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,139
disease and since then there's been a

206
00:08:00,228 --> 00:08:04,579
linear decrease in disease severity so

207
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:05,778
somehow I feel like I should take credit

208
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:08,269
for that

209
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:10,250
okay but what the point I'm trying to

210
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:12,680
make here is that the environmental

211
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:16,069
impact seems to be really large for

212
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,050
disease severity and finally there has

213
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:20,360
been work done with Sierra and Mayes

214
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,520
interaction but this is done in years

215
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,468
but what's been shown is that the gene

216
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:27,528
genetic architecture for this

217
00:08:24,468 --> 00:08:29,959
interaction is very complex many genetic

218
00:08:27,528 --> 00:08:31,490
loci seem to contribute to the disease

219
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:34,038
resistance or to disease severity

220
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,099
phenotype so taken all three factors

221
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:38,328
together we decide to measure

222
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,379
biochemical markers under laboratory

223
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:41,389
conditions

224
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:45,259
rather than doing any kind of disease

225
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:48,500
severity scoring so what we decided to

226
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:51,259
do this is to take seedling root samples

227
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,990
of p73 and mow 17 recombinant inbred

228
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:56,629
lines we take those samples subject them

229
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,879
to lcms analysis of metabolites as well

230
00:08:56,629 --> 00:09:01,460
as a new technology developed by carl

231
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,889
kremlin here in at buckler's lab looking

232
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,960
using a 3 prime RNA see technology to

233
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:08,539
look at their transcriptome and if we

234
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,670
combine the metabolomic data with the

235
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:12,679
quantitative genetics setup we can do

236
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:15,919
some kind of metabolite QTL mapping and

237
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:17,809
if we combine the 2 omics data set we

238
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,329
can start to do cross omics network and

239
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:22,309
system analysis so most of the work I'm

240
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:24,800
going to present today will come out of

241
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:28,489
these two analysis here combining the

242
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:30,049
three measures here okay so the first

243
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:33,259
story I want to tell you from this study

244
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:36,979
is looking at looking at just comparing

245
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:38,990
B 73 and mo 17 are two parental

246
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,149
genotypes will soar without fungus

247
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,399
inoculation what I'm showing here are

248
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:45,799
cloud plots and each bubble here

249
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:48,139
represent a single mass feature that the

250
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:50,809
mass spec machine can detect and in

251
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:52,610
green I'm showing the the metabolize or

252
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:55,609
the mass features that are significantly

253
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:58,519
up regulated by Fusarium induction in

254
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,560
red are significantly reduced but really

255
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:03,289
the take-home message is that a lot of

256
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:06,649
bubbles in b73 not so many bubbles in mo

257
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:09,049
17 and what that tells you is that B 73

258
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:11,269
the susceptible genotype seems to be

259
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:13,909
significantly responding metabolically

260
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:16,189
speaking to Fusarium inoculation whereas

261
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:20,778
there's not so much going on in mo 17 in

262
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:23,390
terms of its metabolic an do then is we

263
00:10:20,778 --> 00:10:26,120
can compare the constitutively tableau

264
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:28,639
of the susceptible B 73 and a resistant

265
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,049
mo 17 and ask what are the difference

266
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,480
there because the differential

267
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:35,329
metabolize will likely be related to

268
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,100
resistance against Fusarium and not so

269
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:39,528
surprisingly we find a lot because

270
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,089
they're over 700 masked features that

271
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:43,189
are significantly different which is

272
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:45,290
still a lot to work with like which one

273
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:47,570
should we actually look at them so I did

274
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:51,169
a second comparison looking at fungus

275
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:53,420
induction in B 73 and from there we

276
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:54,679
found over 300 metabolites or mass

277
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,958
features that are significantly

278
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:59,120
different and if we look for the overlap

279
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:01,219
between this two which means this

280
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,230
metabolize are both constitutively

281
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,870
different between my susceptible and

282
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:08,870
resistant genotype as well as being

283
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:11,539
responsive to fungus inoculation those

284
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:13,820
will be my high priority pool so I found

285
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:15,259
less than 100 mask features there and if

286
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,270
I filter out the ones

287
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:19,939
have low intensity that's harder to work

288
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:22,490
with and then we find about 30 mask

289
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,770
features so among the 30 mask features

290
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,379
there are some known metabolize with

291
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:29,059
bioactive bio activities against

292
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:30,889
Fusarium which will be good positive

293
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:33,139
control for us to show that this

294
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:35,210
approach is actually effective but what

295
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:38,419
we're actually more interesting are the

296
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:40,730
unknowns here so what are the unknowns

297
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:42,620
two of the unknowns that really capture

298
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,659
my eyes are just two masks features

299
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:47,600
shown by their negative mass-to-charge

300
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:50,569
ratio here and retention time so from

301
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,810
now I'm just refer to them to refer to

302
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:56,270
them as a 19 and 777 and you see that in

303
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:58,429
both p7 history and MO 17 they are

304
00:11:56,269 --> 00:12:00,740
inducible by fungus inoculation and

305
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:03,229
their constitutively different between

306
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:07,039
our two genotypes and what's really

307
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:08,930
interesting to me that okay is that the

308
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,929
structure seems to be related to each

309
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:13,849
other and QT Jung in Franco there's lab

310
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:16,549
help me to field a purify there's two

311
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:19,430
compounds and perform 2d NMR on them to

312
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:22,219
clarify their structures here so we have

313
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:24,469
a sucrose backbone right here connected

314
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,420
to them one Furillo Cassatt to Furillo

315
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:28,430
Cassatt and then different nacido groups

316
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:30,649
and really the only difference between

317
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:32,929
this to metabolize is this one

318
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:35,899
additional estilo group here on the two

319
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:37,969
position okay so this metabolize have

320
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:41,179
previously been reported in medicinal

321
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:42,889
plants such as smilax in this case my

322
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:45,049
lips china and that's why they have to

323
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:48,049
they goes by the name such as Smuggler's

324
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:52,159
I see a smile aside a so those are names

325
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:54,229
given by the natural chemist and okay so

326
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:56,179
they're finally in this kind of plant

327
00:12:54,230 --> 00:13:00,139
and to me they're really there to heart

328
00:12:56,179 --> 00:13:02,659
because I kind of grow up eating it in

329
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:05,799
China you can make you can make this

330
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:08,719
dark jello like saying from smilax and

331
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:11,029
supposingly will be rien reached is in

332
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,519
this middle side as - like compound and

333
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:17,360
you can just have it as a dessert okay

334
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:20,210
so that's cool then we really if they're

335
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,800
related to resistance against truce area

336
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:23,990
and we want to show is there any in

337
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:26,139
vitro final activity against this area

338
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,089
and that's where it's really interesting

339
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:30,370
when we did

340
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:33,850
virtual liquid culture si we see that

341
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:37,179
the try assimilated Nikolas I see does

342
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:40,870
not show any significant activity

343
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:43,448
against Fusarium where is the bias in

344
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:46,299
latest Melissa a show you a significant

345
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:48,308
growth of inhibition and notice that the

346
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:50,198
concentration of smiles side a is

347
00:13:48,308 --> 00:13:53,259
actually lower than smoogle as I see

348
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:56,588
because this is reflecting there in vivo

349
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:59,379
in vivo concentration so even at low

350
00:13:56,589 --> 00:14:01,689
concentration the dye assimilated - at a

351
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:04,720
seems to be more bioactive than the

352
00:14:01,688 --> 00:14:07,480
triassic the latest Nikolas I see ok so

353
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,278
then we can ask the question why are

354
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,499
they why is there natural variation

355
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:13,720
between for this two compounds in our

356
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:15,579
population so we measure this two

357
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,709
compounds across the recombinant inbred

358
00:14:15,578 --> 00:14:20,078
lines which can help us to identify the

359
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:22,778
genetic loci that is controlling or

360
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:24,909
associated with this - was this -

361
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:27,188
metabolite and perhaps not so

362
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:29,889
surprisingly we see a co localized

363
00:14:27,188 --> 00:14:33,338
quantitative trait locus or QTL at the

364
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:35,620
beginning of chromosomes 3 so if we if

365
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:37,779
we sub set to become the umbrella in

366
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,328
population by different alleles at this

367
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:42,759
locus we see that for the ones that

368
00:14:40,328 --> 00:14:46,149
carry the p73 allele that preferentially

369
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:49,058
accumulates nicholas i see just like v73

370
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:52,120
the parental line whereas has less of

371
00:14:49,058 --> 00:14:55,870
the smile si a so that's pretty good

372
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:57,850
segregation and then we want to confirm

373
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,230
the mapping result from becoming inbred

374
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,389
lines using a different genetic

375
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:04,389
population called near isogenic lines

376
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:07,389
also generated from p73 and most 17 and

377
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:09,308
indeed we find that when we have P 73

378
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:11,259
and most of a team here the phenotype

379
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:13,629
I'm measuring is the ratio of this tree

380
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:16,778
metabolites in be 73 we have a lot of

381
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:18,999
simple as I see and not so much smiles

382
00:15:16,778 --> 00:15:20,259
at a so we have a very low bar whereas

383
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:22,420
in most Seventeen's the other way around

384
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:22,990
and when we look at the near as organic

385
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:24,610
lines

386
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:27,909
some of them looks just like be

387
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:30,100
semi-sweet and the latter here annual

388
00:15:27,909 --> 00:15:31,870
taste what's the genetic background so

389
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,240
even though for example this two lines

390
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:37,269
the genetic background is most 17 it

391
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,610
does have a b7 III like phenotype and we

392
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:41,919
have example from from the other side

393
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,629
whereas when you have even if you have a

394
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:46,479
seventy-three genetic background their

395
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:48,129
phenotype looks just like moe 17 when we

396
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,928
do a PETA when we do a tea pass between

397
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:51,699
them we see that there is indeed a

398
00:15:49,928 --> 00:15:54,100
significant difference between this

399
00:15:51,698 --> 00:15:56,828
difference are near as a genetic lines

400
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,869
and then on top I'm showing the genetic

401
00:15:56,828 --> 00:16:00,878
map associated with all this nearest

402
00:15:58,869 --> 00:16:02,649
Jenny flies wears in red I'm showing the

403
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,778
piece of history allele in blue I'm

404
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:06,249
showing the most 17 allele so if you

405
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:07,869
look at the correspondence between the

406
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:10,899
phenotype and genotype we can actually

407
00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:12,459
further narrow down our QTL area to less

408
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:15,730
than 600 Kb

409
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:18,188
so this particular area would contain a

410
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:21,039
gene that we think is causing the

411
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:23,980
difference in sniffles I see as smart as

412
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,778
I a constitutive abundance so remember

413
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,999
these two compounds are only different

414
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:30,068
by one acetyl group so when we're

415
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:31,178
looking at this cutie our result was

416
00:16:30,068 --> 00:16:32,798
that okay that's pretty straightforward

417
00:16:31,178 --> 00:16:35,318
we're looking for a pseudo transferase

418
00:16:32,798 --> 00:16:38,078
that's going to add a student group to

419
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:39,488
that tooth - I ate and of course when

420
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:42,729
you look at there there's no solute

421
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:45,100
transfer rates there so for that part as

422
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,539
so at that time this whole project was

423
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,918
kind of dead in water we don't have a

424
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:50,198
candidate gene we have a small genetic

425
00:16:47,918 --> 00:16:52,688
area but we really don't know you know

426
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:54,159
there's probably a dozen genes in there

427
00:16:52,688 --> 00:16:56,379
we really don't know which one we should

428
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:58,269
look at so that's when I was taking a

429
00:16:56,379 --> 00:17:01,329
vacation and physically my wife last

430
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:03,369
December okay and I was really bored in

431
00:17:01,328 --> 00:17:05,048
her office and I have nothing to do so I

432
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:07,419
decided to play with some of this data I

433
00:17:05,048 --> 00:17:10,869
thought that was hopeless at the time so

434
00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:12,220
I decided to plot out all the most 17b

435
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:14,259
said ministry and their recombinant

436
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,380
inbred lines based on their constitutive

437
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:18,548
concentration of these two compounds so

438
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,240
that's when I noticed something rather

439
00:17:18,548 --> 00:17:24,578
weird so we know all all alone that most

440
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,888
seventeen has a lot of smile as I a not

441
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:29,048
so much sniffles I see and we know the

442
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:30,548
opposite is true for be semi-sweet so

443
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,679
for all this time I've been assuming

444
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:35,230
that all the recumbent in bread lines

445
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:37,570
should be distributed kind of in a

446
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:40,240
negatively correlated way right because

447
00:17:37,569 --> 00:17:41,888
if we assume that or if we hypothesize

448
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,839
that there is a difference in the co

449
00:17:41,888 --> 00:17:46,178
transfer race then you should have

450
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,678
either a lot of the substrate or a lot

451
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:49,690
of the product so then you'll have a

452
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,669
negative correlation but that's not the

453
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,558
case here if you see that you see a

454
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:55,028
clear positive correlation trend

455
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:55,599
actually more than that

456
00:17:55,028 --> 00:17:58,329
there's

457
00:17:55,599 --> 00:18:01,199
be two separate classes one being more

458
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:04,240
like mo 17 the other be more like b73

459
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,788
okay so I was like if only there's one

460
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,099
way I can draw a line here and separate

461
00:18:06,788 --> 00:18:11,169
them and that's when the advantage of

462
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:14,079
marrying us statistician become really

463
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:15,910
really great okay so just so basically

464
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:18,490
my wife said oh you just meet neither

465
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:20,169
linear discrimination analysis to be

466
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:22,650
done here I was like let's do that

467
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:25,630
whatever that is okay

468
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:28,090
that's exactly what she did for me and

469
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:30,549
we show that we can actually separate

470
00:18:28,089 --> 00:18:33,609
the recombinant inbred lines into the

471
00:18:30,548 --> 00:18:36,460
most a machine like ones versus the b73

472
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:39,069
like ones so we can separate this this

473
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:41,950
population based on their phenotypes so

474
00:18:39,069 --> 00:18:43,629
we have two phenotypic classes and if we

475
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:46,720
say that there's some kind of genes

476
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:48,640
that's causing this discrimination then

477
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,169
the expression expression of that gene

478
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,409
should be significantly different

479
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:55,090
between my true phenotypic classes so

480
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:57,340
that's exactly what I did when I

481
00:18:55,089 --> 00:18:58,808
compared the gene expression data

482
00:18:57,339 --> 00:19:02,259
between this fingertip to fingertip

483
00:18:58,808 --> 00:19:04,690
classes across an entire genome so here

484
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:07,058
I'm showing the negative log of P value

485
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:09,640
based on students t-test and we see that

486
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:11,589
the genes that are most significantly

487
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,470
differentially expressed between this

488
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:17,529
two phenotypic class indeed locate right

489
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:19,569
within my QTL area if i zoom into like

490
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:21,009
this QTL area the gene that's most

491
00:19:19,569 --> 00:19:23,319
differentially expressed there's a

492
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:26,319
saline insensitive to which is a saline

493
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:29,918
receptor that's positively regulating a

494
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:32,079
saline signaling so if we look at the

495
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,090
segregation within the population we see

496
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:35,859
that the recombinant inbred lines that

497
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:39,220
have a phenotype that just looked like a

498
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:41,949
73 tend to express iron to a much high

499
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:46,179
significantly higher level so this was

500
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:48,730
lead us to the hypothesis that su

501
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:51,548
expression and hence a saline signaling

502
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:55,150
is a positive regulator of smaller size

503
00:19:51,548 --> 00:19:58,359
a two single size C transition okay so

504
00:19:55,150 --> 00:20:00,759
and we can test that hypothesis ideally

505
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:03,189
by looking at iron two mutant but that's

506
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:05,230
not available in maize so we did the

507
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,659
next best thing we can do which is

508
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:10,230
looking at a saline bio synthetic mutant

509
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:12,990
which constitutively make

510
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:15,900
so when we compare b73 it's well typed

511
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:18,599
in the background and ACS to six mutants

512
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:21,630
which produce less a saline indeed we

513
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:23,750
see that there's less Smith Nicholas I

514
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:26,220
see as smile si a being produced

515
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:28,440
constitutively and what's even more

516
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,990
exciting is that we can actually rescue

517
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,420
this phenotype by exogenously adding a

518
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:35,250
saline back to the ceilings and in

519
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:37,050
well-typed background you can actually

520
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:40,319
induce these two compounds with

521
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:42,629
exogenously so with this experiment we

522
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,149
have demonstrated that two novel

523
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:47,970
compounds found in maize Smiggle aside a

524
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:50,730
as Nicolas IC and smile si a that are

525
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:53,370
related to Fusarium resistance are

526
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:56,309
positively regulated by a saline

527
00:20:53,369 --> 00:21:00,000
signaling in vivo so that's the first

528
00:20:56,309 --> 00:21:02,250
story so far how does this fit in with

529
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,390
the literature about ethylene and

530
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:07,650
Fusarium so embody and wheat it has been

531
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,290
shown that absolutely actually

532
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:12,630
contribute to the susceptibility of this

533
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:14,460
area so in this case for example if you

534
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:16,560
treat Harley Leafs with ethylene you'd

535
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,809
be a stronger symptom and more fungal

536
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,519
commedia whereas in wheat if you have a

537
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:23,369
transgenic line that produced less

538
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:27,930
ethylene then you have a less severe

539
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:30,029
phenotype okay so this fit in with our

540
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:32,850
result really well because we show that

541
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:35,190
ethylene promotes melosa a which is the

542
00:21:32,849 --> 00:21:37,559
bio active compound transition into

543
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:41,430
simple as IC which is the deactivated

544
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:44,069
form so it looks like a this nicolas i

545
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:46,230
see as smile as i a provides some kind

546
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:50,029
of biochemical link between a saline

547
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:53,269
signaling and Fusarium resistance okay

548
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:55,589
so so far we've looked at two particular

549
00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:57,480
metabolites that is significantly

550
00:21:55,589 --> 00:22:00,569
different between the true genotypes

551
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:03,240
okay what we cannot do unfortunately is

552
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:05,189
to tell you how much this two

553
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,799
metabolites actually contribute to

554
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:09,930
resistance quantitatively because we

555
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:12,269
only found ethylene as an important

556
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:15,450
factor we cannot specifically manipulate

557
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:17,670
these two compounds in vivo so really if

558
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,529
you look back we found over seven

559
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,910
hundred metabolites where mask features

560
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:22,609
that are significantly different between

561
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:24,640
the two genotype and

562
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:27,500
one of those could give you a

563
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,480
disproportional impact on Fusarium

564
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,839
resistance and there's really no reason

565
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,789
I'm telling you compound that I just

566
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:36,829
tell you it's much more significant than

567
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:40,009
every other every other thing in this

568
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:42,889
700 poles okay but what I did show you

569
00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:45,500
is that we can do QTL mapping with mass

570
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:47,330
features and that does give a lead us to

571
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,759
somewhere in terms of the genetic

572
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:52,220
control so if we can do gin QTL mapping

573
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:54,048
for two mass features there's really

574
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,690
nothing to stop us from doing it for all

575
00:22:54,048 --> 00:22:58,940
700 mass features so the only thing is

576
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:00,980
that instead of showing you lost or for

577
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:04,460
two metabolites I'm going to show you

578
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:08,419
the distribution of QTL for all this 700

579
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:11,419
mapping that I did so in result on this

580
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:13,759
plot every on x-axis I'm laying out the

581
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:16,490
genetic locus on the earth in their

582
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:18,500
chromosomal order and on y-axis instead

583
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:20,839
of looking at how strongly that

584
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,970
particular locus is associated with one

585
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:25,459
particular metabolite instead I'm

586
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:27,769
measuring how many metabolites that give

587
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:31,370
you a significant UTL at that particular

588
00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:34,700
locus okay so immediately we recognize

589
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:37,969
this tower in being 2.9 towards the end

590
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:40,669
of chromosome 2 okay and this is really

591
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:42,679
interesting because being 2.09 has been

592
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:45,440
previously associated with multiple

593
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:48,019
disease resistance before in maize so

594
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,539
then our question is what's happening in

595
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:52,129
here what are the genes that is giving

596
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:55,009
that's affecting all this metabolize

597
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:57,049
because collectively they affect over 17

598
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:59,089
which have seven TMS features that's

599
00:23:57,048 --> 00:24:03,168
about 10% of what's different between

600
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:04,759
these two genotypes together okay and is

601
00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:06,520
there only one gene in there that's

602
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:08,450
affecting all this metabolites

603
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:09,980
simultaneously or are there just

604
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,509
multiple genes that's in the short

605
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:14,089
genetic interval kind of clustering

606
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:16,190
together okay and this is when you

607
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:18,769
translate that into physical distance we

608
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:21,650
still have about eight megabase to cover

609
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:24,650
and hundreds of genes in there so again

610
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:26,809
we can possibly come up with any rep

611
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:30,230
candidate genes just by looking at this

612
00:24:26,808 --> 00:24:32,808
plot so what we did there then is we can

613
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:35,900
get to the QTL by doing the table QTL

614
00:24:32,808 --> 00:24:36,168
mapping but when we can also look at the

615
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,970
x

616
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:39,980
oppression of genes and then ask the

617
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:42,558
question how is gene expression

618
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,480
correlated with our metabolite abundance

619
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:47,599
across this recombinant inbred line

620
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,028
population and our hypothesis is that if

621
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:51,408
there's only one gene in there then that

622
00:24:50,028 --> 00:24:53,450
one gene should be significantly

623
00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:55,700
correlated with all the mass features

624
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,288
that map to this locus whereas if there

625
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:00,470
are multiple genes in the interval each

626
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:02,720
regulating a subset then only the subset

627
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:05,450
and their regulator gene should be

628
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,089
correlated with each other so what's the

629
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:09,950
result that we got from that in this

630
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:13,428
crate in this case I'm laying out all

631
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:15,440
the transcript across a chromosome of

632
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:16,999
maize and then on the y-axis I'm

633
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,940
measuring the median Pearson's

634
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:22,970
correlation coefficient off that 75 mass

635
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:25,970
feature with each transcript and again

636
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:29,720
we start to see this very clean signal

637
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:32,629
within our QTL region in being 3.09 if

638
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,940
we zoom in there and ask for each

639
00:25:32,628 --> 00:25:36,558
transcript what's the number of mass

640
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,629
features that has that particular

641
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:41,210
transcript as the most single most

642
00:25:38,628 --> 00:25:43,339
correlated transcript we see that we

643
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:46,879
have a clear winner in a putative

644
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:48,918
vesicular transport protein which would

645
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:51,069
suggest that this single protein is

646
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:54,710
regulating many metabolites

647
00:25:51,069 --> 00:25:57,079
simultaneously so to actually prove that

648
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:59,960
help us or them support that hypothesis

649
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:01,970
we found two independent mutation

650
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,819
insertion lines that has this particular

651
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:06,950
gene knocked out and when we can confirm

652
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:10,038
the insertion we see that there's a

653
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:12,319
trend of decrease in this very important

654
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:14,808
metabolite defense metabolite cut in

655
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,579
bowler glucoside so at this point I have

656
00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:18,470
no statistics to support my claim

657
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:20,628
because this is based on very small

658
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:23,169
sample size but we're in the process of

659
00:26:20,628 --> 00:26:27,019
poking of the seeds so that hopefully

660
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:29,989
soon we'll add a steric scare so this

661
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:33,288
will show us that indeed the vesicular

662
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:36,379
transport protein is important - it's

663
00:26:33,288 --> 00:26:38,440
important for the metabolism of defense

664
00:26:36,378 --> 00:26:41,719
metabolites such as tambour glucoside

665
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:44,778
but that's kind of unexpected how could

666
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:48,379
a vesicular transport protein related to

667
00:26:44,778 --> 00:26:50,589
a secondary metabolism so one way we

668
00:26:48,378 --> 00:26:53,240
look at it is how about

669
00:26:50,589 --> 00:26:55,759
synthetic pathway off Bendix annoyed

670
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:59,150
with off which Timbo a glucoside is a

671
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:00,079
member of so we see that because without

672
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,960
a glucoside

673
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:05,779
die boa in boa all this men's oxy no is

674
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,120
a highly cytotoxic so for plant cells

675
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:11,210
actually makes sense for them to be kept

676
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:14,719
in the vacuole in my and the microsomes

677
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:17,210
so we think that the G that biosynthetic

678
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,460
genes should also localized in this

679
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:22,460
cellular compartment which are made from

680
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:24,799
vesicles so if there is some kind of a

681
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,930
disruption in the vesicular transport

682
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:30,829
protein or in that particular trend but

683
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:32,779
with secure transport protein then there

684
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:34,819
might be something there might be

685
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:41,149
something disrupting this entire bio

686
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:43,730
synthetic pathway as well ok so so far

687
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:47,060
I've been done all the studies within

688
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:49,039
the realm of IBA uh b73 mo seventeen

689
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:51,049
recombinant inbred lines I've shown you

690
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,240
we can do mapping with two metabolites

691
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:56,269
or we can do mapping across the entire

692
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,920
metabolome however there are limited

693
00:27:56,269 --> 00:28:00,200
genetic diversity looking at this

694
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,690
recombinant inbred lines as I've shown

695
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,000
you there are only 700 over slightly

696
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:08,000
over 700 mass features that we can map

697
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,619
with this population but what I hope

698
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,569
I've convinced you is that this

699
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:13,849
experimental approach of combining

700
00:28:11,569 --> 00:28:15,529
metabolomics transcriptomics and

701
00:28:13,849 --> 00:28:17,869
quantitative genetics it's really

702
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:20,359
powerful when it comes to dissecting the

703
00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:22,849
secondary metabolism so we decided to

704
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:24,459
take this approach extend it to a much

705
00:28:22,849 --> 00:28:27,049
more chemically diverse genetic

706
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:30,549
genome-wide Association study panel

707
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:34,430
which include over 280 genotypes and

708
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:37,009
from there we found more than 3,900 Mass

709
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:39,289
features that we can dissect using the

710
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:42,230
exact same approach okay

711
00:28:39,289 --> 00:28:44,690
so we're lucky that the same diversity

712
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:48,410
panel the transcriptome has previously

713
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:51,019
has only recently been analyzed by Carl

714
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:52,880
Kremlin here in at buckler's group so we

715
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:54,529
use the exact same tissue type and we

716
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,050
try to keep the growth condition as

717
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:58,670
consistent as possible looking at this

718
00:28:57,049 --> 00:29:00,799
will be the emergence certainly if

719
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:04,230
looking at the tip of that and the base

720
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:07,259
of it okay so we harvest the tip and

721
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:09,538
and base of all this over 280 lines and

722
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:12,839
then perform some performative element

723
00:29:09,538 --> 00:29:14,879
analysis so the first thing before we

724
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:18,119
even go into the genetics is we try to

725
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,580
parse out the vast data set that we have

726
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:23,158
how can we explain the variance in this

727
00:29:20,579 --> 00:29:25,648
pretty big data set so the first thing

728
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:27,630
we see that is the first thing we see is

729
00:29:25,648 --> 00:29:30,058
that the tissue type seems to be really

730
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:32,429
important not so surprisingly so the

731
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:34,648
base and tip seems to clustering very

732
00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:36,690
well with each other so that means we

733
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:38,099
should probably analyze those data sets

734
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:40,889
separately from each other

735
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:43,349
another way to visualize this is that if

736
00:29:40,888 --> 00:29:45,479
we can do two-way anova on every single

737
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:48,000
mouse feature and say how are they

738
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,429
different either by tissue or by genetic

739
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,308
sub population or interactive and we see

740
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:54,298
the vast majority of them are

741
00:29:52,308 --> 00:29:56,819
significantly different based on tissue

742
00:29:54,298 --> 00:29:59,579
type whereas by genetically defined

743
00:29:56,819 --> 00:30:03,240
defined subpopulations less of them are

744
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:06,028
actually significantly different okay so

745
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,370
when it comes to metabolomics are always

746
00:30:06,028 --> 00:30:10,798
bothering question is you know what are

747
00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:12,778
the metabolites so people always act as

748
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:15,148
but this is great so but but what are

749
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:16,888
the metabolites unfortunately not like

750
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:18,658
in transcriptomics you can map to the

751
00:30:16,888 --> 00:30:20,548
genome and say okay this is this gene

752
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:22,528
and this is that gene you can't really

753
00:30:20,548 --> 00:30:24,690
say that with metabolites there are only

754
00:30:22,528 --> 00:30:27,839
very limited information we have in hand

755
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:29,460
so when we want to say what's what are

756
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:31,408
the metabolites that's driving the

757
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,090
differentiation between you know

758
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:36,059
different tissue types we really have a

759
00:30:33,089 --> 00:30:38,069
hard time so to address that question I

760
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:40,888
look at my chroma I look at my

761
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:44,250
chromatogram so this is a UV absorption

762
00:30:40,888 --> 00:30:46,469
from a chromatogram from my analysis so

763
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:48,509
at the beginning things are more polar

764
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:51,269
and at the ends things are more non

765
00:30:48,509 --> 00:30:53,308
polar but what I what I've come to

766
00:30:51,269 --> 00:30:55,349
realize is that you can actually divide

767
00:30:53,308 --> 00:30:57,720
this base on their retention time or

768
00:30:55,349 --> 00:30:59,189
based on their relative polarity and we

769
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,649
know that this are physiologically

770
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:03,960
relevant because we can click into every

771
00:31:01,648 --> 00:31:06,028
single peak in here which represent a

772
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,970
metabolize and look at their UV

773
00:31:06,028 --> 00:31:11,339
absorption profile so we see that the

774
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:13,860
peaks in this area tend to have

775
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:15,689
identical or similar UV absorption

776
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:17,729
profile that's characteristic of

777
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:20,399
phenolic acid set

778
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:22,319
similarly Peaks within this area looks

779
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:24,750
like Ben's oxen whites and pigs within

780
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,730
this area looks like flavonoids and this

781
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:29,130
is probably not so surprising if you

782
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:30,360
think about if there are the same class

783
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:32,278
of compounds which means they're

784
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:33,808
structurally related to each other then

785
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:35,880
their polarity should be more or less

786
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:38,220
similar to each other as well right

787
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,919
so that means we can divide we can

788
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:43,679
subset our chromatograms into different

789
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:46,019
groups and then putative lycée are they

790
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,610
different in this retention time range

791
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:49,409
then we can say oh maybe they're

792
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:51,479
different mostly because of phenolic

793
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:53,429
acid and if they're different mostly in

794
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,750
this area of the chromatogram then it's

795
00:31:53,429 --> 00:31:57,389
the flavonoids that's causing the

796
00:31:54,750 --> 00:32:01,109
difference so indeed when we look at

797
00:31:57,388 --> 00:32:03,449
this we can plot the negative log of p

798
00:32:01,109 --> 00:32:06,028
value from our previous two way ANOVA

799
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:07,710
analysis and what you see is that each

800
00:32:06,028 --> 00:32:09,839
dot here represents a single mass

801
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:12,929
feature and they're not distributed

802
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:15,538
uniformly across our chromatograph okay

803
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:19,019
for example we come here tissue type we

804
00:32:15,538 --> 00:32:20,730
see there are significantly more mass

805
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:23,089
features that are significantly

806
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:25,950
different widths in the flavonoid

807
00:32:23,089 --> 00:32:27,658
flavonoid time range whereas when we

808
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:29,580
look at the mass features that's

809
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:31,649
differentiated between subpopulations

810
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:34,918
they're almost exclusively within

811
00:32:31,648 --> 00:32:37,709
depends extended range okay so we can

812
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:39,870
actually compare the negative log of p

813
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:42,090
value from two way ANOVA with another

814
00:32:39,869 --> 00:32:44,369
one way ANOVA and then say is there any

815
00:32:42,089 --> 00:32:46,230
significant difference between each

816
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:48,359
retention time group and the answer is

817
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:50,579
yes okay what your eyeballing is

818
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:53,069
actually happening so for tissue type

819
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:54,898
most of the most of differentiating part

820
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:57,269
are we seeing a flavonoid time range

821
00:32:54,898 --> 00:32:59,369
whereas for the SubPop genetic sub

822
00:32:57,269 --> 00:33:03,599
population they're mostly differentiated

823
00:32:59,369 --> 00:33:05,668
based on bins ox androids okay so is

824
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:08,699
that actually happening we can look at

825
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:10,679
some examples okay so for example if we

826
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,019
compare the lift tip and fleet base and

827
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:15,990
this is Toto UV absorption profile and

828
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:18,388
we see that there's clear absence of any

829
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:20,519
flavonoids in the leaf base so we see

830
00:33:18,388 --> 00:33:24,089
that flavonoids are exclusively found in

831
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:26,089
the tip of the of the leaf okay so

832
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:28,230
that's the primary driving factor of

833
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:30,778
differentiating this to tissue type and

834
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,620
when we look at genetic defined sub

835
00:33:30,778 --> 00:33:34,079
populate

836
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:36,418
we see that Bendix enjoys such as in

837
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:39,119
this case dim boa is significantly lower

838
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:42,270
in tropical lines whereas the same

839
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:44,099
tropical lines tend to accumulate a

840
00:33:42,269 --> 00:33:48,329
different Bendix annoyed compound called

841
00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:50,879
HTML glucoside okay so we do find out

842
00:33:48,329 --> 00:33:55,589
the same thing looking at specifics as

843
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:57,720
well as the global analysis so so far

844
00:33:55,589 --> 00:34:00,240
I've been showing you analysis based on

845
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:03,079
a priori knowledge okay so we know that

846
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,000
the the different samples can be

847
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:07,678
categorised into either tip or base or

848
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,320
they think can be categorized into

849
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,878
different genetically defined

850
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:14,820
subpopulations but how about if we just

851
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:17,368
examine this big data set without any a

852
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:19,080
priori knowledge I just want to know how

853
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:23,909
are the mass feature is distributed

854
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:26,819
across my entire population okay so in

855
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:28,530
this to plot again I'm analyzing the tip

856
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:31,200
and base data separately from each other

857
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:34,710
on the x-axis I'm looking at the

858
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:36,628
frequency for each mass feature at which

859
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:37,889
it's being detected so basically this is

860
00:34:36,628 --> 00:34:39,868
a histogram right

861
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:44,309
whereas on y-axis is how often they are

862
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:47,280
so we see that those in tip and base we

863
00:34:44,309 --> 00:34:49,799
have a bimodal distribution okay so

864
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,869
there are about 15% of all the mass

865
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:55,280
features that we detected I found almost

866
00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:57,720
ubiquitously like over 90% of the Matata

867
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,060
genotypes that we examined half this

868
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:03,719
mass features whereas we also have this

869
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:06,269
significant L over 40% of the

870
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:09,839
metabolites are only found in less than

871
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:12,090
20% of the entire population and I think

872
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,950
this really really highlights the vast

873
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:16,230
chemical diversity that's existing

874
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:18,389
within this population and you can think

875
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:20,010
of this kind of as essential metabolites

876
00:35:18,389 --> 00:35:21,659
there's apparently of liquid sweet and

877
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:24,240
there's something like expendable

878
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:26,190
metabolites if you will and we also see

879
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,618
that there's actually a significant

880
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:30,960
difference in how this to distribution

881
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:33,539
look like between the two dishes have

882
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,820
tissue types such that in the base you

883
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:38,460
have more of the expendable metabolites

884
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:41,070
whereas in the tip distribution is

885
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:45,050
actually more flat okay so the bimodal

886
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:49,070
pattern is more up is less obvious

887
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:52,789
okay so but when I first got this result

888
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:54,410
my concern was really are this tells

889
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:56,809
really just noise from a metabolomics

890
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:58,670
analysis because those are the exact

891
00:35:56,809 --> 00:36:02,000
same pattern what you will expect from

892
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:04,579
the tab from lcms noise okay they tend

893
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,849
to occur in very small subsets of your

894
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:09,980
entire population and they're kind of

895
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:12,139
accounting a big part of your data set

896
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:14,030
so it'll be it'll kind of suck if you

897
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:15,759
publishes and find out all these are

898
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:19,190
actually just noise not true metabolites

899
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,440
so one characteristic associated with

900
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:23,510
mass spec noise is that they also tend

901
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,190
to have lower intensity because they're

902
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:27,080
they're just a machine noise they're not

903
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:29,329
representative of true metabolised

904
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:33,440
founding samples so what I decided to

905
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:36,319
test is to see thus the occurrence

906
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:40,760
frequency somehow correlate with the

907
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:42,850
intensity off of a mass feature so in

908
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,890
both tip and base we found a very weak

909
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:47,929
positive correlation so it does seems

910
00:36:45,889 --> 00:36:50,089
like the ones that occur at lower

911
00:36:47,929 --> 00:36:52,579
frequency tend to have lower intensity

912
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:54,710
as well but you also see that this

913
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:56,539
distribution is so broad you have mass

914
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:59,480
features that occur for example almost

915
00:36:56,539 --> 00:37:01,460
less than 20% of the population that

916
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,769
have higher intensity than the ones

917
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:05,510
that's found in vigorously so we do

918
00:37:03,769 --> 00:37:07,639
think that most of the mass features

919
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:10,460
that we are finding here are not noise

920
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:12,379
from the machine but I think you have

921
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,720
already noticed that across this

922
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:17,960
positive correlation we also have

923
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:20,689
noticeable exceptions okay so this mass

924
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:24,199
features here are occurring less than

925
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:26,659
20% of all our all the genotypes we have

926
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:30,409
examined but they are found at very high

927
00:37:26,659 --> 00:37:32,719
intensity they're colored based on a 95%

928
00:37:30,409 --> 00:37:35,659
confidence interval of a linear

929
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:37,579
regression okay so we decided to look at

930
00:37:35,659 --> 00:37:40,129
some of this so what are these mass

931
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:43,309
features that are rare but occurring at

932
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:45,800
high intensity so when we look at this

933
00:37:43,309 --> 00:37:49,250
three for example showing one of them

934
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:51,890
have a mass to charge ratio of 350 3.5

935
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:54,079
we see that actually you can find an

936
00:37:51,889 --> 00:37:56,569
exact same mass feature exact you can

937
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,679
find exact same master charge rate range

938
00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:01,710
in another

939
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:04,169
in other genotypes okay so for example

940
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:06,119
in this genotype call for two to six we

941
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:08,309
have this to metabolize with that

942
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:11,759
particular mass to charge ratio however

943
00:38:08,309 --> 00:38:14,369
in CML 45 we have a completely different

944
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,110
different peak showing up that has the

945
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:18,179
exact same molecular weight but

946
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:19,950
different retention time and they're

947
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:22,739
actually occurring a much higher

948
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:25,619
intensity so that you see the original

949
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:28,229
two peaks tend to be really short or

950
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:31,799
really small in this case so that means

951
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:33,210
we I interpret this as a rear isomer so

952
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,430
they have the exact same molecular

953
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:37,740
weight but different polarity so

954
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:39,839
different 2d structure so that they

955
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:42,779
allude at a different retention time

956
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:44,550
okay so when we look at all three of

957
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:47,040
this what's really interesting is that

958
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:49,890
all three of them show you the exact

959
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:52,739
have a shared ms/ms

960
00:38:49,889 --> 00:38:55,259
or tendon ms fragment okay so this

961
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:57,209
metabolize can be fragmented so that you

962
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:59,850
get the parental ion but also the

963
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:02,369
franklin ions so you see all three of

964
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:04,559
this rare high-intensity metabolites

965
00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:06,960
have a shared fragment which means they

966
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:08,279
are structurally related if you do the

967
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,030
mass between them you have a

968
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:15,510
hydroxylation and a methylation okay so

969
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:17,160
that further strengthened our hypothesis

970
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:20,340
that they are probably structurally

971
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:22,500
related with each other and if we look

972
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:25,320
at occurrence of this three metabolites

973
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:28,019
or three mask features so here I'm

974
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:30,180
showing a student phylogeny off my 282

975
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:33,119
population and then on the lower the

976
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:35,219
color the color plot in blue I'm showing

977
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,650
where that the top ass feature is being

978
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:40,049
detected at high intensity whereas in

979
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:41,630
yellow they're not detected and you see

980
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:44,160
that most of the time there are

981
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,840
co-occurrence which means when you find

982
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:48,059
one of them all three of them are

983
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:50,160
probably there okay so this strongly

984
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:52,650
suggests that this three metabolize

985
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:54,210
they're rare they're high intensity and

986
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:59,250
they're structurally related to each

987
00:39:54,210 --> 00:40:01,079
other okay so we really want to now look

988
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:03,059
for you know what's the genetic basis

989
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:05,190
why do we sometimes have this rare

990
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:08,099
isomers why sometimes we have the more

991
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:09,659
common ways so for that again that's

992
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:12,489
when we need to do the genome-wide

993
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:14,889
Association study but before we actually

994
00:40:12,489 --> 00:40:16,779
look at any of this unknown metabolites

995
00:40:14,889 --> 00:40:18,969
we want to make sure that our G was is

996
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,890
actually working so that's when we go

997
00:40:18,969 --> 00:40:23,859
back to our old friend Ben's oxy knows

998
00:40:20,889 --> 00:40:26,500
where we previously used by parental

999
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:29,050
mapping population of this metabolize

1000
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:31,690
and then correctly identify their

1001
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:34,119
respective biosynthetic genes so we want

1002
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:36,700
to use this as our positive controls for

1003
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:38,680
the jiwa study and say can we recover

1004
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:41,049
the same gene using the same mass

1005
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:43,149
feature or the same metabolites okay and

1006
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:45,730
the answer is yes when we map with

1007
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:48,849
symbol in kuba glucoside we found it's

1008
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:51,250
virus inside between px 13 and we map

1009
00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:52,900
with when we map with HTML glucoside not

1010
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:55,360
only do we find the previously

1011
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:58,079
identified biases active gene B X 12 we

1012
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,160
also found this significant snip unknown

1013
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,559
located towards the end of chromosome 9

1014
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:04,059
so that's really interesting so I got

1015
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:05,829
sidetracked it a little bit so I want to

1016
00:41:04,059 --> 00:41:08,170
know what is this unknown why why do I

1017
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:10,239
have another snip here so we know B X 12

1018
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:12,909
is a biosynthetic gene is this another

1019
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:15,309
biosynthetic gene here so that's when I

1020
00:41:12,909 --> 00:41:20,079
go to their genome and then look at p73

1021
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:22,269
versus CML 247 genome so CML 247 is a

1022
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,250
tropical line remember previously I

1023
00:41:22,269 --> 00:41:27,369
mentioned tropical lines tend to have

1024
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:29,710
higher amount of HTM or glucose ID

1025
00:41:27,369 --> 00:41:32,050
however when we compare their genome

1026
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:34,179
there doesn't seem to be any structural

1027
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:36,730
variation in terms of presence/absence

1028
00:41:34,179 --> 00:41:39,219
okay and that's where our G Y snip has

1029
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:41,349
are located so our clear candidate at

1030
00:41:39,219 --> 00:41:43,779
this point will be this gene right here

1031
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:46,599
which encodes a protein phosphatase to

1032
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:48,280
see family protein okay so the way we

1033
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:50,679
look at this is I go back to cow's

1034
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:53,050
expression data and then plot out its

1035
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:55,480
expression across our entire G West

1036
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:57,369
lines and then we take the two tails of

1037
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,440
this expression distribution and then

1038
00:41:57,369 --> 00:42:02,410
compare their H timba glucoside

1039
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,480
metabolites and indeed we see that for

1040
00:42:02,409 --> 00:42:06,608
the lines that express this gene a high

1041
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,309
level they tend to have significantly

1042
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:10,960
higher aged in Bogalusa side so this

1043
00:42:09,309 --> 00:42:13,690
will be strong evidence suggesting that

1044
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,429
this expression of this gene at least is

1045
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:17,440
Co segregating with our metabolic

1046
00:42:15,429 --> 00:42:19,989
phenotype which means this would be a

1047
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,210
very nice candidate genes to say does

1048
00:42:19,989 --> 00:42:25,509
that actually regulate HT more glucoside

1049
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:27,730
biosynthesis or metabolism in vivo

1050
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:29,650
okay so that's a good size story from

1051
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:32,619
the positive control how about the rare

1052
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:34,480
isomers were talking about earlier so we

1053
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:36,490
did genetic mapping again so this is

1054
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,139
rather preliminary state data at this

1055
00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:41,079
point so I've used a slightly different

1056
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:43,719
genetic data set but what we find out is

1057
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:45,789
that this three potentially structurally

1058
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:47,529
related metabolites map to the same

1059
00:42:45,789 --> 00:42:49,929
exact locus towards the end of

1060
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:51,970
chromosome four so probably not too

1061
00:42:49,929 --> 00:42:53,589
surprising we've seen this before the

1062
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:56,349
structurally related ferrell or sucrose

1063
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:59,500
is mapped to the same locus as well okay

1064
00:42:56,349 --> 00:43:02,469
so what is within this locus there so

1065
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:05,619
lucky for us one of the lines the half

1066
00:43:02,469 --> 00:43:07,929
this rear isomers again is CML 2:47

1067
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:11,289
which we have the genome so we compared

1068
00:43:07,929 --> 00:43:15,000
a genome of 240 cm l/24 t7 with p73 and

1069
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:18,190
what we found is a 40 kb insertion with

1070
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:21,309
specific to the CML 2:47 which contains

1071
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:24,429
four putative gene models one of them

1072
00:43:21,309 --> 00:43:27,579
being one of them being a putative and

1073
00:43:24,429 --> 00:43:29,289
so sign in Iowa synthesis regulator so

1074
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:31,179
anthocyanins is also in the feel

1075
00:43:29,289 --> 00:43:33,579
appropriate pathway so we think that

1076
00:43:31,179 --> 00:43:35,710
maybe this is what we're looking for but

1077
00:43:33,579 --> 00:43:37,769
at this point I think at least we have

1078
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:40,840
preliminary evidence associated this

1079
00:43:37,769 --> 00:43:46,030
associating this 40 kb insertion with

1080
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:48,280
those rare isomers that we observed okay

1081
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:50,590
so so far I've been again looking at

1082
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,500
individuals but remember I mentioned

1083
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:55,809
there over 3,900 mass features that we

1084
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:58,989
can map and if you just do that one by

1085
00:43:55,809 --> 00:44:01,000
one for a look at that manually for

1086
00:43:58,989 --> 00:44:03,129
every one of them you know that take

1087
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,969
probably 3900 graduate students to do

1088
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:10,329
that okay so instead I'll compile their

1089
00:44:06,969 --> 00:44:13,029
jiwa result and then again on the x-axis

1090
00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:15,670
I'm looking at genetic locus for snips

1091
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:18,550
and then I'm counting for each snip or

1092
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:21,070
each genetic locus how many metabolites

1093
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:23,740
G Waze hits that I got and again we

1094
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:25,869
start to see these towers coming up okay

1095
00:44:23,739 --> 00:44:28,269
which means small genetic locus

1096
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:32,050
associated with large part of the

1097
00:44:28,269 --> 00:44:33,789
metabolomic a so then what are the

1098
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:35,230
metabolites that map to there again it's

1099
00:44:33,789 --> 00:44:36,429
always the question about what what are

1100
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:38,469
the metabolites what are the mass

1101
00:44:36,429 --> 00:44:39,329
features remember I've already come up

1102
00:44:38,469 --> 00:44:40,769
with a putative

1103
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:42,989
into that which is looking at retention

1104
00:44:40,769 --> 00:44:45,659
time okay so what we see is that

1105
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:48,539
structurally related metabolites tend to

1106
00:44:45,659 --> 00:44:50,909
have clustered retention time okay so

1107
00:44:48,539 --> 00:44:53,340
what we can do then is to say if we

1108
00:44:50,909 --> 00:44:55,769
measured the variance of retention time

1109
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:58,950
of mass features and mapped the same

1110
00:44:55,769 --> 00:45:01,980
locus that give us a measure of how

1111
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:03,179
structurally related are those okay so

1112
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:05,789
that's exactly what I did

1113
00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:08,519
so in this plot I'm measuring the log of

1114
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:10,679
variance of retention time you see the

1115
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:12,300
background level up here and you start

1116
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:14,250
to see all this valleys dipping down

1117
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,440
which means the mass features are

1118
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:18,840
physically clustered together on the

1119
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:21,360
chromatogram and if we compared this

1120
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:23,940
plot to the G wasps result we have

1121
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:26,400
almost perfect correspondence okay

1122
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:28,530
whenever you have a peak on the number

1123
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,619
of G was hits in the genome you also

1124
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:33,690
have a valley in the retention time what

1125
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:36,599
that tells us is that structurally

1126
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:39,659
related metabolites tend to be regulated

1127
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:41,130
by the same locus in your genome when

1128
00:45:39,659 --> 00:45:42,869
you say that out loud it makes a lot of

1129
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:44,670
sense but when you want to want your

1130
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:47,519
data to say that to you it takes a

1131
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:49,680
little bit more work so we can actually

1132
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:51,659
try to identify what are the genes or

1133
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:53,879
what are the structural variants there

1134
00:45:51,659 --> 00:45:55,920
that's associated we see that in bread

1135
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,900
there are for example known Ben's ox

1136
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,180
annoyed biosynthetic genes that we can

1137
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,889
recover from this analysis and also in

1138
00:46:00,179 --> 00:46:08,039
blue there will be the putative found

1139
00:46:01,889 --> 00:46:08,789
notes okay okay so in summary what have

1140
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:11,880
I told you today

1141
00:46:08,789 --> 00:46:14,099
so I've coaches three stories first we

1142
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,440
discovered to metabolize that has not

1143
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:18,420
been reported in maize before cost - I

1144
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,010
ate and smoothens I see we think they're

1145
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:22,470
related to Fusarium Bremner and

1146
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:24,960
resistance and we show you that a saline

1147
00:46:22,469 --> 00:46:26,879
signaling and probably iron - expression

1148
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,150
is positively regulating this

1149
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:32,369
acetylation reaction and then we extend

1150
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:34,579
that from single metabolites - across

1151
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:37,130
the entire metabolome to show you that

1152
00:46:34,579 --> 00:46:39,869
correlation between metabolomics and

1153
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:41,730
transcriptomics analysis can help us to

1154
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:43,369
pinpoint candidate genes from

1155
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:45,990
quantitative genetics results and

1156
00:46:43,369 --> 00:46:48,480
finally we extended that same approach

1157
00:46:45,989 --> 00:46:51,299
to a much more diverse she was and she

1158
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:53,219
was population and show you add a global

1159
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:55,680
scale that's structurally related

1160
00:46:53,219 --> 00:46:59,789
tablets tend to be Co regulated by the

1161
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:02,039
same locus in the genome okay so I think

1162
00:46:59,789 --> 00:47:04,079
with that being said I think that's all

1163
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:05,608
of my research part I would like to take

1164
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,490
a pause here before my long and

1165
00:47:05,608 --> 00:47:09,960
emotional acknowledgment section and

1166
00:47:07,489 --> 00:47:11,669
everybody forget about your questions so

1167
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:27,568
I would like to take any questions you

1168
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:33,139
may have thank you yes it's a lot to

1169
00:47:27,568 --> 00:47:35,809
consider here so when you look at the

1170
00:47:33,139 --> 00:47:37,980
sampling the tip which is a well

1171
00:47:35,809 --> 00:47:40,078
differentiated terminal differentiated

1172
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:44,429
tissue and the base of the leaf or you

1173
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:46,530
have still you know many cells along

1174
00:47:44,429 --> 00:47:49,139
gating some differentiating depending on

1175
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:52,890
you know where the state is statuses

1176
00:47:49,139 --> 00:47:54,868
that believed to diversity panel

1177
00:47:52,889 --> 00:47:56,848
wouldn't you suspect that there's a lot

1178
00:47:54,869 --> 00:48:00,960
of variations still within the base of

1179
00:47:56,849 --> 00:48:02,068
the leaf and it could be influencing

1180
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:06,809
some of your results too

1181
00:48:02,068 --> 00:48:08,789
I mean like when you look at one of the

1182
00:48:06,809 --> 00:48:10,170
major concerns you know when we do a

1183
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:11,849
tree watch we hope to explain the

1184
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:14,130
variance in phenotype by various in

1185
00:48:11,849 --> 00:48:16,349
genotype right but then there's no way

1186
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:18,210
you can you can talk about that outside

1187
00:48:16,349 --> 00:48:20,460
the framework of development so there

1188
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:22,139
will be differentiation and development

1189
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:24,240
and indeed many of the many of the

1190
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:26,789
genotypic difference we saw or probably

1191
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:28,739
can be attributed to different

1192
00:48:26,789 --> 00:48:31,170
biological differences in rate of

1193
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:33,328
development so we try to do that as

1194
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:36,630
consistently as possible as consistently

1195
00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:39,480
as possible but you know if we map to an

1196
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:41,849
ox in response factor that that's also

1197
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:44,190
biologically true right so it's

1198
00:48:41,849 --> 00:48:48,000
biologically relevant so we're not just

1199
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:52,010
looking at a bio synthetic enzyme in

1200
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:55,010
secondary metabolism pathway per se so

1201
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:55,010
yeah

1202
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:15,180
yeah

1203
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:17,970
so sorry I probably didn't say that very

1204
00:49:15,179 --> 00:49:32,069
clearly there so there's three does 353

1205
00:49:17,969 --> 00:49:38,189
there are isomers so if we go back sorry

1206
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:40,830
guys I have to mess up somewhere okay so

1207
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:42,570
both dis chromatograms are done with

1208
00:49:40,829 --> 00:49:44,730
mass to charge ratio the same master

1209
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:48,830
charge ratios so this two are isomers

1210
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:51,269
okay right because they have the same

1211
00:49:48,829 --> 00:49:53,369
molar weight but different retention

1212
00:49:51,269 --> 00:49:55,980
times okay but what I'm saying is that

1213
00:49:53,369 --> 00:49:59,579
this is only one of this dots up here

1214
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:01,559
there's 369 and the 383 are the other

1215
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:03,690
two I'm not saying this three are

1216
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:06,299
isomers of each other but rather there

1217
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:07,470
are series of rare isomers which we can

1218
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:10,440
find a more common more common

1219
00:50:07,469 --> 00:50:19,319
counterparts in other genotype the

1220
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:28,200
second question is 700 do you have an

1221
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:31,580
idea of a related sorry can't say the

1222
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:31,579
first part of your question again I do

1223
00:50:31,909 --> 00:50:41,879
features that you got for the

1224
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:45,179
differential now so can you say they are

1225
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:46,650
right so apparently the data is there so

1226
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:50,039
we can use the same kind of retention

1227
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:53,160
time analysis to say you know where are

1228
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:55,019
all those 700 Mass feature allocated in

1229
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:56,969
my chromatograph and that give us some

1230
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:59,280
idea about what they are and my guess

1231
00:50:56,969 --> 00:51:01,939
based on the G wasps result is that

1232
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:04,200
there are probably most in mostly in the

1233
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:06,210
stands are so annoyed pathway as well

1234
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:08,480
that would be my guest but I don't know

1235
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:11,119
that yep

1236
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:24,170
classic so you're very beginning of your

1237
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:25,960
slideshow yeah we don't know you know so

1238
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:30,440
so why did you choose this particular

1239
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:33,980
you know range good question so when we

1240
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:35,329
look at this i remember i know towards

1241
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:37,639
the end kind of truce areum just fall

1242
00:51:35,329 --> 00:51:40,250
out of the picture so sorry for for the

1243
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:42,049
fungal biologist here but remember we're

1244
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:43,789
trying to look at secondary metabolites

1245
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:46,400
we're trying to look for metabolites was

1246
00:51:43,789 --> 00:51:49,429
known that's associated with biochemical

1247
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,380
defense so that's why we decided to use

1248
00:51:49,429 --> 00:51:53,389
a 50 percent methanol extract where we

1249
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:55,220
get most of the so-called mid polarity

1250
00:51:53,389 --> 00:51:57,679
metabolites whereas if you look at

1251
00:51:55,219 --> 00:52:00,259
sugars you know or primary metabolites

1252
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:01,699
there that are important for biochemical

1253
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:03,560
defense but traditionally they're not

1254
00:52:01,699 --> 00:52:05,299
associated with that and also you can

1255
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:07,219
you can make the argument to say why are

1256
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:09,260
we not looking at lipids you know so so

1257
00:52:07,219 --> 00:52:12,858
whenever you're looking at metabolomics

1258
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:15,350
it's never comprehensive per se so the

1259
00:52:12,858 --> 00:52:17,569
argument we're making here are limited

1260
00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:19,940
to you know really if you look at the

1261
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:22,190
chromatogram we really see primarily

1262
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:23,780
three major classes of compounds we see

1263
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:25,820
phenolic acid you see Bendix a noise

1264
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:28,100
when we see flavonoids I can't tell you

1265
00:52:25,820 --> 00:53:04,990
anything about sugars for lipids or

1266
00:52:28,099 --> 00:53:07,400
whatever so the question the question is

1267
00:53:04,989 --> 00:53:09,349
at the beginning of my slide I make the

1268
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:11,780
argument that biochemical and molecular

1269
00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:17,690
markers are less work but this doesn't

1270
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:20,480
look like less work can you can you try

1271
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:22,010
to correlate what we observe here to any

1272
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,170
kind of

1273
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:27,890
for example disease symptoms that we can

1274
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:29,180
measure so I think correlation will be a

1275
00:53:27,889 --> 00:53:32,779
little bit too ambitious to the chief

1276
00:53:29,179 --> 00:53:35,868
but what we can do is to do a pairwise

1277
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:37,369
comparison which you cannot do if user

1278
00:53:35,869 --> 00:53:40,519
started out the quantitative genetics

1279
00:53:37,369 --> 00:53:41,480
approach by directly scoring symptoms

1280
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:43,820
okay

1281
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:45,699
so right now since we have identified

1282
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:47,510
specific locus that's associated with

1283
00:53:45,699 --> 00:53:49,909
metabolites that are probably associated

1284
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:51,680
with resistance then we can say let's

1285
00:53:49,909 --> 00:53:53,509
find a mutant in this particular gene

1286
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:55,129
and then we can do pairwise comparison

1287
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:58,609
is there any significant difference

1288
00:53:55,130 --> 00:54:00,740
between my mutant versus well type that

1289
00:53:58,608 --> 00:54:02,779
we know are only different by this

1290
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:04,368
biochemical phenotype and that's exactly

1291
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:06,920
what I'm planning to do with the

1292
00:54:04,369 --> 00:54:08,809
vesicular vesicular transport protein

1293
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:11,480
because in that case I have a very

1294
00:54:08,809 --> 00:54:13,549
specific manipulation genetically so I

1295
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,990
can say not only cannot test is there

1296
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:16,460
any biochemical difference between my

1297
00:54:14,989 --> 00:54:17,689
mutant and wild type is there a

1298
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:19,490
significant difference in their

1299
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:21,920
biological phenotype in terms of disease

1300
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:23,719
resistance unfortunately we cannot do

1301
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,358
that for the feral or sucrose part

1302
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:28,279
because it's on cue if you knock how

1303
00:54:26,358 --> 00:54:30,409
high onto or if you disturb a saline

1304
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:32,869
pathway yeah you will see a phenotype

1305
00:54:30,409 --> 00:54:36,199
that that that you can say that's

1306
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:37,100
because the feral or sucrose because

1307
00:54:36,199 --> 00:54:56,089
there are two thousand other things

1308
00:54:37,099 --> 00:54:58,789
that's also changed in people of the of

1309
00:54:56,090 --> 00:55:11,240
the Pharos sucrose you mean I'm sorry

1310
00:54:58,789 --> 00:55:15,259
the Smigiel science - idea what kind of

1311
00:55:11,239 --> 00:55:17,689
mechanism yeah yeah so there

1312
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:19,400
I would say two classes of mechanisms

1313
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:21,530
that's been associated with resistance

1314
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:24,320
so the first class for example phenolic

1315
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:27,050
acids it's been shown data has in vivo

1316
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:30,710
in vitro activity so it means that

1317
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:33,860
somehow it's biocidal or inhibits the

1318
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:35,510
gross okay so molecular molecular

1319
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:38,539
mechanism we don't really know

1320
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:40,520
so there are antioxidants so antioxidant

1321
00:55:38,539 --> 00:55:42,889
are thought to be good but you know we

1322
00:55:40,519 --> 00:55:46,210
don't really know but on the other hand

1323
00:55:42,889 --> 00:55:48,559
probably something more relevant is that

1324
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:51,159
usually phenolic acids are associated

1325
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:53,150
with structural structural

1326
00:55:51,159 --> 00:55:55,759
fortifications the word I'm looking for

1327
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:57,920
okay so vast majority of the phenolic

1328
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:00,500
acid you found in planta are actually

1329
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:03,019
esterified to the cell wall so it's been

1330
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:04,789
shown that one of the major response one

1331
00:56:03,019 --> 00:56:06,829
of the first response to fungal

1332
00:56:04,789 --> 00:56:08,960
infection is that you have this major

1333
00:56:06,829 --> 00:56:10,969
production induction of phenolic acid

1334
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:14,019
and they tend to all go towards cell

1335
00:56:10,969 --> 00:56:16,669
wall and reinforce our cell wall so if

1336
00:56:14,019 --> 00:56:19,639
the two compounds that we found actually

1337
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:21,530
play a role by reinforcing the cell wall

1338
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:23,629
then we would not have captured that

1339
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:28,810
activity with the in vitro inhibition

1340
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:28,809
assay I hope that answered a question

1341
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:44,619
that approaches biased words finding

1342
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:03,139
it's a good question I can't exact same

1343
00:56:59,269 --> 00:57:05,420
questions before so my idea is that now

1344
00:57:03,139 --> 00:57:08,509
that we are I think we are in the era

1345
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:11,180
where data generation it's always going

1346
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:13,250
to outpace data analysis you can kind of

1347
00:57:11,179 --> 00:57:15,019
you can do this kind of global analysis

1348
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:16,579
but then when you try to dive into

1349
00:57:15,019 --> 00:57:19,159
specifics you have to go in with

1350
00:57:16,579 --> 00:57:21,349
hypotheses so you can say okay now I

1351
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:22,460
associate this metabolite with some kind

1352
00:57:21,349 --> 00:57:24,500
of biological phenotype that I'm

1353
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:26,269
interested in then I can go in to say

1354
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:28,889
you know what are the genes what are my

1355
00:57:26,269 --> 00:57:30,840
G wats result and what I found what

1356
00:57:28,889 --> 00:57:32,759
what I believe will be valuable from

1357
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:35,150
this analysis is not necessarily you

1358
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:37,920
know the final correspondence between

1359
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:40,289
structural related relatedness and a

1360
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,930
particular genome but genetic locus but

1361
00:57:40,289 --> 00:57:44,429
rather in the future if you have a

1362
00:57:42,929 --> 00:57:46,199
candidate compound that you're

1363
00:57:44,429 --> 00:57:48,269
interested in and then you can go to

1364
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:50,489
this data set the gos result is right

1365
00:57:48,269 --> 00:57:52,380
there and you can just go and say what

1366
00:57:50,489 --> 00:57:55,469
is my candidate gene and basically you

1367
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:57,630
reduce entire PhD ceases to experiment

1368
00:57:55,469 --> 00:58:02,159
right with the with the you know

1369
00:57:57,630 --> 00:58:03,930
maturation of of CRISPR and other genome

1370
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:06,449
editing technology you can say okay I

1371
00:58:03,929 --> 00:58:08,969
hear I have a very clear Candida gene if

1372
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:10,079
I've altered that does that do I have a

1373
00:58:08,969 --> 00:58:12,000
chemical phenotype do I have a

1374
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:14,069
biological phenotype and I think that's

1375
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:33,119
the way this resource can be used in the

1376
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:37,080
future I haven't thought about that too

1377
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:39,239
much so we know that from from us oh so

1378
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:41,250
you can transform this fungus with GFP

1379
00:58:39,239 --> 00:58:43,229
and then do fungus tracking we know that

1380
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:44,940
initially grows intracellularly

1381
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:46,980
and then that and then during the

1382
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:48,840
intercellular face it produced mycotoxin

1383
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:51,420
and kills the plant cell and then move

1384
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:56,579
into a more intracellular necro trophic

1385
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:58,650
phase so for or so first for all the

1386
00:58:56,579 --> 00:59:00,239
metabolomic QTL analysis we did a

1387
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:02,369
constitutively there's no fungus

1388
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:04,199
induction whatsoever and for all the

1389
00:59:02,369 --> 00:59:06,839
earlier induction experiment that I did

1390
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:09,059
there are six days post inoculation so

1391
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:13,019
there barely start transitioning into

1392
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:15,420
the intracellular face so I'm not

1393
00:59:13,019 --> 00:59:17,880
exactly sure you know how much Pollak

1394
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:19,889
Lee the plant will switch between fast

1395
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:21,990
as the fungus switch from an

1396
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:24,150
intercellular to an intro intracellular

1397
00:59:21,989 --> 00:59:26,129
life stop but I think there's been a lot

1398
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:29,220
of transcriptomics analysis done on that

1399
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:35,610
front so that's probably a good way to

1400
00:59:29,219 --> 00:59:36,959
look at it okay so my advisor is just

1401
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:38,579
reminding me I also have an

1402
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:43,019
acknowledgement to do and he also want

1403
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:46,670
to have lunch so let's do that so so one

1404
00:59:43,019 --> 00:59:49,170
thing that I'm not sure I have the

1405
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:51,930
luxury to do anymore now that I'm doing

1406
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:54,450
it on a Friday time slot is that you

1407
00:59:51,929 --> 00:59:57,079
have a very very long acknowledgement to

1408
00:59:54,449 --> 00:59:59,579
to recognize everybody in my family and

1409
00:59:57,079 --> 01:00:01,739
apparently you know I wouldn't be the

1410
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:04,980
person I am without all their help and

1411
01:00:01,739 --> 01:00:06,359
their company but so I try to restrict

1412
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:08,340
my acknowledgement to all the people

1413
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:10,019
I've met here in Cornell so I want to

1414
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:11,910
recognize all my collaborators here

1415
01:00:10,019 --> 01:00:14,699
without whose work none of this would be

1416
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:16,559
possible so throughout the talk I hope

1417
01:00:14,699 --> 01:00:18,210
you recognize that this is a really

1418
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:19,949
diverse project we use many many

1419
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:22,409
different approaches and I'm no

1420
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:24,960
expertise in any of those so the only

1421
01:00:22,409 --> 01:00:26,670
expertise I have is to find the right

1422
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,670
person and do the right experiment for

1423
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:32,070
me okay so I really want to thank

1424
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:34,920
everybody here that helped me throughout

1425
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:36,960
the entire project so I

1426
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:39,710
over-over my time here I'm also being

1427
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:41,909
extensively working with students both

1428
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:44,309
undergraduate and summer interns they

1429
01:00:41,909 --> 01:00:45,719
make my life so much more fun and my

1430
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:47,730
wife and I can go to cruise tour when

1431
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:50,369
they take pictures of fruit so that's

1432
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:52,260
pretty good and also I want to recognize

1433
01:00:50,369 --> 01:00:54,929
all my lab mates throughout this times

1434
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:56,700
it's been obviously being evolving over

1435
01:00:54,929 --> 01:00:59,699
time and I really want to thank them for

1436
01:00:56,699 --> 01:01:01,199
all the inspiration all the ideas I got

1437
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:05,609
from them as well as there are patients

1438
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:07,230
to listen to all my brain dump also I

1439
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:09,210
want to recognize my committee members

1440
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:11,309
Rebecca Nelson and Gary Bergstrom who

1441
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:14,039
both have been really inspirational very

1442
01:01:11,309 --> 01:01:16,469
supportive and very resourceful and I

1443
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:18,599
think again this project wouldn't have

1444
01:01:16,469 --> 01:01:22,250
been done without any of their help and

1445
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:25,860
of course finally I want to recognize

1446
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:29,369
the advisor okay and in the gender lab

1447
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:31,079
is kind of a tradition that at the edge

1448
01:01:29,369 --> 01:01:33,569
or access seminar you want to give kind

1449
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:36,090
of a famous philosophical quote directly

1450
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:39,210
actual quote from George so in the past

1451
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:41,519
his bicycling habit has been the subject

1452
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:44,130
of discussion so here I want to you I

1453
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:45,869
want to take this quote right here okay

1454
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:48,780
so this happened when

1455
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:51,329
visiting an alpaca farm in in true

1456
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:53,970
Leesburg and they also have pigs here so

1457
01:01:51,329 --> 01:01:57,960
that's what George said to me so I so

1458
01:01:53,969 --> 01:01:59,759
the context I think it's pigs and George

1459
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:02,369
said it's a great they treat you equally

1460
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,140
as one of themselves and I think that's

1461
01:02:02,369 --> 01:02:06,000
also the same kind of philosophy that

1462
01:02:04,139 --> 01:02:07,889
George has been using to treat his

1463
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,369
graduate students that he treats his

1464
01:02:07,889 --> 01:02:13,529
graduates equally asked one of himself

1465
01:02:10,369 --> 01:02:14,909
so but I do realize I need to give a

1466
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:17,190
little bit more context next time I

1467
01:02:14,909 --> 01:02:18,960
present in conference and say that or to

1468
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:24,539
present a Georgia treat his grad

1469
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:26,070
students like pigs come alright and last

1470
01:02:24,539 --> 01:02:28,110
but not least I want to recognize

1471
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:31,140
everybody here who take the time to come

1472
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:33,180
I really want to say you know the my

1473
01:02:31,139 --> 01:02:37,349
time here in Cornell would not be the

1474
01:02:33,179 --> 01:02:39,750
same without any of you so you mean we

1475
01:02:37,349 --> 01:02:41,639
may not be collaborated directly on my

1476
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:43,559
thesis project I probably met you in the

1477
01:02:41,639 --> 01:02:45,809
class we probably work together as

1478
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:47,730
teaching staff and we probably were

1479
01:02:45,809 --> 01:02:50,190
students together in the class and all

1480
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:52,980
those interactions really gave me idea

1481
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:56,159
and I really own a big time to all of

1482
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:59,099
you guys and really from this project I

1483
01:02:56,159 --> 01:03:01,619
think one of the message I got is at

1484
01:02:59,099 --> 01:03:03,809
this time where the merit of diversity

1485
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:05,759
has often been questioned and sometimes

1486
01:03:03,809 --> 01:03:08,279
been attacked I can reflect on my own

1487
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,950
experience in Cornell and stay convinced

1488
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:13,380
that if life itself is an emergent

1489
01:03:10,949 --> 01:03:15,960
property then our society and our

1490
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:27,300
science should also be greater than some

1491
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:29,730
of its parts thank you this has been a

1492
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:34,550
production of Cornell University on the

1493
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:34,550
