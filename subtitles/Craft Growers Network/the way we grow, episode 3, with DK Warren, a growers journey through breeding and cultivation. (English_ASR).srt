started the show um I've been a little

24
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,759
bit sick so kind of drank some meds and

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,320
trying to power through this but uh yeah

26
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,759
getting over the holiday hump and kind

27
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:26,599
of just trying to get back to things and

28
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,478
plan my next rounds and hunts and and

29
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:31,438
what's to come so what do you got going

30
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:33,280
right now

31
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:38,279
oh right now

32
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,920
so I have a few things so I ever just

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,000
about every run I have like three things

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,200
going I have like just plants I know are

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
good and I'm running

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,960
for personal smoke and to gift to people

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,359
and whatnot just that I keep rerunning

38
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:59,078
and kind of my Staples um so I have a

39
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:01,879
few of those going off the shelf um my

40
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:04,000
Kepler 22 be which is about to be

41
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:06,199
renamed unfortunately because somebody

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,479
else used that name and it's gotten its

43
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,878
way into uh the commercial space here in

44
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,160
Denver and people don't want to reuse it

45
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:16,799
so it's going to be called AST fruit

46
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,318
it's like the most bizarre smelling

47
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,680
fruity bubble gummy medicine smelling

48
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:25,000
plant ever um I've kept it pretty close

49
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,519
for a few years now and uh I think I'm

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,400
going to start letting people have that

51
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,480
pheno so I've already given it to a few

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,800
commercial grows as I mentioned but

53
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,119
yeah every time I run it it's like

54
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,760
shocking um super strong and keeps its

55
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,400
tpin really well in the jar like really

56
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:42,719
really powerful smells is that something

57
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:47,599
that you hunted yeah so I took uh

58
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:49,598
everything I make I hunt um very seldom

59
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:53,318
do I use any clones to do any of my

60
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:55,639
breeding um so I started with a great

61
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:58,439
pupil from Mass medical strains great

62
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:00,439
people V V2 that I hunted um really cool

63
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:02,759
Plant good effect

64
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:05,560
um didn't really have a great taste

65
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:06,959
though um so I didn't I kept the mother

66
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,158
around for a bit to do some breeding

67
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,920
because it had some really special

68
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:13,519
qualities but didn't really check every

69
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:15,000
box um I'm sure in his seeds there's

70
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,400
other ones that taste delicious this

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,560
particular one I had just didn't but um

72
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:25,439
so I bred that to capulator uh Miracle

73
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:30,158
Grow which is like he took I think it's

74
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:33,479
like 2third of what makes up Mac um the

75
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:35,039
miracle and I can't remember all of it

76
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:38,318
right now but and he crossed that to

77
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:41,000
like an OG I think and so it's like a

78
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:44,359
preac kind of of the same Mac stuff but

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,840
without the cookies and uh cross that to

80
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,760
that to that uh great people V2 and it

81
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,799
came out with this like really

82
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:53,759
interesting funky expressions of like

83
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,879
bubble gums and really cool flavors and

84
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,840
fox natural Fox tailing and stuff that's

85
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,039
one of my coolest cuts that I'm like

86
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,959
finally going to let people get their

87
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:04,000
hands on I didn't that was back when I

88
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:07,158
was doing like branch pollinations and

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,680
like much smaller um seed runs so like

90
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:13,280
all of those are sold out and I have

91
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,239
like maybe 30 in a personal stash but

92
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,079
there's no way to buy those anymore um

93
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,358
but like I said they cutan out there um

94
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,439
so I have that going and then a sister

95
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:25,918
kind or like a a cousin to that plant is

96
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,439
my um Black Canyon Kush that I always

97
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,560
just about every run I run one of those

98
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:33,519
because I like to smoke it um used that

99
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:39,759
same great people V2 mom and pollinated

100
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:41,839
it with uh higher vibe from uh ke play

101
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,879
or I think he calls it SE business keys

102
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,638
to the kingdom

103
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:48,000
um I used to test stuff for him and

104
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,360
whenever I would find something cool I

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,879
would breed with it um another really

106
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:59,840
cool Plant crazy flavors like Berry

107
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:02,560
cushy nose and like fun playful effects

108
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:05,119
um so that's always a staple in my

109
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,918
runs what else do I have that's like

110
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,519
rerun my critical Neal Haze I always run

111
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,959
really hazy but like grows like a bush

112
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:14,399
so you can grow it indoors and only

113
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:16,038
takes like 70 days so I keep trying to

114
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,879
find hazes I keep running all these

115
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:21,079
hazes and they're like nightmare indoor

116
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,680
plants you know you have to like trigger

117
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:24,639
them before everything else and they

118
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,319
outgrow everything and they don't fit

119
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,759
into your water schedules and they don't

120
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,479
fit into your tent Heights and it's like

121
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:32,400
this you know I want grow the classics

122
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,439
and I want to grow hazes and sativas and

123
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,679
stuff and I keep trying but it's like so

124
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:38,800
challenging indoors so when I found that

125
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:43,600
critical Neville Haze it has like the

126
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,800
classic spicy metallic smell in the grow

127
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,280
and then it CS into like an

128
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,879
incy hazy kind of nose and it's really

129
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,198
good and the high is super high flying

130
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:56,240
um so so I always kind of run some of

131
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:59,240
that um do you want me to go through all

132
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,160
of them I have like a ton ofan I was uh

133
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,439
you know just kind of like interested in

134
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,120
what's going on in your world but it

135
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:06,519
sounds like you got a lot you know in

136
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,519
terms of how much you have like going on

137
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:12,000
at any one given time um yeah so like

138
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:14,959
you know one of the first questions that

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,240
I do like to ask is what got you into

140
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:20,879
growing were you introduced into growing

141
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,400
uh um like vegetables or other plants as

142
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,079
a young kid by a relative or like what

143
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:27,239
was what were some of the first plants

144
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:30,318
that you ever grew uh whether it be

145
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,360
cannabis or not good good call so the

146
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,800
first ones I ever grew was every year I

147
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,319
used to grow like giant sunflowers uh

148
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,759
next to my house with my mom she would

149
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,720
have her little garden going with like

150
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,879
tomatoes and cucumbers and all that

151
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,639
stuff and for some reason I became like

152
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,959
the c or the uh sunflower guy and I

153
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,319
would grow these like 12T sunflowers I

154
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,079
was always really proud of how big they

155
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,960
would get that was when I was like

156
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:56,079
really young um but then in high school

157
00:06:53,959 --> 00:07:00,159
my town that I grew up in is like is

158
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:03,800
known for um plant nurseries and like

159
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,439
basically if there's not a house or a

160
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:10,439
development the land in my hometown is

161
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:12,759
used for um Nursery growth um primarily

162
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:17,839
like ornamental Landscaping type plants

163
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:19,360
not like um not like uh for food really

164
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,119
there it's not like apple apple orchards

165
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,120
and there are apple orchards and grapes

166
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,800
and strawberries and stuff like that but

167
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,598
and Vineyards but um the the main all

168
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,000
the hoop houses and like the main like

169
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:31,719
many many hundreds of of acre

170
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,199
cultivation is for

171
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:38,160
like uh like red dendrum and arbite and

172
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,800
various uh like the stuff you would buy

173
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,479
at Home Depot or like a a plant outlet

174
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,199
for your yard um so every summer me and

175
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:49,918
all my friends would work at these plant

176
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:53,478
nurseries and we would work in the

177
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:55,079
um in the Clone barns or the propagation

178
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:57,240
barns we would basically in the mornings

179
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:58,839
we would go out to the mother fields and

180
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,680
take thousands and thousands of cuting

181
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:04,679
off the mother PL it was primarily tree

182
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,319
hydrangeas so a lot of the work that I

183
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,598
did was with cloning hydrangeas um so we

184
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,039
would take the cuting and go back to the

185
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:13,918
barn and

186
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:18,478
spend 10 hours just making clones and

187
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:21,198
then filling you know 50 F 50 I think it

188
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,839
was 50 slot Flats just like one after

189
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,240
the next we had a conveyor belt with the

190
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:27,079
soil that filled the flats and we'd sit

191
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,158
there and dip the Clones in a rooting

192
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:31,120
hormone and just plug them plug them

193
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:32,718
plug them fill a trailer with them

194
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,519
trailer them out to the to the hoop

195
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,000
houses and then put them in the hoop

196
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:40,440
houses so that was like many medium were

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,679
you using to to clone

198
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,640
with that was just it must have just

199
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:49,919
been a potting soil I mean I know from

200
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:52,240
it it was like huge huge um plastic

201
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:55,079
wrapped bales of it that come in on like

202
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,879
palletized delivery you know um so

203
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,920
somebody would take like a forklift slit

204
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:02,519
the slit the plastic hold P it over the

205
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:04,559
hopper and just like dump a giant pallet

206
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:07,959
of it it must have just been some kind

207
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:10,479
of potting mix with perlite um I truly

208
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:12,799
don't know I was like a you know a

209
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,879
15-year-old kid at the time or whatever

210
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:19,439
but um it was definitely soil a soil

211
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,399
medium um I think it was just I think

212
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,440
they just used the same cloning medium

213
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:26,120
that they used to up poot and I I I

214
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,160
don't think there was any like

215
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,440
differentiation between like the start

216
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:34,278
or the you know the next sizes as they

217
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,240
went so that was like years of doing

218
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:38,240
that and then some of the years I I got

219
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,000
into like

220
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,159
um potted Farms so we we had Farms that

221
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,958
like would grow directly in the soil

222
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,639
Farms that would grow hoop houses and

223
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:51,119
then Farms that would grow in containers

224
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:54,278
um and a lot of the work when in

225
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:58,000
containers is like adding granular

226
00:09:54,278 --> 00:10:00,320
fertilizers and spacing plants and um

227
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,519
just like in general maintenance and and

228
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,320
and and growing these plants getting

229
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:08,360
them ready for delivery and whatnot so

230
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,200
driving around on a tractor all day and

231
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,120
just like bending over and moving plants

232
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,440
around most of the time so yeah a lot of

233
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,799
that a lot of it was tree Hy ranges but

234
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:20,200
um many other plants so that was kind of

235
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:22,078
like where my interest in cultivation

236
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,720
and propagation began and where I

237
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:27,278
started to like learn about this stuff

238
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,600
and see how it could be done it's also

239
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,919
basically where I got introduced to C in

240
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,879
cannabis too cuz we would find cannabis

241
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:38,199
plants growing in the Farms a lot of the

242
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:39,879
workers the non High School workers um

243
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,360
you know they would plant they would

244
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:42,559
stash a plant somewhere here or there

245
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,360
and we would have we would occasionally

246
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,879
stumble across it and I'd stick it in my

247
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,759
car and drive it home and hide it in the

248
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:52,720
woods behind my parents house and hope

249
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:54,439
for the best so a lot of dig it up uh

250
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,360
potted we would find potted ones

251
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,360
actually just like yeah just like

252
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,039
stashed in a bunch of like oh so like

253
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,919
for sure not even just like a dropped

254
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:04,159
seat or something and it was like for

255
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,799
sure on purpose like cuz it wouldn't be

256
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:07,679
on the perimeter it'd be like in the

257
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:09,559
interior kind of like stashed away and

258
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,159
we'd stumble across it and I would be

259
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:13,638
like all right I'm going to leave for

260
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:16,319
lunch break today and run run it back to

261
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,959
my house and hope for the best it was

262
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,879
nothing you know it was

263
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:24,719
probably uh Mexican bag seed type stuff

264
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:27,399
and just you know plant what you got and

265
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,519
hope for the best around what year was

266
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:32,240
this this was

267
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:36,639
probably

268
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,399
01 okay uh maybe yeah that was kind of

269
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,799
my tinkering days was high school you

270
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,879
know nothing like of substance there

271
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:46,759
would be maybe like one mature Cola on

272
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:48,120
these plants that you could mess with or

273
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:49,759
you know I had some plants that were

274
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,639
like looking really good and one one day

275
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,759
I came home from work and they were

276
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:55,278
uprooted and laying on my back porch my

277
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,559
dad had stumbled across him while he was

278
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:59,759
doing some y yard work or something and

279
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:01,799
just like grabbed it by the stem and

280
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,679
yanked it up and laid it on the back

281
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:06,559
porch so I definitely had some trials

282
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:09,278
and tribulations with those early ones

283
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,958
but that was all just like very low

284
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:15,399
effort you know going and trying to

285
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:18,039
water things hoping you'd get uh joint

286
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:20,879
to smoke type of stuff um it wasn't

287
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:23,559
until college that I like got a hold of

288
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:26,919
some good genetics and like proper grow

289
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:30,599
equipment and grew some you know some

290
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:32,719
some good fire that was uh yeah I can

291
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,720
tell that that story yeah my first

292
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,480
indoor experience I can kind of explain

293
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,480
that so I had some friends in college

294
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,120
that were growing and had been growing

295
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,399
for a few years and somehow had got a

296
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,159
hold of good you know California and

297
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:48,879
Canadian genetics and and uh you know

298
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:51,399
train wack was being grown and um

299
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:54,198
blueberry and that type of thing and

300
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:58,039
then one of my one of my friends that

301
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:59,879
was growing uh was a web developer and

302
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:03,000
he developed

303
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:04,519
a a website I wish I knew the details of

304
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,519
this like who this was but he developed

305
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:14,399
a website for a Canadian seed maker um

306
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:17,720
this is in 2004 maybe 2005

307
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:21,159
and the in exchange for developing it

308
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:24,440
the guy sent him a ton of seeds and so

309
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:26,679
one of the strains was called Thor's

310
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,800
hammer which I know there's like more

311
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:32,120
than one of those today so I don't think

312
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:33,919
it's tied to any of the modern ones but

313
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,480
um so one of the scens was Thor's hammer

314
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,919
that I grew first indoor and the other

315
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,759
one was called monkey snooze which is

316
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:44,479
bizarre name but um basically the guy

317
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,519
was going through some problems with his

318
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,680
he was going through a divorce

319
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,560
essentially and they had they had a kid

320
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:53,638
and he was afraid that the wife was

321
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:56,000
going to like use that grow against him

322
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,839
in court you know like oh like whatever

323
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,320
I don't know the details but he was just

324
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,600
nervous about it so he called me and

325
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,720
he's like hey I've got these plants that

326
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,680
are like ready to flip to flower can you

327
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,320
come pick them up so I threw them in my

328
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:13,198
car and took them home took his 400 watt

329
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:15,920
HPS home um and they kind of escorted me

330
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,078
to the hydro store to buy some buy some

331
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:20,278
nutrients maybe this is where I can get

332
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:21,319
into like how I grow um so we we go to

333
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:24,879
the hydro store and they were like

334
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:27,199
showing me all the fox farm stuff and

335
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:29,639
you know bottle nutrients and

336
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:31,240
uh the guy at the store was like Hey

337
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:33,079
this stuff you know this stuff is like

338
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,240
the new thing this is like yeah you guys

339
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:36,439
should give this a shot if you're

340
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,360
interested and it was uh General

341
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:43,040
Hydroponics uh Flor Nova it's a one part

342
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:47,079
for vag and one part for flower and it's

343
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:48,958
like it's like mostly partially organic

344
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:52,120
I think it's like Sanic people call it

345
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:53,799
now but it's um very thick like black

346
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:58,799
tar it's kind of like not tar it's like

347
00:14:53,799 --> 00:15:00,519
mud kind of um so tried it and loved it

348
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,159
and this this is 20 something years ago

349
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:06,078
and I've literally been using the same

350
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:08,039
stuff for 20 something years the florova

351
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:10,758
it's called floron NOA grow and florova

352
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:13,439
Bloom um you can add all kinds of other

353
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:15,000
stuff with it you know you can mix in

354
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,880
your

355
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,480
floralicious plus and your whatever but

356
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:22,278
it's really all you need to be honest

357
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,560
with you you can go from seed to harvest

358
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:26,278
with that stuff it's crazy um but anyway

359
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,239
so you went to the hydro store though

360
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:32,078
got the got these new nutrients to go

361
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,000
set up your first grow yep yep I get I

362
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:35,719
get

363
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,318
home section off a piece of my closet

364
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:41,839
with a blanket I think you know like uh

365
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:45,278
400 watt super hot HPS in like a tiny

366
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,639
closet with no proper exhaust um two

367
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,799
plants tripped them into flower and then

368
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:52,480
just like proceeded to go like way way

369
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:55,879
way down the rabbit hole of learning um

370
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,600
got on grass City forums and just

371
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:00,958
started posting and reading and like

372
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,360
just went way way deep on everything you

373
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:06,078
could do I think at one point I was like

374
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,879
spraying seltzer water on the plants

375
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,879
because I read that that was like you

376
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:12,159
know good for stuff I just started

377
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:15,198
messing with everything but um those

378
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:17,679
first two plants came out like

379
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:20,758
phenomenal like the kids that I got them

380
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,838
from were like shocked they were like

381
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:23,519
holy [ __ ] you know like I was

382
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,680
immediately I didn't go through this

383
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,879
like big uh I stink at growing phase I

384
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:33,039
guess I just kind of like got

385
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:35,720
good premium flour like the first time I

386
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:38,318
harvested and then from there every run

387
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:41,199
I did like I my my next setup was a

388
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:43,799
little bit larger than that but

389
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:46,719
um I just how many how many rounds did

390
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:48,599
you run that first setup uh I think only

391
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,199
one because we ended up moving out of

392
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,000
that house and I ended up moving out of

393
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:54,639
that town and had to give that guy his

394
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,559
equipment back and then went and got

395
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,680
with some other folks with with more

396
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:02,919
space basically built like a

397
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:06,558
closet or a attic type of grow room for

398
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:08,720
my next grow um behind a false wall

399
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:11,160
basically like that was still you know

400
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,880
20 something years ago or 20 years ago

401
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:18,360
uh so yeah I got a hold of larger grow

402
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,760
lights you know set up a separate um veg

403
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:25,918
space flower space and dry curing drying

404
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:27,318
and curing space and uh then was faced

405
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,919
with like okay I got to track down some

406
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:34,319
genetics right so back in those days you

407
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,600
would like print out an order form from

408
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:39,918
a

409
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:42,439
UK uh seed bank handr write your order

410
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:46,400
hand total and send cash in an envelope

411
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:49,519
and then you know hope hope so like four

412
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,798
weeks later you know some weird envelope

413
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,720
arrives with some seeds in it actually

414
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:56,558
before that I got some through a friend

415
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:59,440
so there's this like outside of uh

416
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:01,639
Athens Ohio like OU is like mix County

417
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,320
and that's where like some famous Ohio

418
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,360
stuff is from I mean famous to me cuz

419
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:08,399
I'm from Ohio might not be famous to a

420
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:11,000
lot of listeners but like Ohio dumpster

421
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,798
and death star and lemon G and all of

422
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,720
that stuff is from like the Columbus or

423
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:19,119
miigs County kind of Athens area in Ohio

424
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,400
and uh I knew somebody tied into there

425
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:24,798
and they got me some New York City

426
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,600
Diesel seeds uh from Megs County Growers

427
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:31,200
and I grew those and it was like

428
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:32,918
incredible but didn't yield like at all

429
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,720
um but it was it was super good so like

430
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:36,120
right away I was like ah this isn't

431
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,038
really what I'm looking for at this

432
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:42,079
point you know I was trying to like put

433
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:44,960
out some you know put out some more and

434
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,960
uh that's when I went to the to Dr

435
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,600
chronic I think it is he's still around

436
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,840
today that store is still around today

437
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:55,038
the online shop and I

438
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:58,959
ordered big bang

439
00:18:55,038 --> 00:19:01,679
and uh Morning Glory from big bang is

440
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,120
greenhouse seeds and morning glory is

441
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,240
Barney's Farm they don't sell it anymore

442
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:08,319
but at the time it was like 3 years four

443
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,480
years after Morning Glory had won the

444
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:12,759
Cannabis Cup so I was like okay this you

445
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,159
know this is a good place to start I

446
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:15,759
that's how I used to do my ordering I'd

447
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:18,960
look at like the Cannabis Cup winners

448
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:21,400
from like three to eight years prior the

449
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,840
idea being like okay they won with this

450
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:28,600
they've had however many cycles to like

451
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:31,839
you know inbreed or BX this or or you

452
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:33,639
know you know F2 F3 F4 so to stabilize

453
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:36,599
these genetics so the idea was like okay

454
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,280
if they won 5 years ago with it then

455
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:44,240
there's a good chance that uh that this

456
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:47,879
is a stronger or um more stable batch so

457
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,240
I ended up not liking the Big Bang um

458
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,360
act that hunted a bunch of the morning

459
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,279
glory and found like an absolute killer

460
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:57,240
and that became kind of like you know

461
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:00,399
cycle after cycle like continuous

462
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:03,599
Harvest like many many many plants of uh

463
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,240
morning glory for many years so so I

464
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,279
mean it sounds like you were just like

465
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,798
right onto the Hunts of like looking for

466
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:11,720
something that was that was like some

467
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:13,879
some awesome [ __ ] smoke and and

468
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,640
something that you could you know uh

469
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:19,200
move uh if you will and so like like it

470
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,600
it it sounds like you were like pretty

471
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,319
on point early on and you said like you

472
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:26,399
you went right from the little closet

473
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:28,319
setup where it was kind of like hey my

474
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,559
buddy needs me to do this so on a whim

475
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:33,480
I'm going to just you know jump at it

476
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:38,720
and then to I'm going to go set up a

477
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:40,120
whole uh you know attic grow and uh like

478
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,919
what was guiding you where were you

479
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:43,639
getting the information to set this up

480
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:47,360
and like what were you what were you

481
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:51,559
using to sort of uh get you to like that

482
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:54,038
level of success early on yeah I mean I

483
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:57,000
don't I guess just like obviously I knew

484
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:58,240
propagation from growing up right like I

485
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,759
I learned propagation I'm like a

486
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,640
professional level and I learned large

487
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:05,640
farming or scale farming like the way

488
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,559
it's

489
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:11,240
done you know outside of this new

490
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,759
industry um the way it should be done I

491
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,798
guess the way people people have been

492
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:16,480
doing it for a very long time so I kind

493
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:19,119
of had that understanding of like how

494
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,400
things scale and how to like time things

495
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:24,000
um but you know I gave you the the the

496
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,159
the shortened version of all of this

497
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,599
right like there was

498
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:30,880
many there was many times where things

499
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:33,719
didn't work or um I had to try things

500
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,360
and then you know started okay

501
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,759
everything I read says I've got to have

502
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:40,678
moms right like so got this space with

503
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:42,839
these big moms that are getting bark on

504
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,759
them because they've been around for 18

505
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:47,639
months and you know they're just getting

506
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:50,960
all old and gnarly and I realized like I

507
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,960
did a bunch of research into you know

508
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,919
genetic drift and cloning cloning

509
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,038
cloning over and over again and really

510
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,600
came to

511
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:02,038
the at least for me in like a matter of

512
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:03,839
a couple years you're talking like

513
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:08,278
cloning things over and over again maybe

514
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:10,959
20 times like I never saw any drift

515
00:22:08,278 --> 00:22:13,278
whatsoever I I don't not even the

516
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,200
slightest like at all I know it like

517
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:17,000
environmental impacts and stuff can make

518
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,720
things fade or whatever like I I don't

519
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,599
know so I eventually got rid of mothers

520
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,798
and just started you know cloning off of

521
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,759
my next round before it went into flip

522
00:22:23,798 --> 00:22:28,038
and using those cuting like lower

523
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:30,319
branches it's almost it almost comes

524
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:32,359
across as like a a healthier version of

525
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:34,720
the plant over and over again whereas

526
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:38,158
like you can get this buildup of viral

527
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,798
stress or other you know um abiotic

528
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,760
stressors uh where the plant if you

529
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,599
keeping it around for 18 months like who

530
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:47,558
knows what sort of stuff is building up

531
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:49,599
in the tissue there totally and with

532
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:50,798
those with those plants you're vegging

533
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:54,319
out to go

534
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:57,200
flip that's all like brand new you know

535
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:59,558
so vigorous such vigorous like like

536
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,240
awesome green bright green vigorous

537
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:04,319
growth that like it would all clone

538
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,000
super quickly I actually used to clone

539
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:11,399
back then directly in Coco like and had

540
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,440
no issues whatsoever um I now I use

541
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,679
plugs and all that stuff but back back

542
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,600
then it was just like dipping in some

543
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:22,120
gel put it into cocoa and it worked um

544
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:23,599
but yeah so I mean I yeah I I gave you

545
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:25,239
the fast version I definitely went

546
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:29,319
through a ton of like trial and error

547
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:31,839
and like um just like I said like way

548
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:34,038
down the rabbit hole on um grass City

549
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:37,678
forums and just like learning and I

550
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:39,240
didn't really have people to talk to

551
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,320
back then you know you didn't really

552
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,599
talk a lot you know I I see a lot of

553
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:45,759
these podcasts and most people say the

554
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:47,879
same thing as like you had you had your

555
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:50,119
grow Bible books and maybe if you got a

556
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,600
hold of some weird VHS that somebody put

557
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:58,278
out way back in the day some copy of a

558
00:23:52,599 --> 00:24:00,798
copy um there was some stuff online but

559
00:23:58,278 --> 00:24:02,759
yeah I mean it was all forums back then

560
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:05,759
really it wasn't nearly as in the open

561
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:07,400
and posting pictures was even something

562
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:10,480
you didn't really want to do like I have

563
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,278
almost no pictures from this time back

564
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,960
then I think I have

565
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:15,720
one

566
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,319
um

567
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:21,960
yeah I mean that makes a lot of sense

568
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:24,158
cuz you know 20 plus years ago the the

569
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,440
level of illegality was almost at at a

570
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:29,240
pinnacle where like people were going

571
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:32,360
away for unheard of amounts of time

572
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:35,720
and um just being cracked down on so

573
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:38,278
heavily uh yeah I mean I I totally

574
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,038
understand wanted to just you know stick

575
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:42,200
to stick to what was working right

576
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:44,599
rather than having to risk branching out

577
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,120
and looking for someone who could teach

578
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:48,319
you even just differently not

579
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:50,639
necessarily better or anything like that

580
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:53,599
just different yeah there

581
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,720
was even with genetics like I said once

582
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:58,558
I found kind of the cut that checked

583
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,759
everything I was looking for it wasn't

584
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,639
oh let's play with a bunch of stuff like

585
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:05,158
I occasionally threw stuff in I'd get a

586
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,120
bag seat of like I got a bag seat of

587
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,799
some Mendo perss and grew that and I had

588
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:12,359
some crazy purple candy stuff for a

589
00:25:09,798 --> 00:25:15,119
while but it wasn't as vigorous and it

590
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:16,959
was kind of like a novelty and I would I

591
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:19,000
would occasionally test stuff but I had

592
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,840
to have my like staple that was like

593
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,440
okay I knew that like you know the bulk

594
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:26,599
of it is going through this one this one

595
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,240
strain and everything I did back then

596
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:30,519
was standardized like who it went to you

597
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,079
know like that there was really only

598
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:36,319
like one person I was talking to and it

599
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:37,558
all left there and went to one person

600
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:40,439
and then I didn't care what happened

601
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:43,879
after that but like sure you know it it

602
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:46,120
it was very uh it tried to simplify it

603
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:50,200
and and and you know make it as like

604
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:52,278
rinse and repeat as possible um yeah had

605
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,278
some issues definitely had some issues I

606
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:58,398
had a few scares for sure where I had to

607
00:25:54,278 --> 00:26:00,440
like tear the whole thing apart and uh

608
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:02,199
ended up doing some you know some wild

609
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,200
stuff to try and save harvests and stuff

610
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,120
like that but you know these these you

611
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,319
hear these classic stories I think one

612
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:11,719
of my Harvest ended up in a uh in a

613
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:13,398
hunting blind drying actually cuz it was

614
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,200
like we got to get we got to get we got

615
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:16,519
to clean this all out of here and get it

616
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,000
somewhere it's like where the hell do we

617
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:19,918
take this and it's like oh I know this

618
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,278
spot back in the woods like a tree fort

619
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:25,159
basically and I think that's called

620
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:26,839
Stoner Ingenuity yeah yeah it's just

621
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:28,320
like this this something needs to happen

622
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:31,119
here I don't know what but we need to

623
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,720
figure out something to do with this so

624
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:34,798
I mean if it was the right time of year

625
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,640
cold and dry and winter or something you

626
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:40,158
know that would be beautiful yeah I you

627
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:42,919
know it made it to harvest kind of it

628
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:47,200
was like 10 days 10 days early so even

629
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:49,559
though it was it dried okay um it it uh

630
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,038
it had that look to it you know you

631
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:55,918
could tell it wasn't fully mature but

632
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:59,079
yeah um yeah yeah yeah so uh yeah that

633
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:02,038
was your kind of early days yeah nice so

634
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:04,918
um I mean with with all the like seeming

635
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:07,278
success that you found early on and not

636
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:08,960
necessarily running into too many um

637
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:12,200
roadblocks that would prevent you from

638
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,319
wanting to continue uh growing what what

639
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,880
maybe were some of the the setbacks that

640
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:20,200
you might have faced um where you you

641
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,520
you know was it it was part of your

642
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,080
learning curve to to like make you a

643
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:27,960
better

644
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:28,879
grower oh yeah um all kinds of stuff man

645
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,278
like

646
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,640
uh we were you know I was running that

647
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:35,440
was like I said that was like I was

648
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,840
reading so much and so down the rabbit

649
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,840
hole that I was trying everything you

650
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:42,720
know like I had water filtration system

651
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:44,879
hooked up to Rodi and like all the water

652
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,919
had to go through this tiny little Rodi

653
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,120
thing that took like forever to filter

654
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:53,759
water so it was like you know having to

655
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,439
like plan ahead and like filter and fill

656
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,278
gallons and stuff like that like way

657
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,960
ahead of feedings to like try and get

658
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:02,159
water through that you know nowadays

659
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,679
it's like at least um in Colorado tap

660
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,519
water is fine like you can pH tap water

661
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:07,759
and

662
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,839
it's perfect like you I mean I don't

663
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:10,200
want to say perfect I'm sure there's a

664
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:12,079
better way to do it I'm sure some of

665
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,919
these cultivation facilities have

666
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:17,000
million dooll filtration that's better

667
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,240
than my tap water but you know back then

668
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,200
like that I thought that's what you had

669
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,640
to do and I like right online that's

670
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,519
what you had to do so like none of my

671
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,240
plants ever saw straight tap water it

672
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:28,319
was either filtered through a filtration

673
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,079
system or bought at the grocery store

674
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:31,599
you

675
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:34,119
know I didn't that was definitely like

676
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:36,798
early days trying to figure stuff out um

677
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:41,079
so I had that going I had I had a

678
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:43,839
nonsealed room with CO2 going you know

679
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:45,839
like I like like just sucking all of it

680
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:48,959
directly out of exhaust fans you know

681
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:51,199
like that type of thing like calculating

682
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:55,278
you know square footage and trying to

683
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:57,120
get to like 1,200 PPM of CO2 and do you

684
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:59,159
know swapping tanks out every couple of

685
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:01,199
weeks and doing it all perfect and not

686
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:03,080
realizing that I'm just like exhausting

687
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,440
all of this extra CO2 directly out of

688
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:09,639
the room um same thing with like I had

689
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,200
you know it was an air cooled or

690
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,440
whatever like an exhausted thousand watt

691
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:18,440
and that was going into a carbon

692
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:20,360
scrubber but I also had some like

693
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,120
bathroom type exhaust fans on the

694
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:24,479
ceiling just pulling air directly out of

695
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:26,879
there with no carbon filters so it's was

696
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,640
like it's like why does this whole block

697
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,440
smell so strong you we we have the

698
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,360
carbon filters going like what the

699
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,519
hell's going on here like this must just

700
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:38,199
be a rank strain and it's beating the

701
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:39,919
scrubbers and it's like no like looking

702
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,360
back on some of that stuff it's like

703
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,600
what the hell were we thinking um had a

704
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:46,439
sulfur burner going I don't actually see

705
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:48,798
much of that these days like I bet it's

706
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,120
used it most some of the uh larger

707
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:54,440
facilities but you pour like powdered

708
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:56,398
granular salt sulfur um it seemed to

709
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,399
work though I never had any issues in

710
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:01,678
that grow with like any molds or I mean

711
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:03,678
I guess like very rarely like a tiny bit

712
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,720
of Bud Rod or something but

713
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:12,440
like no real PM or molds or issues like

714
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:15,480
that um those early days I also had zero

715
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,679
pest issues I mean I think that was like

716
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,640
the you know not taking like now

717
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,120
everybody swaps stuff and like half the

718
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,720
times you get pest it's probably from

719
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:25,839
your hydro store or from your medium

720
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,720
that you're buying at your hydro store

721
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:29,678
or a clone that you bought from somebody

722
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,240
like if you just keep to yourself I

723
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,320
think that stuff kind of just stays away

724
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,480
um really had to deal with like none of

725
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:39,918
that I've heard Colorado doesn't uh have

726
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,519
like the worst pest pressure either just

727
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:45,480
uh due to there's not a lot of bugs that

728
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:49,440
can overwinter up there correct it's dry

729
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:52,200
it's dry and hot and Aid here and uh a a

730
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,759
lot of the times like the only thing I

731
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:58,360
was really dealing with here is fungus

732
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:59,960
gats um and those I learned were pretty

733
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:02,158
much just like coming from the medium

734
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,519
that I was buying so I switched mediums

735
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,559
and have no issues with that anymore

736
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:09,720
either so what what sort of substrate

737
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:12,720
are you using with the um what what's it

738
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:16,399
the floramax is that Flor florova

739
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:21,000
florova that's right yeah yeah um I just

740
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:24,119
used 7030 Coco perlite uh from a local

741
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,480
local manufacturer here um Grower's

742
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:27,678
Choice um oh nice they don't give it to

743
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,759
me for free though I shouldn't even be

744
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,679
plugged it they should now they should

745
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:34,558
give it to me for free or something but

746
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:37,399
no I was using like uh tuper before

747
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:38,879
Royal gold product and I'm almost

748
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:41,398
positive that's where my bugs were

749
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,200
coming from and I've heard a lot from

750
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:44,918
I've I don't want to put them on blast

751
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,919
or sound like I'm talking smack because

752
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:48,759
I like the product but a [ __ ] it they

753
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:51,480
can come on and defend themselves if

754
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:53,919
they want but yeah like I use that for

755
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,319
so long and I like it and it was great

756
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,399
but I was always dealing with fungus

757
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:57,398
Nets and then I would get rid of them

758
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:59,199
and they would come back and I was like

759
00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:00,719
what the hell's going on and I mentioned

760
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,360
it to the grow store guys and they were

761
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,079
like we've had dozens of people you know

762
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:09,119
switch away from that and got rid of

763
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:11,199
their bug problems so I did it and it

764
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:14,278
happened so I don't want to talk [ __ ]

765
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:17,600
but you know whatever seems like what

766
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:20,519
happened um yeah the rest of my stuff is

767
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:22,319
pretty like dude I'm like the I don't

768
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:25,798
have like Wizardry I have like the

769
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:27,918
lamest how I grow ever but it allows run

770
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:29,519
through your run through your like uh

771
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,639
just like run through your grow setup as

772
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:36,960
you run it currently yeah so I use

773
00:32:32,638 --> 00:32:39,879
clonex gel I use those plugs Riot root

774
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,319
Riot plugs um the only thing I've added

775
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:45,679
in the last year is probably the uh

776
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:47,839
clonex solution for like young plants um

777
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,440
and I will stand behind that stuff it

778
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:52,119
works fantastically cuz like those young

779
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,960
plants you're kind of like afraid to

780
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:55,719
give them anything potent right like

781
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,319
you're like ah they're they hit that

782
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,519
period where they're like all right they

783
00:32:57,319 --> 00:33:00,798
need something thing but they need

784
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:01,798
something mild um if I give them

785
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:03,119
something too much it's going to burn

786
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:05,158
them out or if I don't give them enough

787
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:07,638
they're going to start to consume

788
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:10,880
themselves in yellow out but that clonex

789
00:33:07,638 --> 00:33:12,599
solution is like perfect for that early

790
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,919
stage

791
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:19,079
um and then you know I repot from there

792
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:21,120
into it depends if I'm doing seeds or

793
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:22,519
clones if I'm doing clones I know right

794
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:25,000
away what I'm doing if I'm doing seeds

795
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:29,399
and might go into Solo cups so that I

796
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,720
can you know I I I I pop like three or

797
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:34,199
four times the seeds I intend to finish

798
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:36,038
and then I call plants like every single

799
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,319
step of the way like any mutations or

800
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:40,359
irregularities or slow growth or

801
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:43,480
anything like that they get killed do do

802
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:46,319
you pop them in root riots no I I paper

803
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,480
towel paper towel in like plastic food

804
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:50,638
containers um then like right into a

805
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,319
solo cup or something yep yep paper

806
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:56,199
towel until they have tails which like

807
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:59,798
you know Standard 24 72 hours and then

808
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:01,880
Solo cups and and then like I said I

809
00:33:59,798 --> 00:34:03,038
kind of just start calling I start

810
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,120
calling right away I start calling out

811
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:06,519
of the paper towels I'm like that one's

812
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:09,199
got a bigger tail than that one or that

813
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:11,039
one's fatter that one's scrawny like I

814
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,598
just right away I mean I guess I have

815
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:14,398
that luxury because I make seeds and I

816
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:17,639
have so many extra that I can I can do

817
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:19,960
that but um even when I buy and I'm

818
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:22,079
hunting other peoples I always pop way

819
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,720
more than I intend to finish and it

820
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,240
sounds silly and I'm sure some people

821
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:27,078
would say that's ridiculous cuz I could

822
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:28,358
be killing off a unicorn and not knowing

823
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:31,039
it but

824
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:33,679
I don't know I'll never know Vigor is so

825
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,679
huge though and so do do you pop all the

826
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,760
seeds in a pack do you save one seed

827
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,519
like some

828
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:42,000
people oh gez it depends it depends on

829
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:44,559
what my goal is for the plant

830
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,239
um if I'm like really hot on something

831
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:48,519
I'll buy more you know I'll buy like a

832
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,759
larger pack or or even if it's my own

833
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:53,119
that I'm testing that I'm like really

834
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,200
excited about I'll I'll pop more but um

835
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,960
if it's something that's like you know

836
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,399
known to be a pretty stable pack seeds

837
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,400
that somebody's been selling for like

838
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,559
years and kind of all the pictures

839
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,320
online look really similar and breeder

840
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:07,440
write ups grow reports all look really

841
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:10,400
similar you might only need like three

842
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:13,519
fem to get a really strong plant out of

843
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:17,519
that um I don't think that's the case

844
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:18,880
though with most so no I do have a lot

845
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:22,719
to answer your question more directly I

846
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,720
do have a lot of like one seed pants

847
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:25,519
sitting in my fridge that are like that

848
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:28,879
are

849
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:30,559
like yeah yeah I I po all but one I do I

850
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,200
do I don't know why and maybe other

851
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:34,119
maybe that's a thing we all do and don't

852
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:35,879
talk about it but like I I just talked

853
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:37,680
about it in an episode I I recorded

854
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,280
recently I was basic we were talking

855
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:40,960
about like you know the philosophy

856
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,880
behind it is like you're saving that one

857
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,480
seed cuz what if it is the unicorn and

858
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,079
then if if that's the philosophy though

859
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,719
then why not you should be popping you

860
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,119
should be popping it yeah that's

861
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:56,039
interesting I

862
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:57,200
mean I do that I I think I do that um I

863
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:58,759
was looking through a bunch the other

864
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:00,759
night and I saw that I was like I have

865
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,920
all these like Single Seeds laying here

866
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,839
and you when you get around to it and

867
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,039
you have to do those Single Seed runs

868
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:08,880
like it's it almost feels wrong unless

869
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:10,920
you're doing you know like a batch of

870
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,760
them you know like I actually funny

871
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:17,720
enough if you go way back on my

872
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:21,359
Instagram timeline I did a hunt that was

873
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:23,679
50 something strains or one each 50

874
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:26,199
something strains one each and just like

875
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:28,799
just like who will survive and it was

876
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:31,799
like before I started breeding a lot

877
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,960
more uh uh or a lot more breeding

878
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:37,000
focused you know but I yeah I did I was

879
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,639
like well some won't germinate and some

880
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,239
will stink and I one of the websites I

881
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:44,759
think Attitude Seedbank does like a mix

882
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:47,719
and match where you can literally just

883
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:50,040
like choose one I just choose like chose

884
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:51,559
like 40 different ones and then took

885
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:54,800
single seeds out of like other stuff I

886
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:57,838
had and did this huge hunt I don't

887
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,680
think it I don't think there was any

888
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:02,719
like unicorns in that whole I I had some

889
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:04,279
good plans but I had like nothing where

890
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:07,279
I was like oh my God I'm keeping this

891
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,599
forever um it was just a bunch of yeah I

892
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,960
feel like that's got to be there's got

893
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:13,160
to be some sort of statistical analysis

894
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,159
that can go like if you take 50 seeds of

895
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:17,598
one strain and hunt it versus 50 Single

896
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:19,559
Seeds of a bunch of different strains

897
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,039
and hunt it like it are you more

898
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:24,480
statistically guaranteed to get a better

899
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:28,358
Cross or like a better representation of

900
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:32,000
a nice flower from the 50 of all one or

901
00:37:28,358 --> 00:37:34,480
you know the 50 of individuals like

902
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,920
probably some statistician that's like

903
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,880
oh it's absolutely this or that I'm like

904
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,960
I don't know that's a it's a funny

905
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,720
question though I think my vote would be

906
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,480
the 50 of one strain um which which I

907
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:49,199
say which I say but it's like totally

908
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,280
counter to how I hunt and stuff like I

909
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:53,639
cuz I'm such a nut for like seeing new

910
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,079
stuff and like finding new stuff that

911
00:37:53,639 --> 00:38:01,879
like you know my hunts are

912
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:04,440
between one and six fenos you know like

913
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,960
many more seeds to begin like many many

914
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,800
more seeds to begin but like the actual

915
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,639
finishing flower might only be like one

916
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,200
to six different fenos um that actually

917
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:18,000
like made it through all those culling

918
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:19,439
stages that I do so yeah like I I I do

919
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,960
want to like and I've T talk tried to

920
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,800
talk to some of the larger cultivation

921
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,119
spaces about like getting a bench of

922
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,359
theirs or like in their in their testing

923
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:31,559
um rooms um

924
00:38:28,358 --> 00:38:33,960
getting 50 out there or 100 or you know

925
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:35,920
like of some of the lines where I'm like

926
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,679
you know I've maybe lightly tested them

927
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,039
and I'm like confident that there's

928
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:43,799
craziness in there you know some of them

929
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:45,480
have done it some some of them locally I

930
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,280
know of and some of them in other states

931
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,838
have like bought multiple packs of the

932
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,680
same the same strain off of me to like

933
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:55,000
do a bigger hunt but it sucks I never

934
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:56,399
hear back from those people like I I

935
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,679
don't think they do it cuz they're CU it

936
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,760
wasn't a good experience or what ever

937
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:01,799
but people just kind of like you know

938
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,880
like not everybody's like us posting

939
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,920
everything online and doing write ups on

940
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,200
everything they test and getting the

941
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,800
information out there a lot of people

942
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:11,480
are like wow this is amazing and then

943
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,240
they they never really feed that back to

944
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,400
to the source I really wish I got more

945
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:17,199
of that like I have the abil have the

946
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,838
ability to write reviews on my website

947
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:20,559
and like don't get many I really wish

948
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:22,559
more people would come back and like

949
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:24,838
talk about their

950
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:26,880
experience I I could definitely

951
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:29,159
empathize with that I feel like it's

952
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,838
sometimes give advice out to people and

953
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:32,118
and I just won't even hear back from

954
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:33,960
them and I'll be like oh you know I

955
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:36,039
really hope that that worked for you and

956
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:39,240
if it didn't you know let me know as

957
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:41,960
well because uh I can adjust but um you

958
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:43,639
want to hear the bad stuff too need to

959
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,199
hear I need the bad stuff I don't even

960
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:49,559
need the good stuff that's just to feed

961
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:52,039
my ego right I like that too though yeah

962
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:56,920
I mean yeah why not you know feed the

963
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:58,920
ego a little bit um so you know I I I

964
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:02,680
see a of the flower pictures that you

965
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:04,920
post on uh Instagram and Reddit and like

966
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:07,480
when it's uh the representation of one

967
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,039
of your uh strains that you're putting

968
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,199
out there either for the first time or

969
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:12,960
just showing a really nice

970
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:16,439
representation of it and so I'm curious

971
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,280
um do you have a specific uh grow method

972
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:21,519
for your plants that you're flowering

973
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:25,079
out specifically for uh like glamour

974
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:27,719
shots or are you just running uh seed

975
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:29,760
plants in your pheno hunts SEL ing them

976
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:32,399
and choosing those is it a little bit of

977
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,520
both yeah so

978
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,880
um no is the answer everything I

979
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:40,400
everything goes through the exact same

980
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,880
treatment like my seed

981
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,720
plants will photograph really well like

982
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,599
I grow the seed plants the exact same

983
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:50,919
feed schedules the exact same treatment

984
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:53,559
um sometimes better probably like if if

985
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:56,000
I it it shifted over the last couple

986
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:58,159
years to where like I value my seed

987
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,239
plants more than I value my jar plants

988
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:04,199
or my my cons you know smoke plants I be

989
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:06,519
because other people are getting my

990
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:08,199
seeds now so like literally like say if

991
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:11,400
I was in a hurry or had to go somewhere

992
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:13,519
and could only water you know half of my

993
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,639
plants I would water the the seed ones

994
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:20,318
like and not the other ones um you know

995
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:22,279
I'm I'm so sorry I uh I guess I I Mis uh

996
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:25,358
explained what I was what I was asking

997
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,440
but um so like when I say seed plant I

998
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,920
should have clarified because of course

999
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,318
as a breeder you're thinking of a plant

1000
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,400
that's been pollinated but I mean like

1001
00:41:31,318 --> 00:41:36,960
um so if you're growing a plant from

1002
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:40,240
seed okay um are you flowering that out

1003
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,039
for your uh for the shots that you take

1004
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:45,318
for Instagram or are you taking a

1005
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:48,920
cloning of it and uh got flowering the

1006
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:51,679
Clone out and if you do um regardless of

1007
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:54,599
if it's from seed or from clone what's

1008
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:56,598
your method for growing that out to get

1009
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:58,280
like those really robustly beautiful

1010
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:00,000
plants where you have like all the

1011
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,760
colors are really deep the tricomes are

1012
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,199
really pronounced the whole plant has a

1013
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,359
really really nice structure you know

1014
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:07,719
they're very there's a lot of turer to

1015
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:10,719
it you know they're all rigid and

1016
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:13,439
upright and not necessarily like big old

1017
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:16,000
floppy uh you know Candy strains

1018
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,119
sometimes I feel like are like that so

1019
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,480
um yeah like what's what are you doing

1020
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:22,079
there everything is it's kind of the

1021
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:26,280
same answer though everything is grown

1022
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,680
like identical I I so my the the if it's

1023
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,079
something new that I'm talking about

1024
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:30,358
like if you see me posting about a plan

1025
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:33,519
over and over again and I'm like oh I'm

1026
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:36,480
excited about this that is a like hunt

1027
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:40,280
like this round of my own I'm hunting my

1028
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,800
black lavender and lavender Haze and so

1029
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:46,079
those pictures are from you know I took

1030
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,240
a I typically when I'm hunting my own

1031
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:51,318
what I like to do is you know my packs

1032
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:53,199
are sold as 12 I give people 15 so they

1033
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:55,358
have a couple extra in case one doesn't

1034
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:59,239
germ or whatever

1035
00:42:55,358 --> 00:43:01,279
um and so I'll start with 15 and you

1036
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:03,318
know with most of my seeds are regular

1037
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,519
or all up into this point are regular so

1038
00:43:03,318 --> 00:43:09,279
they're half and half male female right

1039
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:11,280
so you get seven or eight females um but

1040
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,839
I like I said I'm calling the weak the

1041
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,920
whole way down the line so those

1042
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:17,880
pictures that you see or like recently

1043
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,880
I've been posting those black lavenders

1044
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,358
like those

1045
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,920
are just from seed first time I've ever

1046
00:43:22,358 --> 00:43:28,519
seen them you guys are seeing them too

1047
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:32,119
um those bud shots are

1048
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:33,759
just the way I grow from from from seed

1049
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:36,280
I do have others from clone as I

1050
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,200
mentioned some of my like mother shelf

1051
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:41,519
plants uh the breeder shelf that are

1052
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:44,039
going right now and try to get those

1053
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:45,679
like really nice bud shots I think the

1054
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:49,960
trick

1055
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:50,919
is like day 50 55 it's like when you get

1056
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,039
that

1057
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,519
like Peak you might not get Peak colors

1058
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:57,838
yet but you'll get like that you know

1059
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:59,838
that kind of like nice fluff before

1060
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:02,480
anything starts to like deteriorate or

1061
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:05,719
crinkle up or kind of get an uglier look

1062
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,400
to it um so a lot of times the best

1063
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:10,558
photo or the best it'll look is not the

1064
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,280
day of harvest sometimes it is some some

1065
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:14,839
plants just stay looking beautiful as

1066
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,720
you guys know but sometimes it's just

1067
00:44:14,838 --> 00:44:19,480
like that earlier photo will be better

1068
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:22,279
but yeah I don't do anything like no

1069
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:24,920
tricks no weird feedings no like it's

1070
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:27,800
just like I'm hunting stuff it's all

1071
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,680
being treated the same and you know I

1072
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,599
guess the trick

1073
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:34,639
is you guys will never see or hear about

1074
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:37,119
the losers and I'm not talking about my

1075
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:38,480
own if if I have a loser in my own seeds

1076
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,480
it'll it would get pulled from the

1077
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,679
website and I just refund everybody or

1078
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:48,159
replace it with something else like I so

1079
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:49,960
I release my new seeds untested um I

1080
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:53,519
germination test them but other than

1081
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:55,880
that um for like a discounted price and

1082
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:59,159
then when I internally test all of them

1083
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:00,720
I put the price up if I internally

1084
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:02,440
tested that and it didn't make it I

1085
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:03,838
would pull it off my website just reach

1086
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,720
out to anybody who bought it and be like

1087
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:07,119
hey what do you want I'll give you

1088
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:09,719
something else um but I guess what I'm

1089
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,920
saying is like when I'm testing others

1090
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:16,598
like right now I'm running a bubble gum

1091
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:21,318
or a Bubble Yum Bubble Yum from uh resin

1092
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:23,480
seeds and it's just like extremely

1093
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:25,119
average plant so the only time that

1094
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,719
people heard about it on my posts is

1095
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,838
like when I post like hey this is what

1096
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:30,719
this includes you know in the beginning

1097
00:45:28,838 --> 00:45:32,358
this is what I'm doing this time and

1098
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:33,959
then I just never really post it because

1099
00:45:32,358 --> 00:45:36,078
it didn't show up or it just didn't

1100
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,358
become something noteworthy I'm not

1101
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:41,720
going to breed with it I'm not going to

1102
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:44,799
keep it um so like yeah there's a lot of

1103
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:46,439
stuff that just never makes it to to to

1104
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,240
to nice pretty photos because it just

1105
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:52,240
gets one and done you know you grow it

1106
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:54,598
and on to the next one for sure are you

1107
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:56,679
um like when you're doing these 15 seed

1108
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:57,440
hunts just to do like the testing of the

1109
00:45:56,679 --> 00:45:59,318
pack

1110
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,760
are you are you cloning them right away

1111
00:45:59,318 --> 00:46:04,960
before you put the seed uh plants into

1112
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:08,480
flower yeah I've got a little bit of a a

1113
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:10,400
tip there or a trick that I do too so I

1114
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,159
every single plant that I ever flower

1115
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,480
gets cloned gets backed up like no

1116
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:17,519
matter what I have a pretty strong rule

1117
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:20,719
about that these days like I know you

1118
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:23,679
guys know why I do that it's like you

1119
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:25,239
you know that One That Got Away we've

1120
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:27,838
all got that story and eventually you're

1121
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:30,959
just like I need to back up everything

1122
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:32,719
um but with that becomes room you know

1123
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,119
room problems right like you back up

1124
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:36,118
everything and then you have no room for

1125
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:39,960
anything um it just like becomes crowded

1126
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:42,200
and packed so what I started doing is

1127
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:45,240
and like I got some people were I posted

1128
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:46,318
about this online year ago or maybe more

1129
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:47,679
some people were like that's a great

1130
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:49,279
idea other people were like oh I could

1131
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:52,558
see that causing problems blah blah blah

1132
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:57,079
and I'm like it doesn't but what I do is

1133
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:58,319
I clone for preservation cuts at like

1134
00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:02,720
day nine of

1135
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:06,119
flour and what happens is that has

1136
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:08,358
already started to trigger into flow so

1137
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:10,680
it'll root right like it'll root just

1138
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:12,440
fine um so I'll root it up and it'll

1139
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:14,679
root and grow like maybe one or two more

1140
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:16,280
nodes and then it'll mutate out like a

1141
00:47:14,679 --> 00:47:18,679
uh

1142
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:21,800
uh uh what's the word for it why am I

1143
00:47:18,679 --> 00:47:24,719
not monster crop or like a yeah like a

1144
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:27,119
uh it started to rev rev right yeah

1145
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:29,000
that's the word I was struggling with so

1146
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,200
it'll it'll start to throw single blades

1147
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,480
and do the whole rev funky M mutation

1148
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:36,919
thing and then it'll go back into normal

1149
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:38,599
growth but with that so I saved a week

1150
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:41,440
right because I waited till day nine or

1151
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:43,519
I saved a week in two days and then you

1152
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,039
know 10 14 days of cloning whatever you

1153
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:48,239
want to call it so that's that's week

1154
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:50,679
I'm already into week three um and then

1155
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:52,118
the Rev slows things down you guys know

1156
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:53,879
it slows things down a ton when you're

1157
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:56,480
reving things so that plant goes into

1158
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,000
this like really slow mutated growth you

1159
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,400
know that takes like two weeks for the

1160
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:04,159
plant to come out of so you're on to

1161
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:06,039
like week five six of the the the hunt

1162
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:09,399
and it's still small and you've still

1163
00:48:06,039 --> 00:48:10,880
only got this like 10 in thing and by

1164
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,358
week six you're starting to know what

1165
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,880
you need to keep right like you're kind

1166
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:16,679
of like okay like you kind of know your

1167
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,400
winners at that point or at least you

1168
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:20,039
might not know your your winner winners

1169
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,559
but you know your losers right like you

1170
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:25,400
know there's like you're like that one

1171
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,800
it's got Somey branches and even it

1172
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,440
might be good smoke I don't want to

1173
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,280
cultivate something that's so floppy

1174
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:34,480
right so yeah you've got a 10 14in plant

1175
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:37,280
at that point and you already know what

1176
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,280
you're calling so that's my Pro tip on

1177
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,119
uh on on preserving stuff bunch of

1178
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,040
people in the comments were like uh

1179
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,760
that's going to be cause you problems

1180
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:46,800
and blah blah blah it doesn't that that

1181
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:49,520
may be the most practical use of monster

1182
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:53,798
cropping I've ever heard to be fully

1183
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:56,199
honest like uh because of like space

1184
00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:58,480
restraints and then like you even have

1185
00:48:56,199 --> 00:49:00,798
the potential you get that top that sort

1186
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,559
of like can mutate from the the flower

1187
00:49:00,798 --> 00:49:05,039
node where you get a bunch of new nodes

1188
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:06,839
that grow out of it ra and So you you're

1189
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:08,519
still keeping a stout plant with lots of

1190
00:49:06,838 --> 00:49:10,719
tops then that if it is nice and you

1191
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:13,159
want to clone it and even like send out

1192
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:14,519
clones to people you know you're you're

1193
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:17,000
right there at the end of flower ready

1194
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:19,199
to do that that's I mean that's really

1195
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:23,358
efficent that's an efficient way to feno

1196
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:25,039
hunt yep it's uh yeah I mean I I I'm not

1197
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:26,759
going to run out and get a plant to show

1198
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:28,480
you right now but I have some that are

1199
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:33,880
right at like my run right now is at

1200
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:35,639
like day 58 or so and I did have to top

1201
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,519
the the preservation Cuts or whatever we

1202
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:40,519
want to call them the Clones um but yeah

1203
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:42,920
they're only like you know 14 in high or

1204
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:44,880
something they're in one and a half

1205
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:48,119
gallon pots or they're not taking up

1206
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:50,280
much space at all at this point so but

1207
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:54,960
now a lot of like the time what I'll do

1208
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:58,200
now is the ones I want to keep I will

1209
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:01,079
take a cutting off of that one that went

1210
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:05,439
through that process and start a proper

1211
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:07,960
mom from like the beginning um so yeah

1212
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,079
that's my like that's a pro tip because

1213
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,639
everybody reaches out to me and they're

1214
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:11,839
like I can't clone everything how do I

1215
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:14,558
keep everything how do you have room for

1216
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:16,400
that it's like well I maybe I do have

1217
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,000
more room than most though I I you know

1218
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:21,280
I have like five tents or something like

1219
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,679
that or five different areas um but

1220
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:27,280
yeah what uh do you feel like do you

1221
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:29,919
have any other unique um approaches to

1222
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,280
cultivation that maybe not a lot of

1223
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,838
other people are using or or that like

1224
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:40,079
uh that you can find maybe just a select

1225
00:50:34,838 --> 00:50:43,519
few are yeah I this isn't unique um but

1226
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:47,280
it's an answer to your question I don't

1227
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:50,199
train anymore like I used to train and

1228
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:53,280
and be like way into like doing all

1229
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:56,078
kinds of crazy Bonsai stuff or even

1230
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:59,280
using like um I found these like

1231
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:01,200
trellises that like are for tomato cage

1232
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,480
kind of but it's like a flat top and you

1233
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:05,759
can put it into your pot and it's like 2

1234
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:08,519
feet up 3T up and then you can like kind

1235
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,960
of have like potted trellises and I

1236
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:12,599
can't do like full trellis like

1237
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,119
everybody does because I'm moving stuff

1238
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:15,680
around so frequently cuz of breeding

1239
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:17,680
like I need potted plants that I can

1240
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:19,679
like pick up and carry to other places

1241
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:22,399
and you know pollinate and then bring

1242
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:25,960
back and so I can't do like beds or I

1243
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:28,880
can't do like an individual trellis so

1244
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:32,000
what I've done is is like um when the

1245
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,680
seedlings are young and even clones but

1246
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,358
mostly speaking about

1247
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:40,759
seedlings once they get to like the 4ish

1248
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:42,719
node I I start removing all the fans and

1249
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,839
what I've noticed is the the plant will

1250
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:47,719
naturally get bushier because of that

1251
00:51:44,838 --> 00:51:49,239
light access to the lower nodes so even

1252
00:51:47,719 --> 00:51:50,798
without topping at that point you

1253
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:53,519
already start to get this like

1254
00:51:50,798 --> 00:51:56,358
accelerated growth on the lower branches

1255
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:57,079
um so my system for every seedling is

1256
00:51:56,358 --> 00:51:58,759
like

1257
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:01,480
yeah fourth node I start to remove all

1258
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:03,760
the all larger fans and then by like the

1259
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:05,199
sixth or seventh or eighth node I will

1260
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,359
depending on the way the plant

1261
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:10,598
individual plant is growing I will uh

1262
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:13,400
then I will actually top and then I'll

1263
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:16,480
wait you know a week or two and then

1264
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:18,240
flour and I found like dude the time

1265
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,960
people are wasting with all these crazy

1266
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:23,479
tieout methods and all these crazy

1267
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,679
like they're not gaining anything

1268
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,960
because like your footprint of your

1269
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:30,279
light and your space didn't change right

1270
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:32,199
so like if I can fill that space by

1271
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,720
doing that with like a single topping

1272
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:38,639
and like a little bit

1273
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:40,318
of excuse me like um you know allowing

1274
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:41,719
light into the lower areas by removing

1275
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:44,880
certain

1276
00:52:41,719 --> 00:52:48,078
leaves you you've gone you you've it's

1277
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:50,720
faster and at the end I'm still taking

1278
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,280
up the same square footage of the the

1279
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:55,519
that plant's canopy that you did with

1280
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:57,400
all that training so I don't know there

1281
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:59,318
I'm not saying like there obviously

1282
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:02,200
places and grow techniques I used to

1283
00:52:59,318 --> 00:53:03,838
grow with like scrags and like I've done

1284
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:06,399
all of this stuff and I love to do it

1285
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:08,239
cuz it's kind of fun um but yeah I I

1286
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,599
found like a lot of that just slows you

1287
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:12,639
down and doesn't increase yields or

1288
00:53:10,599 --> 00:53:14,000
anything like that I'm trying to think

1289
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:17,279
anything else like that I do that might

1290
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,880
be weird I water I water way less

1291
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,640
frequently than most Growers with my

1292
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,599
technique I hand water and it's only

1293
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:24,480
like every 3 or 4 days and people always

1294
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:26,798
think I'm they're like holy [ __ ] my

1295
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,679
cocoa dries out in 24 hours how you do

1296
00:53:26,798 --> 00:53:30,318
that and that's just a matter of pot

1297
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:31,679
sizing right like you just if you didn't

1298
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:34,719
size your pot properly then you're going

1299
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:37,558
to be drying out constantly like I I

1300
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:39,399
finish in five gallons and there the

1301
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:41,000
plants are sized appropriately that like

1302
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,798
I don't need to water for like 3 or 4

1303
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,199
days and when I do water it's like a

1304
00:53:42,798 --> 00:53:50,358
total flood it's like a like flood the

1305
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:52,639
medium 20 25 30% drain it drains off and

1306
00:53:50,358 --> 00:53:54,960
kind of carry some of the waste or the

1307
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:56,440
uh the used the spent nutrients with it

1308
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,599
so you don't get any type of like salt

1309
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:03,000
build ups and stuff like that and what

1310
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:05,640
uh what sort of uh EC are you feeding at

1311
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:09,079
uh it's a good question it's like the

1312
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:10,318
last I I think I I did I don't test any

1313
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,640
of that because I've been doing it for

1314
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:14,079
so long with the same nutrients but I

1315
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:16,199
used to have all of this in like chart

1316
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:20,280
my grow chart feed charts and it was all

1317
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:22,439
calculated out I want to say I never did

1318
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,720
I never did calculate anything back dude

1319
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,838
I made these charts 21 years ago and

1320
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:28,639
haven't looked at them since I never did

1321
00:54:26,838 --> 00:54:32,159
anything by I never did it by EC I was

1322
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:35,039
doing it by PPM it was like it was like

1323
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:37,598
1100 Max 1200 Max that sound right it's

1324
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:39,440
been like a really long time since I

1325
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:41,960
looked into that so I really couldn't

1326
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,480
tell you is is the uh the Flor Nova is

1327
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:47,720
it like a powder that you just dissolve

1328
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:50,280
in water is it like a liquid it's a mud

1329
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:51,959
it's like it's a liquid but it's thick

1330
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,720
it's you have to like shake it really

1331
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:59,199
aggressively um what how much are you

1332
00:54:53,719 --> 00:54:59,199
adding per gallon I'm just curious it's

1333
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:05,639
uh one and a half teaspoons I think wow

1334
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,720
it's it's potent it's it's like super

1335
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:10,759
concentrated that's I mean that's pretty

1336
00:55:07,719 --> 00:55:12,598
crazy I I to have something just so so

1337
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:15,640
simple and and are you like adjusting

1338
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:19,039
the pH or anything with that i ph before

1339
00:55:15,639 --> 00:55:20,480
I put it I I don't pH afterwards so I'm

1340
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:25,679
doing I've been doing the same thing for

1341
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:28,440
so long it's like i ph my my water add

1342
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:30,000
that and that's literally all that I do

1343
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,960
what what do you pH your water to ahead

1344
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,719
of time water to six okay I pH the water

1345
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,639
to six and then

1346
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:41,318
that I don't go above certain amounts

1347
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:45,279
with that nutrient so the water or the

1348
00:55:41,318 --> 00:55:47,920
the pH remains in that like low sixes

1349
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:50,559
kind of range yeah it's super like I

1350
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,519
said there's like no magic there's no

1351
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:54,480
like it's like the most I've been in the

1352
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:56,480
the hydro store before and like new

1353
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,519
Growers have been in there and the sales

1354
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,960
were like just talk to him because they

1355
00:55:58,519 --> 00:56:02,599
were already going to sell these new

1356
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:04,760
Growers on Flor Nova and they were like

1357
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:08,359
just ask him how he does it cuz like

1358
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:09,559
it's the lamest most basic like it's

1359
00:56:08,358 --> 00:56:11,000
funny when you guys ask me to come on

1360
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:13,920
and do this like how we grow thing I

1361
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,159
immediately thought like the actual how

1362
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,559
I grow in terms of like product wise is

1363
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:21,078
the most boring simple thing but for a

1364
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:22,760
new grower dude that's so good for new

1365
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:25,240
Growers though so

1366
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:27,680
awesome hear that they can pH their

1367
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:30,279
water to 6.0 and if it's just plain

1368
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:32,239
water you can get a cheap pH meter

1369
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:35,000
because it's it's the salts that you

1370
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:37,000
need a nicer pH meter where the like the

1371
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,760
crystal isn't getting messed up and and

1372
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,280
like the different uh components that

1373
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:42,160
actually measure the the water aren't

1374
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,720
getting messed up uh but if it's plain

1375
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:46,558
water and you're just phing that and

1376
00:56:43,719 --> 00:56:50,000
then just boop boop drop it in Stir It

1377
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:52,839
Up pour it on that's that's probably one

1378
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,599
of the easiest ways I've I've heard and

1379
00:56:52,838 --> 00:56:56,440
with how your flowers look and the

1380
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:57,440
people who listen to this I know that

1381
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,440
there's going to be some of them that

1382
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,798
already see your stuff online maybe they

1383
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,760
don't know that this is how you do it

1384
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:05,280
and they're just going to go oh my God

1385
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:08,280
what am I doing with my life this is I

1386
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:11,200
feel like it CU to to simplify people's

1387
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:13,519
grows at home is one of the biggest

1388
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:16,279
gifts for most home Growers because so

1389
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:18,079
many people spend like you know an hour

1390
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:20,039
or more a day in their grow just to make

1391
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,640
sure that it's right and I'm like if I

1392
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:25,160
can get in and out in 5 minutes I'm I'm

1393
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:27,239
happy yep there's some drawbacks for

1394
00:57:25,159 --> 00:57:30,000
sure like you cannot drip the stuff that

1395
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:31,838
I use it's mud like it would clog your

1396
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,920
clog your drippers immediately you can't

1397
00:57:31,838 --> 00:57:35,880
so it's it's it's hand watering which is

1398
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:39,480
good most new Growers have a couple

1399
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:42,838
potted plants you know keeping it simple

1400
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,798
so um also like I said you've really got

1401
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:48,719
to shake the stuff cuz it's like it's

1402
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:50,318
it's got grit in it like it settles and

1403
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:51,838
sure you've got to shake it and I you

1404
00:57:50,318 --> 00:57:54,679
know I use the little measurement shot

1405
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:56,400
glass to pour the stuff in um you can't

1406
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:58,759
use droppers or anything like that you

1407
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,599
have to like kind of pour it it's thick

1408
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:02,160
and so there's some like drawbacks and

1409
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:03,680
like it's so potent that if you

1410
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:05,358
accidentally overdid it like you could

1411
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:07,838
burn your plants probably pretty easily

1412
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:11,480
I I don't have that issue because I just

1413
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:13,838
measure everything but um yeah it's so

1414
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:14,920
easy like I I I try to tell new Growers

1415
00:58:13,838 --> 00:58:16,798
all the time that this is what you

1416
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:20,599
should be doing you know you see people

1417
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:22,199
with like like dwc first time and stuff

1418
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:24,318
and it's like you're going to get crazy

1419
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:26,879
yields if you succeed but if you mess up

1420
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:30,159
phing one time or if you mess your EC up

1421
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:32,240
one time 4our window you scorched your

1422
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:35,239
entire like your whole Harvest and then

1423
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:37,919
you get all sad about it do do you not

1424
00:58:35,239 --> 00:58:40,199
use any um calcium or magnesium

1425
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:44,960
supplements to help compensate for the

1426
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:46,519
cocoa nope none I have cow mag I've like

1427
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,039
messed with it in the past i' I've

1428
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:49,838
messed with tons of stuff in like over

1429
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:52,839
you know 20 something years of growing

1430
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:54,440
the same way I've messed with like all

1431
00:58:52,838 --> 00:58:56,679
these products that they recommend at

1432
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:59,240
the store and uh

1433
00:58:56,679 --> 00:59:02,558
um every time I just end up going back

1434
00:58:59,239 --> 00:59:06,439
to the simple it's too easy I know I

1435
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:08,000
could probably be getting bigger yields

1436
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,760
I don't think that I'm missing out on

1437
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,159
much on like the flavor side though or

1438
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,520
like the expression side right like

1439
00:59:13,159 --> 00:59:17,719
there's probably something I'm missing

1440
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:19,798
out on the you know pumping it up side

1441
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:23,078
and like bulking it up but it's not

1442
00:59:19,798 --> 00:59:26,920
really my goal so if I can get it to

1443
00:59:23,079 --> 00:59:30,798
fully expressed like you know tping and

1444
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:33,159
tricomes and flavors that's I would much

1445
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:35,199
prefer that over like a larger yield so

1446
00:59:33,159 --> 00:59:37,239
I I'm not really trying to Pump It Up I

1447
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:39,399
mean yeah as a breeder to to have

1448
00:59:37,239 --> 00:59:40,838
quality as the goal I I totally

1449
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:42,559
understand that it's not necessarily

1450
00:59:40,838 --> 00:59:44,480
about you know you're not looking to

1451
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:46,400
minimize pot size so that you can

1452
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,400
increase planting density so that you

1453
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,079
can increase yield per square foot

1454
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,720
you're you're looking to get the nicest

1455
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:54,720
buds you can out of each plant so yeah

1456
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:56,480
you know on that note I try to do that

1457
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:58,318
for a while I tried to increase plant

1458
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:02,838
count so I could hunt more you know like

1459
00:59:58,318 --> 01:00:05,038
as a pheno hunter tester breeder um and

1460
01:00:02,838 --> 01:00:08,960
I know some people do it they like one

1461
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:12,440
gallon out you know like 36 50 plants in

1462
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:14,039
a 5x5 or a 4x4 and they're like just you

1463
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:15,599
know you get you cut everything off and

1464
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:17,760
you've got one Cola and that's what

1465
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:20,160
you're testing and that's your proof or

1466
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:24,160
whatever for that feno I don't think

1467
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:26,038
that that demonstrates the plant at all

1468
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:27,838
to me so I tried doing that for a while

1469
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:28,880
I was running these like many many

1470
01:00:27,838 --> 01:00:32,038
smaller

1471
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:34,079
plants and you don't really get to see

1472
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:36,400
that plant come to maturity at all like

1473
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:38,760
you don't get to see its Branch

1474
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,639
structure you don't get to see the inner

1475
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,640
node spacing you might get to see the

1476
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:44,719
inner node spacing on the top five nodes

1477
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:47,038
of that one Cola that you're growing but

1478
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:49,318
like you have no idea how the lowers

1479
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:52,440
Branch out if it crowns up really well

1480
01:00:49,318 --> 01:00:54,440
if like the branches at the beginning

1481
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:56,318
have 8 in nodes and then they shrink

1482
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:58,599
down as you get towards the tip like you

1483
01:00:56,318 --> 01:01:00,920
never get to like see it happen I don't

1484
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:03,200
think so I tried it for a little while

1485
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:05,240
and I went right back to like nothing

1486
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:06,480
smaller than 5 gallons to finish like I

1487
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:10,439
want to see the plant you know it's

1488
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:14,039
usually like chest high or head high and

1489
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:16,440
five gallons and like a properly grown

1490
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:18,680
fully mature plant I I don't I think

1491
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:21,039
you're missing it if you don't do that

1492
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:23,679
for sure and you've also said you know

1493
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:26,520
you you're uh not only breeding for hom

1494
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:29,159
Growers but you're breeding to get uh

1495
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:31,719
into the cultivation space in some cases

1496
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:35,000
so like what but who is your your

1497
01:01:31,719 --> 01:01:38,118
biggest customer I guess most of it is

1498
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,719
is is hom Growers um cultivation spaces

1499
01:01:38,119 --> 01:01:42,200
just want the Clone they just want the

1500
01:01:39,719 --> 01:01:44,719
cut like they they don't want to hunt

1501
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:46,000
anything like so I have had

1502
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:48,358
conversations with a lot of them and

1503
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:51,278
I've shared Cuts with some of them and

1504
01:01:48,358 --> 01:01:53,679
you know like I I'm not big on like

1505
01:01:51,278 --> 01:01:55,119
making a zillion dollars off of one cut

1506
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:57,598
so I'll just usually give it to them as

1507
01:01:55,119 --> 01:02:00,000
long as they keep my name on it um

1508
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:01,798
that's hey I I feel that I mean I I

1509
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,199
think I have a cut of uh your Flawless

1510
01:02:01,798 --> 01:02:05,838
lavender that I'm going to try and get

1511
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:08,159
into a in a cultivation space and and

1512
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:10,199
get into mass production just uh with

1513
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:12,798
your name attached to it and you're

1514
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:14,798
absolutely right you know I I think we

1515
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:17,278
will feno hunt maybe once or twice a

1516
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:18,880
year and and it's like maybe like I

1517
01:02:17,278 --> 01:02:20,760
think the last time we did a feno hunt

1518
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,160
was Outdoors this last year but it was

1519
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:24,160
kind of last minute we didn't get

1520
01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:26,519
anything from it other than the flower

1521
01:02:24,159 --> 01:02:29,159
that we sent off for processing and so

1522
01:02:26,519 --> 01:02:31,199
it's like uh yeah it's it's really hard

1523
01:02:29,159 --> 01:02:32,838
to justify I think one of our earlier

1524
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:34,960
podcasts we were even talking about how

1525
01:02:32,838 --> 01:02:36,599
pheno hunting at a commercial level is

1526
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,960
so

1527
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:41,200
expensive you know it's it's kind of

1528
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:43,400
crazy to think about it and then uh how

1529
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:45,118
a hom grower can you know get one pack

1530
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:47,559
pop it find something great and if they

1531
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:51,358
keep it then they can get that out to a

1532
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:52,880
lot more people really easily um and uh

1533
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:54,558
especially but so what I was going to

1534
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,358
say though is how you're growing in like

1535
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:58,119
the 5 gon pot where there are a lot of

1536
01:02:56,358 --> 01:03:00,318
hom Growers growing in around that size

1537
01:02:58,119 --> 01:03:02,720
pot because it it does cut down on the

1538
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:06,440
maintenance uh required of uh either

1539
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:09,038
having like a an irrigation system or

1540
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:12,679
having um the ability to water multiple

1541
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:14,680
times a day by hand um I can see how

1542
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:16,519
that's a really good way to also show

1543
01:03:14,679 --> 01:03:18,719
the expression of what someone might be

1544
01:03:16,519 --> 01:03:20,880
able to experience at home and with such

1545
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:23,239
a simple growing method to it just it

1546
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:26,200
shows how how easy it really can be I'm

1547
01:03:23,239 --> 01:03:28,038
I'm really I'm like Blown Away by that I

1548
01:03:26,199 --> 01:03:30,278
cuz I I try to keep it as simple as

1549
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:33,200
possible too you know I do a two parts

1550
01:03:30,278 --> 01:03:34,960
for veg and two parts for Bloom and and

1551
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:36,519
one of those parts is shared between the

1552
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,798
two because it's just calcium nitrate

1553
01:03:36,519 --> 01:03:40,798
and calcium chloride mixed together and

1554
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:43,599
so um but the other two parts are just

1555
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:45,318
all the other Mac macros and micros and

1556
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:46,599
uh you can you can keep it so simple and

1557
01:03:45,318 --> 01:03:49,400
then adding all this other stuff just

1558
01:03:46,599 --> 01:03:51,920
seems to complicate things is that the

1559
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:54,599
the traditional GH line that you're

1560
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:57,559
talking about I'm I'm using uh Jr crop

1561
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:59,640
Tech um okay and that that when you like

1562
01:03:57,559 --> 01:04:00,960
buy your own calcium nitrate and calcium

1563
01:03:59,639 --> 01:04:03,440
chloride and they just provide the

1564
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:06,400
flower bag and the veg bag and you just

1565
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:08,838
mix up your concentrates and go to town

1566
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,880
yeah I've been toying with changing i'

1567
01:04:08,838 --> 01:04:13,798
like I said I've tried it a bunch I

1568
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,760
there's one uh I shouldn't even mention

1569
01:04:13,798 --> 01:04:16,798
this because I can't think of the name

1570
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:19,119
right now that I I've been or Organics

1571
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:20,798
alive I've had my eye on I'm trying I've

1572
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:22,119
been thinking about trying that stuff

1573
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:24,440
and I'm not plugging them because I've

1574
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:26,000
never tried it but like through

1575
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:27,358
researching it and stuff it's seems like

1576
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,920
they've got an interesting thing going

1577
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:31,000
over there so I thought about trying

1578
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:32,559
that product but and anything that I see

1579
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,798
working at a commercial level where I

1580
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:37,000
see people actually producing nice flow

1581
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:39,079
at a commercial level I think that you

1582
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,440
know there's there's a huge thing to say

1583
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:44,880
about at least the cost factor of being

1584
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:46,798
able to produce nice flow um totally

1585
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,680
because at scale you you're not going to

1586
01:04:46,798 --> 01:04:53,440
find a lot of people with a a six like a

1587
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:56,159
16 part uh mix anymore it's just it's

1588
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:58,720
not tenable with the market yeah and

1589
01:04:56,159 --> 01:05:00,879
what I mean what what I do certainly

1590
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:02,679
doesn't go to scale there's no way to

1591
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:06,200
use the product I use hand or without

1592
01:05:02,679 --> 01:05:08,519
handw watering so it'd be you might be

1593
01:05:06,199 --> 01:05:10,159
able to mix up like huge Vats of it but

1594
01:05:08,519 --> 01:05:12,559
yeah it'd be it's not ideal for that at

1595
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:14,798
all def like a bunch of different like

1596
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:16,319
strainers and [ __ ] all the way through

1597
01:05:14,798 --> 01:05:19,920
then you're probably pulling stuff out

1598
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:21,558
that you're getting into the pot totally

1599
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:24,920
but uh yeah I mean I'd say most of the

1600
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:27,400
people that reach out are are homeowers

1601
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:32,318
or maybe like caregiver size you know

1602
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:34,358
like small smaller um I I I have worked

1603
01:05:32,318 --> 01:05:36,278
with a bunch of different facilities um

1604
01:05:34,358 --> 01:05:38,318
but like I said they usually want Cuts

1605
01:05:36,278 --> 01:05:40,960
some of them have bought some of them

1606
01:05:38,318 --> 01:05:42,798
have bought packs and hunted packs um

1607
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:45,400
and like St like I've had ones here in

1608
01:05:42,798 --> 01:05:46,759
Denver that were like starting a grow

1609
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:49,160
and the start of it they did it the

1610
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:52,400
right way they basically were like

1611
01:05:49,159 --> 01:05:55,078
excuse me for the for this first run

1612
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:56,200
we're dedicating all of the tables to to

1613
01:05:55,079 --> 01:05:59,200
hunting

1614
01:05:56,199 --> 01:06:01,000
and like to kick off the business we are

1615
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:03,879
going to do a giant hunt and then we

1616
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,798
have our own fenos that nobody else has

1617
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:09,920
and I was like this is awesome

1618
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:12,038
um that story ends poorly they like had

1619
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:14,400
a falling out as people seem to do in

1620
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:16,799
this industry and like lost all the cuts

1621
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,798
and they're starting over and stuff and

1622
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:20,239
they actually reached they actually

1623
01:06:17,798 --> 01:06:24,079
reached out to me um because one of the

1624
01:06:20,239 --> 01:06:27,358
packs that they hunted was uh the first

1625
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:30,119
Kepler 22b that I put out I put out the

1626
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:31,400
the f1s and then I put out f2s both in

1627
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:33,278
pretty small numbers and they're all

1628
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,880
gone now but yeah they hunted it and

1629
01:06:33,278 --> 01:06:37,639
they were like this was like there were

1630
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:39,640
like six different fenos that were like

1631
01:06:37,639 --> 01:06:41,679
everybody's favorite various favorites

1632
01:06:39,639 --> 01:06:44,558
in here out of everything we hunted all

1633
01:06:41,679 --> 01:06:49,199
from that one pack and they were like we

1634
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:51,960
lost them all oh so um yeah but it's you

1635
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:54,239
know like that

1636
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:56,240
that that's F1 breeding though with

1637
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:57,879
those packs so like he was like yeah we

1638
01:06:56,239 --> 01:06:59,439
have some that smell like Bubblegum and

1639
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:01,160
some that smell like medicine and some

1640
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,400
that like they had a variety you know

1641
01:07:01,159 --> 01:07:04,440
like that's that's one thing that I

1642
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:07,000
wanted to make sure to talk about like

1643
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:09,880
on the podcast was like what I'm

1644
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,719
breeding and what it what it um what

1645
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:13,200
what people should expect out of it too

1646
01:07:11,719 --> 01:07:14,838
I know the podcast is not necessarily

1647
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:16,439
about my breeding projects it's most

1648
01:07:14,838 --> 01:07:18,440
mostly about how mean like let's let's

1649
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:20,798
say go ahead and choose like what's

1650
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:23,278
what's like your um what's your focal

1651
01:07:20,798 --> 01:07:25,679
point in breeding right now and uh and

1652
01:07:23,278 --> 01:07:27,719
what are you trying to to get out to to

1653
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:30,679
people uh through your breeding

1654
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:34,239
practices yeah so uh the the whole thing

1655
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:38,118
for me started a few years ago I I got

1656
01:07:34,239 --> 01:07:40,000
back to Colorado and wanted to get into

1657
01:07:38,119 --> 01:07:42,880
the commercial space wanted to to to

1658
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:45,760
purchase a commercial facility and start

1659
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:47,640
um growing at scale and the Market's

1660
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:50,760
been horrible here like the pound price

1661
01:07:47,639 --> 01:07:53,879
is terrible the people are giving away

1662
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:55,599
spaces so I I was like okay well what

1663
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:57,160
can I do in the meantime until there's a

1664
01:07:55,599 --> 01:08:00,640
better Market or until the time is right

1665
01:07:57,159 --> 01:08:02,199
to enter so I started phen I started

1666
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:04,239
fenal hunting I was just like screw it

1667
01:08:02,199 --> 01:08:06,639
I'm just going to test everything so I

1668
01:08:04,239 --> 01:08:08,439
gathered up every clone in town ran

1669
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:11,679
everything and I was like holy smokes I

1670
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:13,519
don't like any of this um like I had

1671
01:08:11,679 --> 01:08:15,078
taken a few years off from cultivation

1672
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:17,679
and when I came back to it a few you

1673
01:08:15,079 --> 01:08:19,440
know four years ago I was like all right

1674
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:20,679
all this stuff is so hyped up like this

1675
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:23,000
is what everybody's talking about I got

1676
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:26,039
to try it and then I tried it and I was

1677
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:28,479
like o like so much of it just like so

1678
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:30,679
much of the hype these days it's like

1679
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:33,559
really beautiful when you grow it and

1680
01:08:30,679 --> 01:08:36,079
then like you cure it and the flavors

1681
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:38,679
gone or the highest flat or it's just

1682
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:41,359
like commercial right like it's like

1683
01:08:38,679 --> 01:08:44,719
good flowering it bulky it grows well

1684
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:47,600
it's easy but man it like lost that

1685
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:50,399
magic of like the 20 years ago stuff

1686
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:52,440
that I started with so you have none of

1687
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:55,719
the older stuff that you started

1688
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:57,399
with not in seed or clone no I've been

1689
01:08:55,719 --> 01:09:00,158
through too many like I've moved around

1690
01:08:57,399 --> 01:09:01,759
a ton and just like have never been able

1691
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:04,759
to like maintain I think I have some

1692
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:07,798
pretty old seeds but nothing noteworthy

1693
01:09:04,759 --> 01:09:10,119
no um fair enough but I but yeah in my

1694
01:09:07,798 --> 01:09:12,158
head I was like expecting all that stuff

1695
01:09:10,119 --> 01:09:15,439
you know like expecting the stuff that

1696
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:17,399
like you know you open the jar and the

1697
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:19,399
whole house stinks or the whole car

1698
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:22,879
whatever the whole area is like ruined

1699
01:09:19,399 --> 01:09:24,838
from like open one jar I don't see that

1700
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,079
often anymore at all so I was kind of

1701
01:09:24,838 --> 01:09:27,399
like okay so I ran through all these

1702
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:29,679
clones and I was like all right I got to

1703
01:09:27,399 --> 01:09:31,639
go back to seeds um so I can find

1704
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:35,279
something special then I started growing

1705
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:37,759
all these like no no uh I'm not no shade

1706
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:41,000
on anybody but like a lot of these like

1707
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:42,759
uh you know us and California and like

1708
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,319
these popular breeders I was Finding on

1709
01:09:42,759 --> 01:09:46,000
Instagram and stuff like that like I

1710
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:48,319
said i' had been out of this for a while

1711
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,759
so I didn't know who was who or you know

1712
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:53,080
like 2020 or so that you're getting back

1713
01:09:50,759 --> 01:09:56,000
into it yeah yeah that I got back to

1714
01:09:53,079 --> 01:09:58,279
Colorado and got back into it um

1715
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:01,039
yeah like back in the day it was you

1716
01:09:58,279 --> 01:10:03,198
know greenhouse and Barney and Dutch

1717
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:05,560
Passion and I think you know there were

1718
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:07,158
like all the UK and Amsterdam and like

1719
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:08,560
those were all the names and now as so I

1720
01:10:07,158 --> 01:10:10,319
get back and I kind of start looking

1721
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:12,000
around and there's all these like new

1722
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:14,319
ones and it's all so hyped up so I

1723
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,719
started spending a lot of money on a lot

1724
01:10:14,319 --> 01:10:18,759
of these seeds

1725
01:10:15,719 --> 01:10:20,239
and started I mean I'm not going to name

1726
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:23,520
any names but it just started becoming

1727
01:10:20,238 --> 01:10:29,359
this like you know aggressive mutations

1728
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:30,000
and like Herm issues and like crazy like

1729
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:33,319
this

1730
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,760
one is like barely yielding anything and

1731
01:10:33,319 --> 01:10:36,920
like I was just like what the hell is

1732
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:38,440
going on here like this is and it wasn't

1733
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:42,039
across the board you know I grew some

1734
01:10:38,439 --> 01:10:44,359
stuff that was fantastic from us popular

1735
01:10:42,039 --> 01:10:46,679
breeders but so I kind of was like screw

1736
01:10:44,359 --> 01:10:49,279
it I started ordering seeds again from

1737
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:50,960
from the UK and and and from Amsterdam

1738
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:52,800
and kind of went back like hoping maybe

1739
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,719
they still have some of those old lines

1740
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,920
that I loved from way back in the day

1741
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:58,960
and

1742
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:01,158
um and and and some locals here too so

1743
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:04,880
so the first breeding project I ever did

1744
01:11:01,158 --> 01:11:08,439
was a local breeder uh this is Colorado

1745
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:10,600
seed ink who is now or well they still

1746
01:11:08,439 --> 01:11:13,119
exist but split off uh this Scots say

1747
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:15,400
I'm up in bowler is Free World genetics

1748
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:17,039
um project he worked on they call it

1749
01:11:15,399 --> 01:11:19,559
hibiscus Sunrise it's from like some

1750
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:21,760
Hawaiian sativa anyways I got long story

1751
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:23,920
short I got a maale in the seeds that

1752
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:26,280
was like I couldn't throw it away I was

1753
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:29,239
just like this is

1754
01:11:26,279 --> 01:11:31,639
a a monster it just was like outgrowing

1755
01:11:29,238 --> 01:11:33,039
everything and super strong looking back

1756
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:35,239
on it now that I know a little bit more

1757
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:39,000
than I know about breeding it probably

1758
01:11:35,238 --> 01:11:40,399
wasn't the best male ever because like a

1759
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,439
lot of times plants that put a lot of

1760
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:43,839
effort into like fiber production or

1761
01:11:42,439 --> 01:11:46,638
like hemp production like stock

1762
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:48,760
production aren't necessarily like

1763
01:11:46,639 --> 01:11:50,520
putting that that effort that they could

1764
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:52,920
be putting into flower is going into

1765
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:55,760
like you know building the frame or

1766
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:57,039
building like fibers so looking back it

1767
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,520
might not have been the best thing ever

1768
01:11:57,039 --> 01:12:00,439
but at the time I was like blown away

1769
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:02,120
it's it ended up being a good project

1770
01:12:00,439 --> 01:12:05,799
for some and and not for others but I

1771
01:12:02,119 --> 01:12:09,599
bred that to a uh a batch of like nine

1772
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:11,199
plants and uh tested one it didn't test

1773
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,679
well and I was like damn dude this

1774
01:12:11,198 --> 01:12:14,919
breeding things harder than I thought so

1775
01:12:12,679 --> 01:12:15,960
like I didn't release my first one first

1776
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:17,840
one that I thought I was going to

1777
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:19,639
release I was like I can't put my name

1778
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:21,800
on that and then I tested the next one

1779
01:12:19,639 --> 01:12:23,719
and it was that hibiscus Sunrise male

1780
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:25,679
pollinated to

1781
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:29,158
uh uh

1782
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:31,039
Dosey Do and it's it's a super cool

1783
01:12:29,158 --> 01:12:32,399
Plant it's it's on my site it's called

1784
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:34,679
Uh Island time that's the first one that

1785
01:12:32,399 --> 01:12:37,638
I ever put out it like you get these

1786
01:12:34,679 --> 01:12:39,480
like 17-inch Spears and they're like

1787
01:12:37,639 --> 01:12:43,119
crazy RS to colors and it's got this

1788
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:45,638
really pungent like tropical fruit nose

1789
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:47,198
to it it came out really good um and it

1790
01:12:45,639 --> 01:12:48,920
grows like it's a super strong

1791
01:12:47,198 --> 01:12:51,479
aggressive grower a lot of people have

1792
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:52,880
trouble like keeping up with it so I get

1793
01:12:51,479 --> 01:12:54,879
a lot of feedback that people are like

1794
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:57,079
man it's fading by like day 40 cuz I

1795
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,560
like can't keep up with this thing so it

1796
01:12:57,079 --> 01:13:00,840
is a little bit tricky or more

1797
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:03,159
challenging to grow but it's a super

1798
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:05,760
cool Plant um so that kind of kicked off

1799
01:13:03,158 --> 01:13:07,119
the whole and that the rest is history

1800
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:10,000
as I say like that was the first time I

1801
01:13:07,119 --> 01:13:12,880
made seeds and then I was just like wait

1802
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,800
a minute like I really like this plant

1803
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,159
like what if what would it be like if I

1804
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:19,400
combin it with this plant and then it

1805
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:21,439
just went from there but so the first

1806
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:22,519
two years or so of breeding was just a

1807
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:25,719
lot of

1808
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:27,639
like things I like combined to other

1809
01:13:25,719 --> 01:13:29,158
things I like right like like this is

1810
01:13:27,639 --> 01:13:31,000
something cool like what is it is it

1811
01:13:29,158 --> 01:13:33,319
going to be cooler if it combines with

1812
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:36,359
this and the answer is not always yes I

1813
01:13:33,319 --> 01:13:38,319
have projects where I'm like I combined

1814
01:13:36,359 --> 01:13:40,920
two things and it came out fine like the

1815
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:42,519
result but it wasn't better than the

1816
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:44,279
parents so you're like what's I'm not

1817
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:46,760
going to sell these seeds like who cares

1818
01:13:44,279 --> 01:13:49,960
you can go like I combine calculators

1819
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:52,639
goat gas with some some other plant

1820
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:54,079
and I I didn't throw the seeds away

1821
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:55,199
they're in my fridge or something but I

1822
01:13:54,079 --> 01:13:57,039
was like I don't want to sell these it's

1823
01:13:55,198 --> 01:14:00,158
like just go to culator the goat gas is

1824
01:13:57,039 --> 01:14:02,479
better than this thing I made like it's

1825
01:14:00,158 --> 01:14:04,920
it's fine it's good but it didn't like

1826
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:06,439
make something new and interesting so

1827
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:08,039
that was a lot of the beginning was just

1828
01:14:06,439 --> 01:14:09,638
like trying to like see if two things

1829
01:14:08,039 --> 01:14:12,920
combined to make something better than

1830
01:14:09,639 --> 01:14:14,480
the The Originals and then if you follow

1831
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:17,158
me if you've been following me for like

1832
01:14:14,479 --> 01:14:19,959
the last two years I found a lavender

1833
01:14:17,158 --> 01:14:23,039
plant that like completely took over my

1834
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:25,439
like it it's like I found like the the

1835
01:14:23,039 --> 01:14:29,359
thing that I'm like okay like this is

1836
01:14:25,439 --> 01:14:31,359
truly unique it checks almost every box

1837
01:14:29,359 --> 01:14:33,319
as a mother like the plant I have that I

1838
01:14:31,359 --> 01:14:36,198
do all the breeding with does everything

1839
01:14:33,319 --> 01:14:39,599
perfectly except it veg is a little bit

1840
01:14:36,198 --> 01:14:42,079
slow and it growth patterns are a little

1841
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:45,280
irregular like you don't get this like

1842
01:14:42,079 --> 01:14:48,079
uniform Crown out of it it's kind of

1843
01:14:45,279 --> 01:14:51,519
weird but other than that man it yields

1844
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:55,880
well it's dripping with these like

1845
01:14:51,520 --> 01:15:00,199
floral beautiful Tarin like not

1846
01:14:55,880 --> 01:15:02,279
spicy just like straight up flowers I

1847
01:15:00,198 --> 01:15:06,198
don't even know have you got it tested

1848
01:15:02,279 --> 01:15:07,559
before um yeah I got it tested and I

1849
01:15:06,198 --> 01:15:10,000
need to do it again because I got it

1850
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:12,080
tested and they like messed up the test

1851
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,000
of course they like called me and I'm

1852
01:15:12,079 --> 01:15:16,679
like what's going on it was supposed to

1853
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:19,000
be like a 48 hour turnaround and then

1854
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:20,960
they were like we had to send it to our

1855
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,479
other lab our machines broken and blah

1856
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:25,520
blah blah and it eventually came back

1857
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:28,759
and it didn't the the results came back

1858
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:32,040
with like nothing

1859
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:34,520
uh nothing interesting really like like

1860
01:15:32,039 --> 01:15:37,158
like a very like run-ofthe-mill tpine

1861
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:38,360
report like where I was like expecting

1862
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:39,759
something you know like there's some

1863
01:15:38,359 --> 01:15:41,719
magic here I've never smelled anything

1864
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:43,960
like this everybody that I give it to

1865
01:15:41,719 --> 01:15:46,239
nobody's ever smelled anything like this

1866
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:48,480
it's not even like other lavenders that

1867
01:15:46,238 --> 01:15:51,519
I smelled and yeah the report came back

1868
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:54,279
and it was like not telling of any kind

1869
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:56,000
of fun story um so I need to like run

1870
01:15:54,279 --> 01:15:58,238
another batch get it tested by another

1871
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,719
lab so cuz I don't now I don't really

1872
01:15:58,238 --> 01:16:03,000
trust their they kind of messed with me

1873
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:05,560
but and and uh did you find that

1874
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,359
lavender and a pack of seeds yeah so I

1875
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:10,120
bought a this was totally by accident I

1876
01:16:08,359 --> 01:16:11,920
had never even heard well I heard of

1877
01:16:10,119 --> 01:16:15,000
lavender because I knew s's story and I

1878
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:17,119
knew like he was a legend and so on and

1879
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:22,359
so forth but I was really excited to

1880
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:26,198
grow um La uh is it laughing Buddha by

1881

so I had I had sampled that here at a

1883
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:31,679
dispensary many years ago and loved it

1884
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,239
and then I was like you know what like

1885

come out good at all um it it was okay

1917
01:17:46,439 --> 01:17:51,519
but it was nothing special and then the

1918
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:54,000
two lavenders that I finished um one was

1919
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:55,880
okay it's like a lavender like musk kind

1920
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,600
of smell like Musk

1921
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:59,279
um I ended up keeping that for a while

1922
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,920
lavender one and got rid of it this is

1923
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:03,920
lavender 3 that I do all my breeding

1924
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:05,960
with it's just like it's unbelievable I

1925
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:08,440
like don't know I want everybody to try

1926
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:11,439
it um but I don't know how to accomplish

1927
01:18:08,439 --> 01:18:14,079
that without like letting that cut go

1928
01:18:11,439 --> 01:18:15,638
which not not quite ready it's just like

1929
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:18,198
Catch 22 it's like I want you all to

1930
01:18:15,639 --> 01:18:19,719
have this but like I don't want anybody

1931
01:18:18,198 --> 01:18:21,439
to have this cuz it's the only Secret

1932
01:18:19,719 --> 01:18:24,359
Sauce that I have or it's like my you

1933
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:25,960
know most special feno that I hold um

1934
01:18:24,359 --> 01:18:28,319
like until find something that beats it

1935
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:30,439
out then you'll you'll won't be such a

1936
01:18:28,319 --> 01:18:32,559
it won't be your baby anymore it's

1937
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:34,198
comingo it's starting to come close like

1938
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,159
some of it some of the seeds that it's

1939
01:18:34,198 --> 01:18:39,279
making are coming close to me being like

1940
01:18:36,158 --> 01:18:41,319
okay I'm comfortable letting that out

1941
01:18:39,279 --> 01:18:44,800
now because I'm seeing expressions in

1942
01:18:41,319 --> 01:18:46,559
the seeds that are either better or

1943
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,079
close enough or whatever like the one

1944
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:52,440
plan I've been posting about lately the

1945
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:55,439
black Lavender is like it it it it dug

1946
01:18:52,439 --> 01:18:56,919
up some genetics from the the pupil

1947
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:58,759
because it's a black I Cross My Black

1948
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:00,279
Canyon cush which has great pupil in it

1949
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:01,440
so it kind of had that color that

1950
01:19:00,279 --> 01:19:02,759
pinkish color I don't know if you've

1951
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:05,319
seen some of my videos online I've

1952
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:08,239
posted like the the Hues and stuff come

1953
01:19:05,319 --> 01:19:12,439
from that but it has

1954
01:19:08,238 --> 01:19:14,599
pure um lavender tarpine like it's like

1955
01:19:12,439 --> 01:19:17,039
almost identical like a slight maybe

1956
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:19,840
slightly sweeter but like almost

1957
01:19:17,039 --> 01:19:24,079
identical to the mom so now I have this

1958
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:25,840
like beautiful pink purple red plant it

1959
01:19:24,079 --> 01:19:27,600
the only the only thing it's missing on

1960
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:29,760
it's got a better structure better

1961
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:32,880
growth patterns doesn't require any

1962
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:34,840
support like all of that better um it's

1963
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:37,639
maybe it it's not quite yielding as much

1964
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:40,079
as the as the the main lab that I use

1965
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:41,440
for all of this but but if you follow me

1966
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:43,279
like and look on my website you're gonna

1967
01:19:41,439 --> 01:19:46,238
be like dude everything is got Lavender

1968
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:48,000
in the name and like I started uh I I

1969
01:19:46,238 --> 01:19:49,638
released chapter one and chapter two of

1970
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:53,119
my lavender project and I'm about to

1971
01:19:49,639 --> 01:19:55,400
release chapter 3 in a two months or so

1972
01:19:53,119 --> 01:19:57,319
um I just

1973
01:19:55,399 --> 01:19:59,839
started saying to myself like this is

1974
01:19:57,319 --> 01:20:01,479
something I haven't seen in other seeds

1975
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:04,159
it's totally different like this cut

1976
01:20:01,479 --> 01:20:06,079
that I have and I've hunted many other

1977
01:20:04,158 --> 01:20:08,960
lavender seeds too and haven't found

1978
01:20:06,079 --> 01:20:10,800
this like I I I'm hunting lavender right

1979
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:13,800
now literally in this hunt I have two

1980
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:15,960
more from directly from s seeds and

1981
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:18,800
they're totally different they're like

1982
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:20,920
so I don't know if that anniversary pack

1983
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:22,360
that I bought was some like vintage you

1984
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:23,600
know I don't know when he released it I

1985
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:25,238
should probably message him and ask him

1986
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:29,159
when that was from if it was from a

1987
01:20:25,238 --> 01:20:31,079
different parent um I can't find more of

1988
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:34,279
those multi packs online at all they're

1989
01:20:31,079 --> 01:20:36,158
completely gone I can't find anymore and

1990
01:20:34,279 --> 01:20:38,000
But but so now I'm buying I have another

1991
01:20:36,158 --> 01:20:39,559
new pack I just got of his recent

1992
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,840
lavender I keep thinking to myself like

1993
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:43,480
okay I'll keep you know maybe there's

1994
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:45,880
something close to this or similar to

1995
01:20:43,479 --> 01:20:48,959
this in in in more of these seeds I

1996
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:50,960
found nothing like it um so yeah I

1997
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:53,000
started Crossing it to everything and

1998
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:55,399
and and trying to kind of bring those

1999
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,840
flavors to people and it's been working

2000
01:20:55,399 --> 01:20:58,960
I mean I get messages all the time that

2001
01:20:56,840 --> 01:21:01,400
are like this didn't even smell like

2002
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:05,079
cannabis like it smells like you know

2003
01:21:01,399 --> 01:21:07,079
flowers or soap or perfume or um you

2004
01:21:05,079 --> 01:21:09,479
know like floral incense kind of which

2005
01:21:07,079 --> 01:21:11,359
some people absolutely hate by the way

2006
01:21:09,479 --> 01:21:13,399
like I have people that reach out to me

2007
01:21:11,359 --> 01:21:16,238
and are like what you're doing sucks and

2008
01:21:13,399 --> 01:21:18,119
you're stupid and I hate I hate it and

2009
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:20,479
I'm like yeah well you know like at

2010
01:21:18,119 --> 01:21:22,079
least I'm not doing the same thing as

2011
01:21:20,479 --> 01:21:24,079
everybody else is because it seems that

2012
01:21:22,079 --> 01:21:26,279
like most people are doing the same [ __ ]

2013
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:28,039
it's like you know buy a hype cut and

2014
01:21:26,279 --> 01:21:31,039
reverse it to a bunch of other hype Cuts

2015
01:21:28,039 --> 01:21:33,279
I don't even you know because I I'm I'm

2016
01:21:31,039 --> 01:21:36,399
not sure if it's the same lavender but

2017
01:21:33,279 --> 01:21:40,639
um I always remember back in

2018
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:43,439
like uh like 2008 9 10 uh at some of the

2019
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:46,159
dispensaries in the Bay Area uh there

2020
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:49,638
was lavender and it was coming down from

2021
01:21:46,158 --> 01:21:51,960
uh mad farmer up in uh Mendo and I'm not

2022
01:21:49,639 --> 01:21:53,760
sure if it's the same lavender um cuz

2023
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:57,119
then he had a bunch of lavender crosses

2024
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:59,280
that were like pretty pretty well known

2025
01:21:57,119 --> 01:22:00,559
um yeah people reach out to me all the

2026
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:01,719
time about this and I've researched a

2027
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,960
bunch of the other breeders that have

2028
01:22:01,719 --> 01:22:06,039
worked with it and stuff and I think

2029
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:08,198
that that era you're talking about is

2030
01:22:06,039 --> 01:22:10,800
when most people know of it from like

2031
01:22:08,198 --> 01:22:13,000
the 2010ish range people will be like oh

2032
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:14,840
I haven't seen it since 2011 or whatever

2033
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:17,158
and so I think there was a minute where

2034
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:20,600
it was around um from what I've gathered

2035
01:22:17,158 --> 01:22:24,238
through my research that lavender was

2036
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:28,000
spicier um it was spicy for sure yeah

2037
01:22:24,238 --> 01:22:30,519
mine not at all wow like and I have

2038
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:33,158
lavenders literally right now growing

2039
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:35,320
that are spicy and floral and I like get

2040
01:22:33,158 --> 01:22:39,599
it they're kind of like mentholated like

2041
01:22:35,319 --> 01:22:41,359
yeah um this is not in any way it seems

2042
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:43,000
completely unrelated to be honest with

2043
01:22:41,359 --> 01:22:45,079
you we we would always compare it to

2044
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,198
like meno PS because we'd say that it

2045
01:22:45,079 --> 01:22:49,679
like had a lot of that like that purple

2046
01:22:47,198 --> 01:22:50,960
flavor uh like yeah whether or not

2047
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:53,239
that's even a thing it was like just

2048
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:55,840
like the methyl anthranol uh of the

2049
01:22:53,238 --> 01:22:57,479
grapes or the the cins or whatever it

2050
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:59,719
was it just like came through as this

2051
01:22:57,479 --> 01:23:02,319
like very distinctive flavor and so it

2052
01:22:59,719 --> 01:23:06,158
was like a very spicy floral but with

2053
01:23:02,319 --> 01:23:09,158
that heavy purple tinge to it yeah this

2054
01:23:06,158 --> 01:23:11,479
uh is like its own thing and I'm not

2055
01:23:09,158 --> 01:23:14,759
just trying to like sell it or sound

2056
01:23:11,479 --> 01:23:17,000
sound cool or whatever but it's like

2057
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:20,400
it

2058
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:23,639
I it the it tastes like it smells and it

2059
01:23:20,399 --> 01:23:25,158
makes the room smell like it smells and

2060
01:23:23,639 --> 01:23:27,239
it's extremely pungent when you're

2061
01:23:25,158 --> 01:23:29,238
growing it like like most florals kind

2062
01:23:27,238 --> 01:23:31,959
of like wouldn't take over a room you

2063
01:23:29,238 --> 01:23:34,759
know you'd expect like a cam or a a

2064
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:38,079
diesel or a you know train wack to take

2065
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:40,880
over a room smell wise but sure this

2066
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:43,719
floral can like take over and dominate

2067
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:44,960
other smells it's it's such a unique

2068
01:23:43,719 --> 01:23:46,760
experience it's so different than

2069
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:48,000
everything else with it being that loud

2070
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:49,639
it makes me think of something like a

2071
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,158
really good Jack herrer or something

2072
01:23:49,639 --> 01:23:53,520
just where it's like really floral but

2073
01:23:51,158 --> 01:23:55,079
just also like you know really really

2074
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,400
loud in the rage like you're going to

2075
01:23:55,079 --> 01:23:59,559
smell it you're going to know exactly

2076
01:23:56,399 --> 01:24:01,439
what it is yep yep it's I've grown Jack

2077
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:03,639
a few times I mean I don't you can't

2078
01:24:01,439 --> 01:24:06,919
attest to like if it was the Jack or

2079
01:24:03,639 --> 01:24:08,800
like you know how true Jack yeah I've

2080
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:12,880
grown a jack I've grown Jack seeds

2081
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:16,199
before um and it's it's not I I don't

2082
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:18,359
know what to compare it to like I uh

2083
01:24:16,198 --> 01:24:20,839
yeah like I've given I I I've given

2084
01:24:18,359 --> 01:24:23,880
samples to some people and given samples

2085
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:27,639
to uh my stepdad who who smokes because

2086
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:30,880
he has mess and uh my mom absolutely

2087
01:24:27,639 --> 01:24:32,920
hates the smell of of smoke right like

2088
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:34,679
she hates the smell so she's always

2089
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:36,239
spraying the room down and opening the

2090
01:24:34,679 --> 01:24:38,679
windows and stuff like that and she

2091
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:41,638
calls me the one day and she's like

2092
01:24:38,679 --> 01:24:43,319
she's like she like don't tell Tim but

2093
01:24:41,639 --> 01:24:46,359
that that lavender stuff that you sent

2094
01:24:43,319 --> 01:24:48,840
him I love the smell of like like the

2095
01:24:46,359 --> 01:24:50,839
burnt smell of it in the in the room and

2096
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:51,960
she she was like don't tell him because

2097
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:54,719
like I don't want him smoking in the

2098
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:56,279
house but like it's it's that different

2099
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:58,039
it's like that different it doesn't

2100
01:24:56,279 --> 01:25:00,118
remind you of cannabis it's bizarre for

2101
01:24:58,039 --> 01:25:03,238
sure I mean if it's actually got a lot

2102
01:25:00,118 --> 01:25:06,000
of the lonol in it and uh and it's being

2103
01:25:03,238 --> 01:25:09,559
burnt then like I think of like the uh

2104
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:12,880
you know the bundled uh lavender um or

2105
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:15,719
even like Sage um bundles that people

2106
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:19,920
will light on fire and burn and and uh

2107
01:25:15,719 --> 01:25:22,319
in in specific uh ways and yep like

2108
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:26,560
there's probably some Nostalgia there to

2109
01:25:22,319 --> 01:25:28,238
me the smell is so you know that like

2110
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:31,600
carpet powder you can sprinkle out and

2111
01:25:28,238 --> 01:25:34,759
then vacuum up if you had

2112
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:36,679
a uh like a like Armen Hammer like

2113
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:38,159
baking powder and they they flavor it or

2114
01:25:36,679 --> 01:25:39,239
scent it you know and then you vacuum it

2115
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:41,118
up and the whole room smells good and

2116
01:25:39,238 --> 01:25:43,359
your carpet smells good yeah if you had

2117
01:25:41,118 --> 01:25:44,559
if you had like a floral one of those

2118
01:25:43,359 --> 01:25:46,719
that's kind of what it smells like some

2119
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:48,840
people say it smells like like like

2120
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:52,399
floral incense but it and it kind of

2121
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:55,560
does um but yeah it's like a totally

2122
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:58,198
different thing so yeah I've

2123
01:25:55,560 --> 01:26:00,719
the first breeding project I did with it

2124
01:25:58,198 --> 01:26:02,960
I outcrossed it to Max stomper which

2125
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:06,319
took a while to find a good Max stomper

2126
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:07,639
breeder because that line has really

2127
01:26:06,319 --> 01:26:09,559
it's not a

2128
01:26:07,639 --> 01:26:11,920
great I want to say it's not a great

2129
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:13,800
line it's just like not a strong line it

2130
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:15,199
it uh the plants are finicky but the

2131
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:17,760
flower at the end is like really

2132
01:26:15,198 --> 01:26:19,919
beautiful so they're like not strong

2133
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:23,360
plants so I finally found like a strong

2134
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:25,118
male um and made a line I released a

2135
01:26:23,359 --> 01:26:26,920
handful of things from male but one of

2136
01:26:25,118 --> 01:26:29,279
them was Flawless lavender

2137
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:30,800
which became like probably my

2138
01:26:29,279 --> 01:26:32,519
bestselling or one of my bestselling

2139
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,920
things and I kind of wish I wouldn't

2140
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,199
have named it that I named it that at

2141
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,039
the time because I was so obsessed with

2142
01:26:35,198 --> 01:26:38,599
this damn plant that I found that I when

2143
01:26:37,039 --> 01:26:39,679
I made that cross I named it Flawless

2144
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:41,719
lavender and I was like wait I don't

2145
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:43,000
even I haven't even tested these yet I

2146
01:26:41,719 --> 01:26:44,920
don't even know if these are good and

2147
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,880
like now now I've tested them they are

2148
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:48,440
good and it's like I I attached this

2149
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:50,000
name Flawless to it and I was hoping

2150
01:26:48,439 --> 01:26:52,638
that I didn't like make a you know come

2151
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:55,399
out looking like an idiot but um so

2152
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:58,800
anyways that flawless I I hunted through

2153
01:26:55,399 --> 01:27:02,879
a ton of and found a maale that smelled

2154
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:04,800
exactly like the lavender that I like

2155
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,880
that that was the mom to it and it had

2156
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:08,480
the same kind of leaf structure it had a

2157
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:11,400
better frame to it like a little better

2158
01:27:08,479 --> 01:27:14,000
build and that's what I pollinated all

2159
01:27:11,399 --> 01:27:17,519
of chapter one with

2160
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:19,079
and it's been amazing like everything

2161
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:22,760
I'm finding in that and people are

2162
01:27:19,079 --> 01:27:24,800
reporting back are getting um very

2163
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:26,600
strong lavender expr Impressions it's

2164
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:28,679
almost as if I used a lavender maale

2165
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:30,480
which was the goal right like it it

2166
01:27:28,679 --> 01:27:33,118
wasn't a pure lavender but I tried to

2167
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:36,118
find like the most lavender that I could

2168
01:27:33,118 --> 01:27:37,719
out of that cross and so I I Bax that to

2169
01:27:36,118 --> 01:27:40,158
the lavender and the Expressions that

2170
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:44,000
are coming out of that are like very

2171
01:27:40,158 --> 01:27:46,359
very very much like my like my main one

2172
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:49,198
um and then some of the other ones I did

2173
01:27:46,359 --> 01:27:50,799
in that line um you know they're f1s so

2174
01:27:49,198 --> 01:27:52,839
you'll have variety right like you

2175
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:54,480
you're going to have variety um across

2176
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:57,319
the both you know from both sides of the

2177
01:27:54,479 --> 01:27:59,279
parents but there seems to be pretty

2178
01:27:57,319 --> 01:28:02,079
dominant floral and

2179
01:27:59,279 --> 01:28:03,840
lavender in those plants coming through

2180
01:28:02,079 --> 01:28:06,719
and then the second the second chapter

2181
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:09,319
was with Caramelo which is uh a

2182
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:12,319
different breeders version of lavender

2183
01:28:09,319 --> 01:28:14,359
um and so that's all lavender lavender

2184
01:28:12,319 --> 01:28:17,198
as well it's slightly different and then

2185
01:28:14,359 --> 01:28:19,559
now for chapter 3 I reversed I reversed

2186
01:28:17,198 --> 01:28:22,198
the uh the main plant it successfully

2187
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:25,039
reversed so first time ever I'm going to

2188
01:28:22,198 --> 01:28:28,919
be releasing femin seeds um cool so I'll

2189
01:28:25,039 --> 01:28:35,079
have lavender S1 lavender times uh

2190
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:39,239
Violeta which is a seeds it's like a pck

2191
01:28:35,079 --> 01:28:41,039
times purple maloi um and then I did use

2192
01:28:39,238 --> 01:28:42,439
some other outside cuts for this one I

2193
01:28:41,039 --> 01:28:45,359
don't usually do that occasionally I'll

2194
01:28:42,439 --> 01:28:47,399
throw one in there but uh like last year

2195
01:28:45,359 --> 01:28:49,319
the year last year I think at the at the

2196
01:28:47,399 --> 01:28:52,118
seed event and Denver I was chatting

2197
01:28:49,319 --> 01:28:57,679
with capulator and he had a jar of uh

2198
01:28:52,118 --> 01:28:59,479
Pine so it's like a 's uh what gooi feno

2199
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:02,079
that he found that smells just like the

2200
01:28:59,479 --> 01:29:03,879
pine Sal cleaner and I was just like

2201
01:29:02,079 --> 01:29:07,399
holy [ __ ] I would love to cross that to

2202
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:10,560
my lavender so um capulator sent me that

2203
01:29:07,399 --> 01:29:12,479
cut and I pollinated that and then one

2204
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:14,440
of the dispensaries here in town has

2205
01:29:12,479 --> 01:29:17,959
like a Golden Goat cut that they use for

2206
01:29:14,439 --> 01:29:19,759
everything and they just made like he's

2207
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:21,760
he's he's a good dude he he shares Cuts

2208
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:23,239
with me I share Cuts with him but um he

2209
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:25,400
just made a new version of it he crossed

2210
01:29:23,238 --> 01:29:27,799
it to like cookies and cream and uh so

2211
01:29:25,399 --> 01:29:30,439
he calls it golden cookies so I have

2212
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:34,560
those and

2213
01:29:30,439 --> 01:29:36,839
then uh zombie Kush I hunted some zombie

2214
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:39,080
cush from Ripper seeds and pollenated

2215
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:41,039
that so I think I have five crosses this

2216
01:29:39,079 --> 01:29:44,519
round that are all coming out as fem

2217

01:30:28,479 --> 01:30:32,919
know a lot of interaction with hom

2237
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:36,439
Growers um what would you like to see

2238
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:38,399
sort of change uh as the the next few

2239
01:30:36,439 --> 01:30:40,638
years roll on when it comes to the

2240
01:30:38,399 --> 01:30:42,839
Cannabis Community or industry as a

2241
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:46,079
whole geez there's a whole bunch of

2242
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:48,319
stuff I mean I I uh I think there's a

2243
01:30:46,079 --> 01:30:51,800
lot of us like that are have gray in our

2244
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:55,079
beard that are kind of like missing the

2245
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:57,520
the loud from back in the day for back

2246
01:30:55,079 --> 01:30:59,319
lack of a better term like there's the

2247
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:02,760
the the like aggressive inbreeding and

2248
01:30:59,319 --> 01:31:05,279
the push to high high uh THC contents

2249
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:08,159
has like something's been lost it's

2250
01:31:05,279 --> 01:31:10,279
almost like the plant can only put so

2251
01:31:08,158 --> 01:31:12,519
much effort into one thing right so if

2252
01:31:10,279 --> 01:31:16,000
you're like breeding for high THC and

2253
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:19,320
breeding and not just high THC like the

2254
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:22,679
that is the main goal of most of that

2255
01:31:19,319 --> 01:31:25,079
large scale uh mainstream breeding has

2256
01:31:22,679 --> 01:31:28,000
been um

2257
01:31:25,079 --> 01:31:31,679
high yields and high THC right so like

2258
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:33,719
we want good good mass and and and high

2259
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:36,158
THC and it's

2260
01:31:33,719 --> 01:31:38,000
like then and then people are buying

2261
01:31:36,158 --> 01:31:39,799
Things based off of marketing right like

2262
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,960
they they find a feno that works for

2263
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:44,400
that right like it has the purple Hues

2264
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:47,079
it yields well it's got a high te it

2265
01:31:44,399 --> 01:31:48,638
gets you super you know crosseyed and

2266
01:31:47,079 --> 01:31:50,319
and then they Market the [ __ ] out of it

2267
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:54,600
and then everybody's like oh my God I

2268
01:31:50,319 --> 01:31:56,519
need that like I I need the the the

2269
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:57,880
purple candy gas the Gary Payton or

2270
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:59,280
whatever yeah the purple candy gas and

2271
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:00,600
I'm not talking [ __ ] on Gary Payton I I

2272
01:31:59,279 --> 01:32:02,399
don't even know if I've ever smoked real

2273
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:03,840
Gary Payton before but I just pulled

2274
01:32:02,399 --> 01:32:05,519
down a room with Gary pton and it was

2275
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,800
beautiful but I was gonna say it's

2276
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,159
that's probably like the wrong one to

2277
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:10,560
pick because that's probably like really

2278
01:32:08,158 --> 01:32:11,960
good um no but it's all you know it

2279
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:14,080
depends on who's growing it and when you

2280
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:15,880
get like one of those like runs let's

2281
01:32:14,079 --> 01:32:17,880
say out to where you know there's you

2282
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:19,960
know I don't know maybe a hundred

2283
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:23,880
different facilities in each legal State

2284
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:25,960
growing it um it's it you know it just

2285
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:28,118
at Ates the market and then you get

2286
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:30,920
something that's a bad example of it and

2287
01:32:28,118 --> 01:32:33,679
turns you off to the whole thing yeah

2288
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:38,560
well it's like the those strains from

2289
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:41,199
the early 2000s into the 2010s and stuff

2290
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:43,760
um back in the day like stuff had to get

2291
01:32:41,198 --> 01:32:45,559
popular because it was good right like

2292
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:48,840
like like everyone asked for it it was

2293
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:52,520
like okay like every two

2294
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:53,679
weeks you get a new bag and it's

2295
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:55,440
something different it's whatever's come

2296
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:58,880
through through the pipeline you know

2297
01:32:55,439 --> 01:33:01,599
like and then eventually something hits

2298
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:03,600
and the whole state is asking for it or

2299
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:06,440
like the whole area that got that b or

2300
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:08,079
that batch is like where is that where

2301
01:33:06,439 --> 01:33:10,079
is more of that how do I get more of

2302
01:33:08,079 --> 01:33:12,279
that and that's what drove what was

2303
01:33:10,079 --> 01:33:13,880
grown right like it's like oh wait

2304
01:33:12,279 --> 01:33:16,359
there's a huge demand for this therefore

2305
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:19,480
I can move all of it instantly at a

2306
01:33:16,359 --> 01:33:20,960
higher price so I mean you I I've seen a

2307
01:33:19,479 --> 01:33:22,279
bunch of the podcast you hear Gabby and

2308
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:24,480
them and and other folks that were in

2309
01:33:22,279 --> 01:33:26,679
the New York area during the days

2310
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:29,238
talking about that it just became like

2311
01:33:26,679 --> 01:33:30,520
if you had it you could name everyone

2312
01:33:29,238 --> 01:33:32,279
wanted it everyone wanted it you could

2313
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:34,840
move as much as you want name whatever

2314
01:33:32,279 --> 01:33:36,359
number you wanted um so that's how

2315
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:40,079
that's how things were chosen back in

2316
01:33:36,359 --> 01:33:41,880
the day was like it had to win a against

2317
01:33:40,079 --> 01:33:44,000
everything else that was put out there

2318
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:47,600
and now it's winning through marketing

2319
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:51,520
and IT being marketed because it does

2320
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:54,239
well in a large facility the stuff the

2321
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:56,520
stuff that's the best in your

2322
01:33:54,238 --> 01:33:58,000
joints is not the stuff that's not the

2323
01:33:56,520 --> 01:34:01,199
same stuff that's going to do best in

2324
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:02,920
the commercial facility unfortunately

2325
01:34:01,198 --> 01:34:04,399
like you can sometimes you can hit it

2326
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:05,920
just right where you get all check you

2327
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:08,559
know you get all of that check all the

2328
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:11,118
commercial boxes and you still get an

2329
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:13,600
enjoyable experience yeah there are some

2330
01:34:11,118 --> 01:34:16,198
of course like like let's say 10% of the

2331
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:18,079
cultivars on the market are are have

2332
01:34:16,198 --> 01:34:20,039
that potential in them right you you

2333
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:21,559
still have to then rotate you know

2334
01:34:20,039 --> 01:34:23,000
through a bunch more strains just

2335
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:24,560
because of the demand and and making

2336
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,560
sure that the Shel are filled with a

2337
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:28,400
variety so and if you want to have

2338
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:31,800
enough of a market share you got to have

2339
01:34:28,399 --> 01:34:33,599
you know uh you know four or five things

2340
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:36,000
on deck at any given time just to make

2341
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:38,440
sure that you meet that buyer's demands

2342
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:41,399
because they have to fill that slot of

2343
01:34:38,439 --> 01:34:46,000
whether it be candy or green or Jack or

2344
01:34:41,399 --> 01:34:49,039
floral you know and it's uh it's rough

2345
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:50,679
yeah so I think like that's one thing I

2346
01:34:49,039 --> 01:34:52,198
would love to see change it's I don't

2347
01:34:50,679 --> 01:34:56,399
think it's going to I don't really have

2348
01:34:52,198 --> 01:34:58,839
a lot of stock in that shift happening

2349
01:34:56,399 --> 01:35:00,399
because the way that the the way that

2350
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:02,159
the market is structured now doesn't

2351
01:35:00,399 --> 01:35:03,920
really allow for the customer to tell

2352
01:35:02,158 --> 01:35:07,559
you what they want um they think they

2353
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:10,440
are right like they're like I I I'm not

2354
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:12,039
trying to talk like they don't know like

2355
01:35:10,439 --> 01:35:13,839
the customer doesn't know what they're

2356
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:15,198
misdirected looking for yeah exactly

2357
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:17,679
they're they're just like aggressively

2358
01:35:15,198 --> 01:35:19,238
marketed too yeah and it's like okay

2359
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:20,600
like this thing I've seen it everywhere

2360
01:35:19,238 --> 01:35:22,519
I've heard everybody talk about it it's

2361
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:24,119
like well maybe you hav't heard

2362
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:26,360
everybody talk about it you've seen a

2363
01:35:24,118 --> 01:35:28,639
lot of marketing related to it and it's

2364
01:35:26,359 --> 01:35:30,639
been buzzed about because of all this

2365
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:33,000
marketing and it's people spent a lot of

2366
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:36,480
money to get that strain name in your

2367
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:39,238
ear and now you you think you want it

2368
01:35:36,479 --> 01:35:40,799
because it's been everybody talks about

2369
01:35:39,238 --> 01:35:42,238
it and it's like well there was a lot of

2370
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,960
work that went into getting everybody to

2371
01:35:42,238 --> 01:35:46,079
talk about that and there's a reason

2372
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:49,000
that that that's the case I wish it was

2373
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:51,439
just like back to based on good is good

2374
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:54,079
right like like the best wins out

2375
01:35:51,439 --> 01:35:55,479
because that's what people want um sure

2376
01:35:54,079 --> 01:35:57,439
I don't know how that happens I think

2377
01:35:55,479 --> 01:36:00,599
like in a mature Market you know we we

2378
01:35:57,439 --> 01:36:02,238
might see this end up like like beer you

2379
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:04,440
know with the craft Brewers and stuff

2380
01:36:02,238 --> 01:36:06,559
like it might get to that point it's

2381
01:36:04,439 --> 01:36:09,399
it's got to right like like once there's

2382
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:13,639
National legalization and you're going

2383
01:36:09,399 --> 01:36:14,839
to have your micros and your Macros and

2384
01:36:13,639 --> 01:36:16,600
people are going to get to choose you're

2385
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:19,079
going to be able to say like okay I want

2386
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:21,560
the biggest bag I can get for $100 or I

2387
01:36:19,079 --> 01:36:24,600
want the best bag I can get for $100 I

2388
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:26,159
don't care how much weight it is and um

2389
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:29,520
I've always kind of been one of the

2390
01:36:26,158 --> 01:36:31,559
latter I've always been like I I will

2391
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:33,199
pay for the top shelf or I will go out

2392
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:35,639
of my way to grow the top shelf low

2393
01:36:33,198 --> 01:36:38,479
yielding plant because it's special and

2394
01:36:35,639 --> 01:36:41,960
interesting and unique um and I think

2395
01:36:38,479 --> 01:36:44,479
there's a lot of people that that want

2396
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:46,960
that I mean we we have it I don't know

2397
01:36:44,479 --> 01:36:49,118
in your Market um how healthy that is

2398
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:52,319
but we have it here in Colorado I just

2399
01:36:49,118 --> 01:36:54,158
decided to to flower out something that

2400
01:36:52,319 --> 01:36:55,319
I'm going to need to veg for twice the

2401
01:36:54,158 --> 01:36:58,118
time that it's going to take for

2402
01:36:55,319 --> 01:37:01,559
everything else so I'm sacrificing a a

2403
01:36:58,118 --> 01:37:04,238
huge veg space just because I'm like it

2404
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:08,159
it is the most beautiful [ __ ]

2405
01:37:04,238 --> 01:37:11,678
expression of a runs or a candy that

2406
01:37:08,158 --> 01:37:15,039
I've seen in some time it's a um from uh

2407
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:17,118
Blockhead buds it's his uh pave runs or

2408
01:37:15,039 --> 01:37:19,560
a pave runs cut that he hadross to his

2409
01:37:17,118 --> 01:37:22,920
blueberry sugar and it's just like this

2410
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:26,080
frosted out tight nug spiral you know

2411
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:29,199
perfect little ta stacked on each other

2412
01:37:26,079 --> 01:37:30,960
and it just it ripens all uniformly oh

2413
01:37:29,198 --> 01:37:34,279
it's nice I know his blueberry sugar

2414
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:36,600
well um I love that plant too yeah John

2415
01:37:34,279 --> 01:37:40,559
here Farmer John here in Denver grows

2416
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:43,159
that and uh um it's good but pave that

2417
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:45,719
would come from uh from compound Chris

2418
01:37:43,158 --> 01:37:47,238
right or from I think so I think so

2419
01:37:45,719 --> 01:37:49,880
compound put out all the pave stuff

2420
01:37:47,238 --> 01:37:51,359
originally I think um yeah it's I I

2421
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:53,039
think it's just a cut that he has of it

2422
01:37:51,359 --> 01:37:54,319
it might even be a collab between the

2423
01:37:53,039 --> 01:37:56,800
two of them

2424
01:37:54,319 --> 01:37:58,840
okay I honestly am so bad I don't keep

2425
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,679
up with all that I have so much of a

2426
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:02,480
focus more on like the cultivation

2427
01:38:00,679 --> 01:38:04,039
aspect of things where like even that's

2428
01:38:02,479 --> 01:38:06,799
almost impossible to keep up with

2429
01:38:04,039 --> 01:38:08,319
everything it's impossible to keep up on

2430
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:10,039
I mean there's so much going on right

2431
01:38:08,319 --> 01:38:12,840
now it's kind of cool it gives so much

2432
01:38:10,039 --> 01:38:14,760
variety people can choose from and if

2433
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:16,039
you don't like some like I I I don't

2434
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:18,320
understand all the animosity I see

2435
01:38:16,039 --> 01:38:21,158
online people talking smack about

2436
01:38:18,319 --> 01:38:23,238
breeders or Growers or Cuts or whatever

2437
01:38:21,158 --> 01:38:24,118
there's so much anger and it's like

2438
01:38:23,238 --> 01:38:25,879
there

2439
01:38:24,118 --> 01:38:27,439
we have more variety than we've ever had

2440
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:29,359
like 20 years ago like I said I had to

2441
01:38:27,439 --> 01:38:32,238
fill out a form and send it in the mail

2442
01:38:29,359 --> 01:38:33,759
and hope for the best now like dude if

2443
01:38:32,238 --> 01:38:36,799
you if if you don't like what somebody's

2444
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:38,679
doing just like go to there's so much

2445
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:40,639
there's so much variety now we're like

2446
01:38:38,679 --> 01:38:42,039
spoiled even with what you were saying

2447
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:43,880
where you're like you miss certain

2448
01:38:42,039 --> 01:38:46,198
certain varieties it's it's almost like

2449
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:48,039
you had less to choose from perhaps and

2450
01:38:46,198 --> 01:38:50,198
so like when something was good it was

2451
01:38:48,039 --> 01:38:51,679
just gravitated towards or heavily you

2452
01:38:50,198 --> 01:38:53,598
know it might have even been marketing

2453
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:55,520
of the time just because you know like

2454
01:38:53,599 --> 01:38:57,599
you were saying uh only the good stuff

2455
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:59,239
really survived uh what the what the

2456
01:38:57,599 --> 01:39:01,159
people what the market would bear

2457
01:38:59,238 --> 01:39:02,879
basically like what people would be

2458
01:39:01,158 --> 01:39:05,439
buying and so you know the good stuff

2459
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:08,599
the cream Rose to the top so to speak uh

2460
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:11,638
in a much smaller cup uh and now you the

2461
01:39:08,599 --> 01:39:13,039
cup uh overfloweth and so you're like

2462
01:39:11,639 --> 01:39:15,039
you know you're running around from this

2463
01:39:13,039 --> 01:39:17,198
hype to the next hype and hoping to find

2464
01:39:15,039 --> 01:39:18,800
something and it's uh you know there

2465
01:39:17,198 --> 01:39:20,799
it's still out there like the really

2466
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:23,039
good stuff and even sometimes uh

2467
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:25,000
depending on you know if if you want

2468
01:39:23,039 --> 01:39:27,319
more variety there's possibly even more

2469
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:29,719
variety now than there was but you got

2470
01:39:27,319 --> 01:39:32,759
to sort through a lot of

2471
01:39:29,719 --> 01:39:35,079
uh a lot of feno hunts there's a lot

2472
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:38,159
there's a lot and like it kind

2473
01:39:35,079 --> 01:39:39,599
of I think and I I commented on one of

2474
01:39:38,158 --> 01:39:42,479
G's posts a while ago that I think it's

2475
01:39:39,599 --> 01:39:44,440
the end of that era of like like people

2476
01:39:42,479 --> 01:39:46,279
are like oh what's the next big thing

2477
01:39:44,439 --> 01:39:48,759
it's like I don't know I don't know if

2478
01:39:46,279 --> 01:39:51,439
there is a next big thing like I there's

2479
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:55,560
so much now that like how does one thing

2480
01:39:51,439 --> 01:39:58,678
become the next big thing like like mac

2481
01:39:55,560 --> 01:40:00,960
was one of the last big things I think

2482
01:39:58,679 --> 01:40:03,319
in my opinion like there's there's just

2483
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:05,599
so much there now and there's so many

2484
01:40:03,319 --> 01:40:08,639
different like for one thing to rise

2485
01:40:05,599 --> 01:40:11,880
above every you know it was like okay

2486
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:14,520
10 10 12 whatever years ago Gorilla Glue

2487
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:18,520
hit the market and was like on fire it

2488
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:20,360
was like okay gorilla yeah like you need

2489
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:22,400
Gorilla Glue who cares about anything

2490
01:40:20,359 --> 01:40:24,880
else and then you know since that

2491
01:40:22,399 --> 01:40:26,158
through the teens there's been a bunch

2492
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,880
that have or not a bunch but there's

2493
01:40:26,158 --> 01:40:30,679
been a handful like mac and a few that

2494
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:32,920
have like become the next big thing but

2495
01:40:30,679 --> 01:40:34,719
now like what like like yeah there's

2496
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:37,279
popular stuff like I said like Gary pton

2497
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:38,639
or runs or this or that but like those

2498
01:40:37,279 --> 01:40:40,519
none of those seem to be at the top of

2499
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:42,239
the mountain in my opinion like I can't

2500
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:45,320
I can't say that any one of those is

2501
01:40:42,238 --> 01:40:46,598
like the thing to have right now um like

2502
01:40:45,319 --> 01:40:48,158
I feel like you got to have Lemon Cherry

2503
01:40:46,599 --> 01:40:50,039
gelato if you're in a commercial Market

2504
01:40:48,158 --> 01:40:53,759
or at least some form of like that

2505
01:40:50,039 --> 01:40:56,679
extreme purple candy gas

2506
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:58,679
uh which is just you know it it it gets

2507
01:40:56,679 --> 01:41:01,079
tedious to say over and over again but

2508
01:40:58,679 --> 01:41:03,079
you know even like where we're at at the

2509
01:41:01,079 --> 01:41:04,519
commercial spot here in Oregon you know

2510
01:41:03,079 --> 01:41:06,559
we've tried this you know we've tried to

2511
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:08,280
go that and we you know we've gone for

2512
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:11,039
like extreme bag appeal but with some

2513
01:41:08,279 --> 01:41:13,679
unique TPS you we've gone for you know

2514
01:41:11,039 --> 01:41:15,519
uh extremely potent smoke that you know

2515
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:17,319
may not necessarily be the the best

2516
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:20,199
looking but it's just really really

2517
01:41:17,319 --> 01:41:22,319
tasty and really uh potent and it always

2518
01:41:20,198 --> 01:41:23,678
just comes back to like you got to like

2519
01:41:22,319 --> 01:41:26,519
meet them in the middle and find the

2520
01:41:23,679 --> 01:41:28,760
nicest version of uh of runser candy

2521
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:30,320
that you can grow out yeah I mean for

2522
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:32,079
for a minute there right a couple years

2523
01:41:30,319 --> 01:41:33,920
ago it might have been GMO or it might

2524
01:41:32,079 --> 01:41:37,559
have been wedding cake those might have

2525
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:39,760
been like the top of the pyramid but

2526
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:41,719
like today I don't know that I could

2527
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:44,639
name a strain that I mean you're

2528
01:41:41,719 --> 01:41:47,439
probably close with lemon Cherry like

2529
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:49,400
that's probably one of the ones I see

2530
01:41:47,439 --> 01:41:51,759
the most hype about and see pop up the

2531
01:41:49,399 --> 01:41:54,960
most but like I never have people come

2532
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:56,679
in to or in conversation saying like

2533
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:58,319
where do I get the Lemon Cherry gelato

2534
01:41:56,679 --> 01:42:00,800
or I need it or anything like like it's

2535
01:41:58,319 --> 01:42:02,840
just popular because it's commercially

2536
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:05,719
popular I don't know it's not like being

2537
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:07,199
drooled over by consumers I don't think

2538
01:42:05,719 --> 01:42:09,399
maybe it is and I'm just totally out of

2539
01:42:07,198 --> 01:42:11,158
touch cuz I'm I'm so far from your

2540
01:42:09,399 --> 01:42:13,960
typical consumer because I cultivate you

2541
01:42:11,158 --> 01:42:16,359
know like I I'm not really in the in the

2542
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:18,359
stores and stuff like that so yeah no

2543
01:42:16,359 --> 01:42:20,960
absolutely that it does give you like

2544
01:42:18,359 --> 01:42:22,519
that one step removed where like I I

2545
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:23,760
just went into a dispensary yesterday

2546
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:25,360
and I got some

2547
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:26,599
concentrates and I was looking through

2548
01:42:25,359 --> 01:42:29,479
what the train names were and I'm like I

2549
01:42:26,599 --> 01:42:31,159
don't know half of these and I I I'm

2550
01:42:29,479 --> 01:42:33,118
almost sure that some of this came from

2551
01:42:31,158 --> 01:42:34,960
stuff that I've grown that ended up into

2552
01:42:33,118 --> 01:42:38,759
a concentrate and none of these are the

2553
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:41,198
names that I sent it out with so I'll go

2554
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:44,239
I'll go like every other month I'll go

2555
01:42:41,198 --> 01:42:48,279
to this one store in Denver that has

2556
01:42:44,238 --> 01:42:50,158
like an insane amount of deli style jars

2557
01:42:48,279 --> 01:42:52,439
so you can just sit in there for an hour

2558
01:42:50,158 --> 01:42:54,479
and bother the bud tender and make them

2559
01:42:52,439 --> 01:42:56,719
show you every J and I do it just to

2560
01:42:54,479 --> 01:42:59,319
kind of like make sure I'm not missing

2561
01:42:56,719 --> 01:43:01,079
something you know like genetically like

2562
01:42:59,319 --> 01:43:02,639
make sure that like there's not

2563
01:43:01,079 --> 01:43:04,559
something out there that's just like I

2564
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:06,880
need to be working with this or like

2565
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:08,480
this is this is new or this is

2566
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:12,400
interesting

2567
01:43:08,479 --> 01:43:14,039
um typically I I'm yeah every other job

2568
01:43:12,399 --> 01:43:15,598
it's all like relabeled stuff you

2569
01:43:14,039 --> 01:43:18,238
already know and I'll just sit there and

2570
01:43:15,599 --> 01:43:19,960
go runs runs runs gelat gelato gelato

2571
01:43:18,238 --> 01:43:24,479
like every you know like it's it's like

2572
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:26,719
every every jar but uh um

2573
01:43:24,479 --> 01:43:28,598
yeah just bringing bringing those

2574
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:32,118
varieties and like getting getting more

2575
01:43:28,599 --> 01:43:33,960
more actual variety instead of like

2576
01:43:32,118 --> 01:43:35,039
stated variety right like people act

2577
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:37,719
like things are different and then

2578
01:43:35,039 --> 01:43:40,880
you're like is it though like is it's

2579
01:43:37,719 --> 01:43:43,880
it's dessert chunky purple like you said

2580
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:46,279
purple candy gas or it's dessert or it's

2581
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:49,560
it maybe just this like slight note

2582
01:43:46,279 --> 01:43:51,319
difference than all this other stuff but

2583
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:53,280
yeah I go to these like I go to the

2584
01:43:51,319 --> 01:43:55,519
flower competitions here in Denver you

2585
01:43:53,279 --> 01:43:59,960
know the one at the hydro store had like

2586
01:43:55,520 --> 01:44:01,599
75 76 different jars and like you know

2587
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:05,279
no hate to individual Growers or

2588
01:44:01,599 --> 01:44:07,560
anything but like 50 of those were

2589
01:44:05,279 --> 01:44:10,000
indistinguishable from one another you

2590
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:12,800
know and then 20 20 of them are have

2591
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:13,479
unique notes and and and looks to them

2592
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:15,520
and

2593
01:44:13,479 --> 01:44:16,959
then I don't know if I'm at the right

2594
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:20,400
numbers and then eight of them or six of

2595
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:22,480
them were like wow like that's special

2596
01:44:20,399 --> 01:44:24,359
great example of what they grew or just

2597
01:44:22,479 --> 01:44:26,678
something so unique and so out of left

2598
01:44:24,359 --> 01:44:28,960
field that it was like oh man that's

2599
01:44:26,679 --> 01:44:31,079
nice these days I think you need both to

2600
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:33,520
stand out I think you need different

2601
01:44:31,079 --> 01:44:36,679
different unique that's also grown you

2602
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:39,280
know to its full potential I like this I

2603
01:44:36,679 --> 01:44:41,520
like the philosophy of like doing uh

2604
01:44:39,279 --> 01:44:43,238
like in food if you do like the rule of

2605
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:45,520
two in one where you do two things that

2606
01:44:43,238 --> 01:44:47,678
are familiar and one thing that's unique

2607
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:50,920
or different and something that's uh

2608
01:44:47,679 --> 01:44:53,199
like novel to the experience so like you

2609
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:55,399
know I I like to stick with like really

2610
01:44:53,198 --> 01:44:59,799
Frosty really purple but then if I get

2611
01:44:55,399 --> 01:45:02,439
some weird like old funky you know socks

2612
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:04,320
or you know I like I love really I love

2613
01:45:02,439 --> 01:45:06,198
really good GMO that's like really

2614
01:45:04,319 --> 01:45:10,079
purple and really Frosty but then that

2615
01:45:06,198 --> 01:45:13,399
just like pure funky gas like that to me

2616
01:45:10,079 --> 01:45:14,639
is like it just it it hits your senses

2617
01:45:13,399 --> 01:45:16,158
differently than what you're used to

2618
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:18,319
you're like oh it's going to be purple

2619
01:45:16,158 --> 01:45:23,079
like sweet and candies and then it's not

2620
01:45:18,319 --> 01:45:25,439
and it's like uh excitement almost yeah

2621
01:45:23,079 --> 01:45:27,559
will say just like for anybody that

2622
01:45:25,439 --> 01:45:30,719
watches this and is considering getting

2623
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:35,159
anything from me like most of my stuff

2624
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:37,198
is in the more beautiful flavors or more

2625
01:45:35,158 --> 01:45:38,079
like like and not much of my stuff is in

2626
01:45:37,198 --> 01:45:41,399
the like

2627
01:45:38,079 --> 01:45:44,118
rotten um I don't gravitate towards that

2628
01:45:41,399 --> 01:45:46,719
stuff much I have a few things like my

2629
01:45:44,118 --> 01:45:48,079
DK stomper has like a skunky Gorilla

2630
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:49,719
Glue to it you know it's kind of like a

2631
01:45:48,079 --> 01:45:52,279
nastier not nastier but it's like a

2632
01:45:49,719 --> 01:45:54,639
funky funky smell but I don't really

2633
01:45:52,279 --> 01:45:57,319
gravitate toward like the rotting fruit

2634
01:45:54,639 --> 01:46:01,079
or the stinky Jing bag or like the farts

2635
01:45:57,319 --> 01:46:02,920
or like that I I just like it's just

2636
01:46:01,079 --> 01:46:05,238
personal preference I guess like it's

2637
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:08,239
like the way I I don't look at those

2638
01:46:05,238 --> 01:46:10,279
plants and go like wow I want to always

2639
01:46:08,238 --> 01:46:11,799
have this you know like they're they're

2640
01:46:10,279 --> 01:46:14,319
just not in the garlicky stuff that's

2641
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:17,960
not really my my world it's more like I

2642
01:46:14,319 --> 01:46:21,559
like sweets and berries and florals and

2643
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:23,840
like delicious kind of like smells that

2644
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:28,159
like you just want to keep opening it

2645
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:30,279
and smelling it I guess for sure um um

2646
01:46:28,158 --> 01:46:31,920
yeah no I I agree I feel like we we each

2647
01:46:30,279 --> 01:46:34,039
have our own like things that we kind of

2648
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:35,840
gravitate towards and as breeders too

2649
01:46:34,039 --> 01:46:37,479
like you just kind of lean in towards

2650
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:39,079
what you like and otherwise you're not

2651
01:46:37,479 --> 01:46:41,198
going to have like the exact same sort

2652
01:46:39,079 --> 01:46:42,840
of drive to want to make it as as great

2653
01:46:41,198 --> 01:46:45,279
as you can because you're you're doing

2654
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:48,279
it for yourself in the end and if other

2655
01:46:45,279 --> 01:46:50,279
people like it then uh like get on board

2656
01:46:48,279 --> 01:46:52,519
cuz I'm trying to make what I like the

2657
01:46:50,279 --> 01:46:55,920
best that's that's that's like the maybe

2658
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:57,679
my point then I'd like if people take

2659
01:46:55,920 --> 01:47:01,440
anything away from this it's that it's

2660
01:46:57,679 --> 01:47:04,599
like I'm literally like doing what I

2661
01:47:01,439 --> 01:47:06,238
like I I I I'm not at all looking at the

2662
01:47:04,599 --> 01:47:08,400
market and thinking like what's going to

2663
01:47:06,238 --> 01:47:10,399
sell the best or what's going to like be

2664
01:47:08,399 --> 01:47:11,759
the most popular like there's so much of

2665
01:47:10,399 --> 01:47:14,198
that out there that people can go get

2666
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:17,360
seeds from like if they want to get

2667
01:47:14,198 --> 01:47:19,238
seeds from me it's like very much me

2668
01:47:17,359 --> 01:47:21,079
choosing things that I like and some of

2669
01:47:19,238 --> 01:47:22,598
it people are not going to like at all

2670
01:47:21,079 --> 01:47:25,800
like some of it like that's not what

2671
01:47:22,599 --> 01:47:27,719
it's for like I said the whole journey

2672
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:29,840
started with me trying to find genetics

2673
01:47:27,719 --> 01:47:32,000
because I wanted to get into like larger

2674
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:33,760
scale cultivation and then I wasn't

2675
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,520
finding what I like so I was like I'm

2676
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:38,960
just going to start hunting and making

2677
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:42,320
things I like and so the whole literally

2678
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:43,359
the whole thing is is for me I don't I

2679
01:47:42,319 --> 01:47:44,679
don't know I feel like that's how the

2680
01:47:43,359 --> 01:47:46,920
best stuff's got to be made if you're

2681
01:47:44,679 --> 01:47:50,000
trying to like fulfill somebody else's

2682
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:51,560
interest or like the markets what the

2683
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:54,039
market wants or what you think the

2684
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:55,719
market wants like I don't know that just

2685
01:47:54,039 --> 01:47:59,880
takes like the

2686
01:47:55,719 --> 01:48:02,399
the hey puppy that just takes like the

2687
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:04,520
the I don't want to sound snobby and say

2688
01:48:02,399 --> 01:48:06,519
like art out of it but that just takes

2689
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:08,880
like the creativity out of it right like

2690
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:11,560
that's like it's not personal it's not

2691
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:12,960
mine or whatever whoever whatever

2692
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:15,440
breeder is doing it at that point

2693
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:18,118
they're just trying to make a product

2694
01:48:15,439 --> 01:48:21,960
really they're not trying to like create

2695
01:48:18,118 --> 01:48:24,598
something that they like so yeah I fully

2696
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:28,520
agree with that um so like as a breeder

2697
01:48:24,599 --> 01:48:32,159
then you know since you uh get seeds to

2698
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:33,920
probably new Growers all the time um

2699
01:48:32,158 --> 01:48:35,920
what are some of like either the

2700
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:39,039
pitfalls or or what advice would you

2701
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:40,760
give to new Growers um just considering

2702
01:48:39,039 --> 01:48:41,840
how often it is that new Growers are

2703
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:45,599
growing

2704
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:50,319
seeds oh boy

2705
01:48:45,599 --> 01:48:52,840
um interesting question

2706
01:48:50,319 --> 01:48:54,639
so new Growers if you're talking

2707
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:57,000
strictly genetically in like what to

2708
01:48:54,639 --> 01:48:57,719
purchase um what the seeds to get for a

2709
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:01,000
new

2710
01:48:57,719 --> 01:49:04,198
grower I do a good bit of

2711
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:06,639
research um and and make sure that like

2712
01:49:04,198 --> 01:49:10,238
you choose something

2713
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:12,079
that well as a new grower let's take it

2714
01:49:10,238 --> 01:49:15,039
more around the let's go more the route

2715
01:49:12,079 --> 01:49:17,639
of like uh like growing for for for new

2716
01:49:15,039 --> 01:49:20,399
Growers like um advice that you would

2717
01:49:17,639 --> 01:49:21,960
give them in in the in the garden um

2718
01:49:20,399 --> 01:49:24,279
let's say they already have some seeds

2719
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:26,359
of yours

2720
01:49:24,279 --> 01:49:29,719
oh like like advice to actually like

2721
01:49:26,359 --> 01:49:32,118
succeed with my seeds or like um yeah or

2722
01:49:29,719 --> 01:49:35,279
or like to grow in general as a new

2723
01:49:32,118 --> 01:49:37,639
grower yeah I mean my a lot of my

2724
01:49:35,279 --> 01:49:39,039
feedback is like so the technique that I

2725
01:49:37,639 --> 01:49:40,920
use we we already went through earlier

2726
01:49:39,039 --> 01:49:45,840
in the podcast about like the actual

2727
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:48,239
products that I use um that is such a

2728
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:49,760
focus of everybody and and a discussion

2729
01:49:48,238 --> 01:49:51,439
point of like oh what do you grow with

2730
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:53,520
what's your NES what's your medium

2731
01:49:51,439 --> 01:49:54,799
what's your BL blah blah like what's

2732
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:58,480
your frequency what's your this what's

2733
01:49:54,800 --> 01:50:00,920
your that I think there's so much

2734
01:49:58,479 --> 01:50:04,598
more it is so much more important on

2735
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:07,039
like the uh the the feel side of things

2736
01:50:04,599 --> 01:50:08,960
it's such a bad advice because it's like

2737
01:50:07,039 --> 01:50:10,479
to grow well for new Growers you have to

2738
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:13,000
know what you're doing is like my advice

2739
01:50:10,479 --> 01:50:15,000
no but it's like uh there if you if you

2740
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:17,679
grow simple like the way I do like one

2741
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:19,439
part nutrients cocoa fiber potted or it

2742
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:22,039
doesn't have to be my way but like some

2743
01:50:19,439 --> 01:50:24,559
very you know not a lot of bottles not a

2744
01:50:22,039 --> 01:50:26,840
lot of product of a pretty like clean

2745
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:29,039
and simple way to grow it allows you to

2746
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:31,000
spend time paying attention to the plant

2747
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:33,359
it allows you to spend time like reading

2748
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:35,079
and researching and like maybe chatting

2749
01:50:33,359 --> 01:50:36,279
with people online or taking a photo of

2750
01:50:35,079 --> 01:50:39,158
something that you're curious about like

2751
01:50:36,279 --> 01:50:42,759
this Leaf is curling or why is my plant

2752
01:50:39,158 --> 01:50:44,679
droopy or like and and and so if you're

2753
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:48,880
not like caught up in

2754
01:50:44,679 --> 01:50:50,840
this 30 different bottles and um a drop

2755
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:53,159
of this and four drops of this and 10

2756
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:55,078
drops of this and and then your feed

2757
01:50:53,158 --> 01:50:57,839
chart every other day has different

2758
01:50:55,078 --> 01:51:00,840
cycles and you're chasing this like crop

2759
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:03,760
steering and you get caught up in all of

2760
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:06,560
that and you're like missing the actual

2761
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:09,440
like paying attention to the plant and

2762
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:13,159
like being like okay I love that yeah

2763
01:51:09,439 --> 01:51:15,198
like like keep it simple yeah it'll it

2764
01:51:13,158 --> 01:51:18,078
frees up your your energy and your

2765
01:51:15,198 --> 01:51:20,559
attention to like to like pay attention

2766
01:51:18,078 --> 01:51:23,960
and like okay it what is actually

2767
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:26,159
occurring here there's also this like

2768
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:28,039
people think things happen way faster

2769
01:51:26,158 --> 01:51:30,359
when they're new than they do like

2770
01:51:28,039 --> 01:51:32,198
people so people keep over adjusting

2771
01:51:30,359 --> 01:51:33,519
it's like oh something's wrong the

2772
01:51:32,198 --> 01:51:35,439
internet's telling me I need to give it

2773
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:38,000
more nitrogen or calmag everybody says

2774
01:51:35,439 --> 01:51:41,839
calmag it's like the joke on Reddit but

2775
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:45,760
uh yeah so so okay I gave it to calm mag

2776
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:47,679
uh nothing happened like it's like well

2777
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:49,960
nobody in those comments unfortunately

2778
01:51:47,679 --> 01:51:52,118
told you give it to cowm mag and then

2779
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:53,480
wait 72 hours or something you know like

2780
01:51:52,118 --> 01:51:56,158
like

2781
01:51:53,479 --> 01:51:58,078
so there there's like this this people

2782
01:51:56,158 --> 01:51:59,679
will adjust and then they'll adjust more

2783
01:51:58,078 --> 01:52:03,078
and then and then they just end up like

2784
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:04,880
spiraling into this like disaster so I

2785
01:52:03,078 --> 01:52:07,158
always like one of the big things that I

2786
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:09,118
always encourage new Growers to do is

2787
01:52:07,158 --> 01:52:10,638
like so once you've built so say say

2788
01:52:09,118 --> 01:52:12,118
you've got your selected nutrients in

2789
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:14,159
your medium and you you know through

2790
01:52:12,118 --> 01:52:15,799
research that your your nutrients works

2791
01:52:14,158 --> 01:52:18,920
with your medium and like you know that

2792
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:22,800
that's two things that are working

2793
01:52:18,920 --> 01:52:26,440
together either use the company's feed

2794
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:28,520
chart and reduce it by like 20% is my

2795
01:52:26,439 --> 01:52:31,759
recommendation maybe even 25% like

2796
01:52:28,520 --> 01:52:34,320
whatever their levels are like you know

2797
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:36,560
give it 50 milliliters of this I'd give

2798
01:52:34,319 --> 01:52:37,960
it like 30 they're trying to get you to

2799
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:40,320
use more products so that you have to

2800
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:41,840
buy more product so they they basically

2801
01:52:40,319 --> 01:52:43,960
their feed charts and stuff typically

2802
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:47,119
recommend things at like the

2803
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:48,639
high uh range of nominal right like

2804
01:52:47,118 --> 01:52:50,439
you've got your nominal window somewhere

2805
01:52:48,639 --> 01:52:51,719
in the middle is perfect somewhere down

2806
01:52:50,439 --> 01:52:54,000
here is like as low as you would want to

2807
01:52:51,719 --> 01:52:55,319
go realistically somewhere up here is as

2808
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,719
high as nominal as you would ever want

2809
01:52:55,319 --> 01:52:58,799
to go without killing your plants or

2810
01:52:56,719 --> 01:53:00,560
hurting your plants the feed schedules

2811
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:03,039
from the manufacturers are going to be

2812
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:05,159
pretty high because they want to sell

2813
01:53:03,039 --> 01:53:07,760
product and use product so I always tell

2814
01:53:05,158 --> 01:53:09,679
people like dial that back a little bit

2815
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:11,599
start for your first grow with that

2816
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:13,960
manufacturer's table at like a lesser

2817
01:53:11,599 --> 01:53:15,520
volume or a less lesser quantity run

2818
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:16,960
through it and see what happened you

2819
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:18,639
know and then maybe make adjustments to

2820
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:20,560
your chart from there but like if you

2821
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:23,039
start to see things go wrong you ever

2822
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:24,079
see people online the comments are

2823
01:53:23,039 --> 01:53:30,118
always

2824
01:53:24,078 --> 01:53:32,960
like oh man uh flush it flush it out uh

2825
01:53:30,118 --> 01:53:35,598
and then do this like they they tell

2826
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:37,880
people to like flush their pots with

2827
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:40,119
water to like flush things out

2828
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:42,840
completely that's terrible advice in my

2829
01:53:40,118 --> 01:53:45,000
opinion at least cocoa wise like to to

2830
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:48,599
cuz there are no nutrients in that soil

2831
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:51,639
or in that Medium whatsoever so proper

2832
01:53:48,599 --> 01:53:53,880
watering you you return to nominal right

2833
01:53:51,639 --> 01:53:56,400
like you return to your charts like you

2834
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:57,920
go back to what you know so my

2835
01:53:56,399 --> 01:54:00,719
recommendation is if something's going

2836
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:02,520
wrong like that make up maybe a slightly

2837
01:54:00,719 --> 01:54:04,679
larger batch than you normally would so

2838
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:07,639
you have more runoff so you've kind of

2839
01:54:04,679 --> 01:54:10,000
like you run off whatever's imbalance is

2840
01:54:07,639 --> 01:54:12,400
in that in that medium in your pot and

2841
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:14,840
you after that runoff runs all the way

2842
01:54:12,399 --> 01:54:17,960
through you've kind of reset to your

2843
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:19,440
your Baseline never if you have issues

2844
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:22,078
and you're in Cocoa you might be able to

2845
01:54:19,439 --> 01:54:25,198
do it with soil and I'm not a soil Pro a

2846
01:54:22,078 --> 01:54:27,719
poed soil Pro but like in Coco I see

2847
01:54:25,198 --> 01:54:29,319
these recommendations that are like oh

2848
01:54:27,719 --> 01:54:32,118
dude you burned it you need to flush it

2849
01:54:29,319 --> 01:54:34,000
out and it's like well you went over and

2850
01:54:32,118 --> 01:54:35,639
now you're going to go under immediately

2851
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:38,198
and the plant's going to start starving

2852
01:54:35,639 --> 01:54:41,480
so that's those are some points over

2853
01:54:38,198 --> 01:54:43,759
correction yeah for sure yeah so new new

2854
01:54:41,479 --> 01:54:45,759
Growers I think that's that's good stuff

2855
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:48,199
yeah those are those are great that's

2856
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:50,280
great advice like um you know keeping it

2857
01:54:48,198 --> 01:54:53,399
simple and then also not overcorrecting

2858
01:54:50,279 --> 01:54:56,920
when you do see uh a problem I feel like

2859
01:54:53,399 --> 01:54:59,719
are hugee things for like most new

2860
01:54:56,920 --> 01:55:01,440
Growers and experienced Growers as well

2861
01:54:59,719 --> 01:55:04,399
like the overcorrecting thing I see all

2862
01:55:01,439 --> 01:55:07,158
the time even in commercial spaces and

2863
01:55:04,399 --> 01:55:09,879
um but like the the keeping it as simple

2864
01:55:07,158 --> 01:55:11,799
as possible in the case of hom Growers

2865
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:13,840
it does free your time up to pay more

2866
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:15,760
attention to the plants and then even in

2867
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:18,159
like a a larger scale like let's say

2868
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:22,079
you're running a small little home grow

2869
01:55:18,158 --> 01:55:23,559
for a profit um it it helps to keep it

2870
01:55:22,078 --> 01:55:25,118
simple simple because you you can free

2871
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:28,960
your time up for other things like

2872
01:55:25,118 --> 01:55:33,319
security or for um you know pest

2873
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:34,560
prevention or um trimming uh manicuring

2874
01:55:33,319 --> 01:55:37,359
you know all these other things that are

2875
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:39,199
just hyper time consuming um you don't

2876
01:55:37,359 --> 01:55:41,198
want to you don't want to uh increase

2877
01:55:39,198 --> 01:55:43,879
the difficulty of the simplest things

2878
01:55:41,198 --> 01:55:46,879
like uh for like commercial and for hom

2879
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:48,639
Growers like you if you're new to it or

2880
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:50,440
you're trying to get better at it

2881
01:55:48,639 --> 01:55:51,760
obviously read and research like there's

2882
01:55:50,439 --> 01:55:53,039
so much information out there but make

2883
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:55,760
sure you're read the right sources

2884
01:55:53,039 --> 01:56:01,760
there's so much trash out there now too

2885
01:55:55,760 --> 01:56:03,760
there's good and bad now but uh like

2886
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:05,400
Define I mean everybody in the industry

2887
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:08,520
likes to say the word sop which I think

2888
01:56:05,399 --> 01:56:10,839
is hilarious um not that I dis disagree

2889
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:12,480
with it how standard are they well well

2890
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:14,639
yeah it's like it's just funny to me

2891
01:56:12,479 --> 01:56:16,078
it's it's like that I don't know it's

2892
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:18,239
like people like to say it or something

2893
01:56:16,078 --> 01:56:21,439
it's like it gives him some kind of a it

2894
01:56:18,238 --> 01:56:23,759
sounds smart it sounds smart I I I use

2895
01:56:21,439 --> 01:56:26,879
it in my day-to-day in my regular work

2896
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:30,639
like all the all the time uh but uh so

2897
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:33,560
anyways like you need to like do that

2898
01:56:30,639 --> 01:56:36,159
research learn a lot and then determine

2899
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:38,039
what is nominal right like for what is

2900
01:56:36,158 --> 01:56:40,319
nominal for temperature what is nominal

2901
01:56:38,039 --> 01:56:42,760
for humidity at this point in my grow

2902
01:56:40,319 --> 01:56:45,639
what is nominal for nutrients what is pH

2903
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:47,520
all of this stuff and then like you're

2904
01:56:45,639 --> 01:56:48,880
you're and then the rest of it just

2905
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:50,599
execution so you're always just trying

2906
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:52,440
to get back to that point like you've

2907
01:56:50,599 --> 01:56:54,800
already done the research You' already

2908
01:56:52,439 --> 01:56:57,238
done the math you know at that point

2909
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:59,440
what where you're trying to get to so

2910
01:56:57,238 --> 01:57:01,479
there's like there's like the knowledge

2911
01:56:59,439 --> 01:57:03,279
of what am I supposed to do and then

2912
01:57:01,479 --> 01:57:06,198
there's like the execution of actually

2913
01:57:03,279 --> 01:57:07,840
like achieving that so like if you and

2914
01:57:06,198 --> 01:57:10,960
then teaching people not to panic when

2915
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:12,679
they're within tolerance exactly exactly

2916
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:13,960
well that's why like I keep using the

2917
01:57:12,679 --> 01:57:16,039
term nominal because that's like a

2918
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:18,319
window there's like best in the middle

2919
01:57:16,039 --> 01:57:19,719
and then there's like up or down like

2920
01:57:18,319 --> 01:57:21,158
it's a tolerance thing you're like

2921
01:57:19,719 --> 01:57:23,319
you're like what is that typically used

2922
01:57:21,158 --> 01:57:24,638
in like what uh uh I have a background

2923
01:57:23,319 --> 01:57:27,078
in like electrical and electrical

2924
01:57:24,639 --> 01:57:30,359
engineering so you'll say like nominal

2925
01:57:27,078 --> 01:57:32,679
voltages or like you know like like your

2926
01:57:30,359 --> 01:57:35,319
outlets in your house are like 120 volt

2927
01:57:32,679 --> 01:57:38,000
but their I think nominal is like plus

2928
01:57:35,319 --> 01:57:40,519
or minus 4% or something like that so

2929
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:45,198
like okay appliances that you plug in

2930
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:47,040
might actually be 117 volts but the

2931
01:57:45,198 --> 01:57:50,118
system is designed to work within a

2932
01:57:47,039 --> 01:57:51,760
range um okay so the term is used in

2933
01:57:50,118 --> 01:57:54,359
other things I think it's like medical

2934
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:56,360
probably uses it and stuff but I I take

2935
01:57:54,359 --> 01:57:58,559
it personally from the electrical world

2936
01:57:56,359 --> 01:58:00,399
but anyways yeah it's like you've got

2937
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:03,119
yeah you've got a window right You' got

2938
01:58:00,399 --> 01:58:05,238
high low low and then ideal or close to

2939
01:58:03,118 --> 01:58:08,319
Ideal right in the middle yeah so like

2940
01:58:05,238 --> 01:58:10,078
yeah work study and like come up with

2941
01:58:08,319 --> 01:58:11,439
those numbers and you you kind of like

2942
01:58:10,078 --> 01:58:13,519
you know that's right because you did

2943
01:58:11,439 --> 01:58:15,238
all the work to come up with them and

2944
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:18,239
then you don't have to St and guess your

2945
01:58:15,238 --> 01:58:19,718
plan at that point just like trying to

2946
01:58:18,238 --> 01:58:21,678
get back to that point you're just

2947
01:58:19,719 --> 01:58:22,760
always trying to like achieve that it's

2948
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:25,760
like

2949
01:58:22,760 --> 01:58:28,119
I it's such a simple thing but it's then

2950
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:30,199
it gets overly complicated very easily

2951
01:58:28,118 --> 01:58:32,039
totally I mean there's so many tools now

2952
01:58:30,198 --> 01:58:36,279
though that help with that like back in

2953
01:58:32,039 --> 01:58:40,279
the day we didn't have these home home

2954
01:58:36,279 --> 01:58:42,800
uh home grow didn't have the the tools

2955
01:58:40,279 --> 01:58:44,559
really that to to do cool stuff like now

2956
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:46,440
AC Infinity coming out with all this

2957
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:49,920
like little tent controllers and you

2958
01:58:46,439 --> 01:58:51,479
just set your you that with the AI one

2959
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:54,520
you can just tell it what you wanted at

2960
01:58:51,479 --> 01:58:55,638
and it just it exactly but I don't have

2961
01:58:54,520 --> 01:58:58,040
that version I've got probably the

2962
01:58:55,639 --> 01:59:00,599
previous version and you literally back

2963
01:58:58,039 --> 01:59:03,599
to the term nominal you literally set

2964
01:59:00,599 --> 01:59:06,199
high temp low temp and it'll just cycle

2965
01:59:03,599 --> 01:59:07,719
the fan to keep you in that in that back

2966
01:59:06,198 --> 01:59:12,158
in the day we didn't have all that stuff

2967
01:59:07,719 --> 01:59:13,880
I mean uh commercial grows did not not

2968
01:59:12,158 --> 01:59:17,198
cannabis grows but like commercial uh

2969
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:19,279
farming has automation those controllers

2970
01:59:17,198 --> 01:59:20,919
were so expensive and and like you

2971
01:59:19,279 --> 01:59:24,479
needed to be like a engineering

2972
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:26,158
technician to be able to even handle the

2973
01:59:24,479 --> 01:59:29,399
the UI and and make sure that it was

2974
01:59:26,158 --> 01:59:31,559
running properly totally a totally

2975
01:59:29,399 --> 01:59:34,519
that's a whole those old industrial

2976
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:36,679
controls and and stuff like plc's and

2977
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:38,440
Industrial controls used to be like you

2978
01:59:36,679 --> 01:59:40,158
had to go get training just to work on

2979
01:59:38,439 --> 01:59:43,000
the thing you know just to program the

2980
01:59:40,158 --> 01:59:44,439
thing now it's all getting so clever and

2981
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,198
so simple download an app follow

2982
01:59:44,439 --> 01:59:48,118
instructions and you're good to go

2983
01:59:46,198 --> 01:59:49,638
totally I me we weren't even like back

2984
01:59:48,118 --> 01:59:51,759
in the day we weren't even talking about

2985
01:59:49,639 --> 01:59:53,078
like VPD and stuff like that I mean I

2986
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:55,360
think the what we always used to talk

2987
01:59:53,078 --> 01:59:57,439
about was if it's comfortable for you in

2988
01:59:55,359 --> 01:59:59,279
the room it's comfortable for the plant

2989
01:59:57,439 --> 02:00:01,158
I still go by that and I that's how I

2990
01:59:59,279 --> 02:00:03,359
teach that's how I teach my cultivators

2991
02:00:01,158 --> 02:00:04,319
is I if they like go into a room I'm

2992
02:00:03,359 --> 02:00:06,880
like if it's

2993
02:00:04,319 --> 02:00:08,319
uncomfortable then like you need to

2994
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:10,000
realize the plants are probably feeling

2995
02:00:08,319 --> 02:00:12,039
that too because we're pretty darn close

2996
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,639
to what our comfortability level is

2997
02:00:12,039 --> 02:00:17,118
totally they can hand when it comes to

2998
02:00:13,639 --> 02:00:20,000
transpiration right you know like yeah

2999
02:00:17,118 --> 02:00:22,039
well um so I have a few like kind of

3000
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:26,238
last minute wrapup questions that are

3001
02:00:22,039 --> 02:00:27,960
like the ubiquitous podcast questions um

3002
02:00:26,238 --> 02:00:30,399
I just feel as though it's always

3003
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:32,560
appropriate um so what's your favorite

3004
02:00:30,399 --> 02:00:35,479
strain of all

3005
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:40,320
time like your uh your desert island

3006
02:00:35,479 --> 02:00:42,238
strain if I could get one

3007
02:00:40,319 --> 02:00:44,719
thing I

3008
02:00:42,238 --> 02:00:46,678
I that's so hard to answer one thing I

3009
02:00:44,719 --> 02:00:49,760
know everybody asked this on the podcast

3010
02:00:46,679 --> 02:00:52,319
and it's it can be a seed line or it can

3011
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:55,119
be a single cultivar let's let it a

3012
02:00:52,319 --> 02:00:56,559
little easier on you I've heard people

3013
02:00:55,118 --> 02:00:58,238
talk about like okay if you give me

3014
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:59,840
these seeds I could make anything from

3015
02:00:58,238 --> 02:01:02,158
it you know like

3016
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:05,119
but as a breeder I mean you have that

3017
02:01:02,158 --> 02:01:07,359
prerogative the one that jumps out at me

3018
02:01:05,118 --> 02:01:10,000
that's like a unicorn that I'm chasing

3019
02:01:07,359 --> 02:01:11,559
for the rest of my life I think is that

3020
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:15,479
like

3021
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:19,119
2003 2004 blueberry is like okay like a

3022
02:01:15,479 --> 02:01:21,078
DJ Short Blueberry or even it was who

3023
02:01:19,118 --> 02:01:22,639
who knows at that time you got a bag and

3024
02:01:21,078 --> 02:01:24,880
somebody told you it was blueberry and

3025
02:01:22,639 --> 02:01:27,639
you're like you open it and it's just

3026
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:30,679
like it smelled like a pack of like

3027
02:01:27,639 --> 02:01:34,039
fresh blueberries picked on the farm and

3028
02:01:30,679 --> 02:01:37,880
there was like these silvery blue light

3029
02:01:34,039 --> 02:01:40,639
purple fluffy you know very Crystal

3030
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:44,520
coated fluffy Buds

3031
02:01:40,639 --> 02:01:46,480
and I I would kill for that putt like

3032
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:51,560
there you tried the blueberry muffins

3033
02:01:46,479 --> 02:01:53,000
number four uh from uh from Humbolt yeah

3034
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:54,119
I I didn't know there was a I didn't

3035
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:56,118
know there was a number four I didn't

3036
02:01:54,118 --> 02:01:58,598
know there was like a cut I yeah the the

3037
02:01:56,118 --> 02:02:01,158
number four cut is it's like pure

3038
02:01:58,599 --> 02:02:04,400
blueberry like artificial blueberry but

3039
02:02:01,158 --> 02:02:08,319
with like a a a cream like a a like a

3040
02:02:04,399 --> 02:02:13,399
pastry sort of uh baked goods uh Essence

3041
02:02:08,319 --> 02:02:15,359
to it it's it's up there I have with me

3042
02:02:13,399 --> 02:02:17,118
I finally found a feno in a hunt that

3043
02:02:15,359 --> 02:02:19,439
like kind of reminds me of what I'm

3044
02:02:17,118 --> 02:02:23,359
talking about because the old one did

3045
02:02:19,439 --> 02:02:24,678
not have any pastry or bread or cup not

3046
02:02:23,359 --> 02:02:26,479
saying that that's not a good cut it's

3047
02:02:24,679 --> 02:02:30,239
probably a good cut but like this old

3048
02:02:26,479 --> 02:02:32,479
one was just fresh fruit like like just

3049
02:02:30,238 --> 02:02:33,959
ripe blueberries and it wasn't blueberry

3050
02:02:32,479 --> 02:02:36,879
pie it wasn't blueberry cupcake it was

3051
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:39,198
just the fruit and uh so good it was so

3052
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:41,359
good it was so good and it's so like

3053
02:02:39,198 --> 02:02:43,359
relaxing but not a knockout you know

3054
02:02:41,359 --> 02:02:46,158
just like that anti-anxiety but still go

3055
02:02:43,359 --> 02:02:47,920
about your day and that original when

3056
02:02:46,158 --> 02:02:49,598
blueberry I mean I'm sure you look at

3057
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:51,920
the Timeline blueberry was supposedly

3058
02:02:49,599 --> 02:02:53,119
around like way way before that and some

3059
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:55,279
of the old heads might have different

3060
02:02:53,118 --> 02:02:58,238
stories than me but like early thousands

3061
02:02:55,279 --> 02:02:59,719
was when I was getting it and when a

3062
02:02:58,238 --> 02:03:01,759
handful of people I know and have talked

3063
02:02:59,719 --> 02:03:04,279
to were getting it and man it was just

3064
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:06,159
like super special it was that stuff

3065
02:03:04,279 --> 02:03:08,719
that you were like I'll pay whatever I

3066
02:03:06,158 --> 02:03:11,920
need to pay to get more of this um nice

3067
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:13,319
so I've hunted a bunch of clones or

3068
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:15,078
that's not hunting but I've run a bunch

3069
02:03:13,319 --> 02:03:18,599
of clones that were like said to be

3070
02:03:15,078 --> 02:03:20,238
blueberry Cuts none of them came close

3071
02:03:18,599 --> 02:03:22,480
and then so I switched to seeds and I

3072
02:03:20,238 --> 02:03:24,078
was like all right DJ short used to work

3073
02:03:22,479 --> 02:03:26,198
with Dutch Passion so I was like okay

3074
02:03:24,078 --> 02:03:27,719
I'm buying Dutch Passion seeds cuz they

3075
02:03:26,198 --> 02:03:30,439
have the real cut cuz they worked with

3076
02:03:27,719 --> 02:03:33,480
DJ and ran them and it was just like one

3077
02:03:30,439 --> 02:03:35,479
was this gigantic sativa herming all

3078
02:03:33,479 --> 02:03:36,839
over the place and other one was like it

3079
02:03:35,479 --> 02:03:39,158
just looked like the seeds weren't even

3080
02:03:36,840 --> 02:03:41,440
in the same it they didn't even look

3081
02:03:39,158 --> 02:03:44,879
like they came from the same batch it

3082
02:03:41,439 --> 02:03:49,319
was wild and so burned out on that and

3083
02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:52,159
then um some DJ short ones as well and

3084
02:03:49,319 --> 02:03:54,519
everybody I talk to is like not in the

3085
02:03:52,158 --> 02:03:56,039
TPS in the DJ Short seeds anymore like

3086
02:03:54,520 --> 02:03:58,880
either he's using different cuts or it's

3087
02:03:56,039 --> 02:04:01,279
just faded or what but so i' I I bought

3088
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:04,078
some from double O seeds in Spain that

3089
02:04:01,279 --> 02:04:08,800
claimed to have used the real

3090
02:04:04,078 --> 02:04:12,078
one and the fenos all were slow vegging

3091
02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:14,360
you know small Stout plants like kind of

3092
02:04:12,078 --> 02:04:17,599
like the legend of that plant is said to

3093
02:04:14,359 --> 02:04:21,238
be like like kind of slow and ugly and

3094
02:04:17,599 --> 02:04:23,000
leafy and and I have one that I kept and

3095
02:04:21,238 --> 02:04:24,598
I still keep keep um that I've done a

3096
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:27,319
little bit of breeding with I released a

3097
02:04:24,599 --> 02:04:29,679
cut or I released a a cross of it in my

3098
02:04:27,319 --> 02:04:33,359
last release called blueberry honey

3099
02:04:29,679 --> 02:04:35,800
that's like Caramelo times this plant um

3100
02:04:33,359 --> 02:04:38,078
it doesn't check a lot of boxes because

3101
02:04:35,800 --> 02:04:39,679
it's slow as hell and it's kind of ugly

3102
02:04:38,078 --> 02:04:42,359
and I don't post photos of it because

3103
02:04:39,679 --> 02:04:44,158
it's kind of ugly although it's about to

3104
02:04:42,359 --> 02:04:48,279
hit a nice point where I might finally

3105
02:04:44,158 --> 02:04:50,879
post a photo of this damn thing um but

3106
02:04:48,279 --> 02:04:53,000
I'm not sure that I have what I'm

3107
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:55,639
looking for it's the closest thing I've

3108
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:57,800
found it's beautiful smelling and like

3109
02:04:55,639 --> 02:04:59,559
even when you crack a a leaf you know

3110
02:04:57,800 --> 02:05:03,039
and smell it like it's unbelievable and

3111
02:04:59,559 --> 02:05:06,760
this like ber sweet fresh fruit Berry

3112
02:05:03,039 --> 02:05:08,399
blueberry smell but I'm still not quite

3113
02:05:06,760 --> 02:05:10,320
sure the search is over for that one so

3114
02:05:08,399 --> 02:05:14,359
yeah that's my desert island strains the

3115
02:05:10,319 --> 02:05:16,840
original blueberry well I mean yeah to

3116
02:05:14,359 --> 02:05:18,719
have that much effort to then be put

3117
02:05:16,840 --> 02:05:20,639
into trying to find it I can understand

3118
02:05:18,719 --> 02:05:23,359
why you'd want to definitely have that

3119
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:26,719
one back if anybody listens to

3120
02:05:23,359 --> 02:05:28,759
this and and somehow has that cut cuz

3121
02:05:26,719 --> 02:05:31,439
everybody that says they have that cut I

3122
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:34,159
haven't been impressed not not impressed

3123
02:05:31,439 --> 02:05:35,799
I haven't seen the real deal um and my

3124
02:05:34,158 --> 02:05:37,558
circle's small so it's probably out

3125
02:05:35,800 --> 02:05:39,960
there I just I don't know the right

3126
02:05:37,559 --> 02:05:41,520
people but for sure I mean I know it's

3127
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:44,198
blueberry is big in like the Pacific

3128
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:46,880
Northwest so maybe uh maybe someone out

3129
02:05:44,198 --> 02:05:49,439
here hear it and uh think of you be

3130
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:51,400
awesome nice all right send some seeds

3131
02:05:49,439 --> 02:05:54,399
back I'll I'll breed with it and send

3132
02:05:51,399 --> 02:05:56,519
them some seeds back nice um all right

3133
02:05:54,399 --> 02:05:59,399
so the next question is uh what's your

3134
02:05:56,520 --> 02:06:01,639
who's your favorite breeder of all

3135
02:05:59,399 --> 02:06:04,319
time

3136
02:06:01,639 --> 02:06:07,599
uh I always like so before I ever even

3137
02:06:04,319 --> 02:06:09,960
grew his stuff I always uh like kind of

3138
02:06:07,599 --> 02:06:11,960
revered and like the The Legend of SoMo

3139
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:15,198
was always like kind of super cool to me

3140
02:06:11,960 --> 02:06:16,520
like um even like I said way back in the

3141
02:06:15,198 --> 02:06:18,158
day I didn't never even like cultivated

3142
02:06:16,520 --> 02:06:20,480
his stuff but like every time I was like

3143
02:06:18,158 --> 02:06:22,279
shopping on the the banks I was always

3144
02:06:20,479 --> 02:06:25,919
like uh sounds like he's on to something

3145
02:06:22,279 --> 02:06:27,519
and he sound so interesting to me um and

3146
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:30,639
then i' I've grown them out now and I've

3147
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:32,480
had some success and some you know not

3148
02:06:30,639 --> 02:06:36,118
success but I did find a lavender that

3149
02:06:32,479 --> 02:06:39,118
I've kind of gone nuts over um so yeah

3150
02:06:36,118 --> 02:06:41,279
I'd have to say probably him um I'm

3151
02:06:39,118 --> 02:06:43,920
definitely

3152
02:06:41,279 --> 02:06:47,198
like for better or worse this kind of

3153
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:49,000
like doesn't say much good about me

3154
02:06:47,198 --> 02:06:51,759
because I'm a new breeder it's like I'm

3155
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:54,399
kind of more uh I kind of give more

3156
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:56,960
clout to the old guys uh than the new

3157
02:06:54,399 --> 02:07:00,399
guy even if you like strike gold like

3158
02:06:56,960 --> 02:07:02,960
you mentioned uh you know um who is a

3159
02:07:00,399 --> 02:07:05,078
blackhead earlier with his BlackBerry

3160
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:06,719
and super boof and the blueberry sugar

3161
02:07:05,078 --> 02:07:09,118
he's putting out like super cool stuff

3162
02:07:06,719 --> 02:07:11,158
and like the names his names obviously

3163
02:07:09,118 --> 02:07:14,799
going around and you know huge kudos to

3164
02:07:11,158 --> 02:07:20,078
him but like that's it's still just kind

3165
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:21,920
of like the ogs from Amsterdam and um

3166
02:07:20,078 --> 02:07:24,118
you know different parts of Europe and

3167
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:25,960
Dutch seeds and stuff like that I don't

3168
02:07:24,118 --> 02:07:27,319
know a lot of those guys' names you know

3169
02:07:25,960 --> 02:07:30,439
I don't know them personally I know the

3170
02:07:27,319 --> 02:07:34,238
brands and stuff but um I'd say that's

3171
02:07:30,439 --> 02:07:36,598
where I like where I lean towards and I

3172
02:07:34,238 --> 02:07:39,198
I still keep going to those seeds and to

3173
02:07:36,599 --> 02:07:40,480
those companies over there and Spain and

3174
02:07:39,198 --> 02:07:43,319
the UK

3175
02:07:40,479 --> 02:07:46,039
and and uh Amsterdam and stuff and just

3176
02:07:43,319 --> 02:07:49,118
keep running those and I keep finding

3177
02:07:46,039 --> 02:07:52,039
like really loud stuff like really

3178
02:07:49,118 --> 02:07:53,479
interesting loud stuff um

3179
02:07:52,039 --> 02:07:55,238
I don't know there seems to be I see

3180
02:07:53,479 --> 02:07:57,000
people online like talking smack about

3181
02:07:55,238 --> 02:07:59,198
Dutch genetics and stuff now and I'm

3182
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:01,039
like man that's where most of this all

3183
02:07:59,198 --> 02:08:02,238
came from like way back in the day like

3184
02:08:01,039 --> 02:08:04,319
that's where most of this breeding

3185
02:08:02,238 --> 02:08:05,718
originated from I mean there's always

3186
02:08:04,319 --> 02:08:07,078
California goes way back too I'm not

3187
02:08:05,719 --> 02:08:09,039
trying to take anything take anything

3188
02:08:07,078 --> 02:08:10,719
out of there a there's a level of

3189
02:08:09,039 --> 02:08:13,118
professionalism to Dutch breeding though

3190
02:08:10,719 --> 02:08:15,078
that wasn't really seen elsewhere yeah

3191
02:08:13,118 --> 02:08:17,479
totally it seemed like a lot of the US

3192
02:08:15,078 --> 02:08:19,158
breeding Cali and a lot of those cuts

3193
02:08:17,479 --> 02:08:23,359
that got popular in the US back in the

3194
02:08:19,158 --> 02:08:25,319
day were like some bad seat or some had

3195
02:08:23,359 --> 02:08:28,880
some weird story you know train rack was

3196
02:08:25,319 --> 02:08:32,000
found in a train car or it was like some

3197
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:33,639
bizarre story and and then like or or

3198
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,880
you know all the legends of diesel and

3199
02:08:33,639 --> 02:08:36,440
stuff although it seems like some of

3200
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:38,920
those you know the real stories have

3201
02:08:36,439 --> 02:08:41,198
come out now and and chems and all of

3202
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:43,399
this stuff like a lot of it came from

3203
02:08:41,198 --> 02:08:46,198
like one bag seed because back in the

3204
02:08:43,399 --> 02:08:48,359
day that's what we had right like that's

3205
02:08:46,198 --> 02:08:49,960
like we didn't have access to huge Li

3206
02:08:48,359 --> 02:08:53,359
genetic libraries whereas like you said

3207
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:56,279
the Dutch had Pro programmatic breeding

3208
02:08:53,359 --> 02:08:59,158
back in the day like they were sifting

3209
02:08:56,279 --> 02:09:01,920
through like shitty plants for

3210
02:08:59,158 --> 02:09:04,519
generations and generations to to to

3211
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:07,118
come out with these things that can cul

3212
02:09:04,520 --> 02:09:08,760
one hybrids and totally yeah like like

3213
02:09:07,118 --> 02:09:09,679
not much naturally occurring stuff

3214
02:09:08,760 --> 02:09:11,480
you're going to want to throw in your

3215
02:09:09,679 --> 02:09:13,000
closet it's like there's very few maybe

3216
02:09:11,479 --> 02:09:15,000
some of the Afghan stuff you can just

3217
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:16,639
throw in your closet but a lot of work

3218
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:18,158
and a lot of generational breeding and

3219
02:09:16,639 --> 02:09:19,719
and and selective breeding went into

3220
02:09:18,158 --> 02:09:21,479
like making that happen and I think a

3221
02:09:19,719 --> 02:09:23,319
lot of that happened you know the Dutch

3222
02:09:21,479 --> 02:09:25,198
did a lot of that so yeah I think a lot

3223
02:09:23,319 --> 02:09:28,000
of those OG breeders are where I kind of

3224
02:09:25,198 --> 02:09:31,558
like have the most reverence for sure

3225
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:33,639
that makes a lot of sense um so uh this

3226
02:09:31,559 --> 02:09:35,800
will be the last question uh of the

3227
02:09:33,639 --> 02:09:38,039
little short questions um what was your

3228
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:40,400
most or what is your most memorable

3229
02:09:38,039 --> 02:09:42,479
cannabis related

3230
02:09:40,399 --> 02:09:44,759
experience oh

3231
02:09:42,479 --> 02:09:46,198
man I feel like I've seen you ask this

3232
02:09:44,760 --> 02:09:49,599
before I should have been prepared for

3233
02:09:46,198 --> 02:09:52,558
this um how about this I'll tell maybe

3234
02:09:49,599 --> 02:09:54,559
I'll tell my uh first story instead of

3235
02:09:52,559 --> 02:09:56,079
instead I I can't you know that's that's

3236
02:09:54,559 --> 02:09:58,199
great cuz I didn't touch on that so that

3237
02:09:56,078 --> 02:09:59,920
can just be like cuz it's usually one of

3238
02:09:58,198 --> 02:10:01,319
the most memorable experiences I

3239
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:04,078
definitely remember it I remember the

3240
02:10:01,319 --> 02:10:06,319
first two um yeah let's hit it so the

3241
02:10:04,078 --> 02:10:09,158
first time I was just hanging out with a

3242
02:10:06,319 --> 02:10:11,558
bunch of friends and they had all smoked

3243
02:10:09,158 --> 02:10:14,479
before and this was

3244
02:10:11,559 --> 02:10:18,719
probably you know Mexican brick back in

3245
02:10:14,479 --> 02:10:21,158
the day um and I just remember

3246
02:10:18,719 --> 02:10:23,239
like uh they were I couldn't figure out

3247
02:10:21,158 --> 02:10:24,920
the the carb right on like a bowl so

3248
02:10:23,238 --> 02:10:26,439
they like packed a bowl for me and I'm

3249
02:10:24,920 --> 02:10:27,840
I'm I'm like I'm doing what you're

3250
02:10:26,439 --> 02:10:29,399
you're doing and I was like arguing with

3251
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:30,719
them and they were like no and then

3252
02:10:29,399 --> 02:10:32,638
eventually had to like hold the lighter

3253
02:10:30,719 --> 02:10:35,000
for me and and just say like you know

3254
02:10:32,639 --> 02:10:37,920
inhale or whatever and so I remember

3255
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:39,880
kind of like sitting there in a chair

3256
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:41,960
and my buddy's basement just

3257
02:10:39,880 --> 02:10:44,118
like I couldn't tell if I was like

3258
02:10:41,960 --> 02:10:45,920
talking myself into feeling something or

3259
02:10:44,118 --> 02:10:48,198
if I actually felt something you know

3260
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:50,480
like in my head I was like oh my feet

3261
02:10:48,198 --> 02:10:51,919
are tingling and then it's like but are

3262
02:10:50,479 --> 02:10:53,558
they like are my feet tingling or am I

3263
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:56,760
just sitting in a chair like I I don't

3264
02:10:53,559 --> 02:10:59,000
know so my first time was pretty like I

3265
02:10:56,760 --> 02:11:02,280
was definitely a square you know like I

3266
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:03,880
didn't like just pick up a bong and take

3267
02:11:02,279 --> 02:11:06,399
a big rip and know what I was doing or

3268
02:11:03,880 --> 02:11:08,880
something I was like a total like Square

3269
02:11:06,399 --> 02:11:11,158
trying to figure it out and and then the

3270
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:14,520
next time uh

3271
02:11:11,158 --> 02:11:18,558
somebody gave me like a small bag of

3272
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:21,559
some Mexican brick and me and a buddy

3273
02:11:18,559 --> 02:11:23,320
went out in his car and like drove drove

3274
02:11:21,559 --> 02:11:27,520
around the block and parked and like

3275
02:11:23,319 --> 02:11:30,279
made a tinf foil bowl and like just hot

3276
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:33,119
booxed his car with tin foil in Mexican

3277
02:11:30,279 --> 02:11:34,319
pranks like sitting there we were

3278
02:11:33,118 --> 02:11:35,598
probably oh God we were probably

3279
02:11:34,319 --> 02:11:37,920
listening to the police or something

3280
02:11:35,599 --> 02:11:40,360
that do was a big fan of the police but

3281
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:42,279
um and just like I think that time that

3282
02:11:40,359 --> 02:11:45,519
second time was the first time for For

3283
02:11:42,279 --> 02:11:48,238
Better or Worse it was tinfoil and swag

3284
02:11:45,520 --> 02:11:48,960
I got like really high though I was like

3285
02:11:48,238 --> 02:11:53,039
you

3286
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:55,520
know eyes squinting and like definitely

3287
02:11:53,039 --> 02:11:57,439
giggling and experience the whole thing

3288
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:59,360
but I wish you know what I wish I did

3289
02:11:57,439 --> 02:12:01,359
remember cuz this is probably would be a

3290
02:11:59,359 --> 02:12:03,719
good answer it's like the first time I

3291
02:12:01,359 --> 02:12:05,880
had like kind bud you know like back in

3292
02:12:03,719 --> 02:12:07,399
the day the good stuff we it usually

3293
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:08,760
didn't have a strain name attached to it

3294
02:12:07,399 --> 02:12:11,839
was just kind bud when you got something

3295
02:12:08,760 --> 02:12:13,159
really good and yeah I think I can there

3296
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:15,639
was one strain in

3297
02:12:13,158 --> 02:12:18,839
particular coming up that it was called

3298
02:12:15,639 --> 02:12:22,239
Beauty and the Beast and whoever was

3299
02:12:18,840 --> 02:12:26,000
doing it was very very good at

3300
02:12:22,238 --> 02:12:28,519
cultivation like this was very loud very

3301
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:30,679
potent very expensive you know it only

3302
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:32,679
came around every few months like now

3303
02:12:30,679 --> 02:12:34,078
that I grow I know Harvest cycles and I

3304
02:12:32,679 --> 02:12:35,800
kind of know why it was coming around

3305
02:12:34,078 --> 02:12:37,679
every couple months and you had like

3306
02:12:35,800 --> 02:12:39,520
sold out quick oh you had to know the

3307
02:12:37,679 --> 02:12:41,960
person you know you had to know somebody

3308
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:43,719
and I don't even know who Beauty in the

3309
02:12:41,960 --> 02:12:44,760
like you can it's on seedfinder but I

3310
02:12:43,719 --> 02:12:46,319
don't even know if that's the real

3311
02:12:44,760 --> 02:12:49,559
Beauty in the Beast like it says it's

3312
02:12:46,319 --> 02:12:51,639
like a c99 cross but it didn't look like

3313
02:12:49,559 --> 02:12:55,239
it yielded well it was like golf you

3314
02:12:51,639 --> 02:12:56,520
know and like but man it was like it was

3315
02:12:55,238 --> 02:13:01,118
like an event every time you could get

3316
02:12:56,520 --> 02:13:02,960
your hands on that wow so um oh I here

3317
02:13:01,118 --> 02:13:04,759
I've got I've got a good story for you

3318
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:07,319
so this is probably what I should have

3319
02:13:04,760 --> 02:13:09,920
answered with to begin with so I

3320
02:13:07,319 --> 02:13:11,519
mentioned that that strain um was called

3321
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:14,719
Morning Glory that I had kind of like

3322
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:17,559
cycled through a lot of for a few years

3323
02:13:14,719 --> 02:13:19,039
um I came up and I'm like from Cleveland

3324
02:13:17,559 --> 02:13:23,520
originally you could see it on my hat

3325
02:13:19,039 --> 02:13:25,960
but uh I it eventually made its way into

3326
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:28,639
um the hands of some rappers some like

3327
02:13:25,960 --> 02:13:30,000
local rappers in Cleveland and not not

3328
02:13:28,639 --> 02:13:33,440
that I wasn't connected to him at all it

3329
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:35,439
was like totally secondhand um but I got

3330
02:13:33,439 --> 02:13:38,359
like one day I got like a a voicemail on

3331
02:13:35,439 --> 02:13:39,879
my phone I was on vacation in Baltimore

3332
02:13:38,359 --> 02:13:41,719
or something and I listen to the

3333
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:42,760
voicemail and it's two people rapping

3334
02:13:41,719 --> 02:13:45,158
and I'm

3335
02:13:42,760 --> 02:13:47,199
like I kind of knew who I kind of had an

3336
02:13:45,158 --> 02:13:49,039
idea who it was but I like I was like

3337
02:13:47,198 --> 02:13:50,678
kind of freaked out they were like

3338
02:13:49,039 --> 02:13:52,559
rapping about the morning glory and

3339
02:13:50,679 --> 02:13:54,639
stuff and about the weed and I was like

3340
02:13:52,559 --> 02:13:56,559
you know paranoid grower so I like

3341
02:13:54,639 --> 02:13:58,159
