before you do so it's it might sound

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:14,759
like it's a little off subject but you

5
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:16,679
gave me the nickname Staten Island yeah

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,880
I I'm I I got to let you know I don't

7
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:19,800
know if you've heard I'm not very happy

8
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,640
about

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,080
that well I mean Staten Island's a

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,960
[ __ ] [ __ ] hole yeah it really is you

11
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:31,359
know your [ __ ] hole uh

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,120
and

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,679
Brooklyn and I spent my last year hold

14
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:40,199
on wait the first time I ever grew weed

15
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:42,079
was in Brooklyn okay okay so let's just

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,320
let's just rewind a second when you're

17
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,480
telling can of stories because I do a

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,238
lot right it becomes difficult to tell

19
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:52,479
the whole truth and nothing but the

20
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:55,238
truth right because not that you want to

21
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:58,479
lie but you're talking essentially about

22
00:00:55,238 --> 00:01:01,119
illegal [ __ ] you you might

23
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:04,478
not how do I put this the right way a

24
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:07,118
lot of people do not want to be public

25
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:09,239
figures right you don't they don't want

26
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:11,118
their name out there right you don't

27
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:12,959
want to out your friend if they want to

28
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,118
have privacy they might have moved on

29
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,158
they might have a different job I don't

30
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:17,438
blame you for giving me a nickname but

31
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,799
Staten

32
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,919
Island you know is it like the first

33
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,280
thing that came to your head at the

34
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,960
moment when you were talking I actually

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,200
if you really want to blame oh almost

36
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,399
said his name if you really want to

37
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,759
blame it who I got it from was when

38
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,159
skunk VA was talking to the podcast

39
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,759
about his story and he kept saying my

40
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,159
buddy from Staten Island oh really all

41
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,159
right I'm gonna blame him and then I

42
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,439
mean we can mutually him and I can

43
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,920
mutually share blame for

44
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:51,039
popularizing you know uh and all that

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,280
but it's kind of like yeah it's uh it

46
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,560
you know I you're just trying to talk

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,280
about people and a lot of times like you

48
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,200
know you stop because you're so used to

49
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,799
saying someone's name and you want to

50
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,280
protect someone's privacy maybe they

51
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,960
don't want their real name out there or

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:10,520
whatever you know so they um you know

53
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:13,519
they uh uh so

54
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,400
yeah my point in bringing this up my

55
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,560
point in bringing this up is the weasel

56
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,120
first of all we'll have to talk about

57
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,400
how he got that nickname because that

58
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,519
that might I that's pretty shitty too

59
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,159
but he's the real Staten

60
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:29,000
Island he was growing first on S Island

61
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:31,359

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,318
lived there after I lived there he was

63
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,920

00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,479
about nicknames is that most of the time

71
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,959
you don't pick them yourself they are

72
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:03,719

00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:08,639
talking about bro you put this nickname

75
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,879

77
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:15,639
time least you're not [ __ ] Joe at

79
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:20,798
AJ AJ is common enough nickname that

80
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,120
people probably don't think it means

81
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:28,080
[ __ ] Joe but it does it means assle

82
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,480
Joe right so in my defense Gabby right

83
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,480
when I was starting to talk about you

84
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,598
you had been retired from growing for

85
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:38,840
some time you were a legitimate business

86
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:41,199
store business store owner you know what

87
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,479
I'm saying and like this stuff was long

88
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:46,238
in your past and I didn't call you up

89
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:48,518
and be like do you mind if I out you on

90
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,158
the internet for doing a whole bunch of

91
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:54,200
like shady ass illegal [ __ ] a long time

92
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:56,078
ago right and so I just avoided all that

93
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:57,839
by like talking about you with a name

94
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:59,319
that wasn't traced back to you now that

95
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,360
you've decided to say your name and show

96
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:04,719
your face you're stuck with it but um

97
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,840
you know that's kind of that's kind of

98
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,158
how it went I'm sure for dude I keep

99
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,079
wanting to say his real name I'm sure

100
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,840
skunk VA thought the same thing when he

101
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:16,079
was trying to figure out how to talk

102
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,720
about you five six years ago on the

103
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,759
podcast right without just saying you

104
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,080
know oh you know and that you know I I

105
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,879
don't mind I don't I don't mind that I

106
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,639
got a nickname I just mind the nickname

107
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:32,120
like what it actually and the fact that

108
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:35,918

109
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:39,600

111
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:48,439

112
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,439
