hello and welcome to another episode of

3
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:13,919

00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,960
guest is Russ Patton or uh better known

5
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:19,800

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,920
cannabis educator he's an activist and a

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,118
cultivator um he's also a member of The

founders and operators of the small

10
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:32,759
batch uh cannabis production operation

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,600
the home Forge uh he's a co-host of the

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,520
growing with my fellow grower show on

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,480
YouTube the Michigan Bros Grow Show um

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,680
am I missing anything you are just all

15
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:44,078
over the place man yeah the lesie buds

16
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,039
show I do every Wednesday buds yeah

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,399
that's a really good one um and I don't

18
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,320
think we missed any I've I've been a

19
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,920
part of of other shows in the past but

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,520
they're not running anymore but yeah I

21
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,320
love doing the shows and just talking

22
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,440
about cannabis spreading the good word

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,399
about its healing properties and uh just

24
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:03,159
the uh the power it gives you to be able

25
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:06,280
to Hom grow I'm a big proponent of

26
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:08,200
homerow homerow Rights uh I do uh a

27
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,960
little bit of activism as well I speak

28
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,079
at the capital uh yearly now uh and uh I

29
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,679
don't know I just think it's an

30
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:20,039
important fight to get

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,680
behind for sure no I I fully agree um I

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,880
mean everything that you've talked about

33
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,439
on the different shows that you've been

34
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,118
a part about I'm always like hell yeah

35
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:29,559
Spartan get out there and fight the good

36
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:31,359
fight so I'm uh yeah I'm a huge huge fan

37
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,960
definitely Ely real really happy that

38
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:36,879
you're joining us today um yeah I am of

39
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:39,719
course your host uh Nick wolf uh or Mr

40
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:42,640
Wolf grows on Instagram and Reddit um

41
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:43,920
and so um what's new in your grow World

42
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,439
Spartan like what have you been doing

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,079
lately what have you been getting into

44
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:50,398
um the biggest thing for me the biggest

45
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:53,039
change is probably working being able to

46
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,320
work with Grandmaster LEDs affords me to

47
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,118
have like the latest tech and and to

48
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:01,000
play with that so A few of the biggest

49
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:04,438
things for me was uh Spectrum tuning

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,159
playing with the the ability to um

51
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:07,879
change the Spectrum instead of staying

52
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,479
with one you know the the argument

53
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:10,959
always was what's the best Spectrum but

54
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,640
now it's it's more like why do you have

55
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,080
to stay have one why why can't you give

56
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:17,719
a veg the best Spectrum in veg and then

57
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,319
the best Spectrum at whatever stage of

58
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:21,639
growth why can't you do that with one

59
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:24,518
light so to see that was really cool and

60
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:27,759
we're still playing with that to see you

61
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:32,239
know for example blue light like the the

62
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:34,679
450 440 NM Blues those are great we all

63
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,280
know in veg to keep the plant the inner

64
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,040
node spacing tight and everything like

65
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,719
that but wow if you throw it in at the

66
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:44,400
very beginning of flower you can really

67
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:46,080
suppress the stretch you can uh you can

68
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,560
take and throw it in towards the end of

69
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,879
flow uh when you're getting close to

70
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:53,280
harvest and it can help prod uh produce

71
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:54,919
higher canabo push higher canabo uh it's

72
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,080
kind of like the whole trick back in the

73
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:58,598
HPS days when people were doing HPS and

74
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,360
they throw metal heli in for the last

75
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:02,839
week or something it kind of you know

76
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,760
kind of does that same thing and it's

77
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,598
it's fun to to be witnessing this stuff

78
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,878
a little bit repeat itself and see like

79
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,318
okay this makes sense I can see why the

80
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:13,039
science is starting to catch up a little

81
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:15,679
bit with what uh Growers have already

82
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:18,079
figured out in their home gardens which

83
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,680
is yeah I've been um I've been running

84
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,640
the 730 nanometer red um at the first 7

85
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,159
minutes after lights off and uh 7

86
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,518
minutes prior to lights on to try and

87
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:31,759
cut down on the um the photo period time

88
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,920
of the plant overall and it seems to

89
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,560
definitely do something where it uh puts

90
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,919
them to sleep faster wakes them up

91
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,680
faster um you know I'm

92
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:41,518
anthropomorphizing of course but uh

93
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,519
there's something to do with the photo

94
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,640
cell receptors and one of the one of the

95
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,879
photo receptors responds to it um

96
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:51,679
absolutely that's that's usually far red

97
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:54,919
730 nmet or so and

98
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,519
um another cool thing about that is is

99
00:03:54,919 --> 00:04:00,158
um if you if you're if your base

100
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,599
Spectrum or what I call my so I I speak

101
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,519
in terms of I look at lights as

102
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,878
spectrums and so um sure I was just

103
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,560
talking about this today it was funny on

104
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,560
Discord I was trying to tell people it's

105
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,920
like look if you have whatever light

106
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,079
system you have it doesn't matter what

107
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:14,679
it is you could have HPS right now if

108
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,959
you wanted to or you have whatever your

109
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,798
light system is you could instead of

110
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,959
saying well I can't afford this brand

111
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:24,918
new fancy top-of-the-line grow light and

112
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,159
I'm not going to buy something worse

113
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:27,879
than that so I'm just going to save my

114
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,960
money save my money and then go without

115
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:34,719
for a while like you can do that that's

116
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,959
definitely a strategy or LED has gotten

117
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,000
to the point to where you can just get

118
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:39,079
supplemental bars so what do you missing

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,319
what what do you have right now you have

120
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,719
a light source right now what are you

121
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,519
missing just get what you're missing and

122
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,440
add it to it or maybe just add it to it

123
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:48,079
at a certain part of of flowering to

124
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:50,079
stimulate what you want and then pull it

125
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,159
away you know what I mean like you could

126
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,918
you can add blues or you could add Reds

127
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,520
or you could add far red like you're

128
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,918
saying you could add if you don't have

129
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,719
far red in your light right now you

130
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,120
could add a far red booster bar and do

131
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,840
exactly what you're doing right now and

132
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,918
it would cost so little cuz you're only

133
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:07,399
running that thing seven seven minutes a

134
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:08,799
a day now because it doesn't unless you

135
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:10,560
run it during the fire red during the

136
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,560
light cycle as well I would recommend

137
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,879
doing that um I have the fire already in

138
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,959
my light so I I just do the extra

139
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:21,399
supplemental for the um specifically to

140
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:23,120
try and get that uh that aspect of the

141
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:26,638
Emerson effect yeah I don't know I

142
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,918
haven't been uh so the Emerson effect is

143
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,160
running your far red with in conjunction

144
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:34,519
with 660 rad during your fing normal

145
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,759
flyering cycle and uh I noticed a huge I

146
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:39,279
don't know how much of how much of that

147
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:42,000
incre or that decreased Harvest window

148
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,318
has to do with the Emerson effect or

149
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,519
with the far RADS after after the light

150
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,759
cycle because sure the way the Emerson

151
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:50,719
effect what that does is it it doesn't

152
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,319
make the light that it it's coming down

153
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,440
any more efficient but it makes the

154
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,160
plant more efficient using that light so

155
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,360
if it's more efficient it metabolism is

156
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,280
faster and it's getting through its

157
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,479
processes quicker so um I don't know I

158
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:03,638
think the jury's still out a little bit

159
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:05,120
on what is it that's exactly shortened

160
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:06,598
and maybe it's a combination of both I

161
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,560
don't know but it's exciting to play

162
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:12,079
with and and take advantage of it there

163
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,199
there might be a little user or operator

164
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,758
uh bias there as well on my part because

165
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:20,280
I definitely then tend to run the the

166
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:22,879
generative um leaning irrigations and

167
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:25,959
environmental settings to try and push a

168
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:27,560
faster finish as well um while still

169
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:29,799
trying to you know do a little bit of

170
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,399
bulking but sometimes I just kind of if

171
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,879
it's in my home grow I'll just kind of

172
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:34,679
forego that because the final product

173
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:38,120
ends up that much nicer if you just go

174
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,000
generative the whole time um but I want

175
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,519
to H uh kind of steer the conversation a

176
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,319
little bit into um I I really like to

177
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:49,038
find out where people started their

178
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,240
Journey with growing and kind of what

179
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:54,918
got them into cannabis or um you know if

180
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,720
they started with cannabis and then uh

181
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:58,918
grew vegetables afterwards I know that

182
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,360
you are an avid Gardener in your in your

183
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:04,240
spare time as well and um uh or did you

184
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,479
did you start growing vegetables and

185
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,598
then transition into cannabis what what

186
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,439
was the I guess the the best way to ask

187
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:13,199
this is what's the first plant that you

188
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:16,399
ever grew oh it's definitely a vegetable

189
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,478
of some sort uh as a kid I I can still I

190
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,878
have still memories of remembering uh

191
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,918
back when I you know I don't know a

192
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,639
toddler age or something but uh going

193
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:27,439
out to the garden with my mom or my dad

194
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:30,000
um and working in the in the garden

195
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,879
because we had a pretty big family four

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,279
I have four siblings or three siblings

197
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:36,879
four all together of us and uh so

198
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:39,198
there's six in the family and and mom

199
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,800
and dad supplemented our food with what

200
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,800
they could grow out and and we had a

201
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,840
decent sized Garden um so you know back

202
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:50,158
then it was seemed like more of a chore

203
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:51,719
but uh as I got as an older adult and uh

204
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:53,279
started sampling the food I could get at

205
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,800
the store you can really tell difference

206
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,959
between what you put outside and what

207
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,800
you can get at the store and the health

208
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:02,000
benefits also um and that's really what

209
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,158
got me into cannabis was um I had a

210
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,240
cousin that was

211
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:07,598
growing cannabis here in Michigan and

212
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,360
Michigan it it became medically illegal

213
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:13,199
to grow cannabis in 2008 and I had a

214
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,240
cousin that was doing that um well I'm

215
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,639
just going to say a cousin so I won't

216
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,439
name them but I had a cousin that was

217
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,120
doing well before that but then also

218
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,759
when it became legal got the caregiver

219
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,158
card got on the program and started

220
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,598
growing and I got interested as hell

221
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:27,120
because it's another plant right yeah

222
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:30,158
and so I'd go over there and look and

223
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,240
watch and um

224
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:34,718
uh but then what really spurred me into

225
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,680
growing was that uh I did end up signing

226
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,680
up for the caregiver program and started

227
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,598
to get a couple patients uh signed up

228
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,559
underneath me and I started growing my

229
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:49,000
first cannabis plants um shortly

230
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:51,759
thereafter but uh it was probably 6

231
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,919
months into my growing to where I was

232
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:56,319
you know taking down Harvest every you

233
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:58,599
know a couple months or whatever it was

234
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,160
that I I saw a Facebook post from my

235
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,959
uncle and and uh it it was basically

236
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:04,639
something that he kept kind of secret

237
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:07,559
from most of us was that he had really

238
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,720
bad health and um the doctors had

239
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:11,078
actually he he in the post he was saying

240
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,278
I'm just letting you know the doctors

241
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:14,919
just told me to go home and get my

242
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:18,639
Affairs in order I have about two weeks

243
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:20,519
to live and I just um there was P it was

244
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:23,199
I was he was diagnosed with stage four

245
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,480
pancreatic cancer and wow basically told

246
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,399
him you know he had been going through

247
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,360
chemo and things like that and they

248
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,639
basically just told him with it he

249
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,440
already had a bad heart so with all his

250
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,600
other conditions they basically did all

251
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,800
that they could

252
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,480
do and then at that moment I just

253
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:40,359
remember replying you know just because

254
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,920
they can't help you anymore doesn't mean

255
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,600
there isn't an there isn't a cure I'm

256
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:48,519
growing it right now let's talk you know

257
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,200
and fast forward I uh he ended up you

258
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:51,799
know at that point he's like what do I

259
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,640
have to lose

260
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:58,719
right and uh I started making like from

261
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:01,240
my trim and from uh like the the small

262
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,240
buzz off the bottom the ly stuff I

263
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,759
started making and and researching and

264
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,560
figuring out how to make cannabis oil or

265
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:10,200
Rick Simpson Oil or whatever you want to

266
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,119
call it FICO there's a billion different

267
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,480
names you want to call it and everybody

268
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,639
wants to do it a little bit different

269
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,240
but uh my approaches that and it's

270
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,439
starting to take steam because I'm

271
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,879
actually reading a book right now with a

272
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,240
written by a doctor I'm going to shout

273
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,879
this out I even got through it yet the

274
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,360
Cannabis cancer

275
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:32,000
connection gold stretch okay I read into

276
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,560
I I read ahead to just see what his

277
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,720
process was and he's doing a lot of the

278
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:39,879
same things I'm doing so um I love

279
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,720
seeing that in a doctor so uh absolutely

280
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:44,159
but what my process is RSO is I try to

281
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,639
get as much of the different cannabis as

282
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,120
possible and what I mean by that is I

283
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:51,480
want different from each other in effect

284
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,839
and and uh so sativa or indica if you

285
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,519
want to look at it that way or or

286
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:56,200
whatever just a bunch of different

287
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:58,159
varieties because what I'm trying to do

288
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,040
is collect the most medicinal compounds

289
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,799
as possible you know this one might have

290
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:04,078
lenol but this one might have Alpha

291
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:07,278
pining and this one might have you know

292
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:09,000
beta caropine whatever it is so to be so

293
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,120
what I call it is my shotgun approach so

294
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,159
I'm I'm just loading that shotgun with

295
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,039
every little you know tpine and canabo

296
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,278
that I can get a hold of and then I'm

297
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:19,360
blasting the systems with that and

298
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:22,078
that's what I did and I made the

299
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,759
cannabis oil just like that and uh got

300
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:27,479
my uncle on a program of taking it

301
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:29,439
regularly uh instantly you have to be

302
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,639
careful a little careful with canvas oil

303
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,920
in people on heavy medications because a

304
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:36,278
lot there's a lot of medications that'll

305
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:39,000
make those medications work better it'll

306
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:41,439
enhance them so and one of those cases

307
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,200
was as blood thinners my my uncle immed

308
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,600
not immediately but rather quickly had

309
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,959
to titrate down off of his blood

310
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,079
thinners lower and lower because

311
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:52,439
cannabis does a really good job

312
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,759
especially at high doses of thinning

313
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,079
your blood really wow if you're about to

314
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:58,360
go have a surgery and you think you're

315
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,559
going to cut the nerves by smoking

316
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,480
something you probably should just pass

317
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:06,239
on that maybe just smoke a CBD one

318
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,879
because the THC for sure is is uh helps

319
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,440
blood thinner I've seen it I've done it

320
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:10,879
myself where I've had like like a little

321
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,920
head surgery where they just they cut

322
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:15,278
like a knot off my head but uh it bled

323
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:16,879
like crazy and and they're like we never

324
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:18,679
seen a head you know bleed like this

325
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,320
before and I'm thinking oh yeah I smoked

326
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:23,439
before I came in here that was dumb you

327
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,839
know just just to keep keep an eye when

328
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,680
you're dealing with with other

329
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,800
medications you got you have to be

330
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:32,319
careful and and go slow and uh figure

331
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:34,599
things out but uh fast forward from that

332
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,480
a year after that post was made he was

333
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,879
diagnosed cancer-free

334
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,839
and uh and he's is he still around no

335
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:45,480
unfortunately Co ended up getting him

336
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:48,320
but uh they we did um we did keep all of

337
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,120
his medical records to show like the

338
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,000
monthly shrinking of the tumors and they

339
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,480
didn't stop the conventional medicine

340
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,399
and I want to stress that you know a lot

341
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,039
of people look at cannabis like it's you

342
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,159
know for one a cure for all and it's not

343
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:03,480
a cure all for sure but it helps with a

344
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:06,319
lot of things but um it's not a

345
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,879
replacement for for modern medicine as

346
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,278
much as it can work right alongside of

347
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:12,078
it it can cure it can cure a lot of the

348
00:13:10,278 --> 00:13:14,159
side effects of modern medicine

349
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:16,039
especially chemo stuff like that it'll

350
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,240
revigor your appetite it'll get you

351
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:20,719
sleep so you can recover your body can

352
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,799
recover from everything and uh I think

353
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,879
that's such a great point to make that

354
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:27,000
like a lot of people will just go oh you

355
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:29,360
know I just I do the millennial care

356
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,559
package I take Ibuprofen and drink uh

357
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,159
and and take lots of cannabis right

358
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:38,359
where like if but like to put it in

359
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:40,240
conjunction with um you know Western

360
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,600
medicine I guess we could call it and

361
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,919
and um like keeping that as it as part

362
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,560
of your regiment just as a recovery

363
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,519
process or a even a mental sanity

364
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,879
process cuz for me one of the biggest

365
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:55,320
things with hospitals is I just I have

366
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,639
like a panic like a mental breakdown

367
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,440
like a panic attack when I'm in a

368
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,159
hospital it's it's like one of my least

369
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,199
favorite places to be and so like yeah I

370
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:05,399
could see how just in general improving

371
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,359
the overall demeanor of a patient could

372
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,360
be extremely beneficial but then also

373
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,560
the fact that it is um you know there's

374
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,360
I I believe the it's either the USDA or

375
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:18,518
there's another patent on on uh I think

376
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,639
it's Delta 9C for cancer suppression I

377
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:22,198
forget exactly what it is but I I'm

378
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,720
pretty sure I've even heard you talk

379
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:25,599
about it on the growing with my fellow

380
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,519
Growers podcast or maybe Jack talk about

381
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,320
it or something but it was um very

382
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:35,799
eye-opening to know that uh it's known

383
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:37,519
and it's it's patented and it's withheld

384
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:41,120
and so that's

385
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:44,759
uh yeah I mean seeing the success that

386
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:48,959
your uncle found in using a cannabis oil

387
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:51,600
to increase the odds of survival and

388
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:54,119
remission and even going fully cancer

389
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,759
free that's incredible after being given

390
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:00,639
a two we ticket basically yeah yeah and

391
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:03,399
and that's that does something to your

392
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,919
psyche and your mental power and for me

393
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:07,600
I like like you brought up just the the

394
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:09,240
attitude of a person there is a healing

395
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,639
power of the mind that's why we have

396
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,600
placebos in in test because there is a

397
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:15,278
healing power in the mind there's plenty

398
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,639
of examples where people took placees

399
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,360
and got better thinking they were taking

400
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,879
the medicine and so to have a positive

401
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,480
outlook on life and to have the idea and

402
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,759
the belief that hey whatever this is is

403
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,560
going to work there's healing just in

404
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,800
that which is amazing to believe but

405
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,838
just because we can't explain it uh with

406
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:36,159
science doesn't mean that it it doesn't

407
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:38,120
work it's not helping people so that's

408
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:41,159
what most frustrating thing with me when

409
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,318
it comes to cannabis medicine and uh

410
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:45,439
because that experience for me I was on

411
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:47,838
board ever since it was like I saw it

412
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,519
with my own eyes right I've seen it with

413
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,600
my own eyes and uh you can't tell me

414
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,078
it's not a thing yeah exactly you can't

415
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,639
it's you know and with all the history

416
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,799
of cannabis and the government and how

417
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,120
like oh I'm going to trust some

418
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:02,120
government agency now you know

419
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,198
but uh but yeah and ever since that

420
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,198
moment with my uncle and that

421
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:07,599
cancer-free diagnosis uh I mean I

422
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:09,838
literally bald like a baby when he

423
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,199
called me to tell me uh yeah it's

424
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,920
healing for the Healer too right

425
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:17,039
especially when it's family but uh but

426
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:19,479
ever since that time I had the the

427
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:22,639
fortune to be you know on this different

428
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:25,159
social media platforms on uh YouTube

429
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,480
especially and uh it g it gives me

430
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:30,120
connections even even locally throughout

431
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:33,560
the state and um

432
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:36,360
people will uh offer just to donate me

433
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:38,758
their trim or or whatever because they

434
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,720
know what I do with it you know I make

435
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:42,120
the cannabis oil and I store it up and

436
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,000
then uh when there's people in the

437
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,919
community that need help if somebody

438
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,559
reaches out that has cancer I'm there I

439
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:52,198
I'm I'm I'm getting that to them so even

440
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:54,559
though you know I might not have that

441
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:58,039
person's name registered to me by the

442
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,638
state as a patient I don't care I'm a

443
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:02,559
caregiver for life

444
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:05,160
yeah and I'm GNA help people if I can

445
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:07,918
and so that's what I do so um and I

446
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,839
continue to do that and uh cannabis has

447
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:13,799
afforded me the ability to to to do that

448
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:15,879
and uh I love that um I've worked

449
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:18,879
commercially in cannabis uh at Mitten

450
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,319
canico here in Michigan and I saw the

451
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,079
commercial side of things which was

452
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:24,879
great I I was I learned quite a bit it's

453
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:27,879
it's a little different you know scaling

454
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,720
up to see what it takes to scale up in a

455
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,240
regulated space which you're not just

456
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,960
scaling up like oh what what would it be

457
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,400
like to grow more plants it's not just

458
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,679
that it's like you're in in a regulated

459
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,720
space where you can do these things you

460
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,720
can't do these things you have to you

461
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,038
got metric compliance yeah metric

462
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,880
compliance it's like it get you for

463
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:47,960
every little thing uh that you didn't

464
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,200
even know you were doing wrong in their

465
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:54,200
eyes so absolutely I the the one that

466
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:58,120
always got me was having to like bag and

467
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,519
keep on camera um defoliation like just

468
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:02,000
biomass

469
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,960
and weigh it yeah yeah weigh it and and

470
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,919
then dispose it either like in a

471
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,038
specific manner whether it be like

472
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,240
burying it or like mixing it with other

473
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:13,599
rubbish so that it's unusable and it's

474
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,759
like who's using leaves unless you're

475
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:19,199
making a smoothie or something like and

476
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:21,798
even that you're just getting some like

477
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,558
really low dose cannaboids that are

478
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:26,519
probably not THC unless it's like deep

479
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:27,678
in flour and you're pulling sugar leaves

480
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:30,440
but then it's like why are you doing

481
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,880
that it's it it it really is it's a

482
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,120
stigma that will take you know this is

483
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,720
going to sound terrible but I think

484
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:37,359
there's a lot of Truth in it honestly

485
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,400
and that's it's going to take some of

486
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:42,519
the dinosaurs to die before we really

487
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,519
kill the stigma of cannabis as as a drug

488
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:46,079
rather than cannabis as a medicine or I

489
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:48,319
mean you can look at cannabis as a drug

490
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:50,199
I mean it it is if you think about it in

491
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:53,399
in the aspect of a pharmaceutical kind

492
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:56,319
of um it's just a more of a herbal I

493
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,159
think why cannabis is is so special is

494
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:01,359
because of our endoc canabo system that

495
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:03,120
has the receptor that can literally bind

496
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:06,158
to the components that we're we're

497
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:08,038
growing but cannabis is so diverse all

498
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:11,000
of these different medical compounds

499
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:12,919
like cannabis got me into growing other

500
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,960
medicinal herbs like I've got an herb

501
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:18,440
garden out there now and if I have an

502
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,120
ailment in any anything it could be

503
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,840
something as simple as I got a runny

504
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:24,519
nose or whatever I'm looking in my books

505
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:27,079
and I'm looking online okay what plant

506
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:28,400
can help me because to me I look at it

507
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:30,960
like I look at Food I'd rather have the

508
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,798
whole food rather than something

509
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,798
processed down and so if I can just grow

510
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:39,200
my cure in the in my backyard and and it

511
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:41,200
gives you so much power it's like uh it

512
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,720
does take you control take yeah it's you

513
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,919
taking control of your own health

514
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,240
instead of having to go to a you know a

515
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:49,480
doctor and and and take a prescription

516
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,919
I'm not saying that's bad but if I can

517
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,000
avoid all that and just take something

518
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:57,000
out of my backyard I it makes you feel

519
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,038
so good I totally agree it's I my

520
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,960
easiest comparison to that is like I

521
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:03,240
feel so much better during summer than I

522
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,679
do during winter I'm in Oregon you're in

523
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,519
Michigan so you know the the the cold

524
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,480
basically just you're you're just

525
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:12,038
importing crop all winter just to have

526
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,839
something fresh unless you're getting it

527
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:15,480
from someone with hoop houses and stuff

528
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,480
and then that you know usually you're

529
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,038
going to like a local farmers market or

530
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,759
a co-op or something and that can get

531
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:24,400
pretty pricey um so had like summertime

532
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:26,519
when you got all that fresh produce and

533
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,200
stuff it's it's medicine

534
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:31,759
itself oh 100% that's

535
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,200
it it it's cool to for me because a lot

536
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:34,839
of times I'll sit back whether I'm

537
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,679
gardening outside you know in the

538
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:41,678
vegetable garden or the herb garden or

539
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:43,759
the flower garden um to me like

540
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:47,038
diagnosing a plant problem or whatever

541
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:49,440
it it reminds me almost like the human

542
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:52,240
body you know our body so like I look at

543
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,240
food now more like it's like it is a

544
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,440
medicine because it's just another plant

545
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,919
that we're consuming um and uh like the

546
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,279
the the microbes that you want in

547
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,880
organic gardening in your root system is

548
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:05,678
you know very similar to the microbes

549
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,600
that you want in your guts to digest

550
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:12,278
these plants uh when you're eating them

551
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:15,000
and uh I don't know it's wild to see all

552
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:17,079
of the coincidences of the things that

553
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,200
are so similar between human health and

554
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:21,720
plant

555
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,000
Health yeah I I absolutely agree with

556
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:27,558
that it is really crazy to think that um

557
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,079
you know so many medicines were found

558
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:32,678
out just through the application of like

559
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:35,199
either consuming it or putting it as a

560
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:38,640
topical on skin and just seeing what the

561
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,880
reaction was and then um you know the

562
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,120
just the slow and arduous process of

563
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,880
figuring out what plants worked for what

564
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,879
um by all of our you know past ancestors

565
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,880
and stuff and now we do have like all

566
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,919
these methods that we can use where it's

567
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:55,799
just the consumption of a plant or the

568
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:57,679
yeah the application of some sort of

569
00:21:55,798 --> 00:22:00,440
derived product from just something that

570
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,320
you can grow in your back yard uh and

571
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:06,080
how it almost seems like we like evolved

572
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:07,639
together or something yeah we absolutely

573
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:09,639
did I mean we definitely helped spread

574
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,038
it it was around way before we were but

575
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,960
uh we definitely helped spread it

576
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:16,519
everywhere we are I mean I don't know if

577
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:19,640
there's a maybe maybe this is a big

578
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:21,839
maybe maybe somewhere uh in a igloo

579
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,919
somewhere they don't have an indoor grow

580
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,639
around but uh there might be a Rellis

581
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:28,840
hanging around a nearby River somewhere

582
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,120
still surviving I think canvas is a

583
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:34,038
Survivor and uh it's around it's still

584
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:36,359
around for for a reason because it's

585
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:37,480
it's not not even just helpful to humans

586
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:39,918
I think it's helpful to a lot of other

587
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,159
species too but uh definely humans we've

588
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,000
spread it all over the place well I know

589
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:48,080
there was like this um almost uh

590
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,759
deficiency within the the human uh endoc

591
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:52,839
canabo system for the longest time after

592
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:55,000
hemp was removed as a a crop in the

593
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:57,918
United States because it was fed a lot

594
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,960
of times to uh dairy cows and so there

595
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,200
would be Trace uh cannaboids within milk

596
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,000
and so people are actually satiating

597
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,519
their CB1 and CB2 receptors through um

598
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,720
like either raw milk consumption or even

599
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:12,798
I believe it was even still in

600
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,120
pasteurized milk um but uh yeah once a

601
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:16,278
hemp was removed as a a feed option for

602
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:19,639
cattle it

603
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:22,720
was no more no more uh cannaboids in

604
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:26,120
your average uh American's uh

605
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,640
endocannabinoid system yeah I think it's

606
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:29,639
it's um

607
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,278
know I I don't want to say it's a

608
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,038
destined thing or or whatever because

609
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:36,159
there's plenty of examples of

610
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:37,960
other of other things that uh connect to

611
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,600
uh our receptors in our bodies that so

612
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,558
we can't say that of course that that's

613
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:45,959
it's um destined but um like you said

614
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:47,879
our ancestors have found that uh the

615
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,200
medicinal properties of it you know they

616
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,880
might not know the science of it but

617
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,640
they they know that it that it worked

618
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,278
and I think that's why it's prevailed

619
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:59,080
actually it's it's done well it's

620
00:23:56,278 --> 00:24:00,679
because of that and um does a lot of our

621
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:04,199
other medicinal plants produce a lot of

622
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:05,798
the same tpes and and volatile compounds

623
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,080
um that are medicinal to us and it's

624
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:10,158
like this plant just is special because

625
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,480
it like gathers a bunch of them together

626
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,278
rather than just being a plant that's

627
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,519
high like the pine needle that's high

628
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:18,000
and maybe Alpha Pine right um well this

629
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:20,519
cannabis plant can have that but it also

630
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,679
has THC it also has you know some of

631
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:23,879
these other maybe CBD that's what I

632
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:26,240
think the

633
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,440
biggest thing that I'm a little

634
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,319
disappointed in in the Cannabis field of

635
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,960
of of today is is we deal with a lot of

636
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:35,759
extremes everything's pushing for the

637
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,480
highest THC or the highest CBD the

638
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:42,679
highest whatever when I think the

639
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:46,079
medicine is more in a balance is more in

640
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:48,600
you know multiple different uh levels of

641
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:50,558
them in in a right mix and because every

642
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:51,639
human body is a little bit different and

643
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:52,798
people might react a little bit

644
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,480
differently they've got to find the

645
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:58,960
cultiv for them that's what I found as a

646
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:01,038
caregiver is um it made me to what I'm

647
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,480
now I call myself the Perpetual pheno

648
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:05,679
Hunter because uh it made me realize

649
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,079
that you know if I smoke something it

650
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,320
might not be super great for me but my

651
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:12,079
buddy can smoke it and it might help him

652
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:15,480
with his back or it might help him

653
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:18,599
something else and uh that's valuable

654
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:21,240
information for that person at least and

655
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:23,079
um and then when we get the human the

656
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,240
whole human consensus together and start

657
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:28,038
saying you know I love seeing sites like

658
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:31,359
that like hey so and so said this strain

659
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:33,200
works really good for XYZ and my mom you

660
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:34,398
know suffers from XYZ so I'm going to

661
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,000
get me some seeds of that and I'm going

662
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:38,519
to give it to her and we'll see if if it

663
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,558
works and uh when that stuff actually

664
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:41,918
works when when that stuff works out

665
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:43,519
like that we like well someone said this

666
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,120
works this all the way down like Gorilla

667
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:50,679
Glue was a good example my mom really

668
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:53,918
liked that um for her joint pains and

669
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:56,399
uh it's just like you feel like you're

670
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,440
the scientist in that you're the the the

671
00:25:56,398 --> 00:26:01,558
guy running the test to see you know

672
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,960
know if the rumors are true but for sure

673
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:05,879
but with cannabis it's like the the

674
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,840
cat's out of the bag man and what

675
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:11,440
whatever the government decides to

676
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:13,119
do people know that it's healing there

677
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,080
there's too many you want to call it

678
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:16,798
antidotal evidence sure you can call it

679
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:17,960
that for sure because you you the

680
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:20,240
government has made it so you can't

681
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,759
study it um until it gets off that first

682
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,440
schedule so sure it's antidotal evidence

683
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:28,679
but these are antidotal people walking

684
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:30,880
around alive today uh not suffering so

685
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:33,000
you know what is that worth yeah what

686
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,600
how how much of a test size do you need

687
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,759
like a test population do you need for

688
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:39,439
it to no longer be anecdotal um you know

689
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:41,319
like and I feel like there's definitely

690
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,880
there's enough data out there for

691
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:48,359
someone to aggregate together and create

692
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:52,640
an actual uh like a metadata study to to

693
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:55,398
create you know um a non anecdotal

694
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,038
approach to explaining why certain

695
00:26:55,398 --> 00:27:00,158
things do what they do when they come

696
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:01,599
from cannabis and yeah you're absolutely

697
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,440
right though it's uh you know it's

698
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:06,480
schedule one so it's heroin right uh and

699
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:10,320
and no one's going to provide funding

700
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:14,440
and research at a significant level to

701
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:16,519
um to study that um unless you you have

702
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:19,240
some I feel like it's almost like you

703
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:21,480
have to find some Ecentric individual

704
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,200
who is willing to go against the system

705
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:27,159
because they don't care or they're

706
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,159
passionate about it and but I feel like

707
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:32,440
that's far and few in between and a lot

708
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:35,360
more people that are at that level of um

709
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,038
social uh privilege are probably more

710
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:38,918
interested in the culture of cannabis

711
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:42,359
than the medicine behind it at least

712
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:45,159
that's what I've seen

713
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:47,038
um yeah it but you're absolutely right

714
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:49,360
like you know we can call it anecdotal

715
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:51,759
but if we see it working then we can

716
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:54,240
just continue to promote it um as

717
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:56,278
individuals and like you do on so many

718
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,960
different platforms and you know I I

719
00:27:56,278 --> 00:28:03,398
feel like uh the fact that you go and

720
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:05,558
you talk to um like politicians and you

721
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:08,839
you bring people out for demonstrations

722
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:11,038
to uh promote the you know the

723
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:12,240
information that's out there and and not

724
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:16,839
for it to

725
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:19,038
be put behind these sort of uh stigmatic

726
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:20,879
barriers where people are like I'm not

727
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:22,919
even going to talk about that because uh

728
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,880
you know my grandma told me that when

729
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:27,240
people smoke cannabis they start

730
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,799
worshiping the devil and I'm a devout

731
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,079
Christian so I'm not even going to

732
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:33,639
consider that um you know it's everyone

733
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:35,319
has their encampments and it's really

734
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,120
hard to break free of some of those and

735
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:38,918
so I I do believe you're absolutely

736
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:41,959
correct it's almost like the dinosaurs

737
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:46,000
need to go extinct in order for the the

738
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:48,720
new um the new mentalities to Prevail um

739
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,558
right I do have one for like you bring

740
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,759
that up it automatically Clicks in my

741
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:54,960
brain um if if I get a religious like

742
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:57,798
especially on especially in the

743
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,640
Christian side of things um push back on

744
00:28:57,798 --> 00:29:02,398
on the use of cannabis I like to remind

745
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,720
them of of the passage I believe it's

746
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:07,959
Genesis that says that uh that they

747
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:11,079
basically God gave us all seed bearing

748
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,840
plants and uh even though we try to keep

749
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:15,079
Ours from uh having seeds they all come

750
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:18,158
from a seed they are seed bearing plants

751
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:20,759
so we like theia but the SAS are all

752
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:23,039
right

753
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:25,240
yeah there's evidence I've seen some

754
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:29,480
compelling arguments that uh in the

755
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:31,880
early uh oils THC could have or uh

756
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,798
cannabis could have been in there or in

757
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,519
the Holy anointing oils or even uh what

758
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,759
they burned is in the incense as they

759
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:41,200
walked up and down sure I mean look at

760
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:44,158
the uh original assassin order that were

761
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:47,038
called the hashashin who smoked hash in

762
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,919
order to put them in a mindset to um

763
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:52,480
have this almost religious uh experience

764
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:55,600
that they were like tying into their uh

765
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:59,319
culture of uh political assassinations

766
00:29:55,599 --> 00:30:01,959
and so like it there's

767
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:04,398
definitely the ability to tie uh

768
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,840
cannabis into a higher power or an ENT

769
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:08,798
like a higher entity if that's uh you

770
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:11,678
know how you live your life or what you

771
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:12,918
like to believe in so it's there there's

772
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,600
historical evidence for it you're

773
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:17,440
absolutely right and just consuming

774
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:20,240
cannabis I like to call it a life

775
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,679
enhancer because um not only is it

776
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,399
medicinal right it definitely is

777
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:27,159
medicinal but for me I'm I'm a big lover

778
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:29,959
of Music it makes music so much better I

779
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:32,559
pick out more in I used to play in a in

780
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,558
a band in school so like like I can kind

781
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:35,759
of pick out all the different

782
00:30:33,558 --> 00:30:37,319
instruments and and like sometimes I'll

783
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:38,798
hear like a whole instrument that I

784
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:40,480
never even knew was in the song like

785
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:43,359
what the when where did that come from

786
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,919
but now I never can't hear it right so

787
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:47,639
unlock something or a more Focus or or

788
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,480
whatever it could be but like there's so

789
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,919
many EX food food tastes so much better

790
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,319
you know what I mean so um whatever

791
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:57,200
you're doing of course why not like go

792
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:58,678
to church high of course that would be a

793
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,919
more religious

794
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:02,840
uh experience and I don't understand why

795
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:05,799
a church would want to discourage that

796
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:09,199
but uh for sure yeah I think uh I think

797
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:10,798
Canabis 100% has its place in a lot of

798
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,399
in a lot of places because of that

799
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:16,200
because it's a life enhancer

800
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:19,199
man yeah I mean like to to even have

801
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,960
like someone like uh Ralph uh Mulan I

802
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,200
believe is his name who the guy that

803
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,960
discovered the endoc canab anoid system

804
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,919
we're like it is it is as real as our

805
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:30,200
nervous system it is as real as our c

806
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,679
ulatory system and for it to not even be

807
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,679
taught in medical schools yet or at

808
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:37,320
least in most medical schools and uh

809
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:39,880
medical disciplines yeah it's it's

810
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:43,319
almost a travest it is a travesty you

811
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:46,679
know it's um it's like willful blindness

812
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:49,678
uh yeah or yeah just willful ignorance I

813
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:52,360
should say well that's why I love the uh

814
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:55,240
the internet and I love uh the that's

815
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:58,079
the good side of social media and and

816
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,000
things like this is that uh everybody

817
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:01,398
has a voice and you can choose to listen

818
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,720
to it or not listen to it but you can

819
00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:06,038
get your voice out there you can be

820
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,600
heard and um you can get around some of

821
00:32:06,038 --> 00:32:10,558
the smoking and that's that's kind of

822
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:13,519
put in front of you by governments that

823
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:15,278
want to try to steer you in one way or

824
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,159
the other to be able to talk to other

825
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:20,159
people who may have experienced things

826
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:21,600
that you haven't uh could really open

827
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,440
your eyes can really open your eyes to

828
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:26,079
other points of view which is a scary

829
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,600
thing for a government it is they like

830
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:30,839
you to think in a specific way

831
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:32,439
um you know we've we've kind of gotten a

832
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:33,959
little off topic but I've Loved This

833
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,320
Thread so I haven't tried to slow us

834
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,679
down but I'm going to try and steer us

835
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:39,918
back a little bit towards cultivation

836
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,159
because um I want to I want to have

837
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:46,519
people know a little bit more about your

838
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:48,760
cultivation Journey um so was was the

839
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:51,319
first cannabis plants that you grew

840
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:54,679
after you had a

841
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:58,480
caregiver uh card or were you um you

842
00:32:54,679 --> 00:33:00,600
know did you ever do any uh gorilla grow

843
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,798
or you know pop a couple seeds when you

844
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:05,439
were younger or anything like that or

845
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:07,319
you know what what what uh yeah what was

846
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,360
like the first experience growing

847
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:13,240
cannabis I guess I was pretty uh I was

848
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:14,879
pretty uh late into the game really when

849
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,319
it came to Growing I didn't do any

850
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,278
Gorilla growing I I mean I have since

851
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:21,798
but not before that um most of the

852
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:23,359
Gorilla growing is just all outdoor

853
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:25,638
grows like I'm going to throw an extra

854
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:29,079
couple plants outside just to get you

855
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:31,879
know a bunch more so I can make more oil

856
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:34,000
for people or something and uh

857
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:36,840
especially like nowadays I'm thinking of

858
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,558
doing that with funny enough CBD it's

859
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:40,798
like I could throw a couple plants out

860
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,398
there and grow you know a couple pounds

861
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:44,398
of CBD throw it in the freezer and I

862
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:47,398
have enough to just mix in every little

863
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:49,719
batch um to to make it that more diverse

864
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:52,439
and uh that is the plan going forward

865
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:55,038
but um my first plants were grown as a

866
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:58,038
caregiver and I started out in cocoa and

867
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:59,278
five gallon pots and I believe

868
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:02,079
I don't remember if they were fabric

869
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:03,440
pots or plastic pots at the time but uh

870
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:08,799
I know I moved to

871
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:11,079
fabric uh shortly after but I hated how

872
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,119
uh the they you had to water extremely

873
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:16,000
slow or you lose a lot of your water

874
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:19,480
yeah so I uh pretty quickly went away

875
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,079
from fabric pots and and stayed with uh

876
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,800
plastic pots and and cocoa is is how I

877
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,320
did probably the first two or three

878
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:29,320
years before I started playing around

879
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,919
with uh organic growing at

880
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:37,200
home and really it was out of a I'm not

881
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:38,358
a huge fan of having to measure out 12

882
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,918
bottles of

883
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:42,960
nutrients and I wasn't a fan of the

884
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:47,039
quality when I measured out of three

885
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:49,199
bottles of nutrients so so for me it was

886
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:50,639
more a push to make it easier and people

887
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,519
say oh you can just throw water on it

888
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,800
and you're good you don't even have to

889
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:56,320
PE that [ __ ] you know and I was like

890
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,880
what and I'm not one person to say

891
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,160
you're full of [ __ ] I don't believe you

892
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,640
I'm the one to be like all right I'll

893
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:04,239
try one plant I'll see see what it's

894
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:07,078
about see if you're full of [ __ ] or not

895
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:10,199
you know what I mean and uh I quickly

896
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:13,320
found uh sub irrigated Planters or sip

897
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:16,199
containers and all that is is a pot it's

898
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,760
a pot with a a reservoir below it and

899
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:20,519
the water Wicks up so you can water it

900
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:24,320
and and the plant kind

901
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:25,920
of drinks water at its own rate like a

902
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,800
city picker or something like that right

903
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,480
City picker my absolute favorite one you

904
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,680
get them right at Home Depot it's

905
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,519
available to most everybody the first

906
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:37,719
time I grew a tomato in one of those I

907
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:40,880
was blown away at how big a tomato could

908
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:43,679
get in such a small pot and I feel like

909
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,599
it's this combination of like uh

910
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:47,799
Hydroponics where you get this like

911
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:52,800
availability of water that you wouldn't

912
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:56,280
normally get in um like just like a like

913
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,599
an like a soil like a a sand Silton clay

914
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,359
um outside uh like it's just you you

915
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:03,119
lose a lot of water availability to The

916
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:04,920
Matrix potential but when you have that

917
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,640
sub irrigated plantern like you can you

918
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,960
can put anything in that top part really

919
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:12,039
as long as you get those roots down into

920
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,400
that water you're golden yeah and and

921
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:15,800
they like you said they act like they're

922
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,119
in a much bigger space they they get you

923
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,640
can get some monster plants in in a sip

924
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:21,960
container and uh I've even done multiple

925
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:23,519
plants in a sip container but I still

926
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,240
like to do you know I'm in a plant count

927
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,920
state so I like to do if it wasn't a

928
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:29,279
plant count State I would be on much

929
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,240
smaller plants than just harvesting

930
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,800
colas believe me just

931
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:36,679
regulation um and for Organics it's

932
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,560
better to grow probably a bigger pot

933
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:42,279
anyway but once I found sip containers

934
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:43,759
uh there was no looking back man it was

935
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:47,440
so much easier for me and then I got

936
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,359
into organic soils and and wow that's an

937
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,480
onion that's as big as this world that

938
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:54,119
you can peel back and get layers until

939
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,519
your dying day so you can forever have

940
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,358
something to dig into to keep yourself

941
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:00,559
uh more more interested in growing

942
00:36:58,358 --> 00:37:02,078
because absolutely there's there's so

943
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:04,279
many fights just within the organic

944
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,680
Community who's organic enough you know

945
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,119
and

946
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:09,719
uh it could be ridiculous I'm trying to

947
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:10,920
be I'm trying to be The Peacemaker guy

948
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:12,799
like look guys we're all cannabis

949
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,318
Growers that's awesome can we agree on

950
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,318
that can we age it's like there's the

951
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:18,960
two encampments of like the practice of

952
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:20,679
Organics versus the religion of Organics

953
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,240
yeah um where like some people don't

954
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:23,960
even want to hear if somebody else is

955
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:26,559
doing it another way and it's like you

956
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,199
guys are both growing Organics let's uh

957
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:30,480
let's just try to share knowledge rather

958
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:33,559
than say that mine's better than yours

959
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,679
yeah and and everybody's Situation's

960
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:36,000
different and their environment is

961
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:37,960
different so you know something that

962
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,119
works really good for me might suck for

963
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:42,599
somebody you know in California or

964
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:45,200
somebody in Texas who knows depending on

965
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:47,119
the environment right so you know I I I

966
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:51,199
always I found that out myself the hard

967
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:54,000
way and so I don't try to try to

968
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:55,719
um I don't know I don't I don't try to

969
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,960
fault people for not really knowing that

970
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:59,199
so much but for sure I'm just here

971
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,358
trying to get people

972
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:02,799
growing absolutely I mean that's the end

973
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:05,358
goal right is just get more people

974
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:08,599
growing um when you were first starting

975
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:10,799
out in the Sip containers were you uh

976
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:14,920
sticking with like Coco quar and feeding

977
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:17,440
it um a hydroponic uh fertilizer or or

978
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:21,000
did you immediately switch over to a

979
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:23,358
like amended substrate or soilless media

980
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,838
uh you know with uh like organic meals

981
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:28,039
and things like that with like the high

982
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:29,880
uh biological activity

983
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:33,279
I went with just a I went with just a

984
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,880
bag soil a locally baged soil uh from it

985
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,800
was called M3 mix it's actually pretty

986
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,480
popular yeah and um here in Michigan and

987
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,760
I just dumped that in my sip container

988
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,240
threw away all the crap that came with

989
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,200
the Sip container as far as nutrients

990
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:49,679
went and well I didn't throw it away I

991
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:51,598
set to the side to use outside but but

992
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:54,239
uh and I just wanted to see because the

993
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,800
the the bag of soil said water only soil

994
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:57,679
too so I'm going to test this stuff I'm

995
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,960
going to see you know and so I did that

996
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:02,440
and put it in a container at the same

997
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,599
time and got great results and uh and

998
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:07,400
for the longest time I would replace my

999
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:09,800
soil I would take the I would at the end

1000
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,838
of harvest I would take that uh soil

1001
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,160
block that pot that sip container take

1002
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:16,519
it out to my compost pile and dump it

1003
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:18,279
nice I did that you know and then I the

1004
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:20,039
next spring I'd be digging out of that

1005
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,839
compost pile to build beds for my

1006
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:23,880
vegetable gardens or something but uh

1007
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:26,759
those were probably great beds oh it's

1008
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,519
so good dude one one round of Michigan

1009
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,560
made mix

1010
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:33,838
yeah yeah it makes me think of like

1011
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:36,119
building like 4x8 beds with like build a

1012
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:37,639
soil 3.0 now you're it's like that's

1013
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:41,318
going to be the best vegetable garden

1014
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:44,719
for like 10 years yeah exactly tons of

1015
00:39:41,318 --> 00:39:46,358
worms just loving it yeah but uh yeah

1016
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:48,159
but then I got to the point to where I

1017
00:39:46,358 --> 00:39:50,838
started figuring out oh you can just re

1018
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:53,039
amend the soil which makes it even

1019
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:54,799
easier now I'm not hauling these things

1020
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:56,880
outside and dumping them I'm not dumping

1021
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,519
them at all I am throwing some

1022
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,440
amendments I might dig out a a you know

1023
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:03,400
a big enough hole to plant my plant into

1024
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,920
this but uh that's really the only soil

1025
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,119
and a lot of times I can break that soil

1026
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,599
up and put it right back on top so I'm

1027
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,039
not really taking anything from it and

1028
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:12,640
I'm always just adding to what I already

1029
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,000
have and that's kind of the current

1030
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:17,318
system that I'm still doing at home my

1031
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,119
my home Garden isn't like I mean if you

1032
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:21,639
compared the triome forge with the home

1033
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:24,200
my home Garden you'd probably laugh a

1034
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:27,159
little bit because you know triome Forge

1035
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:30,679
is just like a race car right it's Coco

1036
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:33,639
it's it's nutrients and uh we're feno

1037
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:35,639
hunting all the time it's you know PVC

1038
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:37,480
walls it's like what you would dream to

1039
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:39,838
have as a as a that's what me and my

1040
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,679
buddy uh baked pone we were like we're

1041
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:45,279
just going to set it up for what we

1042
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:46,879
always wish we had nice and uh but at

1043
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,640
home it's just like it's designed for

1044
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:52,200
convenience it's still great cannabis

1045
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:54,239
it's just like you know it's just like a

1046
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:57,799
room I built out myself it's just like a

1047
00:40:54,239 --> 00:41:00,479
stick room with some uh of the Panda

1048
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,440
film and uh that's still way more than a

1049
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,880
lot of people have yeah well that's true

1050
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:07,240
that's true but it's not like what I

1051
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,519
have going on over there at all so but I

1052
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:10,118
go down there it's just like my happy

1053
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:11,519
space I'll sit in in the flower room

1054
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:13,480
just look at the plants for a while you

1055
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:14,920
know and uh such great weather

1056
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:18,920
especially in the winter

1057
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:21,039
time yeah well um let's let's break down

1058
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:24,960
your hom grow and then we'll break down

1059
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:28,000
the uh triome Forge so um since you're

1060
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:30,079
doing Organics at home let's start there

1061
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,559
and like just go through kind of what

1062
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:36,599
your general practices are um you know

1063
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:38,838
uh whether it be like like like if

1064
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:40,280
you're cloning or popping seeds or if

1065
00:41:38,838 --> 00:41:42,679
you're maintaining mother plant

1066
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,000
populations and then um like how you

1067
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:46,679
maintain those uh and then also like

1068
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,639
when you get into flower what is your

1069
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:51,719
sort of uh what's your process for

1070
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:54,318
flowering out a plant um in an organic

1071
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:58,000
amended uh soiless

1072
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:59,960
media okay great questions um

1073
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
basically I start I usually start from

1074
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:04,838
Colones for most of my plants the the

1075
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
system that I have uh in the uh the

1076
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:09,078
Coliseum we'll call it SPS Coliseum down

1077
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,719
there is is that I have keeper plants I

1078
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:15,800
have like four to five slots that I can

1079
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:18,559
keep that strain around but I'm always

1080
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,960
growing a new strain from seed and it's

1081
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:21,318
head it's going up head to-head against

1082
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,440
these other strains if it's better than

1083
00:42:21,318 --> 00:42:25,599
any one of these it's just going to

1084
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:27,880
replace it um so I'm always bringing in

1085
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,800
new genetics from seed and it it's

1086
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,280
always but the ones that I'm keeping are

1087
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,480
always improving because as I get more

1088
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,040
genetics that I like better than what I

1089
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,559
have I just replace it and I've been

1090
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:39,920
doing that since caregiver days and

1091
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:42,960
that's how I've always been able to

1092
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,960
retain my quality is that I'm constantly

1093
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,400
striving to find that better strain or

1094
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:51,159
whatever and I've cycled to quite a few

1095
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,400
of them but I'm I'm never done I don't

1096
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:55,399
think I don't know if I'll ever be done

1097
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,318
I love the feno hunt and the possibility

1098
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,639
of the next thing so usually it's going

1099
00:42:57,318 --> 00:43:01,920
to be a a cutting or it could be a seed

1100
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:04,358
but they both go into um it used to be

1101
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,480
root Riot Cubes but I've since switched

1102
00:43:04,358 --> 00:43:08,639
to veloc gr cubes which is like a

1103
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:12,559
vegetable-based

1104
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:14,239
um you said it's called veloc veloc I

1105
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:16,640
believe is the name of them I just

1106
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:20,000
started getting them and using them it's

1107
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:21,440
like almost like a biochar gel Cube so

1108
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,119
it's got a little bit of nitrogen a

1109
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,000
little bit of nutrition in there for the

1110
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,000
plant um and the different thing that

1111
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,400
makes them different is they're kind of

1112
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,440
like like a jell substance like consist

1113
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,039
consistency and uh like almost like an

1114
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,838
agar or something that you might use for

1115
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:38,639
tissue culture yeah it's very yeah

1116
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:40,000
almost like an but you just you stick it

1117
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,039
in there and then you just want the

1118
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,440
bottom to be in contact with water at

1119
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:45,719
all times so you can put them in a tray

1120
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,760
your traditional tray as long as there's

1121
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:50,039
a hole in the bottom of where what's

1122
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,680
holding your Cube and you just fill that

1123
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:53,920
bottom tray with water and let them go

1124
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:56,679
I'm right now running them without even

1125
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,358
a clone dome but my humity is pretty

1126
00:43:56,679 --> 00:44:00,919
much good it's probably 50% in there

1127
00:43:58,358 --> 00:44:04,480
anyway but um but they're sitting in

1128
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,880
water so uh that's crazy I'm a fan I

1129
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,760
like them because they break down I

1130
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:11,119
really hate how root R the the glue that

1131
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,359
they use in the root R cubes are that

1132
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,838
type of cube never seen to break down I

1133
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:18,159
find them still in my compost pile

1134
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:20,679
sometimes and it's drives me nuts you'll

1135
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:23,159
have to send me a um the name for those

1136
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:24,679
and I'll put a link in the in the show

1137
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:26,480
notes because that that's really

1138
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:28,078
fascinating cuz that's one thing that

1139
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,480
I've always found is like the closest

1140
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,559
thing that I could find for like an

1141
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,838
organic based or something that would

1142
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:36,599
break down fully in an organic media

1143
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:39,639
would be like an oasis Cube but handling

1144
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:40,720
those is a pain in the butt if if um I

1145
00:44:39,639 --> 00:44:42,358
think I've heard you say that you've

1146
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:44,399
tried them before but I know other

1147
00:44:42,358 --> 00:44:46,440
people that if they haven't you know

1148
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,880
it's like um it's like a sponge that

1149
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,559
doesn't bounce back and so like if you

1150
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:55,760
squish it at all or crunch it it just is

1151
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:59,720
no longer really viable um but so that a

1152
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:02,559
gel-based clone media and are they like

1153
00:44:59,719 --> 00:45:04,679
very um are they very sturdy or or would

1154
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:06,760
it like break apart like jello if you

1155
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:08,440
like squished it in your hand yeah if

1156
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,760
you squished it that would break apart

1157
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,760
like jello yes wow so yeah you have to

1158
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:15,680
be a little uh a little more gentle with

1159
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:19,200
them for sure and uh we actually on the

1160
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:22,639
letby buds um show on YouTube we did

1161
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:25,039
interview the guy from velos grow um so

1162
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:26,078
there's a there is a um episode that

1163
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:28,159
with all the information if you're

1164
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:30,440
interested on

1165
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:32,118
but um I've had some some pretty good

1166
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:35,079
luck so far with them I I do think that

1167
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:36,599
they they do at least I maybe I'm doing

1168
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:39,680
something wrong but they do seem to take

1169
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:43,000
a little long maybe two to little bit

1170
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:45,199
past two weeks to to germinate or to get

1171
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,559
Roots but I'm not picking them up

1172
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:48,318
because they're kind of gentle because

1173
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:51,000
normally I'd be grabbing the stems just

1174
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:52,400
looking but uh I'm just like looking

1175
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,559
down and seeing if I see any Roots

1176
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,880
popping out around the edges yet and as

1177
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:58,280
soon as I see Roots popping out then

1178
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:00,079
I'll reach down in and pull on mountains

1179
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:02,720
and know that it's going to cuz if you

1180
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,680
don't have Roots if you were to pull it

1181
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:06,759
would just pull the cutting right out of

1182
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:08,159
the I mean you could stick it right back

1183
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,440
in but you're making holes and it's not

1184
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:12,118
really doesn't stay together the

1185
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,720
greatest they're working on it I guess

1186
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:16,160
another version where to be a little bit

1187
00:46:13,719 --> 00:46:17,639
tighter but I'm a big fan because they

1188
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:18,920
break down it doesn't and there's a

1189
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:20,199
little bit of nutrition in them so I can

1190
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:23,800
stick them in a

1191
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:26,679
little half gallon planter or whatever

1192
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:28,519
and uh with that after they get a couple

1193
00:46:26,679 --> 00:46:30,399
roots and they still have nutrition for

1194
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:32,400
a while I don't even have to give it

1195
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,079
food if I didn't want to but after I get

1196
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,519
it rooted after I get a rooted cut or a

1197
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:41,079
Seedling which I also put in a cube um

1198
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:44,358
I'll just uh plant that into usually

1199
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:47,599
like a solo cup size like a half gallon

1200
00:46:44,358 --> 00:46:49,239
uh just to get them started once they uh

1201
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,680
are ready to transplant out of that they

1202
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:54,039
usually it's two things it'll either go

1203
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:55,960
into a one gon pot or directly into my

1204
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:59,039
sip container and what makes that

1205
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:01,720
determination is is do I have room for

1206
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:03,119
it in the vegro into a big pot or does

1207
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:05,279
it have to stay in a smaller pot for

1208
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,559
right now the reason I say that is I run

1209
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,800
a Perpetual grow which means that I have

1210
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:12,680
a one light flower right now and uh but

1211
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,760
I have four plants underneath that one

1212
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:18,358
light but each plant is at a different

1213
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:20,880
age so as one plant goes out I put

1214
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:23,558
another plant in and but this way I'm

1215
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,480
harvesting more often I'm harvesting a

1216
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:28,839
plant you know what I mean every

1217
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,679
whatever the hell that that goes out to

1218
00:47:28,838 --> 00:47:33,119
because if if you figure I usually like

1219
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:34,598
2.5 weeks or 2.3 weeks or something yeah

1220
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,318
depending on what your Harvest window is

1221
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:38,880
like I say I usually go about nine weeks

1222
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:41,519
on most of my strains so cool but

1223
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,960
anyways you get a more consistent supply

1224
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:45,960
of cannabis that way instead of get all

1225
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:49,838
at once and what's more important for me

1226
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:51,760
is it's a lower amount of work right so

1227
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:53,400
I'd rather take that workload that same

1228
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,000
workload instead of doing it all at once

1229
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:57,280
I'd rather get it and divide it up by

1230
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,719
four like the four plantsing one at a

1231
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,839
time rather than having to do all four

1232
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:03,078
plants at once so for me it just works

1233
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:04,838
my assist a lot better that way because

1234
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:07,440
of that I can't really change the light

1235
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:08,639
cycles too much to be too crazy in the

1236
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,760
flower room because they're all the

1237
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:12,558
different stages of of growth if I

1238
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:14,240
wanted to you know suppress the stretch

1239
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,040
but the other plant in there is at the

1240
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:17,879
end of harvest that's kind of

1241
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:20,279
counterintuitive to do different things

1242
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,480
but so what I'm doing as far as light

1243
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:26,359
cycles in the flower room is I'm I do

1244
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:28,519
simulate the The Daily Sun in a way I

1245
00:48:26,358 --> 00:48:30,598
start out with a more red warm Spectrum

1246
00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:33,679
during the middle during the beginning

1247
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:36,039
of the day then um in the middle part of

1248
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:40,000
the light cycle the middle 3 hours it

1249
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:42,920
goes to almost all blue almost pure blue

1250
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:46,239
and then it goes back down to uh more

1251
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:49,559
Reds at the end and the reason I do that

1252
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:52,199
is um it's a way for me to sneak more

1253
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:54,160
blue light into the flower cycle so that

1254
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:56,960
I can get that increased cannabinoid

1255
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:59,239
production from that and so far I've

1256
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,519
I've had good results doing it that way

1257
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:02,679
under my schedule otherwise I'd be doing

1258
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:06,119
all kinds of weird stuff if they were

1259
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:09,838
all in the same light cycle or the same

1260
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:12,760
uh age I should say I go from from I go

1261
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:15,358
from that small pot so we'll call it a a

1262
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:18,160
either a cup or a or a gallon it goes

1263
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:20,400
into a sip container and honestly after

1264
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:22,598
it gets into a sip container and this is

1265
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,160
all judged by how do you judge when

1266
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:25,599
you're going to transplant up or

1267
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:28,440
whatever it's all judged by the size of

1268
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:31,559
the plant and so my veg basically has

1269
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:33,000
always got plants in it and my only rule

1270
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:34,839
is if it's leaving the veg room I have

1271
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,838
to have a clone or a cut somewhere in

1272
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:39,798
the Vroom and if it's uh going into a

1273
00:49:38,838 --> 00:49:42,239
sip

1274
00:49:39,798 --> 00:49:45,000
container it's going to have to or if

1275
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:47,479
it's yeah if it's going into a sip

1276
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,280
container I want to make sure that at

1277
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:53,679
that time uh I'm pulling my clone

1278
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:55,519
usually because then I'll have I'll have

1279
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:57,480
an answer to Is it do I have a rooted

1280
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:59,920
clone when this is ready to come out of

1281
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,240
the veg room if I don't have a rooted

1282
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,920
clone when I'm coming out of the veg

1283
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:06,239
room I might consider skipping that

1284
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:09,400
plant until I do and take another plant

1285
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:11,159
um I've I've lost too many strains that

1286
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,798
I've really liked because I tried to

1287
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:14,639
rush something into from the veg into

1288
00:50:12,798 --> 00:50:16,318
the flower room but I didn't have I had

1289
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:18,199
a cut taken but I didn't have it rooted

1290
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:21,000
yet well that root of course that cut

1291
00:50:18,199 --> 00:50:22,399
didn't root right and so now now I'm in

1292
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,119
flower and I'm looking at a REV

1293
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:29,358
situation and uh those a lot of times

1294
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:30,519
you get mixed results so I've changed my

1295
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:32,639
thing a little bit and make sure that I

1296
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:34,000
always have them backed up and then

1297
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:35,719
after that after the veg so I couldn't

1298
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,039
tell you how long of a veg I have

1299
00:50:35,719 --> 00:50:38,679
because it depends on the plant I have a

1300
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:39,960
Mac 1 that might veg for two freaking

1301
00:50:38,679 --> 00:50:41,919
months because it's such a slow grower

1302
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:44,318
in veg but she shows out in

1303
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,480
flower um but I don't really stress

1304
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:48,000
about it I just plant plant the I put

1305
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,679
the plants in as they get bigger they

1306
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,358
get moved up and then when I take a

1307
00:50:50,679 --> 00:50:54,318
plant out of the flower room and I'm

1308
00:50:52,358 --> 00:50:55,798
harvesting I don't like to have a open

1309
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:56,920
hole in the flower room I always say no

1310
00:50:55,798 --> 00:51:00,000
open holes in the flower room room I

1311
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:01,838
like to always fill the Hol so I'll take

1312
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,519
whatever the biggest plant is in veg if

1313
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:05,960
I don't have one that I feel is

1314
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:08,440
completely ready I'd still rather take

1315
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,838
one that's almost ready out of veg than

1316
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:13,079
have light hit the floor it should be

1317
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:16,000
hitting plant material for sure um

1318
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:19,680
before you go into your uh your uh

1319
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,039
flowering cycle practices um you know th

1320
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:24,159
this is something that I just talked

1321
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:26,639
about uh on one of the most recent uh

1322
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:29,480
The Way We Grow podcasts with uh two can

1323
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:34,879
Sam uh from Instagram cuz he also runs

1324
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:37,039
Perpetual uh flower and um you know IPM

1325
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,039
for me is one of those uh the big

1326
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:42,880
questions when it comes to Perpetual

1327
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:45,358
Cycles uh so what what do you do for IPM

1328
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:49,640
uh whether it be in veg or in

1329
00:51:45,358 --> 00:51:51,960
flower so in flower or in in veg I I do

1330
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:54,239
your traditional IPM so about once a

1331
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:56,838
week and sometimes I even slack on that

1332
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,879
my IPM game is not the Super strongest I

1333
00:51:56,838 --> 00:51:59,960
do

1334
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:04,640
do and the reason for that I'll tell you

1335
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:06,480
here coming up yeah but um I do I do

1336
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:08,159
take the practice that I I gotten from

1337
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,000
the commercial industry is I have a pair

1338
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:11,480
of Crocs those are my favorite Garden

1339
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,559
shoes but I have a pair of Crocs that

1340
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:17,199
are dedicated for the garden and then um

1341
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:19,280
I used to when I was a caregiver um with

1342
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:22,039
a lot of patients when a full card I had

1343
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,480
it one time I would actually have a pair

1344
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:25,318
of Scrubs that I got at a secondhand

1345
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,519
store that I would change into to go in

1346
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:27,838
there too that way I'm not taking any

1347
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:31,719
anything into the

1348
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:34,759
grow um and then once a week I would uh

1349
00:52:31,719 --> 00:52:36,558
spray a oilbased spray usually Lost

1350
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:39,119
Coast plant therapy is probably one of

1351
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:40,920
my favorite ones um I've just had great

1352
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:42,480
results with it um the only thing I'd

1353
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:45,000
ever do to add to it is if I was

1354
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,798
fighting thrips I would add an equal

1355
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:52,119
amount of isopropyl alcohol to the mix

1356
00:52:47,798 --> 00:52:55,199
so if I'm using 30 ml of Lost Coast in a

1357
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:57,000
gallon I'd use 30 m of iso as well and

1358
00:52:55,199 --> 00:53:01,519
that really helps to dry them out and

1359
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:03,440
and take them out a 70% or a 90% or on

1360
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:09,318
the iso I think the stuff that I used

1361
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:12,880
was in the 90s cool 92% or something but

1362
00:53:09,318 --> 00:53:16,719
um but as far as and then um I used to

1363
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:19,318
use predator bugs uh often but uh now i'

1364
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:21,519
I've completely replaced Predator bugs

1365
00:53:19,318 --> 00:53:24,199
and um in my flower rooms I'm running

1366
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:27,119
the Predator lights from J Grandmaster

1367
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:31,000
LEDs and what that is is it's a UV SE

1368
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:35,119
light and it's new to us but not new at

1369
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:38,159
all in the industry um we happened upon

1370
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:40,599
the uh the CEO of Grandmaster LEDs

1371
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:43,159
happened to cross a expired patent on a

1372
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:45,559
UVC light and uh that's how we began our

1373
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:47,440
journey on it and doing our research on

1374
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:51,319
it but um they've been using it in like

1375
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,720
the Netherlands UVC light to because not

1376
00:53:51,318 --> 00:53:55,558
only for pest control but they've been

1377
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:58,318
using it for uh molds and things because

1378
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:59,680
they have such much stricter um

1379
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:02,440
regulations on what they can use and

1380
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:04,000
spray on their plants there and they

1381
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:06,880
have like these big booms that just

1382
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:10,318
bring the UVC lights and and bathe the

1383
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:12,000
plants and the lights uh automatically

1384
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:15,079
what we've done on on these lights is

1385
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,519
they just hang under canopy facing up to

1386
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:19,480
where the bugs usually like to hang out

1387
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:21,358
uh underneath they kind of hide from the

1388
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:23,960
the light a little

1389
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:26,558
bit and then uh they also run that in

1390
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:29,519
the night cycle so they act almost cuz

1391
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:31,920
they do UVC still does have some visible

1392
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:33,719
light so it does emit some light but

1393
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,559
it's not enough to trigger the photo

1394
00:54:33,719 --> 00:54:37,679
receptor so you don't lose your you know

1395
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:39,119
you don't have any Herm Hermes or

1396
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:41,039
anything like that it doesn't uh you

1397
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:43,240
don't lose your photo period doesn't

1398
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:45,119
doesn't disrupt the the scoto period

1399
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:46,759
exactly it doesn't interrupt it at all

1400
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,440
but it acts like a bug Light in that in

1401
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:51,359
a dark room that little bit of light

1402
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:54,720
attracts the the pests kind of towards

1403
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:57,719
it uh and then the UVC just nukes their

1404
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:59,480
DNA and it makes it so that they don't

1405
00:54:57,719 --> 00:55:02,879
reproduce very well and then eventually

1406
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:05,240
they will just die um I've been running

1407
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,798
those prototypes and now the actual

1408
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:10,399
launch units in my flower room for

1409
00:55:07,798 --> 00:55:14,440
almost a year now and it's made me so

1410
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:18,200
lazy so lazy with the with the IPM and

1411
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:19,960
uh but the reason I don't use them in my

1412
00:55:18,199 --> 00:55:21,519
in my vegro is for one I don't have a

1413
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:25,639
set in there and but for

1414
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:27,159
two I don't technically have a I don't

1415
00:55:25,639 --> 00:55:30,960
technically keep other

1416
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:33,639
plants um but I do you know clone

1417
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,079
consistently off the plants in there so

1418
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:38,440
I don't know if UVC I mean I do know

1419
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:41,200
that the UVC is damaging the DNA of the

1420
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:44,039
pests right I don't know if the UVC is

1421
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:45,798
enough to damage the the DNA of the

1422
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:48,599
plants but if it

1423
00:55:45,798 --> 00:55:50,960
were if it were those plants get

1424
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:53,599
harvested and don't get cloned anyway so

1425
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,079
if there is any kind of small DNA change

1426
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,760
or whatever like that I'm protecting

1427
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:59,400
myself from that by taking that clone

1428
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:01,200
from the veg that isn't treated with UVC

1429
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:05,318
from a plant that hasn't been exposed to

1430
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:06,838
it um that a great keep the DNA yeah so

1431
00:56:05,318 --> 00:56:08,759
that's just the one step and that's why

1432
00:56:06,838 --> 00:56:10,679
I'm still doing the sprays in my veg

1433
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,039
because my veg kind of is my mother room

1434
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:13,558
if you want to call those mother plants

1435
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:14,880
they are getting clones taken off them I

1436
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:17,079
guess you could call those mothers but

1437
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:19,119
I'm not specifically saving the plant

1438
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:20,760
for long periods of time that I'm

1439
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:22,960
cutting off of because I think that's

1440
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:26,680
just a a bank

1441
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:28,960
to get pests or diseases or whatever the

1442
00:56:26,679 --> 00:56:32,480
longer a plant's alive the longer it's

1443
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:34,079
you know able to uh pick up those

1444
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,039
diseases and I think plants that sit in

1445
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:38,318
pots and get root bound and and do that

1446
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:40,480
are more apt to that than plants that

1447
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:43,358
are actively growing and getting potted

1448
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,960
up so if you can just take a clone and

1449
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:47,119
get that clone growing you can get rid

1450
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:49,358
of that Mom plant if you're not going to

1451
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:52,039
flower it out in my opinion or in my

1452
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:55,480
system we've found in the commercial

1453
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:57,400
space that um the more often you clone a

1454
00:56:55,480 --> 00:57:00,838
plant the more Vigor and health you

1455
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:03,119
maintain and then also um through like

1456
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:06,558
cuz we would we always wash our our slip

1457
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:08,680
cuttings um before we stick them and so

1458
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:10,960
that's like an extra barrier to make

1459
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:14,038
sure that the

1460
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,480
um that uh any bug populations are going

1461
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:17,240
through multiple treatments throughout

1462
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:21,920
all the different stages of the the

1463
00:57:17,239 --> 00:57:24,679
plants uh life cycle um but I you know

1464
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:26,760
that's that's really fascinating so if I

1465
00:57:24,679 --> 00:57:28,919
remember correctly I think

1466
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:32,200
I the you were the first person I ever

1467
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:35,639
heard using wettable sulfur in uh

1468
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:37,239
cannabis cultivation um you know three

1469
00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:40,118
or four years ago when I was listening

1470
00:57:37,239 --> 00:57:42,239
to the cheap hom Grow Show um but it

1471
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:45,838
sounds like you've moved towards uh

1472
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:48,199
oilbased in your veg uh cycle or in your

1473
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:51,798
veg space so I'm assuming that you're

1474
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:54,798
not using sulfur anymore um but what

1475
00:57:51,798 --> 00:57:56,838
what made you go away from that so what

1476
00:57:54,798 --> 00:57:59,679
a sulfur I still have in my Arsenal

1477
00:57:56,838 --> 00:58:01,639
that's still my in my uh in my tool belt

1478
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:03,759
we'll say um and what I would use that

1479
00:58:01,639 --> 00:58:05,960
for is for the tougher like for me the

1480
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,200
only thing that I I've been let me knock

1481
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,679
on some wood here but the things that

1482
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:11,798
I've been struggling with mostly that

1483
00:58:08,679 --> 00:58:14,598
show up in my garden uh would be a thrip

1484
00:58:11,798 --> 00:58:18,199
and uh I just found that wable sulur is

1485
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:18,200
not very effective on trips

1486
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:24,358
and but it's very effective on spider

1487
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:26,400
mites and in a lot of the mites so um if

1488
00:58:24,358 --> 00:58:29,558
i' that was the second one that I would

1489
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:32,559
get is i' occasionally still get spider

1490
00:58:29,559 --> 00:58:34,480
mites um and uh when that happened

1491
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:37,720
that's when the wable sulfur comes out

1492
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:39,559
one thing to remember with sulfur is for

1493
00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:41,118
one it's a plant nutrient and it's one

1494
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:42,720
that the that cannabis specifically

1495
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:46,519
likes a lot and I think it's kind of the

1496
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:49,318
key to a lot of the skunky smellier more

1497
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:51,318
on the foul foul and um volatile

1498
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:53,960
compounds whether that be a turine or an

1499
00:58:51,318 --> 00:58:55,279
Esther or something like that and um if

1500
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:56,880
you want if you have a skunk plant and

1501
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,319
it's well there's all these fruity

1502
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,798
skunks but if there's a skunk that you

1503
00:58:58,318 --> 00:59:02,358
say is skunky give it a little extra

1504
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:04,920
salt for maybe some epson salts and see

1505
00:59:02,358 --> 00:59:06,519
if you get a little bit more skunky but

1506
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,358
uh being able to spray that on your

1507
00:59:06,519 --> 00:59:11,400
plant it's almost like a fure well it is

1508
00:59:08,358 --> 00:59:14,239
a fure uh not only does it have the

1509
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:15,720
effect of pretty much nuking the mites

1510
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:17,118
but it also gives them a the plants a

1511
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:19,519
little bit of nutrition fully their

1512
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:21,880
nutrition of sulfur so it was a little

1513
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:23,318
trick of mine but uh I don't uh use it a

1514
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:25,318
lot now because I just haven't had

1515
00:59:23,318 --> 00:59:26,838
issues with spider mites um but if I

1516
00:59:25,318 --> 00:59:28,279
were to have issues the spider might I

1517
00:59:26,838 --> 00:59:29,759
would break that sulfur back I still

1518
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:31,280
have the same bag that's the great thing

1519
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,640
about wettable sulfur is you're not

1520
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:37,200
buying water it's all powdered you mix

1521
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:38,960
it in and uh it lasts I think forever

1522
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:43,239
yeah so I don't see how it could go bad

1523
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:45,559
it's just like Elemental sulfur yeah so

1524
00:59:43,239 --> 00:59:48,479
yeah I I still do I haven't sprayed it

1525
00:59:45,559 --> 00:59:50,720
recently but I would I would I wouldn't

1526
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,760
the one thing I would have caution

1527
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:56,239
people as far as sulfur is concerned is

1528
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:58,880
don't burn sulfur uh especially modernly

1529
00:59:56,239 --> 01:00:02,279
uh around LED lights it will actually

1530
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:04,119
mess up the LED uh dodes itself a lot of

1531
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:05,599
the Coatings can't deal with that sulfur

1532
01:00:04,119 --> 01:00:08,640
so if you burn sulfur you can really

1533
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:11,119
mess up an LED uh an LED fixture that

1534
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:14,519
way well I I didn't know that I mean

1535
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:17,920
I've um because I I'll spray sulfur um

1536
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:19,159
or use it as a dip um and I have noticed

1537
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,200
that

1538
01:00:19,159 --> 01:00:23,000
uh maybe it's like some sort of

1539
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:26,838
oxidative factor of it but it does seem

1540
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,960
to speed up like um iron oxidation so

1541
01:00:26,838 --> 01:00:30,400
you'll get like rust uh a little more

1542
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,838
quickly in certain areas if you're

1543
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:35,119
spraying sulfur um but that also just

1544
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:37,318
could be like the moisture content I'm

1545
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:40,000
I'm definitely not a chemical scientist

1546
01:00:37,318 --> 01:00:42,038
who could uh tell you the exact uh

1547
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,239
properties of that but what that's

1548
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:44,680
really fascinating and it's good to hear

1549
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:47,598
that you still have that in Your Arsenal

1550
01:00:44,679 --> 01:00:50,078
cuz for me that it it's like the go-to

1551
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:53,119
if I have russet mites or if I have uh

1552
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:57,880
powdery mildew populations um like those

1553
01:00:53,119 --> 01:01:01,599
two specifically it it seems to be a a

1554
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:04,318
foolproof uh approach to removing those

1555
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:06,119
heavy populations if they're there

1556
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:08,719
excellent knockdown and it it continues

1557
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:09,920
to working as it CU it dries on the leaf

1558
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:12,199
right and you see it on the leaf it

1559
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:15,039
almost looks like PM a little bit little

1560
01:01:12,199 --> 01:01:16,679
bit a little bit and um but it'll dry on

1561
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:18,559
the leaf and it'll continue to help me

1562
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:19,639
protect like if a m still happens to be

1563
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:21,119
there and cross through it it's not

1564
01:01:19,639 --> 01:01:24,239
going to be happy it's not going to be a

1565
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:26,119
happy M yeah if they're uh their style

1566
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:28,558
or whatever it is that they use to to

1567
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:31,119
like uh poke into the the plant tissue

1568
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:32,359
to absorb whatever uh nutrients or

1569
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:33,880
whatnot that they're getting from the

1570
01:01:32,358 --> 01:01:35,358
plant if they go through a sulfur

1571
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:38,798
barrier they're going to be really

1572
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:40,880
[ __ ] pissed um so yeah I'm not mad

1573
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:43,000
about I'm glad about no I I love the

1574
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:44,400
barrier there because it it also if if

1575
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,519
you're like not using sulfur and you're

1576
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:49,400
using oilbased products like uh like

1577
01:01:46,519 --> 01:01:51,239
Monterey horticultural oil or suff oil

1578
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:53,358
um you you definitely see like that

1579
01:01:51,239 --> 01:01:55,318
residue there where it's still like if

1580
01:01:53,358 --> 01:01:57,078
like you know a fungus nut flies and

1581
01:01:55,318 --> 01:02:00,278
walks around that it's it sometimes just

1582
01:01:57,079 --> 01:02:02,839
gets stuck to the the oil residue so it

1583
01:02:00,278 --> 01:02:04,760
it kind of is that like um visual

1584
01:02:02,838 --> 01:02:07,199
assurance that it it's working the way

1585
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:09,960
that you want it to work yeah and one

1586
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:12,118
caution speaking of um when you have an

1587
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,838
oil Bas if you sprayed an oilbased and

1588
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:16,119
then you you want to do wable sulfur

1589
01:02:13,838 --> 01:02:18,119
don't do those close together um they

1590
01:02:16,119 --> 01:02:20,440
don't play well together so wait a week

1591
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:23,960
or two weeks even U before you were to

1592
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:26,679
apply one or the other if I also suggest

1593
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:28,798
doing like a water uh spr down in

1594
01:02:26,679 --> 01:02:30,480
between as well um especially if you're

1595
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:31,960
going from sulfur to oil cuz you can

1596
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,039
really rinse the sulfur off really

1597
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:37,400
easily but with the oil you really need

1598
01:02:34,039 --> 01:02:39,520
to let that like uh absorb fully or or

1599
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:43,200
dissipate whatever it is that it's uh

1600
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:45,798
it's doing to no longer have that direct

1601
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:48,199
residue um yeah I've I've melted some

1602
01:02:45,798 --> 01:02:51,000
plants um hitting them with sulfur too

1603
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:53,399
close to oil and uh it's something that

1604
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,400
I I've you know I've had people be like

1605
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,240
no it can't be that bad I'm like go for

1606
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:58,798
it you know know give it a try and

1607
01:02:57,239 --> 01:03:00,558
you'll never want to do it again it's

1608
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:03,119
easy you you'll know exactly what's

1609
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:05,359
going on the next day like leaves are

1610
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:08,039
only like veins you know the the the

1611
01:03:05,358 --> 01:03:09,960
leaf matter is fully gone away it's like

1612
01:03:08,039 --> 01:03:12,160
it's like not even dead it's gone you

1613
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,159
know

1614
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:18,119
it's absolutely yeah well uh so let's

1615
01:03:16,358 --> 01:03:20,400
let's kind of uh now that we've talked a

1616
01:03:18,119 --> 01:03:24,039
little bit about your veg practices how

1617
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:26,240
you're looking to um Source your next

1618
01:03:24,039 --> 01:03:28,520
plants for your flowering cycle and the

1619
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:30,318
IPM practices that you've used up until

1620
01:03:28,519 --> 01:03:33,358
that point uh let's talk about your

1621
01:03:30,318 --> 01:03:36,159
flower cycle how you prep your uh your

1622
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:37,679
sip planters for a flower cycle and kind

1623
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:39,558
of what you do throughout the flower

1624
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:42,639
cycle for each plant to make sure that

1625
01:03:39,559 --> 01:03:45,039
it finishes the way you like so in the

1626
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:46,118
flower cycle it's um the only thing I

1627
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:49,240
like to

1628
01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:51,720
well before so right before switch maybe

1629
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:54,959
the day or maybe two days before uh I

1630
01:03:51,719 --> 01:03:59,679
like to go in look at the plant and uh I

1631
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:02,599
put a a little PVC frame on it with a um

1632
01:03:59,679 --> 01:04:06,318
a grid usually out of jute rope or

1633
01:04:02,599 --> 01:04:08,240
something and uh like a trellis nut and

1634
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:10,480
I try to shap you know I shape the plant

1635
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:12,519
a little bit underneath that trellis nut

1636
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,960
to uh spread out it's usually the nut is

1637
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:16,440
used to spread everything out a little

1638
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:18,880
bit to cuz what I look at is I look at

1639
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:20,720
the size of my planter the Sip container

1640
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:23,200
is about the size that my canopy needs

1641
01:04:20,719 --> 01:04:27,000
to fill because you can fit all four of

1642
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:28,239
those Planters per perfectly into a 4x4

1643
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,639
space and that's what I'm trying to

1644
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:33,199
flower is a 4x4 space or 5x5 if you

1645
01:04:30,639 --> 01:04:35,598
count the edges spilling over sure and

1646
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:37,159
uh and so that's what I'm doing with the

1647
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:38,720
plant is in my head it's like I'm trying

1648
01:04:37,159 --> 01:04:42,358
to get these branches out to F there's

1649
01:04:38,719 --> 01:04:45,239
no holes in my canopy and um so I will

1650
01:04:42,358 --> 01:04:47,798
do a little bit of uh lollipopping at

1651
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:49,759
this time I'll take and um bring any of

1652
01:04:47,798 --> 01:04:51,119
the really low branches that I I know

1653
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:54,520
just from experience that they'll never

1654
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:56,559
reach it to where I have the net set um

1655
01:04:54,519 --> 01:05:00,960
take them off now so that don't waste

1656
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:03,680
resources in in growing more and then uh

1657
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,838
and then um I might do some some

1658
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:07,480
defoliation at the same time make sure

1659
01:05:05,838 --> 01:05:09,960
that I have decent air flow throughout

1660
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:12,719
the canopy and then I move it into flow

1661
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:14,358
and um at that time usually within the

1662
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:18,078
first to second day of it being in

1663
01:05:14,358 --> 01:05:20,038
flower I'll do a top dress and uh I have

1664
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:22,160
two top dresses that I'll that I'll do

1665
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:25,799
throughout all of flour and the first

1666
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:29,278
top dress I do is usually a mix of I'll

1667
01:05:25,798 --> 01:05:34,719
do some worm castings I'll do

1668
01:05:29,278 --> 01:05:37,358
some uh gypsum and then I'll do a like a

1669
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:39,399
mix like a mineral blend and uh my

1670
01:05:37,358 --> 01:05:42,558
favorite one that I like to use a lot is

1671
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:45,880
craft blend from Builder soil um but I

1672
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:48,400
also have a a flowering balloon blend

1673
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:51,119
from a local Source Here country roots

1674
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:53,400
in Michigan and actually use his worm

1675
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:56,278
castings too his worm shout out country

1676
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:59,278
roots for his worm castings I got got a

1677
01:05:56,278 --> 01:06:01,159
story for you to he I grabbed a box I

1678
01:05:59,278 --> 01:06:04,039
grabbed his last bag at a booth he had

1679
01:06:01,159 --> 01:06:05,399
at an event and I said is this been

1680
01:06:04,039 --> 01:06:07,400
sitting here all day he goes yeah but

1681
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:10,119
it'll be fine I'm like okay okay so I

1682
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:11,920
grabbed it I was just busting his balls

1683
01:06:10,119 --> 01:06:14,278
you know the whole thing about if you

1684
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:15,599
buy it in a bag it's probably dead I put

1685
01:06:14,278 --> 01:06:18,039
this thing in my basement and I already

1686
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:20,440
had worm castings I was just getting low

1687
01:06:18,039 --> 01:06:23,319
so they set it sat in my basement for

1688
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:26,240
two months literally two months I just

1689
01:06:23,318 --> 01:06:28,159
opened it about two weeks ago and and uh

1690
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:29,919
I was amending some some worm castings

1691
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:33,278
and I take a scoop of worm castings out

1692
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:35,000
and living worms still yeah living live

1693
01:06:33,278 --> 01:06:37,480
worms in it still I was like all right

1694
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,079
man this is the truth so I'm a big fan

1695
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:42,400
of of of that guy's product um shout out

1696
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:44,839
to Chris out there I I have a worm bend

1697
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,440
that I just let over winter outside and

1698
01:06:44,838 --> 01:06:48,000
like you'll go in and you'll maybe find

1699
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:49,639
a few small worms wriggling around in

1700
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,760
the winter but then as soon as like you

1701
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:54,358
get that first 50 or 55 degree day I'll

1702
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:57,039
go in there a week later and all of a

1703
01:06:54,358 --> 01:06:58,880
sudden there's thousands of worms that

1704
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:01,278
have hatched and and already like are

1705
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,880
fully grown or maybe they were small and

1706
01:07:01,278 --> 01:07:05,199
I just didn't catch them before but it's

1707
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,680
it's crazy how resilient they are and

1708
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:08,199
you know as long as there's still some

1709
01:07:06,679 --> 01:07:11,399
good biological activity they're still

1710
01:07:08,199 --> 01:07:12,960
eating so and they and they can stay

1711
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:15,079
dormant in their cocoon so like when

1712
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:17,079
they you know that that little thing on

1713
01:07:15,079 --> 01:07:18,680
on the middle of the worm that everybody

1714
01:07:17,079 --> 01:07:21,119
sees will they wiggle out of that and

1715
01:07:18,679 --> 01:07:23,519
that's their that's their cocoon and the

1716
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:25,640
cocoons uh in there will pretty much

1717
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:27,318
stay dormant until the conditions are

1718
01:07:25,639 --> 01:07:28,879
perfect for him and then you'll get two

1719
01:07:27,318 --> 01:07:30,199
to three worms out of each cocoon so

1720
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,599
it's like that's how crazy you can get

1721
01:07:30,199 --> 01:07:33,519
some old worm castings that weren't

1722
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:36,559
screened to that fine of a size to pull

1723
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:39,000
the cocoons out um you can have worm

1724
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:40,240
castings in a bucket for years yeah

1725
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,318
throw some water into it and then all of

1726
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:42,239
a sudden there's worms and you're like

1727
01:07:41,318 --> 01:07:45,038
what the

1728
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:46,879
hell worms are magic what was the name

1729
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:50,000
of that guy's company again it's called

1730
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:51,880
country Roots it's in Michigan yeah he

1731
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:55,000
has got Instagram for sure uh the guy's

1732
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:57,200
name is Chris I saw him at the EV with

1733
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,199
the tri for we event different events

1734
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:01,960
and that's where I run into him a lot

1735
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:04,879
nice um yeah get back to the flower room

1736
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:07,278
uh quick question on your blends of the

1737
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:09,760
the mineral Blends that you're using um

1738
01:08:07,278 --> 01:08:13,119
so uh I'm sure people are familiar with

1739
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:15,480
the build-a soil craft blend um and then

1740
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:16,838
this this other guy's blend um and I

1741
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:19,560
think I've heard you say before that

1742
01:08:16,838 --> 01:08:22,838
you've used down to earth um like the

1743
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:26,120
biolive or the allpurpose um do either

1744
01:08:22,838 --> 01:08:29,519
of those uh you feel like um mimic or or

1745
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:32,079
are similar to um the the craft blend

1746
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,799
from builda soil uh in terms of if

1747
01:08:32,079 --> 01:08:35,519
people have one like down to earth

1748
01:08:33,798 --> 01:08:37,798
available because it's it's so

1749
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:39,520
ubiquitous what would what would be your

1750
01:08:37,798 --> 01:08:41,838
uh your choice out of those that people

1751
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:44,440
should go for I like the the Down to

1752
01:08:41,838 --> 01:08:46,798
Earth for sure the um BioLife was the

1753
01:08:44,439 --> 01:08:49,919
one that I was using um the reason I

1754
01:08:46,798 --> 01:08:51,838
like uh the one from builda soil is for

1755
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,838
one what Jeremy's doing over there with

1756
01:08:51,838 --> 01:08:55,759
every one of his inputs he doesn't take

1757
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:57,798
the manufacturer's word for it he

1758
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:59,479
independently test them to make sure for

1759
01:08:57,798 --> 01:09:01,519
in Organics we got to worry a lot about

1760
01:08:59,479 --> 01:09:03,079
heavy metals it's like the hidden the

1761
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:05,000
hidden thing and if and these plants

1762
01:09:03,079 --> 01:09:08,000
were grown or dynamic accumulators so if

1763
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:10,399
we're top dressing with heavy metals um

1764
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:13,158
or we're wrapping the pet peeve of mine

1765
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:16,198
with the whole the whole push for the

1766
01:09:13,158 --> 01:09:17,639
the copper wiring and uh they're

1767
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:19,000
wrapping around a pole and they're

1768
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:21,480
conducting electricity through or

1769
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:23,279
something whatever the copper is

1770
01:09:21,479 --> 01:09:24,879
something they test for so that's

1771
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:27,199
another heavy metal don't be sticking it

1772
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:30,798
in your soil man you don't want to smoke

1773
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:32,158
copper yeah yeah so um yeah so so he's

1774
01:09:30,798 --> 01:09:33,479
getting everything tested and and so

1775
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:36,119
he's doing the leg work and making sure

1776
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:38,559
it's great and what I really love in his

1777
01:09:36,119 --> 01:09:40,719
craft blend is he's included malted

1778
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:44,600
barley uh and I'm I've been a big

1779
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:47,679
disciple I'll say of cimus CP or Jim

1780
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:49,480
yeah uh and uh he he was the one that

1781
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:52,279
kind of turned me on to not only wor

1782
01:09:49,479 --> 01:09:53,838
castings but the uh the malted barley so

1783
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:57,480
um you don't see the malted barley in a

1784
01:09:53,838 --> 01:10:00,399
lot of those mixes so that's really um

1785
01:09:57,479 --> 01:10:02,519
what got me to go towards craft blend

1786
01:10:00,399 --> 01:10:04,198
nice awesome well thank thank you for

1787
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:06,760
that quick side note uh yeah back back

1788
01:10:04,198 --> 01:10:08,238
to your uh your flowering cycle oh yeah

1789
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,880
so that's what I usually will give it

1790
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:12,479
I'll do a top dress right when it flips

1791
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:15,079
over because it's still it's it's the

1792
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:17,519
bolt it's still going to be growing

1793
01:10:15,079 --> 01:10:19,880
vegetatively for 3 weeks probably maybe

1794
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,400
a little bit more and to give it that

1795
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,800
nutrition that's a little bit of a slow

1796
01:10:21,399 --> 01:10:24,920
digest and a little bit of fast

1797
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:27,079
digesting stuff at the same time it's

1798
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,880
just as is going to make sure that that

1799
01:10:27,079 --> 01:10:31,039
nutrition is there for the plant when

1800
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,800
it's doing that um and that's my

1801
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:35,279
strategy for that and then if I were to

1802
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:38,560
top dress anything else throughout the

1803
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:41,158
cycle it would be maybe right around

1804
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:43,520
week three to week four I might do one

1805
01:10:41,158 --> 01:10:45,439
more top dress but um something with

1806
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:48,840
more potassium in it something that's a

1807
01:10:45,439 --> 01:10:51,079
potassium heavy uh supplement and it

1808
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:53,960
might be that balloon blend that I have

1809
01:10:51,079 --> 01:10:58,119
uh that has that or it might be just a

1810
01:10:53,960 --> 01:11:01,520
um a single mineral like a like a cayos

1811
01:10:58,119 --> 01:11:03,119
or something but um right now what I'm

1812
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:06,360
using is that that bloom blend that I

1813
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:09,479
got from uh Chris over at uh country

1814
01:11:06,359 --> 01:11:11,679
roots and I'm trying that out um nice

1815
01:11:09,479 --> 01:11:13,439
another one that I really like a lot is

1816
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:15,880
um for like what I call emergency

1817
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:19,839
situations what I have what I on deck or

1818
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:23,079
just in in my tool belt is Brandon rust

1819
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:25,760
from bokashi Earthworks has his humate

1820
01:11:23,079 --> 01:11:29,640
fertilizers so there's a a nitri there

1821
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:32,079
there's a three part it's a a nitrogen b

1822
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:34,000
or a heavy nitrogen one which is the AF

1823
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:36,238
call it the one that's in the middle the

1824
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:39,880
B and then there's one at the end at C

1825
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:42,158
which is more the C is a pot more higher

1826
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:44,520
in potassium Less in nitrogen and then

1827
01:11:42,158 --> 01:11:45,839
one in the middle is just half and half

1828
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:47,679
so you don't really need to buy the one

1829
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,880
in the middle if you got the first two

1830
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:51,800
or the first one last one do they have

1831
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:54,840
any phos uh phosphorus

1832
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:58,279
content I think that the yes they they

1833
01:11:54,840 --> 01:12:00,639
all have the the um this is going off of

1834
01:11:58,279 --> 01:12:01,679
memory so I know how accurate is but uh

1835
01:12:00,639 --> 01:12:03,440
I'll try and get Brandon on here

1836
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:05,399
sometime too yeah yeah Brandon would be

1837
01:12:03,439 --> 01:12:07,439
the one to ask for sure but the nitrogen

1838
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:09,599
the one uh in veg has a little bit more

1839
01:12:07,439 --> 01:12:12,359
nitrogen but it's got like a base it

1840
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,800
covers all your bases as well but it's a

1841
01:12:12,359 --> 01:12:15,839
little bit heavier on the nitrogen

1842
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:18,440
whereas on on the opposite end of the

1843
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:20,279
things potassium it's a little bit

1844
01:12:18,439 --> 01:12:21,519
higher with low nitrogen when you go

1845
01:12:20,279 --> 01:12:24,039
into flowering just so you're not

1846
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:26,360
suppressing your your bud sights uh with

1847
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:29,359
heavy nitrogen

1848
01:12:26,359 --> 01:12:30,880
cool um awesome I mean that it sounds

1849
01:12:29,359 --> 01:12:32,399
very straightforward like you said

1850
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:34,359
you're you're trying to simplify your

1851
01:12:32,399 --> 01:12:36,158
life at home and and making it as easy

1852
01:12:34,359 --> 01:12:38,119
as possible for you and and with the Sip

1853
01:12:36,158 --> 01:12:39,359
container um how often do you feel as

1854
01:12:38,119 --> 01:12:42,439
though you're watering throughout the

1855
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:44,198
flowering cycle I'm watering um some

1856
01:12:42,439 --> 01:12:46,198
well usually it depends on the plant

1857
01:12:44,198 --> 01:12:48,879
obviously right but uh very common for

1858
01:12:46,198 --> 01:12:50,919
me to water every other day a plant will

1859
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:52,880
get water every other day I'm in there

1860
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:55,880
every day depending on the plant how the

1861
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:57,440
plant's drinking but um I've had plants

1862
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:59,760
have to have water every day and that's

1863
01:12:57,439 --> 01:13:01,238
when I water I water at least a gallon

1864
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:04,360
so they're drinking at least a gallon a

1865
01:13:01,238 --> 01:13:06,799
day they're bigger sized plants but as

1866
01:13:04,359 --> 01:13:08,479
far as how do I decide whether it's time

1867
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,719
to water or not it's it's really easy

1868
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:12,039
for me because those subp containers

1869
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:13,439
have a watering tube that passes through

1870
01:13:12,039 --> 01:13:15,560
the soil block and goes all the way down

1871
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:18,559
into the water reservoir and so I can

1872
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:21,120
take a a flashlight and look down that

1873
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:23,520
tube and actually look into the the

1874
01:13:21,119 --> 01:13:25,719
water reservoir and see do I see water

1875
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:28,560
if I if I see water I will not I will

1876
01:13:25,719 --> 01:13:30,800
not water it and if I if I see it's dry

1877
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:32,199
I'll I'll add water and the reason I do

1878
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,600
that instead of just keeping it topped

1879
01:13:32,198 --> 01:13:35,879
off I used to keep it topped off every

1880
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:39,520
day just keep watering it because

1881
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:41,520
there's a runoff uh overflow where it'll

1882
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:43,800
I can you know catch it I so I could

1883
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:46,400
water until I saw water come out and

1884
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:48,119
know that the know that the res was full

1885
01:13:46,399 --> 01:13:50,479
um I think it's important to have a

1886
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:51,880
layer the way that the Sip containers

1887
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:55,198
are designed as you have a water

1888
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:56,840
reservoir you have some kind of a uh

1889
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:59,799
table or whatever you want to call it a

1890
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:02,880
layer to hold the the soil block above

1891
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:05,639
the water and um then you have your soil

1892
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:08,359
block well between that table and and

1893
01:14:05,639 --> 01:14:10,520
the water as the water drains down you

1894
01:14:08,359 --> 01:14:12,079
have air you have air exchange going

1895
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:13,840
through that tube that tube that you

1896
01:14:12,079 --> 01:14:16,039
have going down once the water is low

1897
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:17,840
enough um you're getting air Exchange in

1898
01:14:16,039 --> 01:14:19,560
there and I think that's one of the

1899
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:22,000
superpowers we'll say of a sip

1900
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:24,679
containers you're getting more air

1901
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:28,039
exchanged at the root level because of

1902
01:14:24,679 --> 01:14:30,719
that than you are in a traditional pot

1903
01:14:28,039 --> 01:14:32,359
and so um I kind of take advantage of

1904
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:34,359
that by letting that pot get completely

1905
01:14:32,359 --> 01:14:36,279
dry so that the air level gets bigger

1906
01:14:34,359 --> 01:14:38,319
bigger and bigger before I put more

1907
01:14:36,279 --> 01:14:40,519
water in because even when those those

1908
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:42,599
reses are completely dry if you were to

1909
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:44,920
go over and pick up that that planter

1910
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:47,560
it's still heavy it's saturated it's

1911
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:50,079
almost like a dryback without having to

1912
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:53,080
reduce the available water to the plant

1913
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:55,760
so it's you know a lot of these a lot of

1914
01:14:53,079 --> 01:14:58,559
these practices seem to um in terms of

1915
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:00,960
like uh hydroponic irrigation practices

1916
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,239
in Coco um I'm sure we're going to get

1917
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:05,719
into that here in a second with the

1918
01:15:02,238 --> 01:15:07,119
triome forge um versus having uh an

1919
01:15:05,719 --> 01:15:08,920
organic soil where you really need to

1920
01:15:07,119 --> 01:15:11,359
maintain that moisture contents so that

1921
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:13,000
the microbial and biological activity

1922
01:15:11,359 --> 01:15:15,599
maintains at a certain level and you're

1923
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:17,198
not killing that off and having other

1924
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,920
adverse effects where nutrients are no

1925
01:15:17,198 --> 01:15:21,279
longer available to the plants due to

1926
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:24,399
the the nutrient cycling processes that

1927
01:15:21,279 --> 01:15:26,399
require all that extra moisture um you

1928
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:28,198
know it it seems as though by

1929
01:15:26,399 --> 01:15:31,759
introducing all this air to the root

1930
01:15:28,198 --> 01:15:33,559
Zone um you are kind of mimicking a

1931
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,760
dryback cycle especially if it's daily

1932
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:38,920
you're just getting it into a good

1933
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:40,679
Sarcan Rhythm exactly and and when I

1934
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:42,880
water I don't water through that tube

1935
01:15:40,679 --> 01:15:46,000
either I like for the same reason I like

1936
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:48,159
to water through the soil block because

1937
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,079
if you if you even in a traditional

1938
01:15:48,158 --> 01:15:52,439
Circle pot if you water it and it and

1939
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:54,760
the water builds up if you just watch

1940
01:15:52,439 --> 01:15:56,960
the water Dr you know drain into the pot

1941
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:59,960
and into the soil and a million of us

1942
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:01,158
I'm sure listening or whatever have seen

1943
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:04,198
that cuz we sit there and watch the

1944
01:16:01,158 --> 01:16:07,158
water drain it's as the water drains

1945
01:16:04,198 --> 01:16:10,079
into the the media it's actually pulling

1946
01:16:07,158 --> 01:16:11,759
air down with it too it's it's also

1947
01:16:10,079 --> 01:16:15,439
doing this air exchange that we're

1948
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:17,280
talking about so I I by me doing the way

1949
01:16:15,439 --> 01:16:19,039
that I'm doing it I'm doing it for that

1950
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:21,119
reason is like I'm trying to just like

1951
01:16:19,039 --> 01:16:23,920
get that air exchange I'm trying to get

1952
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:25,719
oxygen to the roots and uh try to have

1953
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:29,600
the most healthy Roots as as I can have

1954
01:16:25,719 --> 01:16:35,000
because um if you have healthy Roots 90%

1955
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:36,440
of your game is is uh taken care of yeah

1956
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:39,840
and so are you w you're watering through

1957
01:16:36,439 --> 01:16:43,198
the top the entire cycle mhm do you have

1958
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:45,199
a mulch layer of some kind like I use

1959
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:47,519
the mostly so when I harvest the plant

1960
01:16:45,198 --> 01:16:48,678
and I take and I debut it debuck it

1961
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,199
whatever I take all the buds off and I

1962
01:16:48,679 --> 01:16:51,840
have the skeleton of the plant left is

1963
01:16:50,198 --> 01:16:54,439
just the stems I take and cut that into

1964
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:57,600
about 1 in sections with my shears and

1965
01:16:54,439 --> 01:17:01,279
that's my mulch okay so the mulch is the

1966
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:02,719
uh all of the previous grows cool no

1967
01:17:01,279 --> 01:17:06,158
that's awesome I mean it's a good good

1968
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:07,840
use of resources um and it seems like uh

1969
01:17:06,158 --> 01:17:09,759
you know I've heard like Steve Ryner

1970
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:12,639
talk about how he has like a dual

1971
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:14,159
planting uh or a dual substrate system

1972
01:17:12,639 --> 01:17:16,319
with his a dual root Zone there you go

1973
01:17:14,158 --> 01:17:17,920
with uh with his aquaponic production

1974
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:20,479
where you have like that terrestrial

1975
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:24,279
media up top and then you have the the

1976
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:25,399
aquaponic uh you know High nutrient load

1977
01:17:24,279 --> 01:17:27,319
uh water

1978
01:17:25,399 --> 01:17:29,158
below that um and it almost sounds like

1979
01:17:27,319 --> 01:17:31,079
by watering through you're pulling

1980
01:17:29,158 --> 01:17:33,439
nutrients out and where a lot of people

1981
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:34,760
you know I would like whenever I give

1982
01:17:33,439 --> 01:17:36,279
advice for people that are growing

1983
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:38,360
Organics I always make sure you're not

1984
01:17:36,279 --> 01:17:39,759
getting runoff or at least not a lot of

1985
01:17:38,359 --> 01:17:42,719
runoff because you don't want to reduce

1986
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:44,880
that nutrient load capacity of the soil

1987
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:46,920
um but it sounds like by just letting

1988
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,560
that go into the reservoir and letting

1989
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:50,600
the roots go down into the reservoir

1990
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:54,320
you're just giving them their their own

1991
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:56,960
sort of uh dual root Zone yeah yeah it's

1992
01:17:54,319 --> 01:17:58,880
like a almost like a compost tea like

1993
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:59,960
you're pushing water through it and it's

1994
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,400
just sitting at the bottom and it's

1995
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:03,679
getting any of that mineral that washes

1996
01:18:01,399 --> 01:18:05,679
the water soluble stuff anyway it's

1997
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:07,639
going to collect down in the bottom and

1998
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:10,560
it's going to get drawn right back up by

1999
01:18:07,639 --> 01:18:11,679
the roots into the uh into the plant and

2000
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:13,639
a lot of the microbes are going to do

2001
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:15,639
the heavy lifting as far as holding the

2002
01:18:13,639 --> 01:18:17,239
soil together because they create those

2003
01:18:15,639 --> 01:18:20,079
exudates around themselves to kind of

2004
01:18:17,238 --> 01:18:22,519
glue themselves in place yeah I'd be I'd

2005
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:25,399
be really curious have you ever um

2006
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:27,320
pulled any of the the liquid at the

2007
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:30,000
bottom of one of your sip containers and

2008
01:18:27,319 --> 01:18:33,119
tested the pH or the electrical

2009
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:37,600
conductivity just to find out what it is

2010
01:18:33,119 --> 01:18:41,599
I haven't uh I haven't no okay but um in

2011
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:45,679
in an organic situation the pH is is

2012
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:47,800
more driven by the the soil PH like of

2013
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:49,840
the media than it is the water like I

2014
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:51,440
could adjust the water PH to whatever I

2015
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:54,760
want but the soil is going to change

2016
01:18:51,439 --> 01:18:55,759
change that pH um as soon as I do so

2017
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:57,480
it's the minerals right it's the

2018
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,159
minerals that changes pH so if I'm

2019
01:18:57,479 --> 01:19:00,599
putting water with no minerals in it

2020
01:18:59,158 --> 01:19:02,238
it's not going to change the pH much

2021
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:03,560
it's all those minerals composition

2022
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:05,439
that's in that media block that's going

2023
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:07,679
to determine the the pH of what's going

2024
01:19:05,439 --> 01:19:09,638
to happen so yeah if I push water

2025
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:11,520
through I might be able to capture some

2026
01:19:09,639 --> 01:19:13,840
of those minerals and get a weird pH at

2027
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:16,520
the bottom for sure sorry I was thinking

2028
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:18,000
out loud there oh please that's that's

2029
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:20,159
the point of the show I'm just really

2030
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,800
curious because that's such a you know

2031
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:25,759
like with with things like um let's say

2032
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:27,639
with rock wool right where it's so uh

2033
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:31,920
sterile there's absolutely nothing in it

2034
01:19:27,639 --> 01:19:34,760
there's zero cation exchange capacity um

2035
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:37,639
so everything that the plant gets is is

2036
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:40,320
uh requisite on on what you're putting

2037
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:43,000
into your nutrient solution and what the

2038
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:48,119
the the water within the you know within

2039
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:49,319
the substrate is um versus you know I

2040
01:19:48,119 --> 01:19:51,359
you know you're you're not the first

2041
01:19:49,319 --> 01:19:53,319
person that I've heard say this but uh

2042
01:19:51,359 --> 01:19:54,880
you know with Organics like you you

2043
01:19:53,319 --> 01:19:56,279
don't really have to care about the pH

2044
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:59,279
that you're putting in as long as you

2045
01:19:56,279 --> 01:20:02,479
have a a very biologically active

2046
01:19:59,279 --> 01:20:04,479
substrate um because the yeah the exit

2047
01:20:02,479 --> 01:20:06,879
dates of the plant roots as well as the

2048
01:20:04,479 --> 01:20:09,119
ex the interaction with those microbes

2049
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:11,800
and stuff is going to adjust the the ph

2050
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:13,840
and then you know as well as you got

2051
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:16,400
gypsum in there that's going to be a

2052
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:18,960
neutral pH you got sulfur or sulfates in

2053
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:20,439
there U of other kinds like magnesium

2054
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:24,439
sulfate I think is a little bit of a

2055
01:20:20,439 --> 01:20:26,319
acidic pH and then you got like um yeah

2056
01:20:24,439 --> 01:20:29,279
it like nitrates will make it more

2057
01:20:26,319 --> 01:20:33,039
acidic uh uh I think phosphates make it

2058
01:20:29,279 --> 01:20:34,960
a little bit more base um in some cases

2059
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:37,920
I might be wrong don't quote me on that

2060
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:40,439
um but it's it's just really interesting

2061
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:42,399
to see the kind of the two ends of the

2062
01:20:40,439 --> 01:20:44,719
spectrum of needing to be so precise

2063
01:20:42,399 --> 01:20:47,759
with Hydroponics versus being able to

2064
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:49,880
have almost this L Fair attitude about

2065
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:52,119
pH and electrical conductivity with

2066
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:54,679
Organics that you know I can see how a

2067
01:20:52,119 --> 01:20:57,960
hom grower or in a hom grow situation

2068
01:20:54,679 --> 01:21:00,319
leaning towards an organic based media

2069
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:03,119
especially for new Growers can really

2070
01:21:00,319 --> 01:21:04,960
simplify some of these almost where it's

2071
01:21:03,119 --> 01:21:07,639
a scientific practice where you have to

2072
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:09,920
kind of understand the the information

2073
01:21:07,639 --> 01:21:13,800
behind the practice before you can

2074
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:15,399
adjust it well and also another thing

2075
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:18,840
about it is is

2076
01:21:15,399 --> 01:21:22,000
that my best analogy for for it is is

2077
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:25,960
it's like for me growing organically is

2078
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:28,760
like driving a a a nice big boat of a

2079
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:30,319
car you know what I mean it you can just

2080
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:32,119
take it easy you're going to get where

2081
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:34,880
you want to go it's going to be a nice

2082
01:21:32,119 --> 01:21:36,960
relaxed ride and it's hard to over steer

2083
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:39,480
it is hard to over steer exactly but

2084
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:42,399
then you get into coco or you get into

2085
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:44,799
dwc or something or nft or something

2086
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:47,799
like that and now Hydroponics you are

2087
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:49,279
you're driving a race car man and uh one

2088
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:52,560
little overcorrection and you're in a

2089
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:54,279
wall it's not it's not it's not you

2090
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,880
doing you know half that speed and just

2091
01:21:54,279 --> 01:21:59,000
you might get in a little bump no it's

2092
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:01,480
it's it's it could be a more dire

2093
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,760
situation so there and cons and that's

2094
01:22:01,479 --> 01:22:06,879
why I still I love growing man I [ __ ]

2095
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:10,119
love growing and uh I love all aspects

2096
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:12,199
of it and so I still do both you know I

2097
01:22:10,119 --> 01:22:14,639
love the Organics for its hands-off

2098
01:22:12,198 --> 01:22:16,879
approach and plus I literally could skip

2099
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:18,719
I could skip I mean I could skip water

2100
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:20,639
in my garden if I wanted to and it'd be

2101
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:23,399
fine I've done it y done it for two

2102
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:24,920
three days and it's fine it's just um

2103
01:22:23,399 --> 01:22:26,679
you know it's not ideal deal you're not

2104
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:29,920
going to get the best results doing that

2105
01:22:26,679 --> 01:22:32,480
but good luck doing that in a in a uh

2106
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:34,639
Coco grow in a similar situation

2107
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:38,959
especially when you're pushing EC's up

2108
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:43,520
uh above 3.0 like um I I we're currently

2109
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:45,760
running 4.5 EC uh input at the this

2110
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:48,480
place that I I help manage and the

2111
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:51,079
plants have never looked healthier but

2112
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:55,198
we have, 1500 parts per million CO2 we

2113
01:22:51,079 --> 01:22:58,279
have 1250 we have we have 1250 PFD at

2114
01:22:55,198 --> 01:23:00,238
canopy we have Precision Irrigation

2115
01:22:58,279 --> 01:23:03,679
controls environmental controls the

2116
01:23:00,238 --> 01:23:05,359
whole N9 yards and so when I even when I

2117
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:08,079
start other people off on a program

2118
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:09,719
that's similar to mine if they have CO2

2119
01:23:08,079 --> 01:23:12,760
if they have high ppft I'll still start

2120
01:23:09,719 --> 01:23:14,158
them only at like 2.5 3.0 because I

2121
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:15,639
don't know if they're like actually

2122
01:23:14,158 --> 01:23:17,638
measuring their runoff I don't know if

2123
01:23:15,639 --> 01:23:19,800
they're actually able to monitor their

2124
01:23:17,639 --> 01:23:21,480
substrate EC and see the trends up and

2125
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:25,480
down in the PO water electrical

2126
01:23:21,479 --> 01:23:27,718
conductivity and and so it's it's almost

2127
01:23:25,479 --> 01:23:29,959
you're right it's it's a race car it is

2128
01:23:27,719 --> 01:23:32,600
operating at Peak Performance and if you

2129
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:35,520
mess something up you're

2130
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:38,239
[ __ ] yeah in a dramatic way usually in

2131
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:40,159
a dramatic way but in terms of

2132
01:23:38,238 --> 01:23:41,959
Hydroponics I've never seen flower look

2133
01:23:40,158 --> 01:23:43,559
better you know like the nutrient

2134
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:45,399
package is so high that it can

2135
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:48,679
assimilate everything that it needs to

2136
01:23:45,399 --> 01:23:50,638
into the um the biomass without it

2137
01:23:48,679 --> 01:23:53,600
because um like Lee Big's law right

2138
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:56,039
where if you have a a a limiting factor

2139
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:57,960
then that's the that's the greatest that

2140
01:23:56,039 --> 01:24:00,359
the rest of the plant can operate at so

2141
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:02,119
like you have low magnesium the plant is

2142
01:24:00,359 --> 01:24:04,000
not going to be able to photosynthesize

2143
01:24:02,119 --> 01:24:06,198
at the same rate that it would with

2144
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,880
adequate magnesium and so that means

2145
01:24:06,198 --> 01:24:11,000
your nitrogen load if it's super high

2146
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:13,400
it's not all being used if you're uh

2147
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,279
potassium phosphorus sulfate everything

2148
01:24:13,399 --> 01:24:18,679
if it's at a high level it's only being

2149
01:24:15,279 --> 01:24:22,238
able to be used at the the rate of the

2150
01:24:18,679 --> 01:24:24,000
um the lowest common denominator um and

2151
01:24:22,238 --> 01:24:26,839
but in an organic situation where the

2152
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:29,920
plant kind of picking and choosing like

2153
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:32,199
a nice Buffet what it wants at that time

2154
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:34,960
you have like a a huge

2155
01:24:32,198 --> 01:24:37,519
buffer but that buffer comes at the cost

2156
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:39,600
of space right you have to use a really

2157
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:41,199
big you have to use a really big battery

2158
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:44,199
you're putting all your nutrients at one

2159
01:24:41,198 --> 01:24:45,559
time into that media pretty much and uh

2160
01:24:44,198 --> 01:24:46,799
so that's your trade-off that's your

2161
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:52,280
trade-off when it comes to that and

2162
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:55,560
speed like I don't the the growing an

2163
01:24:52,279 --> 01:24:58,719
organic plant as opposed to growing uh

2164
01:24:55,560 --> 01:25:00,719
plant with uh synthetic nutrients they

2165
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:02,560
just I don't care I'm sure I'm going to

2166
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:04,039
get arguments from people and I won't I

2167
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,840
won't ever hear the end of it but I'm

2168
01:25:04,039 --> 01:25:07,679
sorry a synthetic plant synthetically

2169
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:10,159
fed plant is just faster get faster

2170
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:11,760
through veg get it into flower faster it

2171
01:25:10,158 --> 01:25:14,439
just seems

2172
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:17,239
to I'd like to see someone try and argue

2173
01:25:14,439 --> 01:25:20,359
against that honestly because like you

2174
01:25:17,238 --> 01:25:22,039
have commercial experience yeah uh now

2175
01:25:20,359 --> 01:25:24,839
at multiple places you own your own

2176
01:25:22,039 --> 01:25:26,800
place and you run it and it's and you

2177
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:29,760
chose not to go organically and there's

2178
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:31,239
a reason behind that um so you know I

2179
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:33,560
feel like we've touched enough on the

2180
01:25:31,238 --> 01:25:36,479
homow the organic aspect of what you do

2181
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:39,760
as uh a hobbyist and a caregiver so

2182
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:42,198
let's go into the Tricom Forge now so uh

2183
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:44,880
yeah help help uh bridge that gap of

2184
01:25:42,198 --> 01:25:48,279
what made you decide to go

2185
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:51,800
Hydroponics um what your practices are

2186
01:25:48,279 --> 01:25:54,759
there uh because uh like let's do the

2187
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:56,679
same the same thing cloning veg into

2188
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:57,760
flowering what your flowering cycles

2189
01:25:56,679 --> 01:26:01,239
look

2190
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:05,039
like so the uh the triome forge was born

2191
01:26:01,238 --> 01:26:07,919
from uh me and my my best friend big

2192
01:26:05,039 --> 01:26:10,639
pone let's be fair he is the owner of it

2193
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:15,199
uh I'm I'm helping him on it and uh but

2194
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:17,039
yeah it's it's on his property and uh so

2195
01:26:15,198 --> 01:26:18,279
we're both working right and what are

2196
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:19,519
you going to do when you're working in a

2197
01:26:18,279 --> 01:26:20,880
grow with other people you're going to

2198
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:22,040
talk and you're going to just shoot the

2199
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:23,800
[ __ ] and what are we talking about

2200
01:26:22,039 --> 01:26:26,000
growing a lot of the times and like oh

2201
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:27,199
what would you if you could just do

2202
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,238
whatever you wanted in your grow room

2203
01:26:27,198 --> 01:26:33,439
and that's where it was it was honestly

2204
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:36,919
born and um so what we did was we kind

2205
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:40,118
of modeled a grow a home

2206
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:41,760
grow on the commercial place that we

2207
01:26:40,118 --> 01:26:44,279
were working on and then made

2208
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:45,440
adjustments to it that you know like

2209
01:26:44,279 --> 01:26:46,639
anyone where they work somewhere they're

2210
01:26:45,439 --> 01:26:48,919
like well we could make this better if

2211
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:50,400
we just did this well in your own girl

2212
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:52,960
you're that guy you get to make that

2213
01:26:50,399 --> 01:26:55,000
decision so that's what we did so we

2214
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:57,319
went with PVC walls and instead of f FRP

2215
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:00,198
walls which means that uh it's two

2216
01:26:57,319 --> 01:27:01,920
pieces of flat PVC with like almost like

2217
01:27:00,198 --> 01:27:07,039
it looks like cardboard but made out of

2218
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:10,239
PVC imagine that and uh uh and they come

2219
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:13,039
in panels about two about maybe 18 inch

2220
01:27:10,238 --> 01:27:15,118
wide or so uh but like 14 foot tall

2221
01:27:13,039 --> 01:27:17,920
because we got the lot tall

2222
01:27:15,118 --> 01:27:20,599
rooms and uh they just tungue and groove

2223
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:24,239
in we installed them all we put a bead

2224
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:25,639
of silicone [ __ ] between every panel so

2225
01:27:24,238 --> 01:27:26,959
you you'll be able you can just sit

2226
01:27:25,639 --> 01:27:28,079
there with a hose and spray them if you

2227
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:30,600
want to and there's nothing in there

2228
01:27:28,079 --> 01:27:34,158
that will ever mold because it's

2229
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:37,360
PVC and uh and you're

2230
01:27:34,158 --> 01:27:39,000
watertight so we did that first and it's

2231
01:27:37,359 --> 01:27:40,198
white it's it's white so we don't even

2232
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,560
have to worry about painting it or

2233
01:27:40,198 --> 01:27:43,000
anything like that is already the right

2234
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:46,400
color it's going to be

2235
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:50,479
reflective uh so with the triome forge

2236
01:27:46,399 --> 01:27:52,479
we have a two flower room we have we've

2237
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:55,118
completely built out one flower room in

2238
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:57,039
the veg and the dry room

2239
01:27:55,118 --> 01:27:59,479
uh what we have left to complete is

2240
01:27:57,039 --> 01:28:02,319
where we've got a a second flower room

2241
01:27:59,479 --> 01:28:04,879
that is like 99% complete we have to

2242
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:06,639
like hang the lights and get some tables

2243
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:10,480
in there and get some well we need some

2244
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:12,520
electricity in there um but that will be

2245
01:28:10,479 --> 01:28:16,039
done by the end of this year for

2246
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:17,280
sure and then um we have a small room

2247
01:28:16,039 --> 01:28:19,719
for

2248
01:28:17,279 --> 01:28:25,238
hash so for

2249
01:28:19,719 --> 01:28:28,399
processing and what our end goal is is

2250
01:28:25,238 --> 01:28:30,118
we got the vegro we have flower room a

2251
01:28:28,399 --> 01:28:31,799
the one that we're using right now is

2252
01:28:30,118 --> 01:28:33,559
our fenal heart room we will everything

2253
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,760
that gets flowered and so far this has

2254
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:37,080
been the case everything that gets

2255
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:38,719
flowered out in there came from seed

2256
01:28:37,079 --> 01:28:40,840
that's a new it's a new feno we're feno

2257
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:43,198
hunting and then the flower room to is

2258
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:44,800
what we selected from those you know the

2259
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:46,359
selected fenos the ones that we were

2260
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:49,360
wanted as Keepers we're going to run

2261
01:28:46,359 --> 01:28:51,118
those as like a monocrop or maybe you

2262
01:28:49,359 --> 01:28:52,559
know it's only two tables so maybe one

2263
01:28:51,118 --> 01:28:54,319
table of one and one of the other or

2264
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:56,840
something like that but how many lights

2265
01:28:54,319 --> 01:29:00,479
per room there's four lights so it's two

2266
01:28:56,840 --> 01:29:04,679
4 by eight tables nice in each room yeah

2267
01:29:00,479 --> 01:29:06,319
and um in the vegro it's uh the the both

2268
01:29:04,679 --> 01:29:08,399
flower rooms are exactly the same size

2269
01:29:06,319 --> 01:29:09,519
and I I should have got baked on here

2270
01:29:08,399 --> 01:29:11,279
because he'd give you all the dimensions

2271
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:13,920
and everything but uh I can do another

2272
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:17,719
one with him too yeah that'd be great

2273
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:19,840
yeah but that um but then uh the F the

2274
01:29:17,719 --> 01:29:21,560
bedroom is about one and a half times

2275
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:23,560
the the flower room and the reason we

2276
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:25,119
did that was we have a bunch of space to

2277
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:27,280
hold genetics because we know we're

2278
01:29:25,118 --> 01:29:29,559
going to do a lot of feno hunting we

2279
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:31,599
needed uh a place for all these extra

2280
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:32,800
clones that we're holding of every fenal

2281
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,679
that we have in there right until we

2282
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:36,239
make our

2283
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:39,239
selection um so we have a little bit

2284
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:42,718
extra bigger veg space on purpose to be

2285
01:29:39,238 --> 01:29:44,559
able to just hold genetics um and our

2286
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:46,679
whole strategy too is we're not

2287
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:49,000
harvesting for flour so much we do

2288
01:29:46,679 --> 01:29:50,840
Harvest some flour out of there um but

2289
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,920
the vast majority of what's harvested is

2290
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:56,199
harvested fresh frozen to make

2291
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:57,719
concentrate um uh and it it endgame we

2292
01:29:56,198 --> 01:30:00,479
want to be able to make that concentrate

2293
01:29:57,719 --> 01:30:02,118
right now we have a a buddy making our

2294
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:05,759
concentrate for us who does a [ __ ]

2295
01:30:02,118 --> 01:30:08,399
awesome job um but we want to have the

2296
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:10,840
the hash room in-house we can wash the

2297
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:14,479
wash it we can press it and you know

2298
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:16,000
have our dry uh have our freeze dryer

2299
01:30:14,479 --> 01:30:18,519
and all that good stuff but right now we

2300
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,880
still got to um finish out the second

2301
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:22,800
flower room before we worry about that

2302
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:24,679
hash room but that's the end game of it

2303
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,400
um and so

2304
01:30:24,679 --> 01:30:28,880
we modeled it pretty much after what we

2305
01:30:26,399 --> 01:30:33,439
were already doing at at mint and canico

2306
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:34,880
uh so we use coco and we use the same uh

2307
01:30:33,439 --> 01:30:36,638
feeding nutrients well no they've

2308
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:38,880
Switched at mitt canico they're using

2309
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:40,679
Athena but we're we're using Cana

2310
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:43,359
nutrients okay and that's what we

2311
01:30:40,679 --> 01:30:45,279
originally started using at meico and

2312
01:30:43,359 --> 01:30:46,920
both me and him have always liked Canon

2313
01:30:45,279 --> 01:30:49,079
nutrients as fires the results we got

2314
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:54,158
we've hated the cost of them I'm looking

2315
01:30:49,079 --> 01:30:55,840
at you can but uh love the results so um

2316
01:30:54,158 --> 01:30:57,879
what's the uh what's the nutrient lineup

2317
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:59,279
for Cana I've never personally used it

2318
01:30:57,880 --> 01:31:01,560
I've heard about it but I never actually

2319
01:30:59,279 --> 01:31:04,079
looked into it either there's a Cana A

2320
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:07,360
and B uh there's a cocoa specific

2321
01:31:04,079 --> 01:31:10,319
variety uh line of it so there's a can

2322
01:31:07,359 --> 01:31:12,198
of cocoa a can of cocoa B that we use we

2323
01:31:10,319 --> 01:31:15,639
use a um

2324
01:31:12,198 --> 01:31:19,559
rotonics uh canaz which is just an

2325
01:31:15,639 --> 01:31:21,239
enzyme and then um we might use a boost

2326
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:23,280
like boost that's the most expensive

2327
01:31:21,238 --> 01:31:24,919
thing that they they sell and uh boost

2328
01:31:23,279 --> 01:31:26,399
is something that you add during the

2329
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:27,679
flowering period is going to give you

2330
01:31:26,399 --> 01:31:31,000
some PK

2331
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:32,719
basically I believe I'm trying to think

2332
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:35,960
now that makes sense we also use we also

2333
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:38,000
use Mammoth p in there still okay um as

2334
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:40,000
a microb because it's just undeniable

2335
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,719
results even in synthetics we've tested

2336
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,279
time and time again the mammoth p is so

2337
01:31:41,719 --> 01:31:46,359
[ __ ] worth it

2338
01:31:44,279 --> 01:31:48,719
um what the hell

2339
01:31:46,359 --> 01:31:49,960
else was there anything else no I think

2340
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:53,039
that's I think that's all we're using

2341
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:54,960
right now we are our uh Grandmaster

2342
01:31:53,039 --> 01:31:58,560
level is is coming out with some

2343
01:31:54,960 --> 01:32:00,760
nutrients too um in the future and we're

2344
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:02,800
going to be probably tring those and

2345
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:04,600
those were also he well at least I'm

2346
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:06,480
told I haven't tried them yet but I've

2347
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:08,960
been told by gr level that they're very

2348
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:10,319
similar to can so we'll see but it's a

2349
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:13,439
dry nutrient that's what we're excited

2350
01:32:10,319 --> 01:32:15,519
for it's dry it's not yeah

2351
01:32:13,439 --> 01:32:18,799
waterbased yeah that's pretty huge we

2352
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:22,360
use we use dry I've been using a Jr crop

2353
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:25,159
tech for a while and uh we're uh

2354
01:32:22,359 --> 01:32:27,920
transitioning over to uh drip Hydro for

2355
01:32:25,158 --> 01:32:30,439
the flower formula um just seems to run

2356
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:31,800
a little bit cleaner right now but uh

2357
01:32:30,439 --> 01:32:33,839
we'll see we've only been running it for

2358
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:37,199
a couping it in or are you mixing it

2359
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:38,960
yourself yeah we we uh we make up stock

2360
01:32:37,198 --> 01:32:40,719
tank barrels and then use a dosatron

2361
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:43,679
rack with uh we got three different

2362
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:45,319
recipes on it and uh pump those into the

2363
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:47,920
rooms into the reservoirs and then the

2364
01:32:45,319 --> 01:32:50,679
reservoirs all run off of uh leader

2365
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:54,359
pumps um so everything just set up on a

2366
01:32:50,679 --> 01:32:56,000
solenoid system open sprinkler uh

2367
01:32:54,359 --> 01:32:57,960
running for each of the zones and for

2368
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,719
the uh the fill programs and whatnot it

2369
01:32:57,960 --> 01:33:02,239
works really well it's it's so simple

2370
01:32:59,719 --> 01:33:04,520
and it I I never thought that I could

2371
01:33:02,238 --> 01:33:07,479
run this many plants with only two

2372
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:10,880
people it's it's crazy how efficient it

2373
01:33:07,479 --> 01:33:12,519
is um are are you guys using uh hand

2374
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:14,920
watering drip

2375
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:18,199
irrigation right now we're uh we're

2376
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:20,118
still handw watering um it's been a slow

2377
01:33:18,198 --> 01:33:23,000
build uh because we're kind of financing

2378
01:33:20,118 --> 01:33:25,880
this thing ourselves and going time and

2379
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:28,118
uh but yes game is we would like to at

2380
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:30,840
least have something that would like

2381
01:33:28,118 --> 01:33:32,359
give me a cone bottom res and a pump and

2382
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:34,480
at least let me come over and flip a

2383
01:33:32,359 --> 01:33:36,158
switch to water you know a zone or a

2384
01:33:34,479 --> 01:33:38,279
table or something all at once instead

2385
01:33:36,158 --> 01:33:41,319
of me hand watering absolutely just put

2386
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:43,719
it on a put put the pump on a uh on like

2387
01:33:41,319 --> 01:33:45,158
one of those uh Alexa switches or

2388
01:33:43,719 --> 01:33:49,279
something that you can just control from

2389
01:33:45,158 --> 01:33:51,920
your phone exactly yeah exactly yeah and

2390
01:33:49,279 --> 01:33:53,840
put a little uh a little camera inside

2391
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:56,158
the the flower room that's close to the

2392
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:58,119
the pot line so you can see your

2393
01:33:56,158 --> 01:34:02,118
emitters you know what I mean that would

2394
01:33:58,118 --> 01:34:06,039
be dope you be watering from your

2395
01:34:02,118 --> 01:34:09,000
car no absolutely I I sometimes I'm like

2396
01:34:06,039 --> 01:34:11,238
I get home after work and I'll be like

2397
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:14,719
[ __ ] I needed to adjust something I can

2398
01:34:11,238 --> 01:34:16,399
just hop on adjust it from from home

2399
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:17,800
while I'm smoking a bowl or something

2400
01:34:16,399 --> 01:34:20,759
and make sure that it's all set and

2401
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:22,760
ready to go and it's it's just such a

2402
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:24,280
huge weight off the shoulders of what it

2403
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:26,159
used to be where you had to make sure

2404
01:34:24,279 --> 01:34:29,000
everything was set so perfectly before

2405
01:34:26,158 --> 01:34:31,359
you left the building and then I'm still

2406
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,800
that guy that it's automated you know

2407
01:34:31,359 --> 01:34:34,399
I've got the pump running I know it's

2408
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:35,840
water and I'm walking in the room I'm

2409
01:34:34,399 --> 01:34:37,079
looking at every emitter I'm making sure

2410
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:39,480
I don't got a plugged emitter or

2411
01:34:37,079 --> 01:34:41,118
something because it's just I want to

2412
01:34:39,479 --> 01:34:44,198
have a reason to be in the

2413
01:34:41,118 --> 01:34:46,279
room absolutely and it I feel like it it

2414
01:34:44,198 --> 01:34:47,759
does help I mean like you can't be so

2415
01:34:46,279 --> 01:34:48,960
hands off that you're not looking in the

2416
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:50,480
rooms because you're going to miss

2417
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:52,560
something you're absolutely like clogged

2418
01:34:50,479 --> 01:34:54,399
a m you know everything looks fine for

2419
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:56,560
four or 5 days if you let's like let's

2420
01:34:54,399 --> 01:34:58,000
say you got two emitters per pot and one

2421
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:00,400
of them goes down the plant's still

2422
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,719
looking great and then a week later all

2423
01:35:00,399 --> 01:35:05,960
of a sudden it's drooping and it's

2424
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:07,760
behind and at the very least it's like

2425
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:10,679
half the size of everything else around

2426
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:12,199
it half the size and extra tried out by

2427
01:35:10,679 --> 01:35:13,639
like week five or six and you're just

2428
01:35:12,198 --> 01:35:15,799
like what's going on with this one and

2429
01:35:13,639 --> 01:35:17,760
it's just you know getting these crazy

2430
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:21,320
dryb backs and EC

2431
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:22,800
spikes yeah absolutely that's another

2432
01:35:21,319 --> 01:35:26,479
hard thing when you have automation it's

2433
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:28,239
a hard thing to to get every plant to

2434
01:35:26,479 --> 01:35:29,959
still want to water you know still want

2435
01:35:28,238 --> 01:35:32,678
to feed at the same time or water at the

2436
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:35,359
same time you almost have to force yeah

2437
01:35:32,679 --> 01:35:36,399
Coco Coco is is nice that you can just

2438
01:35:35,359 --> 01:35:37,759
okay you're going to drink whether you

2439
01:35:36,399 --> 01:35:39,920
need it or not we're going to push out

2440
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:43,119
what's in there and you're going to get

2441
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:45,679
the good stuff again yeah but some

2442
01:35:43,118 --> 01:35:46,960
people you can still I still want to put

2443
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:49,039
it out there anyway you can still

2444
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:50,840
overwater cocoa don't let people think

2445
01:35:49,039 --> 01:35:54,880
that you can't overwater cocoa it can be

2446
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:57,600
done yep I've I've done it it's

2447
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:59,600
uh it's all about cuz I I feel like one

2448
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:01,719
of the things that I hear for with Coco

2449
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:04,039
users is they say you know from the time

2450
01:36:01,719 --> 01:36:05,800
you transplant that seed in or that that

2451
01:36:04,039 --> 01:36:08,679
clone in you can just water it every day

2452
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:10,360
to run off and I'm like I feel like you

2453
01:36:08,679 --> 01:36:13,279
can do that as soon as you give it that

2454
01:36:10,359 --> 01:36:15,639
first dryback but other than that like

2455
01:36:13,279 --> 01:36:16,719
it it does it doesn't rude in as hard it

2456
01:36:15,639 --> 01:36:19,679
doesn't

2457
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:21,800
like I you just kind of lose that that

2458
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:24,359
turer of that first dryback for some

2459
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:26,079
reason it like the just the uptake of

2460
01:36:24,359 --> 01:36:29,279
nutrients seems to be greater if you

2461
01:36:26,079 --> 01:36:32,158
give it dryb backs in between uh being

2462
01:36:29,279 --> 01:36:34,960
fully saturated at Field capacity I

2463
01:36:32,158 --> 01:36:39,000
think um there's a lot to be said too is

2464
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:41,880
like what I I really think that um a

2465
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:44,238
dryback is a a very slight stress to the

2466
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:46,840
plant um but it's like it's an

2467
01:36:44,238 --> 01:36:49,359
encouragement too at the same time in my

2468
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:51,039
in my head it's like okay the plant's

2469
01:36:49,359 --> 01:36:52,759
getting a little bit dry so it's going

2470
01:36:51,039 --> 01:36:54,719
to trigger some root growth because it

2471
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:55,679
needs to find water water in my head I

2472
01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:58,158
know I haven't read that in the

2473
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:59,880
scientific paper to say that but I think

2474
01:36:58,158 --> 01:37:01,399
a little bit of dryback before it starts

2475
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:03,359
shutting down to try to conserve all of

2476
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:05,359
its water for it to tryb back last too

2477
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:06,679
hard it can definitely be a bad thing

2478
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:09,039
and that's when the stress starts going

2479
01:37:06,679 --> 01:37:11,480
into the you know on the on the

2480
01:37:09,039 --> 01:37:14,519
proverbial needle it's into the red now

2481
01:37:11,479 --> 01:37:17,158
but I think it's a good stress and yeah

2482
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:19,239
I mean multiple multiple studies will

2483
01:37:17,158 --> 01:37:21,238
actually I'm sure come out within the

2484
01:37:19,238 --> 01:37:23,519
years to prove it that uh that little

2485
01:37:21,238 --> 01:37:25,839
bit of a dryback is like a positive

2486
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:27,800
stresser for the plant for sure cuz it's

2487
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:30,440
it's a perceived drought right because

2488
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:32,800
like they still have water available uh

2489
01:37:30,439 --> 01:37:36,198
like I think in in in Rockwell they have

2490
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:38,920
water available up to like 5% volumetric

2491
01:37:36,198 --> 01:37:41,198
water content and in Cocoa it's like 15

2492
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:44,279
or 10 depending on the electrical

2493
01:37:41,198 --> 01:37:45,759
conductivity um so like yeah you can get

2494
01:37:44,279 --> 01:37:47,039
really dry and they still have water and

2495
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:49,199
they'll still be fine but they're going

2496
01:37:47,039 --> 01:37:51,279
to like perceive it as a stressor and

2497
01:37:49,198 --> 01:37:54,879
then you can get sort of that that

2498
01:37:51,279 --> 01:37:57,519
flowering or generative growth steer in

2499
01:37:54,880 --> 01:38:00,880
in like that's how you would refer to it

2500
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:03,199
in uh crop steering and whatnot but it

2501
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:05,520
yeah it I feel like you're absolutely

2502
01:38:03,198 --> 01:38:08,439
right it's a very positive reaction in

2503
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:09,560
most cases there's also a fair amount of

2504
01:38:08,439 --> 01:38:12,118
cases where you're going to get like

2505
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:14,360
this huge issue that's going to arise

2506
01:38:12,118 --> 01:38:17,279
from too much of a dryback or too many

2507
01:38:14,359 --> 01:38:19,639
successive dryb backs that are extreme

2508
01:38:17,279 --> 01:38:21,279
um which buildup at that point you know

2509
01:38:19,639 --> 01:38:22,960
I mean absolutely and I really like what

2510
01:38:21,279 --> 01:38:25,319
you said about like the roots hunting

2511
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:26,920
for the water um and that's kind of

2512
01:38:25,319 --> 01:38:30,039
where I see that initial dryback like

2513
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:32,480
you transplant your clone um you you

2514
01:38:30,039 --> 01:38:34,599
irrigate it fully to run off and then

2515
01:38:32,479 --> 01:38:35,959
you you let let it like grow so the

2516
01:38:34,599 --> 01:38:37,480
roots are cuz you know the roots are

2517
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:40,118
using what's right there and then yeah

2518
01:38:37,479 --> 01:38:42,839
there's going to be some uh water

2519
01:38:40,118 --> 01:38:44,039
movement um across the media but the

2520
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:46,520
roots are still going to be searching

2521
01:38:44,039 --> 01:38:48,479
for the the best air to water ratio and

2522
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:50,960
so as they're just going to move out to

2523
01:38:48,479 --> 01:38:53,000
fully colonize that pot really rapidly

2524
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:54,880
at that point um it's probably going to

2525
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:56,880
go to the air areas where the it's less

2526
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:57,960
root dense and it's root ball because

2527
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:59,639
that's where the moist is going to be

2528
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:02,319
sitting CU there's no roots to suck it

2529
01:38:59,639 --> 01:39:06,599
up at that point so um it's yeah I I

2530
01:39:02,319 --> 01:39:08,679
can't agree more yeah absolutely um so

2531
01:39:06,599 --> 01:39:11,279
when uh like throughout all of your

2532
01:39:08,679 --> 01:39:13,920
experience CU now it's if you started in

2533
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:17,479
2008 and it's 2025 now then you've been

2534
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:19,480
growing for 17 years um what do you

2535
01:39:17,479 --> 01:39:21,879
think were some of the biggest learning

2536
01:39:19,479 --> 01:39:24,279
experiences that you had uh and let's

2537
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:27,079
make it a two-parter where you uh tell

2538
01:39:24,279 --> 01:39:29,158
us what was like a a big setback that

2539
01:39:27,079 --> 01:39:31,719
you learned from and then what was a big

2540
01:39:29,158 --> 01:39:34,679
success that you learned

2541
01:39:31,719 --> 01:39:37,639
from o yeah

2542
01:39:34,679 --> 01:39:38,960
so I think the big what here's a a

2543
01:39:37,639 --> 01:39:41,560
common one probably a lot of people

2544
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:46,118
share this one with me so it's not too

2545
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:47,719
but it was for me um we just had this

2546
01:39:46,118 --> 01:39:50,759
topic come up on cheap home grow not too

2547
01:39:47,719 --> 01:39:52,560
long ago um for me it's just like when

2548
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:55,800
you're curing when I was curing my

2549
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:57,719
cannabis when I was um because I was

2550
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:59,279
reading all these you know there's so

2551
01:39:57,719 --> 01:40:01,560
much information online and how much of

2552
01:39:59,279 --> 01:40:04,519
it's true we don't know until we triy

2553
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:07,360
things and for me it was like timing to

2554
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:09,960
get it off of the uh plant after it's

2555
01:40:07,359 --> 01:40:13,279
been hang drying and get it into the

2556
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:15,239
glass and uh seal it up and come back

2557
01:40:13,279 --> 01:40:17,000
you know I came back I I was I was

2558
01:40:15,238 --> 01:40:19,039
trying to get to the point where like oh

2559
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:21,359
I think the idea is to try to get it as

2560
01:40:19,039 --> 01:40:22,920
as wet as POS not I'm not trying to make

2561
01:40:21,359 --> 01:40:26,479
it more wet but I'm saying try to get it

2562
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:28,639
into the glass at the wetest point I can

2563
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:29,919
get away with it and it still turns out

2564
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:32,560
good because that's going to be the

2565
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:35,319
slowest cure because it's got more water

2566
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:36,719
to get rid of the problem is is you go

2567
01:40:35,319 --> 01:40:39,158
up to Against The Edge to where you put

2568
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:41,639
it in too wet and and what happened to

2569
01:40:39,158 --> 01:40:43,238
me was that you know I opened up uh

2570
01:40:41,639 --> 01:40:46,039
something that I'd put into a jar and it

2571
01:40:43,238 --> 01:40:48,118
was completely molded out and at that

2572
01:40:46,039 --> 01:40:50,000
point you can't smoke any of it you just

2573
01:40:48,118 --> 01:40:52,679
ruined you know for me that's probably

2574
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:55,359
an ounce ounce and a half in that jar

2575
01:40:52,679 --> 01:40:57,679
and uh wow that's something when you

2576
01:40:55,359 --> 01:40:59,000
know you take at least 3 months at least

2577
01:40:57,679 --> 01:41:00,599
three months probably for me at that

2578
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:03,800
time it was probably four months at

2579
01:41:00,599 --> 01:41:06,679
least uh of of growing and time and then

2580
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:08,920
you add on a couple weeks of drying and

2581
01:41:06,679 --> 01:41:11,239
uh you just threw it all away or felt

2582
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:12,560
it's devastating it's devastating but at

2583
01:41:11,238 --> 01:41:14,399
the same time it's something you don't

2584
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:16,039
ever forget and uh you're not going to

2585
01:41:14,399 --> 01:41:17,638
make that same mistake again so it's

2586
01:41:16,039 --> 01:41:20,519
almost invaluable it almost pays for

2587
01:41:17,639 --> 01:41:22,679
itself so in those times when you're

2588
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:24,040
frustrated with yourself think of that

2589
01:41:22,679 --> 01:41:25,599
think like

2590
01:41:24,039 --> 01:41:26,840
what can I learn from this because at

2591
01:41:25,599 --> 01:41:28,520
least there's some value there and you

2592
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:30,679
don't feel like so much of a failure

2593
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:32,920
you're finding something it's only a

2594
01:41:30,679 --> 01:41:34,679
failure if you don't learn from it yeah

2595
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:36,960
exactly and that one right there is I

2596
01:41:34,679 --> 01:41:39,279
mean that's an ounce of product that's

2597
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:41,560
rough so um that one was a tough one for

2598
01:41:39,279 --> 01:41:44,319
me but I think the

2599
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:47,119
biggest um I guess I'll call it a

2600
01:41:44,319 --> 01:41:49,559
setback but it wasn't at but I thought I

2601
01:41:47,118 --> 01:41:52,158
thought it was was uh when I the way I

2602
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:54,400
left Mitten Cano I still left Mitten

2603
01:41:52,158 --> 01:41:57,519
Cano well but

2604
01:41:54,399 --> 01:42:01,118
the short end of the story on on that

2605
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:03,480
was was that um at the time in the state

2606
01:42:01,118 --> 01:42:08,158
of Michigan there was a a push by a lot

2607
01:42:03,479 --> 01:42:09,919
of the big MSO multi-state operating um

2608
01:42:08,158 --> 01:42:13,638
corporations and things where they were

2609
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:15,960
actually paying lobbyists to change the

2610
01:42:13,639 --> 01:42:19,279
law in in the

2611
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:21,000
regulation um to basically make it way

2612
01:42:19,279 --> 01:42:24,559
harder for the hom grower make it way

2613
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:27,840
harder for caregivers and the you know

2614
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:30,000
they looked at those people as

2615
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:32,119
competition and uh in the commercial

2616
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,679
space it's a whole different thing and I

2617
01:42:32,118 --> 01:42:35,158
didn't agree with it and I lobbied hard

2618
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:37,279
against it and a lot of people in

2619
01:42:35,158 --> 01:42:40,238
Michigan lobbied hard against it and uh

2620
01:42:37,279 --> 01:42:41,158
we ultimately defeated that agenda but

2621
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:43,638
during

2622
01:42:41,158 --> 01:42:45,960
that there was a boycott list that was

2623
01:42:43,639 --> 01:42:48,400
started and it was spread a lot and I

2624
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:51,399
was a part of that and um this was a

2625
01:42:48,399 --> 01:42:54,118
list of companies that um directly we

2626
01:42:51,399 --> 01:42:56,799
found evidence of them

2627
01:42:54,118 --> 01:42:59,598
uh um affiliated with that Lobby in that

2628
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:04,480
Lobby group and

2629
01:42:59,599 --> 01:43:08,319
uh one of the uh dispensaries that was a

2630
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:10,718
customer that the CEO of our company the

2631
01:43:08,319 --> 01:43:13,279
owner of our company M canico was

2632
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:16,118
selling to that dispensary unbeknownst

2633
01:43:13,279 --> 01:43:20,079
to me for a little while and then I was

2634
01:43:16,118 --> 01:43:21,559
in the flower room and um him and

2635
01:43:20,079 --> 01:43:23,118
another employer had mentioned something

2636
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:25,000
about that company name I'm like wait

2637
01:43:23,118 --> 01:43:26,439
wait a minute what about that company I

2638
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:28,118
said oh we just had some flower go to

2639
01:43:26,439 --> 01:43:30,719
him and I'm like I thought you weren't

2640
01:43:28,118 --> 01:43:33,799
messing with companies like that and

2641
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:36,079
they laughed it off and that didn't make

2642
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:38,440
me happy obviously so I thought about it

2643
01:43:36,079 --> 01:43:41,238
for a little while and I decided no I I

2644
01:43:38,439 --> 01:43:43,960
know myself too well and that's not

2645
01:43:41,238 --> 01:43:46,879
going to make me a a happy situation so

2646
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:49,118
it's just one of those times in life you

2647
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:52,279
just you know right and wrong you you

2648
01:43:49,118 --> 01:43:54,880
got to make a choice and I did and I I I

2649
01:43:52,279 --> 01:43:56,279
walked away and well I I I went to the

2650
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:57,840
owner I didn't walk away I went to the

2651
01:43:56,279 --> 01:43:59,960
owner and I said look this is going to

2652
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:02,199
be my two weeks notice I can't work for

2653
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:03,520
you anymore not not that I can't work

2654
01:44:02,198 --> 01:44:06,039
for you anymore I can't work for a

2655
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:09,199
company that supplies people that I

2656
01:44:06,039 --> 01:44:12,639
don't believe in and uh so that are

2657
01:44:09,198 --> 01:44:14,960
actively lobbying against the practices

2658
01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:17,639
that you find to be the most Valu

2659
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:20,000
valuable to the the community absolutely

2660
01:44:17,639 --> 01:44:23,639
yes lobbying against homeg grower and

2661
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:24,439
caregivers I can't I can't support that

2662
01:44:23,639 --> 01:44:28,520
and

2663
01:44:24,439 --> 01:44:29,879
so you know um long story short I walked

2664
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:32,520
away from that job because we just

2665
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:36,118
didn't see I die on it and

2666
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:39,480
um uh at the time I I felt like that was

2667
01:44:36,118 --> 01:44:41,198
a huge setback you know like oh now what

2668
01:44:39,479 --> 01:44:43,519
you know what am I supposed to do now

2669
01:44:41,198 --> 01:44:46,238
and I just got a normal job doing the

2670
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:47,679
normal things and uh I thought pretty

2671
01:44:46,238 --> 01:44:50,519
much my whole career was over in the

2672
01:44:47,679 --> 01:44:52,719
field but uh I just kept doing what I do

2673
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:56,480
and talked about cannabis and growing

2674
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:58,198
cannabis ab and an opportunity with my

2675
01:44:56,479 --> 01:45:00,319
he was a good friend at the time uh

2676
01:44:58,198 --> 01:45:02,479
Grandmaster level at Thomas at

2677
01:45:00,319 --> 01:45:05,079
Grandmaster level and he reached out to

2678
01:45:02,479 --> 01:45:06,959
me and he said hey we want to have a

2679
01:45:05,079 --> 01:45:08,439
warehouse in the United States what do

2680
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:13,520
you think do you think you could uh help

2681
01:45:08,439 --> 01:45:15,598
us out I said absolutely I quit my job

2682
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:17,040
that's awesome man yeah do you do you

2683
01:45:15,599 --> 01:45:18,360
have a background in logistics or

2684
01:45:17,039 --> 01:45:21,719
anything like that because that seems

2685
01:45:18,359 --> 01:45:23,960
like such a huge yeah in Michigan a lot

2686
01:45:21,719 --> 01:45:25,480
of the jobs that I've uh have there's a

2687
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:28,000
lot of manufacturing here in Michigan so

2688
01:45:25,479 --> 01:45:31,359
a lot of the jobs that I've had is in in

2689
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:32,960
manufacturing and I always seem to in in

2690
01:45:31,359 --> 01:45:35,279
factories and I always seem to no matter

2691
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:37,800
where I start I'd always end up shipping

2692
01:45:35,279 --> 01:45:39,679
and receiving so I've got a lot of uh I

2693
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:41,960
do have a lot of experience in that so

2694
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:44,000
that did help a lot that's awesome I

2695
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:46,960
mean it's definitely combining like a a

2696
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:49,279
skill and a passion that uh I feel like

2697
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:50,639
a lot of people look for in life and

2698
01:45:49,279 --> 01:45:53,519
it's really cool that you were able to

2699
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:55,960
find that you know it's almost like

2700
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:58,159
um you feel like all the doors are shut

2701
01:45:55,960 --> 01:46:00,000
and then uh one just opens up and you're

2702
01:45:58,158 --> 01:46:02,519
like damn this is a nice door to walk

2703
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:06,118
through right now yeah

2704
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:09,040
and within that first year I mean he's

2705
01:46:06,118 --> 01:46:10,679
uh a been to now around the world man i'

2706
01:46:09,039 --> 01:46:13,039
never left the country other than I did

2707
01:46:10,679 --> 01:46:16,039
go to Canada in high school I think for

2708
01:46:13,039 --> 01:46:18,960
watch a play or something but I mean he

2709
01:46:16,039 --> 01:46:22,118
sent me to Barcelona for spannabis in

2710
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:23,639
the ICBC uh sent me to Berlin the month

2711
01:46:22,118 --> 01:46:26,719
after that

2712
01:46:23,639 --> 01:46:30,440
uh they then we went to we just got back

2713
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:32,359
uh from December in Vegas at the uh MJ

2714
01:46:30,439 --> 01:46:34,238
biscon my first time ever in Vegas my

2715
01:46:32,359 --> 01:46:36,118
first time ever at MJ biscon and that

2716
01:46:34,238 --> 01:46:39,839
was all because of the opportunities of

2717
01:46:36,118 --> 01:46:41,960
working with the grandm LEDs So Dope

2718
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:44,440
shout out to him because uh he's made my

2719
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:46,480
life awesome what a great guy that's

2720
01:46:44,439 --> 01:46:48,359
awesome I should see if he wants to come

2721
01:46:46,479 --> 01:46:50,439
in and talk about his growing cuz I he

2722
01:46:48,359 --> 01:46:52,519
is like such a huge stickler for making

2723
01:46:50,439 --> 01:46:55,678
sure that his grow is perfect and I feel

2724
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:57,199
like oppos grower than me absolutely he

2725
01:46:55,679 --> 01:47:00,118
I've seen him tear down more grows than

2726
01:46:57,198 --> 01:47:02,559
I think I've seen him complete um just

2727
01:47:00,118 --> 01:47:04,158
at least the way that he was for a while

2728
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:05,679
showing it through Instagram it just

2729
01:47:04,158 --> 01:47:08,359
seemed like if it wasn't perfect he's

2730
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:11,079
like I'm done I'm I'm I'm I'm not doing

2731
01:47:08,359 --> 01:47:13,439
this round and I'm

2732
01:47:11,079 --> 01:47:16,920
restarting he doesn't play around man

2733
01:47:13,439 --> 01:47:20,158
and he he is like and I think that's

2734
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:21,880
that's why I'm so um happy to work for

2735
01:47:20,158 --> 01:47:24,519
him because I know that the product is

2736
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:26,960
is the same way like he's on the phone

2737
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:28,400
to endless hours to make sure that the

2738
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:31,039
product's exactly the way he wants he

2739
01:47:28,399 --> 01:47:33,799
doesn't care if that's not

2740
01:47:31,039 --> 01:47:35,079
possible he doesn't care engineer to

2741
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:36,400
make things that aren't possible

2742
01:47:35,079 --> 01:47:38,920
possible because that's what he wants

2743
01:47:36,399 --> 01:47:40,920
and it needs to work his way and that's

2744
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:42,199
awesome that's a that's a good trait for

2745
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:43,480
somebody who's designing a product

2746
01:47:42,198 --> 01:47:45,000
that's supposed to be bulletproof in a

2747
01:47:43,479 --> 01:47:48,519
grow room that's you know it's some

2748
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:50,399
pretty pretty you know High some pretty

2749
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:52,719
extreme environments in my opinion some

2750
01:47:50,399 --> 01:47:55,598
of the Heats that uh these lights have

2751
01:47:52,719 --> 01:47:57,279
to to sit in and uh get sprayed on and

2752
01:47:55,599 --> 01:48:00,279
and everything else and still continue

2753
01:47:57,279 --> 01:48:01,840
to work day in day out it can be pretty

2754
01:48:00,279 --> 01:48:04,439
surprising

2755
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:07,319
uh what they can make it through man

2756
01:48:04,439 --> 01:48:10,079
I've seen some things already that's I

2757
01:48:07,319 --> 01:48:13,639
mean that's great I uh finding a good

2758
01:48:10,079 --> 01:48:17,000
LED supplier is so crucial nowadays that

2759
01:48:13,639 --> 01:48:18,920
uh I haven't personally tried the um

2760
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:21,238
grandmas level LEDs but lately we've

2761
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:23,039
been really digging uh spec grade LEDs

2762
01:48:21,238 --> 01:48:26,718
because they are just they are

2763
01:48:23,039 --> 01:48:28,920
bulletproof and the the heat output on

2764
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:30,880
them is is crazy good it it just

2765
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:33,158
everything seems to flower so nicely

2766
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:34,960
under their Spectrum too I I haven't

2767
01:48:33,158 --> 01:48:36,839
really gotten much into Spectrum tuning

2768
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:38,560
but uh you know maybe in the future

2769
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:41,960
that's something that's in my in my

2770
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:43,440
pathway um so with those as your

2771
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:46,118
setbacks and what you've learned from

2772
01:48:43,439 --> 01:48:50,000
them and how you kind of came through

2773
01:48:46,118 --> 01:48:52,519
that that that's an amazing story um but

2774
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:55,520
uh what about in terms of a success that

2775
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:59,239
you found where it like maybe it was an

2776
01:48:55,520 --> 01:49:02,840
a happy accident um or uh something that

2777
01:48:59,238 --> 01:49:04,879
was purposeful that just either changed

2778
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:06,800
your perspective on growing or that you

2779
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:08,599
just were like you learned something so

2780
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:10,039
valuable from that it's still being used

2781
01:49:08,599 --> 01:49:13,920
in your garden

2782
01:49:10,039 --> 01:49:16,479
today I would have to say just my for

2783
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:20,158
for one my idolizing I guess maybe it

2784
01:49:16,479 --> 01:49:22,799
got to that point at one point uh of uh

2785
01:49:20,158 --> 01:49:25,118
collectimus coup and his teachings

2786
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:27,639
because I love his noons approach and he

2787
01:49:25,118 --> 01:49:30,000
doesn't miss words about you know how he

2788
01:49:27,639 --> 01:49:34,279
feels there's no nobody in the room

2789
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:37,359
wonders how he feels about something and

2790
01:49:34,279 --> 01:49:39,399
uh I love that in this industry where

2791
01:49:37,359 --> 01:49:44,719
it's kind of been in the secret for so

2792
01:49:39,399 --> 01:49:49,238
long and uh there's so many pay walls or

2793
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:51,960
so many uh wies Tales we'll say on some

2794
01:49:49,238 --> 01:49:55,118
things um it's great to to see somebody

2795
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:57,480
who's all about just truth and honesty

2796
01:49:55,118 --> 01:49:59,359
and what is just easy let's just grow

2797
01:49:57,479 --> 01:50:02,000
some weed and not not make it difficult

2798
01:49:59,359 --> 01:50:03,279
for people and from that relationship I

2799
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:06,158
learned about worm castings and like you

2800
01:50:03,279 --> 01:50:07,960
said you get your own your own worm bin

2801
01:50:06,158 --> 01:50:09,359
that's you automatically gain points

2802
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:10,880
with me when you say things like that

2803
01:50:09,359 --> 01:50:13,039
because that's the that's the secret

2804
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:15,319
sauce that yeah there is the science and

2805
01:50:13,039 --> 01:50:18,158
I've read multiple books on it that

2806
01:50:15,319 --> 01:50:19,679
tells you why it does the things it does

2807
01:50:18,158 --> 01:50:21,479
but you don't need to know it all all

2808
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:23,560
you need to know is that if you start

2809
01:50:21,479 --> 01:50:25,439
your own worm bin

2810
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:27,639
and uh you a quick Google search will

2811
01:50:25,439 --> 01:50:30,919
give you good advice on how to do a worm

2812
01:50:27,639 --> 01:50:33,480
bin um the product of that worm bin is

2813
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:35,560
is like magic to me that is like one of

2814
01:50:33,479 --> 01:50:38,039
the number one things I'll do on a plant

2815
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:40,159
that I'm not sure what's going on with

2816
01:50:38,039 --> 01:50:41,359
it what is going on with this plant if I

2817
01:50:40,158 --> 01:50:43,198
know it's some kind of a nutrient

2818
01:50:41,359 --> 01:50:45,118
deficiency or something I'm going right

2819
01:50:43,198 --> 01:50:46,678
to the worm castings first thing because

2820
01:50:45,118 --> 01:50:48,078
that's a that's an easy one I'll just

2821
01:50:46,679 --> 01:50:49,480
put a little bit worm castings water it

2822
01:50:48,078 --> 01:50:51,639
in wait a couple days and let's see if

2823
01:50:49,479 --> 01:50:54,198
is it getting better is it getting worse

2824
01:50:51,639 --> 01:50:57,880
uh but for me worm castings nine out of

2825
01:50:54,198 --> 01:50:59,919
10 times just work and I don't know why

2826
01:50:57,880 --> 01:51:01,639
I mean I have an idea but I I mean I

2827
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:03,399
don't I can't specifically tell you well

2828
01:51:01,639 --> 01:51:05,679
I was having the magnesium deficiency

2829
01:51:03,399 --> 01:51:07,679
and there just so happened to be a

2830
01:51:05,679 --> 01:51:09,078
bacteria in the worm casting that helps

2831
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:11,679
Liberate the Magnesium that was already

2832
01:51:09,078 --> 01:51:13,039
locked up in the soil uh so that the the

2833
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:15,399
plant could take that I couldn't tell

2834
01:51:13,039 --> 01:51:19,078
you all of that because I didn't do a a

2835
01:51:15,399 --> 01:51:21,479
soil test or any or Leaf of leaf uh

2836
01:51:19,078 --> 01:51:23,279
paste test or anything like that all I

2837
01:51:21,479 --> 01:51:26,118
can tell you is I put some worm castings

2838
01:51:23,279 --> 01:51:28,559
on it and the plant got way better

2839
01:51:26,118 --> 01:51:30,359
looking I mean sometimes the secret

2840
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:32,239
sauce is the secret sauce you know you

2841
01:51:30,359 --> 01:51:34,519
don't have to know what's what's in it

2842
01:51:32,238 --> 01:51:38,678
you just have to know it tastes good

2843
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:40,480
exactly so I totally get that it's uh

2844
01:51:38,679 --> 01:51:42,158
and and worm castings yeah like I I

2845
01:51:40,479 --> 01:51:44,078
don't use it at all on my indoor garden

2846
01:51:42,158 --> 01:51:46,598
because I I just am strictly hydroponic

2847
01:51:44,078 --> 01:51:48,799
at home even because I just it uh it

2848
01:51:46,599 --> 01:51:50,319
helps me hone my skills for the the

2849
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:52,159
commercial grow as well just to make

2850
01:51:50,319 --> 01:51:53,719
sure that I'm I'm continuing that

2851
01:51:52,158 --> 01:51:55,679
practice and I'm I'm even like I'm

2852
01:51:53,719 --> 01:51:58,078
planning on doing some tomatoes that way

2853
01:51:55,679 --> 01:52:00,719
this year too just to see what how how

2854
01:51:58,078 --> 01:52:03,118
productive they can actually be

2855
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:05,239
um but you know on everything else

2856
01:52:03,118 --> 01:52:06,920
hitting them with worm castings uh

2857
01:52:05,238 --> 01:52:08,559
especially on tomatoes or anything like

2858
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:10,158
that I always find that like calcium and

2859
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:12,159
magnesium are the things that I always

2860
01:52:10,158 --> 01:52:15,118
run into an issue of and you start to

2861
01:52:12,158 --> 01:52:17,559
get those like the brown spots uh on the

2862
01:52:15,118 --> 01:52:19,839
ends of the tomatoes or um yeah that's

2863
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:22,599
why when you ask me about my organic

2864
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:24,000
practices um it's usually worm casting

2865
01:52:22,599 --> 01:52:26,679
and gypsum because that brings you in

2866
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:29,920
the the calcium it also brings in Sulfur

2867
01:52:26,679 --> 01:52:31,279
like I love sulfur for gypsum for sure

2868
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:33,118
I'm throwing that on all the time I

2869
01:52:31,279 --> 01:52:34,880
sometimes just will put some in my uh in

2870
01:52:33,118 --> 01:52:36,639
my worm bend too and let them work

2871
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:38,239
through it cuz they don't seem to mind

2872
01:52:36,639 --> 01:52:40,199
having that little extra grit I think

2873
01:52:38,238 --> 01:52:41,519
they need a little grit in their guts to

2874
01:52:40,198 --> 01:52:43,519
make sure everything gets through

2875
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:47,280
correctly

2876
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:49,199
um so uh you know man this has been

2877
01:52:47,279 --> 01:52:50,840
really great I've I've loved talking

2878
01:52:49,198 --> 01:52:54,118
with you I feel like I could just keep

2879
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:56,159
going on and on and on about uh just the

2880
01:52:54,118 --> 01:52:58,198
different aspects of your growing style

2881
01:52:56,158 --> 01:53:00,839
and and the choices that you make in

2882
01:52:58,198 --> 01:53:02,839
both a a cultivator mindset where you're

2883
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:05,400
trying to do this for like a specific

2884
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:06,800
goal um and then also you know as a

2885
01:53:05,399 --> 01:53:09,319
homeg grower and a caregiver where

2886
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:11,000
you're doing it for a specific outcome

2887
01:53:09,319 --> 01:53:13,198
of like what that medicine is going to

2888
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:15,439
be for for you or for whoever you're

2889
01:53:13,198 --> 01:53:17,678
providing it for but you know I'm going

2890
01:53:15,439 --> 01:53:20,919
to try and uh get into some of these

2891
01:53:17,679 --> 01:53:24,239
last few questions uh start to to get

2892
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:26,599
towards a wrapup here but um so having

2893
01:53:24,238 --> 01:53:29,319
worked uh in both the cultivation

2894
01:53:26,599 --> 01:53:32,840
industry on a commercial scale as well

2895
01:53:29,319 --> 01:53:35,719
as helping um Venture into it with your

2896
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:37,520
friend baked poem and then being a home

2897
01:53:35,719 --> 01:53:39,840
grower and a caregiver you know all the

2898
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:41,840
different badges that you wear where

2899
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:44,078
would you like to see the cultivation

2900
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:47,520
industry go in terms of uh what do you

2901
01:53:44,078 --> 01:53:50,118
think needs to change for for the

2902
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:52,960
cultivation industry uh as a whole you

2903
01:53:50,118 --> 01:53:55,279
know home grow uh commercial

2904
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:58,840
all all things in

2905
01:53:55,279 --> 01:54:00,719
between um I think that the I think that

2906
01:53:58,840 --> 01:54:03,239
ultimately the biggest thing that I

2907
01:54:00,719 --> 01:54:05,158
would love to see change is um in the

2908
01:54:03,238 --> 01:54:07,879
Cannabis Community I think

2909
01:54:05,158 --> 01:54:11,279
that all of us spend a lot of time

2910
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:12,760
online in in our little communities

2911
01:54:11,279 --> 01:54:15,198
which is normal for us humans to

2912
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:17,840
separate into little groups but when we

2913
01:54:15,198 --> 01:54:20,238
get into the points where like we're

2914
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:22,719
both organic gardeners and G and arguing

2915
01:54:20,238 --> 01:54:26,078
over who's more organic it's like come

2916
01:54:22,719 --> 01:54:29,239
on guys we're all really a minority

2917
01:54:26,078 --> 01:54:31,559
still in the uh in in the grand scheme

2918
01:54:29,238 --> 01:54:34,238
of things when you you you walk down the

2919
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:36,880
streets you know it's not you're not

2920
01:54:34,238 --> 01:54:38,000
going to see you know the vast majority

2921
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:40,000
of people walking down the streets

2922
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:42,439
smoking on cannabis yet it's still not

2923
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,520
as accepted so we're all part of the

2924
01:54:42,439 --> 01:54:47,118
same group guys we have to stop the the

2925
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:49,599
little bit of infighting and stop the

2926
01:54:47,118 --> 01:54:51,598
the need to separate ourselves out into

2927
01:54:49,599 --> 01:54:52,920
little groups and uh I just wish there

2928
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:54,400
was

2929
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:56,520
not that there isn't because there's

2930
01:54:54,399 --> 01:54:58,559
awesome awesome people in the Cannabis

2931
01:54:56,520 --> 01:55:01,079
community and I've been blessed to meet

2932
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:03,560
many of them but I want that for

2933
01:55:01,078 --> 01:55:05,519
everyone right I don't I want that for

2934
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:07,880
everyone and I think that if we as

2935
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:11,840
cannabis users cannabis Growers just are

2936
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:14,078
good human beings uh and also smoke

2937
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:15,960
cannabis that right there does a lot for

2938
01:55:14,078 --> 01:55:18,078
the movement you know what I mean that

2939
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:19,679
right there you know you know it could

2940
01:55:18,078 --> 01:55:21,599
be something like somebody says

2941
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:23,359
someone's talking trash on cannabis and

2942
01:55:21,599 --> 01:55:25,360
somebody in the conversation could be

2943
01:55:23,359 --> 01:55:27,719
like wait my neighbor smokes cannabis

2944
01:55:25,359 --> 01:55:29,598
and he shovels my [ __ ] driveway you

2945
01:55:27,719 --> 01:55:31,239
know when it snows too much what a great

2946
01:55:29,599 --> 01:55:33,920
guy I don't give a [ __ ] about that I

2947
01:55:31,238 --> 01:55:36,118
think that's cool you know and that just

2948
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:37,760
you don't have to be like I I get into

2949
01:55:36,118 --> 01:55:39,920
it because I get to go to these protests

2950
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:41,679
and stuff and I can I get it I get

2951
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:43,279
people wanting to you know get a little

2952
01:55:41,679 --> 01:55:45,440
bit more aggressive about it or whatever

2953
01:55:43,279 --> 01:55:47,439
but you get a lot more you get a lot

2954
01:55:45,439 --> 01:55:51,078
further with honey sometimes than you do

2955
01:55:47,439 --> 01:55:53,799
with uh with uh I can't remember the uh

2956
01:55:51,078 --> 01:55:56,639
expression more flies with honey with

2957
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:57,800
vinegar yeah exactly so there is a time

2958
01:55:56,639 --> 01:56:00,719
and place I guess for a little bit of

2959
01:55:57,800 --> 01:56:02,599
vinegar but uh keep it to your fats

2960
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:04,279
absolutely and and and also you know

2961
01:56:02,599 --> 01:56:06,159
like I I totally agree with that you

2962
01:56:04,279 --> 01:56:09,759
it's like uh bringing the community

2963
01:56:06,158 --> 01:56:12,759
together uh as as a whole rather than

2964
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:16,760
fragmenting into different encampments

2965
01:56:12,760 --> 01:56:19,639
uh would help uh I feel like reduce the

2966
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:21,800
stigma overall because I feel like when

2967
01:56:19,639 --> 01:56:24,440
when you look from the outside at a at a

2968
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:26,880
at a group grou let's say um and you see

2969
01:56:24,439 --> 01:56:30,359
infighting within that group it's really

2970
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:32,760
hard to take what is then being um

2971
01:56:30,359 --> 01:56:36,039
publicized whether it be a political

2972
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:38,599
agenda or a social movement or otherwise

2973
01:56:36,039 --> 01:56:40,158
as being valid because you start to see

2974
01:56:38,599 --> 01:56:43,560
these people you're like they can't even

2975
01:56:40,158 --> 01:56:47,319
decide what they want to do uh together

2976
01:56:43,560 --> 01:56:49,760
uh so how do we how are we supposed to

2977
01:56:47,319 --> 01:56:53,238
view them from the position of not being

2978
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:55,560
part of that group um great and it's

2979
01:56:53,238 --> 01:56:58,000
it's a it's in some cases it's a little

2980
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:59,960
bit of a bad look so I totally agree

2981
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:03,158
like we need to definitely break down

2982
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:06,000
some of those internal barriers that uh

2983
01:57:03,158 --> 01:57:09,319
like Growers and consumers and even just

2984
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:13,760
people who love the idea and the you

2985
01:57:09,319 --> 01:57:15,238
know the the community of cannabis um we

2986
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:17,360
just we definitely need to come together

2987
01:57:15,238 --> 01:57:20,118
I I wholeheartedly agree that is

2988
01:57:17,359 --> 01:57:22,719
something that the entire uh Community

2989
01:57:20,118 --> 01:57:26,198
could benefit from

2990
01:57:22,719 --> 01:57:28,599
um so a lot of new growers face pitfalls

2991
01:57:26,198 --> 01:57:30,598
and as the cheap home grow um you know

2992
01:57:28,599 --> 01:57:33,000
the the growing with my fellow Growers

2993
01:57:30,599 --> 01:57:34,920
you you run into a lot of new Growers

2994
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:37,840
that's one of the first podcasts I

2995
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:40,000
listen to as a new grower um I feel like

2996
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:43,679
so many other people uh listen to it to

2997
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:47,679
try and glean little um insights and

2998
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:52,639
other uh tidbits of good information um

2999
01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:54,000
so what do you feel as though uh if if

3000
01:57:52,639 --> 01:57:56,078
you were to put yourself in that

3001
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:58,800
category of a new grower knowing what

3002
01:57:56,078 --> 01:58:00,880
you know now what would be some of the

3003
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:02,639
advice you would give to yourself or to

3004
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:05,078
new growers in

3005
01:58:02,639 --> 01:58:06,639
general oh I would that's easy I would

3006
01:58:05,078 --> 01:58:09,439
give the same advice that was given to

3007
01:58:06,639 --> 01:58:11,880
me when I when I first uh started

3008
01:58:09,439 --> 01:58:14,078
growing I kept I can't remember who

3009
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:17,880
exactly first said it to me but it stuck

3010
01:58:14,078 --> 01:58:19,439
in my head and that was um I was asking

3011
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:20,960
who was it I was an old grower or

3012
01:58:19,439 --> 01:58:22,598
somebody but I was asking you know what

3013
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:24,960
what's a good tip give me a good and

3014
01:58:22,599 --> 01:58:26,639
they said just be patient learn to be

3015
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:28,439
patient be a patient person a lot of

3016
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:31,000
time there's so many times in growing

3017
01:58:28,439 --> 01:58:32,879
where you want to freak out about oh my

3018
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:34,760
God what's going on and you come back

3019
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:37,039
the next day after doing nothing and

3020
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:38,639
it's completely fine it's completely

3021
01:58:37,039 --> 01:58:42,319
fine and there's times where it's the

3022
01:58:38,639 --> 01:58:44,840
opposite of that too but uh so so for me

3023
01:58:42,319 --> 01:58:47,920
to have a little patience with my grow

3024
01:58:44,840 --> 01:58:49,800
um and maybe that's uh hard for some

3025
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:51,118
people it was hard for me I was one of

3026
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:52,599
the people that would look at every

3027
01:58:51,118 --> 01:58:55,118
[ __ ] day

3028
01:58:52,599 --> 01:58:57,760
uh I wanted to measure it or see how

3029
01:58:55,118 --> 01:59:02,118
much it grew and this and that um and

3030
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:03,159
I've as I've matured in both life and as

3031
01:59:02,118 --> 01:59:06,000
a

3032
01:59:03,158 --> 01:59:09,479
grower I I've learned to step away more

3033
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:12,319
than than be on top of things like that

3034
01:59:09,479 --> 01:59:15,078
and um being patient for me in the

3035
01:59:12,319 --> 01:59:17,840
garden especially for me in the curing

3036
01:59:15,078 --> 01:59:20,679
process in the drying proc process it's

3037
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:22,279
just helped me up my game I feel uh

3038
01:59:20,679 --> 01:59:25,520
tremendously

3039
01:59:22,279 --> 01:59:29,359
um so it's good to be vigilant it's good

3040
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:32,000
to uh to care and to love your plant but

3041
01:59:29,359 --> 01:59:34,598
you can over love your plant and and do

3042
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:36,760
too much um so have a little bit of

3043
01:59:34,599 --> 01:59:39,880
patience I think I would

3044
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:42,159
say yeah I you know I think that that's

3045
01:59:39,880 --> 01:59:44,719
uh that's the second answer that we've

3046
01:59:42,158 --> 01:59:47,638
gotten as as patience being the advice

3047
01:59:44,719 --> 01:59:52,158
to give to a new grower and it's uh it's

3048
01:59:47,639 --> 01:59:55,118
so true I mean even you know it's a kind

3049
01:59:52,158 --> 01:59:57,118
of the common uh Trope of always telling

3050
01:59:55,118 --> 01:59:59,719
people two more weeks when they're

3051
01:59:57,118 --> 02:00:01,279
looking at their flowering cycle uh just

3052
01:59:59,719 --> 02:00:03,118
to make sure that they get to the end of

3053
02:00:01,279 --> 02:00:05,840
it and they're satisfied with their

3054
02:00:03,118 --> 02:00:08,598
Harvest and then you're absolutely right

3055
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:11,639
like not rushing the dry not rushing The

3056
02:00:08,599 --> 02:00:14,400
Cure uh but so much of that does come

3057
02:00:11,639 --> 02:00:16,840
with practice and repetition and it

3058
02:00:14,399 --> 02:00:19,879
feels as though I feel like patience is

3059
02:00:16,840 --> 02:00:22,440
almost guaranteed after a couple years

3060
02:00:19,880 --> 02:00:24,199
of doing it and so I feel like if if you

3061
02:00:22,439 --> 02:00:26,039
can't have patience at first you need to

3062
02:00:24,198 --> 02:00:28,238
have perseverance so that you make it

3063
02:00:26,039 --> 02:00:30,840
through those harvests and all those

3064
02:00:28,238 --> 02:00:32,319
those fuckups and uh you know issues

3065
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:34,880
that you run

3066
02:00:32,319 --> 02:00:37,198
into absolutely

3067
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:38,800
absolutely and that that that's the best

3068
02:00:37,198 --> 02:00:40,559
teacher we've talked about it earlier is

3069
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:42,400
that don't don't worry about the fuckups

3070
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:44,440
just ask yourself when you do [ __ ] up

3071
02:00:42,399 --> 02:00:47,719
what's the lesson in this so I don't do

3072
02:00:44,439 --> 02:00:49,319
it again yeah yeah absolutely well those

3073
02:00:47,719 --> 02:00:51,679
are the last of the main questions that

3074
02:00:49,319 --> 02:00:54,479
I have but I do like to do a couple of

3075
02:00:51,679 --> 02:00:58,039
the uh ubiquitous podcast wrap-up

3076
02:00:54,479 --> 02:00:59,638
questions because um you know it's uh I

3077
02:00:58,039 --> 02:01:03,599
feel like it's important just to round

3078
02:00:59,639 --> 02:01:05,800
out the the story um so uh what was the

3079
02:01:03,599 --> 02:01:08,279
first time you ever smoked

3080
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:10,719
cannabis I don't even recall the first

3081
02:01:08,279 --> 02:01:12,399
time I smoked cannabis um it could be

3082
02:01:10,719 --> 02:01:14,239
the most memorable of your early

3083
02:01:12,399 --> 02:01:17,399
experiences tell you the first time I

3084
02:01:14,238 --> 02:01:20,319
got high so um because I smoked it many

3085
02:01:17,399 --> 02:01:21,920
times before that as I was a kid so fun

3086
02:01:20,319 --> 02:01:25,439
fact I grew cannibals before I smoke

3087
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:27,440
smoked cannabis um and that was for uh

3088
02:01:25,439 --> 02:01:29,158
being a caregiver and for my uncle and

3089
02:01:27,439 --> 02:01:33,118
all that I'd never smoked it at that

3090
02:01:29,158 --> 02:01:36,439
time um there after after I saw did you

3091
02:01:33,118 --> 02:01:38,238
say why no I said no way oh yeah no way

3092
02:01:36,439 --> 02:01:41,078
yeah exactly that you're the first

3093
02:01:38,238 --> 02:01:42,799
person that uh grew before they smoked

3094
02:01:41,078 --> 02:01:46,840
yeah I don't know if I am ever the first

3095
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:46,840
person sure first first on the podcast

3096
02:01:47,479 --> 02:01:52,158
sorry but yeah it was it was when I saw

3097
02:01:50,359 --> 02:01:54,960
what it did for my uncle that it convin

3098
02:01:52,158 --> 02:01:57,078
me like okay this is this is something

3099
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:58,840
that you should probably be taking just

3100
02:01:57,078 --> 02:02:02,078
as a maintenance thing because look what

3101
02:01:58,840 --> 02:02:04,279
it just did yeah and so um and that's my

3102
02:02:02,078 --> 02:02:05,880
uncle who that's my blood and you know

3103
02:02:04,279 --> 02:02:08,800
that means I'm maybe genetically

3104
02:02:05,880 --> 02:02:10,840
disposed to some of the things he had so

3105
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:14,760
um I started trying at that point but uh

3106
02:02:10,840 --> 02:02:19,319
I would smoke bowls and and joints and

3107
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:21,599
bongs and never feel felt anything like

3108
02:02:19,319 --> 02:02:23,238
hold it for as long as I could whatever

3109
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:25,920
all the different things and I never

3110
02:02:23,238 --> 02:02:28,000
really felt like anything and then I was

3111
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:32,880
late in the game I was 20s I was in my

3112
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:34,920
20s at the time well yeah uh and uh but

3113
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:37,199
what the first time I felt it was a

3114
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:41,239
basically an overdose and it was an

3115
02:02:37,198 --> 02:02:42,559
edible I ate a uh I made i' made one of

3116
02:02:41,238 --> 02:02:44,678
the things I like to do as a caregiver

3117
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:46,840
is make edibles around Christmas and one

3118
02:02:44,679 --> 02:02:49,520
of the things I made was a brownie but I

3119
02:02:46,840 --> 02:02:51,119
made them in little Loaf in little loafs

3120
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:52,639
and I got it right out right when it

3121
02:02:51,118 --> 02:02:55,880
came out of the oven so it was hot and

3122
02:02:52,639 --> 02:02:57,920
juicy and oh it was so good so I ate a

3123
02:02:55,880 --> 02:03:00,920
whole loaf of it and who cares because I

3124
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:04,239
didn't really you know get a FM before

3125
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:05,560
but my God as then after I ate the whole

3126
02:03:04,238 --> 02:03:06,799
thing I realized I ate the whole thing

3127
02:03:05,560 --> 02:03:08,119
because it was almost like an automatic

3128
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:09,760
thing where just chewing on something

3129
02:03:08,118 --> 02:03:11,839
it's good and I was going to eat only

3130
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:13,880
half but you know you just keep going

3131
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:16,880
there's there's a psychological Factor

3132
02:03:13,880 --> 02:03:19,319
when you eat a specific uh ratio of fat

3133
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:21,400
to Sugar where you're if you don't

3134
02:03:19,319 --> 02:03:23,759
consciously stop yourself from eating

3135
02:03:21,399 --> 02:03:26,719
your mind will not stop you from eating

3136
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:29,520
even past the um point of being full

3137
02:03:26,719 --> 02:03:32,279
like it's it's this like uh psych

3138
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:34,440
psychological thing that happens so I

3139
02:03:32,279 --> 02:03:36,639
believe it's no

3140
02:03:34,439 --> 02:03:38,839
surprise and so I ate this thing and

3141
02:03:36,639 --> 02:03:40,800
later I did the math and it was upward

3142
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:42,760
of a th000 milligrams I think it was

3143
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:44,079
like you know maybe a little bit changed

3144
02:03:42,760 --> 02:03:46,960
lower

3145
02:03:44,078 --> 02:03:49,519
but so it was it was night time and IID

3146
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:51,319
laid down and I'd started feeling like

3147
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:53,559
whoa I'm starting to feel high almost

3148
02:03:51,319 --> 02:03:56,000
like drunkenness a little bit I'm like

3149
02:03:53,559 --> 02:03:58,119
this is crazy so I'm gonna lay down

3150
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:59,599
maybe I'll just fall asleep and you know

3151
02:03:58,118 --> 02:04:01,279
then it just kept getting stronger and

3152
02:03:59,599 --> 02:04:03,239
stronger then the room started spinning

3153
02:04:01,279 --> 02:04:04,479
like literally like the room started

3154
02:04:03,238 --> 02:04:06,118
spinning and that's like the feeling

3155
02:04:04,479 --> 02:04:09,399
that I get right before I'm going to

3156
02:04:06,118 --> 02:04:11,399
puke you know so I'm laying there the

3157
02:04:09,399 --> 02:04:13,158
room is spinning so I turn the lights

3158
02:04:11,399 --> 02:04:14,759
the light the little night light on and

3159
02:04:13,158 --> 02:04:17,039
that that gives me something to focus on

3160
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:18,760
and I can stop the room from spinning

3161
02:04:17,039 --> 02:04:21,559
and I had like this

3162
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:22,239
almost almost psychedelic experience in

3163
02:04:21,559 --> 02:04:24,079
that

3164
02:04:22,238 --> 02:04:26,319
it's like all this happened in my mind

3165
02:04:24,078 --> 02:04:29,840
but what I experienced was like kind of

3166
02:04:26,319 --> 02:04:31,359
floating through space around and I

3167
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:33,639
don't know how else to describe it other

3168
02:04:31,359 --> 02:04:35,238
than I I knew for a fact that like this

3169
02:04:33,639 --> 02:04:38,639
glass-like material in front of me was

3170
02:04:35,238 --> 02:04:42,198
my Consciousness and it like shattered a

3171
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:43,800
bunch of different pieces and I was like

3172
02:04:42,198 --> 02:04:47,519
I I felt the same as I do sitting in

3173
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:49,079
this chair but I I was I I was formless

3174
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:50,960
I didn't have arms and legs and stuff

3175
02:04:49,078 --> 02:04:52,439
but I somehow like with my mind just out

3176
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:54,480
of pure will was like pulling these

3177
02:04:52,439 --> 02:04:57,000
pieces back together like trying to get

3178
02:04:54,479 --> 02:04:58,479
them all to go back together and um the

3179
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:01,118
strange thing is is I didn't get them

3180
02:04:58,479 --> 02:05:03,479
all back uh before you know coming back

3181
02:05:01,118 --> 02:05:07,158
to or whatever coming back to this plane

3182
02:05:03,479 --> 02:05:08,558
or whatever whatever happened to me um

3183
02:05:07,158 --> 02:05:11,319
so what did I leave behind I don't know

3184
02:05:08,559 --> 02:05:13,559
that's interesting but uh I had a hell

3185
02:05:11,319 --> 02:05:17,078
of a cotton mouth so

3186
02:05:13,559 --> 02:05:19,079
thirsty um but uh super lethargic and

3187
02:05:17,078 --> 02:05:21,920
could barely move my arms without tons

3188
02:05:19,078 --> 02:05:24,679
of concentration and stuff like that uh

3189
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:27,559
but after that uh just a puff of a bull

3190
02:05:24,679 --> 02:05:29,399
would get me high and uh like you had to

3191
02:05:27,559 --> 02:05:30,760
jump start your system yeah like I

3192
02:05:29,399 --> 02:05:34,679
needed just a

3193
02:05:30,760 --> 02:05:36,679
mass overdose of it to get them to start

3194
02:05:34,679 --> 02:05:38,279
working so yeah that was a crazy

3195
02:05:36,679 --> 02:05:41,118
experience and the stuff you were

3196
02:05:38,279 --> 02:05:42,800
smoking before that um I did a dab

3197
02:05:41,118 --> 02:05:44,880
before that I even did like uh we had

3198
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:46,559
shatter you dabbed before that too and

3199
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:48,480
it didn't do anything didn't I didn't

3200
02:05:46,559 --> 02:05:49,719
feel high from it at all but like you

3201
02:05:48,479 --> 02:05:51,839
would do it with friends and stuff and

3202
02:05:49,719 --> 02:05:53,679
they were all getting baked from it yeah

3203
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:56,000
yeah and my one of my patients is the

3204
02:05:53,679 --> 02:05:57,760
one that I would do that with and uh

3205
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:59,880
because he was determined to get me high

3206
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:02,000
and I was like he's like this is the

3207
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:03,800
stuff you grow how can you grow this and

3208
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:05,319
not even you know get an effect I'm like

3209
02:06:03,800 --> 02:06:07,639
dude I don't know maybe I'm broken he's

3210
02:06:05,319 --> 02:06:09,399
like that's it he's like I got some

3211
02:06:07,639 --> 02:06:11,400
shatter you could do that and I'm like

3212
02:06:09,399 --> 02:06:13,359
fine and so we we smoked that and I

3213
02:06:11,399 --> 02:06:15,879
didn't get an effect it was weird I

3214
02:06:13,359 --> 02:06:18,639
don't know you know I've always heard

3215
02:06:15,880 --> 02:06:20,480
like um like if people smoke when

3216
02:06:18,639 --> 02:06:23,199
they're younger they'll say I didn't get

3217
02:06:20,479 --> 02:06:26,039
high the first time and I do always

3218
02:06:23,198 --> 02:06:28,439
wonder if it's like an uh like your mind

3219
02:06:26,039 --> 02:06:31,399
is not recognizing the feelings because

3220
02:06:28,439 --> 02:06:34,519
it's a new feeling and so I wonder if

3221
02:06:31,399 --> 02:06:38,118
that if there's any validity to that I

3222
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:40,280
just think I it has to be that I didn't

3223
02:06:38,118 --> 02:06:41,558
have the receptors or they were way or

3224
02:06:40,279 --> 02:06:43,118
they were covered with something you

3225
02:06:41,559 --> 02:06:45,360
know another substance that was blocking

3226
02:06:43,118 --> 02:06:48,238
it from being able to make that I don't

3227
02:06:45,359 --> 02:06:51,679
know what but the wow but now I BL have

3228
02:06:48,238 --> 02:06:55,118
plenty of them for sure because uh

3229
02:06:51,679 --> 02:06:57,719
definitely feel it oh yeah well that's

3230
02:06:55,118 --> 02:07:00,279
that's super fascinating um like not

3231
02:06:57,719 --> 02:07:02,679
only that you grew before you smoked but

3232
02:07:00,279 --> 02:07:06,359
that you like smoked ample amounts of

3233
02:07:02,679 --> 02:07:08,800
times before you ever got high uh that's

3234
02:07:06,359 --> 02:07:13,238
I feel like that's very unique but it's

3235
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:15,320
uh that's a great story um what's uh so

3236
02:07:13,238 --> 02:07:17,198
uh back into these last few wrap-up

3237
02:07:15,319 --> 02:07:19,719
questions what's your favorite strain of

3238
02:07:17,198 --> 02:07:22,238
all time like your uh some people call

3239
02:07:19,719 --> 02:07:23,840
it the desert island strain or you know

3240
02:07:22,238 --> 02:07:25,799
the end of the world strain like what

3241
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:28,360
would you need to have there if you're

3242
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:30,840
the last guy on earth or whatever but uh

3243
02:07:28,359 --> 02:07:34,158
yeah what's your favorite of all

3244
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:36,559
time um that changes all the answer that

3245
02:07:34,158 --> 02:07:39,039
changes all the time that answer but um

3246
02:07:36,559 --> 02:07:42,320
IID say right now Vortex is is from TGA

3247
02:07:39,039 --> 02:07:45,519
genetics um rest in peace up cool he he

3248
02:07:42,319 --> 02:07:49,679
did so much for the uh the breeding for

3249
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:51,840
flavor and uh because he had uh a lung

3250
02:07:49,679 --> 02:07:54,319
disease and he had to smoke only concent

3251
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:57,039
so he was really really into like the

3252
02:07:54,319 --> 02:08:01,319
flavors and the vortex was such a good

3253
02:07:57,039 --> 02:08:04,840
high on it um it's one of the first and

3254
02:08:01,319 --> 02:08:07,000
only cannabis like buds like flow that I

3255
02:08:04,840 --> 02:08:09,000
smoked and grained out on like usually

3256
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:11,599
there's a sealing for me with flow I can

3257
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:13,439
smoke something and keep smoking it get

3258
02:08:11,599 --> 02:08:15,000
whatever high but once I keep smoking

3259
02:08:13,439 --> 02:08:16,678
I'll get to the point where I know okay

3260
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,960
if I keep smoking now I'm just wasting

3261
02:08:16,679 --> 02:08:20,078
weed because I'm not going to get any

3262
02:08:17,960 --> 02:08:22,760
High higher I hit the ceiling it's where

3263
02:08:20,078 --> 02:08:24,000
I'm going to be um and and Vortex was

3264
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:26,559
one of the first ones that didn't have

3265
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:29,078
that ceiling as I I just got higher the

3266
02:08:26,559 --> 02:08:30,800
more I smoked and uh until the point I

3267
02:08:29,078 --> 02:08:34,759
got sick I greened out I the room

3268
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:37,039
started spinning and I puked wow um so I

3269
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:40,440
was happy to find I ran across a pack of

3270
02:08:37,039 --> 02:08:42,319
them and have have uh made a couple

3271
02:08:40,439 --> 02:08:44,479
breeding projects of that because I like

3272
02:08:42,319 --> 02:08:45,960
that strain so much so I did I bred them

3273
02:08:44,479 --> 02:08:48,839
to themselves because I got some males

3274
02:08:45,960 --> 02:08:51,639
and females to expand how many seeds I

3275
02:08:48,840 --> 02:08:54,760
had and I call that project V and I pass

3276
02:08:51,639 --> 02:08:56,359
that out to tons of people and then um

3277
02:08:54,760 --> 02:08:58,239
I've made a couple crosses too one with

3278
02:08:56,359 --> 02:09:00,439
Donnie Burger I call that my Spartan

3279
02:08:58,238 --> 02:09:02,279
puke which is very popular right now a

3280
02:09:00,439 --> 02:09:03,678
lot of people have been liking that and

3281
02:09:02,279 --> 02:09:06,118
then I've crossed one with an orange

3282
02:09:03,679 --> 02:09:07,480
strain that I had gifted to me from um

3283
02:09:06,118 --> 02:09:10,319
somebody in Florida was called orange

3284
02:09:07,479 --> 02:09:12,000
Dream Haze and I crossed that and made

3285
02:09:10,319 --> 02:09:14,759
an orange Vortex and I'm currently

3286
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:17,198
hunting through that at home slowly nice

3287
02:09:14,760 --> 02:09:20,159
to find a really good one nice are you

3288
02:09:17,198 --> 02:09:22,319
hoping for like a uh like a a heavy

3289
02:09:20,158 --> 02:09:25,158
orange tpine profile out that with some

3290
02:09:22,319 --> 02:09:28,198
of the uh cuz I've never actually had

3291
02:09:25,158 --> 02:09:29,558
the ability to try Vortex uh as flower

3292
02:09:28,198 --> 02:09:31,158
concentrate so I'm not really sure what

3293
02:09:29,559 --> 02:09:34,079
the tarpine profile on that leans

3294
02:09:31,158 --> 02:09:36,000
towards so the vortex is going to be

3295
02:09:34,078 --> 02:09:38,238
like I I find two main fenals and

3296
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:40,078
there's going to be outliers as well but

3297
02:09:38,238 --> 02:09:42,839
the two main ones that I find in Vortex

3298
02:09:40,078 --> 02:09:47,118
are like a really sweet lemony kind of

3299
02:09:42,840 --> 02:09:48,679
uh citrusy taste and then um there's

3300
02:09:47,118 --> 02:09:52,759
another one that's more on the foul side

3301
02:09:48,679 --> 02:09:57,520
of things like a rotten mango kind of uh

3302
02:09:52,760 --> 02:10:01,079
uh uh almost baby diaper real foul yeah

3303
02:09:57,520 --> 02:10:04,119
but that could be yeah exactly and so

3304
02:10:01,078 --> 02:10:05,840
um so you get those two kind of tpine

3305
02:10:04,118 --> 02:10:08,479
you those two kind of profiles off that

3306
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:10,480
Vortex but uh yeah I'll uh you have to

3307
02:10:08,479 --> 02:10:12,198
just DM me a good address I'll send you

3308
02:10:10,479 --> 02:10:13,959
out some of my I call it project V and

3309
02:10:12,198 --> 02:10:15,359
basically it's just Vortex F2 and you

3310
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:17,880
can just hunt through and find out what

3311
02:10:15,359 --> 02:10:19,639
you want for sure good stuff it's old

3312
02:10:17,880 --> 02:10:22,000
school weed it's a little bit leafier

3313
02:10:19,639 --> 02:10:24,239
than some of the new stuff which is can

3314
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:26,078
be annoying but uh it's the effect that

3315
02:10:24,238 --> 02:10:27,399
I like of that string and that's why I'm

3316
02:10:26,078 --> 02:10:31,039
smoking a lot of people say they smoke

3317
02:10:27,399 --> 02:10:33,238
for flavor Which is popular but I'll be

3318
02:10:31,039 --> 02:10:36,399
the first one to tell you if I have to

3319
02:10:33,238 --> 02:10:38,439
pick one thing I want effect [ __ ] I can

3320
02:10:36,399 --> 02:10:40,920
eat food for flavor I need the effect

3321
02:10:38,439 --> 02:10:43,439
that I'm looking for absolutely I mean

3322
02:10:40,920 --> 02:10:46,000
that's uh as a medicine that's probably

3323
02:10:43,439 --> 02:10:47,439
the most important part um I feel like

3324
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:50,399
some people could even argue though that

3325
02:10:47,439 --> 02:10:51,638
the uh the Tarpin and stuff kind of cons

3326
02:10:50,399 --> 02:10:55,238
they all come together for that

3327
02:10:51,639 --> 02:10:58,480
Entourage effect of of the medicine

3328
02:10:55,238 --> 02:11:00,399
so but it sounds like those have plenty

3329
02:10:58,479 --> 02:11:02,078
of flavor to them so uh you're kind of

3330
02:11:00,399 --> 02:11:05,399
getting the Best of Both

3331
02:11:02,078 --> 02:11:06,679
Worlds yeah exactly and but yeah with

3332
02:11:05,399 --> 02:11:08,279
that orange I didn't answer your

3333
02:11:06,679 --> 02:11:10,399
question on that orange Vortex I did I

3334
02:11:08,279 --> 02:11:11,519
do get I've had people so I've had

3335
02:11:10,399 --> 02:11:13,118
people reach out to me that are

3336
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:14,599
interested and I've when I go to these

3337
02:11:13,118 --> 02:11:17,198
events I also usually have some

3338
02:11:14,599 --> 02:11:20,199
available for sale um and I usually ask

3339
02:11:17,198 --> 02:11:23,919
for like 20 bucks or something uh for

3340
02:11:20,198 --> 02:11:26,118
the seeds uh but people have already

3341
02:11:23,920 --> 02:11:30,000
reported back on that getting like like

3342
02:11:26,118 --> 02:11:32,319
orange uh push push-ups or or creamy and

3343
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:35,319
orange kind of out of that orange Vortex

3344
02:11:32,319 --> 02:11:37,399
so I'm that sounds really good for me so

3345
02:11:35,319 --> 02:11:39,198
I want to find one with those kind of

3346
02:11:37,399 --> 02:11:40,519
turs but with the effect I like and and

3347
02:11:39,198 --> 02:11:42,198
what I'm looking for in that is the

3348
02:11:40,520 --> 02:11:44,840
orange Dream Haze is what I called my

3349
02:11:42,198 --> 02:11:47,638
happy weed like bust depression that

3350
02:11:44,840 --> 02:11:49,920
that kind of stuff and so um I'm looking

3351
02:11:47,639 --> 02:11:52,480
for that effect with those flavors on

3352
02:11:49,920 --> 02:11:54,399
that if it's if it's super heavy and

3353
02:11:52,479 --> 02:11:56,598
like really intense rather than it being

3354
02:11:54,399 --> 02:11:58,279
like an orange dreamsicle it could be an

3355
02:11:56,599 --> 02:12:01,279
orange nightmare

3356
02:11:58,279 --> 02:12:01,279
sickle

3357
02:12:02,800 --> 02:12:07,440
like I mean because it yeah if it's

3358
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:10,760
going if potency is the end goal and

3359
02:12:07,439 --> 02:12:12,359
then flavors the secondary then it it

3360
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:13,960
sounds like you're doing this the stuff

3361
02:12:12,359 --> 02:12:17,399
to get you

3362
02:12:13,960 --> 02:12:19,679
there um so uh if that's your like a

3363
02:12:17,399 --> 02:12:21,598
Vortex you know I love that as an answer

3364
02:12:19,679 --> 02:12:23,599
it's it's classic a lot of people have

3365
02:12:21,599 --> 02:12:27,119
heard of it before um whether or not

3366
02:12:23,599 --> 02:12:30,239
they've tried it um uh now uh I'm not

3367
02:12:27,118 --> 02:12:31,759
going to assume that uh TGA is is your

3368
02:12:30,238 --> 02:12:33,399
favorite breeder but who is your

3369
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:37,840
favorite breeder of all

3370
02:12:33,399 --> 02:12:40,479
time my favorite breeder of all time if

3371
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:42,279
you had to like pick a couple packs from

3372
02:12:40,479 --> 02:12:44,759
one breeder as what you're going to be

3373
02:12:42,279 --> 02:12:47,800
running for the next 10 years that's

3374
02:12:44,760 --> 02:12:50,880
that's a hard question because wof so

3375
02:12:47,800 --> 02:12:53,960
many out there um but yeah I probably if

3376
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:56,359
I could just uh pick anyone yeah I would

3377
02:12:53,960 --> 02:12:58,439
love more subs work for sure it just

3378
02:12:56,359 --> 02:13:00,000
seems to be he had the same palette as

3379
02:12:58,439 --> 02:13:02,479
me at least the stuff that he liked I

3380
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:05,439
like so that's cool to have somebody

3381
02:13:02,479 --> 02:13:09,279
selecting for me that's I like that and

3382
02:13:05,439 --> 02:13:11,118
uh his breeding um strategy I loved as

3383
02:13:09,279 --> 02:13:12,559
well and that's that he said he was a

3384
02:13:11,118 --> 02:13:14,439
unicorn Hunter he's looking for that

3385
02:13:12,559 --> 02:13:16,520
unicorn he wants that something that

3386
02:13:14,439 --> 02:13:18,678
that outlier if you grow a 100 seeds and

3387
02:13:16,520 --> 02:13:20,639
there's two of them that are way

3388
02:13:18,679 --> 02:13:22,039
different than everything else those are

3389
02:13:20,639 --> 02:13:25,480
the ones that got has attention and I'm

3390
02:13:22,039 --> 02:13:26,800
kind of the same way so um so when I'm

3391
02:13:25,479 --> 02:13:28,678
feno hunting that's what I'm looking for

3392
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:31,360
I'm looking for that special something

3393
02:13:28,679 --> 02:13:36,039
that nobody else has got um but then I

3394
02:13:31,359 --> 02:13:38,000
want everybody to have it guess so so um

3395
02:13:36,039 --> 02:13:39,359
I feel like that's the Breeders plight

3396
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:41,479
you know you're you're looking for the

3397
02:13:39,359 --> 02:13:43,399
best stuff usually the best stuff is an

3398
02:13:41,479 --> 02:13:45,238
outlier then you try and breed with it

3399
02:13:43,399 --> 02:13:46,920
but then it's another hunt because

3400
02:13:45,238 --> 02:13:50,198
you're looking for the outliers in there

3401
02:13:46,920 --> 02:13:51,559
and it's just this never ending cycle of

3402
02:13:50,198 --> 02:13:54,158
looking for the better the better and

3403
02:13:51,559 --> 02:13:55,920
the better um I mean even with your grow

3404
02:13:54,158 --> 02:13:59,519
style right you're you're always trying

3405
02:13:55,920 --> 02:14:02,719
to knock off the top contenders um yeah

3406
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:04,079
so yeah that's that's dope I you know I

3407
02:14:02,719 --> 02:14:05,480
I thought you might have said cuz it

3408
02:14:04,078 --> 02:14:09,319
seems like you've hunted a lot of his

3409
02:14:05,479 --> 02:14:10,959
gear uh or skunk Master Flex um yeah

3410
02:14:09,319 --> 02:14:13,719
just with all of his different burgers

3411
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:16,319
and stuff uh that's more the influence

3412
02:14:13,719 --> 02:14:19,439
of baked phone he loves the I love the

3413
02:14:16,319 --> 02:14:21,519
effect of the burgers and the GMO well

3414
02:14:19,439 --> 02:14:24,638
say it's really GMO it is I love the

3415
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:26,320
effect of GMO but um the flavors could

3416
02:14:24,639 --> 02:14:31,078
be better if you ask me I mean I'm sorry

3417
02:14:26,319 --> 02:14:34,039
I'm not a big Savory guy okay and uh but

3418
02:14:31,078 --> 02:14:36,198
I call my buddy a gmho because he likes

3419
02:14:34,039 --> 02:14:38,118
anything across the GMO like he's got so

3420
02:14:36,198 --> 02:14:41,118
many genetics that across the GMO it's

3421
02:14:38,118 --> 02:14:43,558
just like come on man just be done with

3422
02:14:41,118 --> 02:14:46,238
it I could I could see if you're going

3423
02:14:43,559 --> 02:14:48,679
straight for hash uh if you find an out

3424
02:14:46,238 --> 02:14:51,078
lier of a GMO cross that does have those

3425
02:14:48,679 --> 02:14:53,679
special tpin that are not necessarily

3426
02:14:51,078 --> 02:14:56,000
the most funky but just really loud and

3427
02:14:53,679 --> 02:14:58,840
you know whether it be sweet or citrusy

3428
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:01,359
or uh fruity or even I I've had some

3429
02:14:58,840 --> 02:15:05,159
gimo crosses that kind of are like this

3430
02:15:01,359 --> 02:15:06,839
rotten candy uh that doesn't even make

3431
02:15:05,158 --> 02:15:09,039
sense I don't know if candy can rot but

3432
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:11,078
it it's what it makes me think of um

3433
02:15:09,039 --> 02:15:14,039
rotten fruit yeah rotten fruit there you

3434
02:15:11,078 --> 02:15:15,799
go uh but if it if it just dumps on the

3435
02:15:14,039 --> 02:15:17,760
on the extraction then I could see why

3436
02:15:15,800 --> 02:15:19,119
you'd want to hunt that stuff in a yeah

3437
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:22,639
in a Tricom

3438
02:15:19,118 --> 02:15:24,598
Forge exactly

3439
02:15:22,639 --> 02:15:28,000
but yeah so yeah I love skunk Master

3440
02:15:24,599 --> 02:15:29,599
Flex and I I love his work um but

3441
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,639
honestly we have a connection to him

3442
02:15:29,599 --> 02:15:33,119
already

3443
02:15:30,639 --> 02:15:35,719
so fair enough sub we don't I don't have

3444
02:15:33,118 --> 02:15:39,039
no connection man come on sub come back

3445
02:15:35,719 --> 02:15:40,679
yeah no I feel that it's always what uh

3446
02:15:39,039 --> 02:15:43,880
what you can't have that almost seems

3447
02:15:40,679 --> 02:15:47,679
like you want it more yeah for sure yeah

3448
02:15:43,880 --> 02:15:50,159
um so you did talk about your first uh

3449
02:15:47,679 --> 02:15:52,118
um time getting like super baked which

3450
02:15:50,158 --> 02:15:55,638
kind of kickstarted your endocannabinoid

3451
02:15:52,118 --> 02:15:57,639
system it sounds like um I do like to

3452
02:15:55,639 --> 02:15:59,920
ask like what was your most memorable

3453
02:15:57,639 --> 02:16:02,279
cannabis related experience and if

3454
02:15:59,920 --> 02:16:05,078
that's the answer for it then so be it

3455
02:16:02,279 --> 02:16:07,279
but if you have another uh just really

3456
02:16:05,078 --> 02:16:09,519
memorable cannabis related experience

3457
02:16:07,279 --> 02:16:12,118
that you haven't uh told in the story so

3458
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:15,280
far today I'll leave this uh this

3459
02:16:12,118 --> 02:16:17,279
opportunity now for that I say that my

3460
02:16:15,279 --> 02:16:20,599
most memorable cannabis

3461
02:16:17,279 --> 02:16:22,078
experience would be like protesting

3462
02:16:20,599 --> 02:16:24,159
smoke smoking cannabis where you

3463
02:16:22,078 --> 02:16:27,039
shouldn't be smoking cannabis and and

3464
02:16:24,158 --> 02:16:29,519
and I've done that multiple places um

3465
02:16:27,039 --> 02:16:33,120
the first time I got ballsy

3466
02:16:29,520 --> 02:16:35,760
was the uh when in 2008 was the first

3467
02:16:33,120 --> 02:16:37,920
time that medical went legal in Michigan

3468
02:16:35,760 --> 02:16:39,960
and so that's when the High Times cup

3469
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:44,280
started shortly after coming to Michigan

3470
02:16:39,959 --> 02:16:46,239
once a year and I think it was the third

3471
02:16:44,280 --> 02:16:48,880
High Times cup or fourth High Times cup

3472
02:16:46,239 --> 02:16:50,359
I don't remember it's like 11 12 or

3473
02:16:48,879 --> 02:16:51,679
something yeah something like I can't

3474
02:16:50,359 --> 02:16:55,439
remember which one was but it was right

3475
02:16:51,679 --> 02:16:57,398
when um when Recreation legal happened

3476
02:16:55,439 --> 02:16:59,079
in Michigan which was I think way later

3477
02:16:57,398 --> 02:17:02,718
like 2012 or

3478
02:16:59,079 --> 02:17:04,840
2015 um but when whatever it was the

3479
02:17:02,718 --> 02:17:06,318
High Times cup after rck came legal so

3480
02:17:04,840 --> 02:17:07,920
the first High Times cup where there was

3481
02:17:06,318 --> 02:17:11,599
Rec ration

3482
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:13,359
illegal the the line was ridiculous it

3483
02:17:11,599 --> 02:17:16,760
was at it's held at a racetrack which

3484
02:17:13,359 --> 02:17:18,519
has a a huge parking lot in front of it

3485
02:17:16,760 --> 02:17:21,000
and the in the line of that's where the

3486
02:17:18,519 --> 02:17:23,239
cars were parked but the people in line

3487
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:26,239
get in went through the whole parking

3488
02:17:23,239 --> 02:17:28,000
lot wrapped around on the side street

3489
02:17:26,239 --> 02:17:30,638
and it was about a block from the

3490
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:33,558
location ridiculous but I was standing

3491
02:17:30,638 --> 02:17:36,039
in that line I didn't care right and and

3492
02:17:33,558 --> 02:17:37,398
um well you stand in line for so long

3493
02:17:36,040 --> 02:17:39,439
you get a little bit bored you you end

3494
02:17:37,398 --> 02:17:42,199
up breaking out the [ __ ] weed and

3495
02:17:39,439 --> 02:17:44,120
start smoking and I can still remember

3496
02:17:42,200 --> 02:17:47,800
that there was two guys from Ohio behind

3497
02:17:44,120 --> 02:17:50,040
me that had driven up there and uh they

3498
02:17:47,799 --> 02:17:51,879
were just so nervous cuz I kept passing

3499
02:17:50,040 --> 02:17:53,880
them the joint just cuz I just passed

3500
02:17:51,879 --> 02:17:55,358
around people around me and they're like

3501
02:17:53,879 --> 02:17:56,839
dude we're in public what are you doing

3502
02:17:55,359 --> 02:17:58,880
I'm like what are you talking about it's

3503
02:17:56,840 --> 02:18:01,359
fine it's you know and I'm just smoking

3504
02:17:58,879 --> 02:18:03,638
it and then like literally I just put it

3505
02:18:01,359 --> 02:18:05,719
out and a cop had driven past and they

3506
02:18:03,638 --> 02:18:09,039
were just like sweating bullets and to

3507
02:18:05,718 --> 02:18:10,718
me I just felt like s such like a king

3508
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:13,399
at that point it's just like come on

3509
02:18:10,718 --> 02:18:14,598
guys it's not they not GNA stop us for

3510
02:18:13,398 --> 02:18:16,279
and uh it was funny because when the

3511
02:18:14,599 --> 02:18:17,760
cops drove by somebody was in the

3512
02:18:16,280 --> 02:18:18,679
passenger seat of the cop car with their

3513
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:20,559
camera phone and they're like

3514
02:18:18,679 --> 02:18:22,318
videotaping people and I never heard the

3515
02:18:20,558 --> 02:18:24,358
end it I never heard the end of it like

3516
02:18:22,318 --> 02:18:26,199
we're all going to get busted and we're

3517
02:18:24,359 --> 02:18:27,399
like that's so funny no one's coming

3518
02:18:26,200 --> 02:18:29,200
back they're just putting it on their

3519
02:18:27,398 --> 02:18:32,398
social medias got nothing to do I mean

3520
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:35,439
we're a quarter mile from the damn place

3521
02:18:32,398 --> 02:18:37,840
yeah and then the next best one was um

3522
02:18:35,439 --> 02:18:40,000
getting invited to uh the Michigan weers

3523
02:18:37,840 --> 02:18:42,318
put on a rally they started they've done

3524
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:46,000
three now and I've been to all of them

3525
02:18:42,318 --> 02:18:49,000
thank God and uh they asked me on at the

3526
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:52,239
first one if I wanted to to speak at at

3527
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:55,638
uh on the state capitals steps and and

3528
02:18:52,239 --> 02:18:58,318
Lancing and boy was I nervous holy cow

3529
02:18:55,638 --> 02:19:00,638
but uh to be able to for one smoke on

3530
02:18:58,318 --> 02:19:02,159
the state capital steps uh with the

3531
02:19:00,638 --> 02:19:03,279
every the Michigan wers and everybody

3532
02:19:02,159 --> 02:19:06,159
else we kind of did it as a

3533
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:08,639
demonstration but then to to then have a

3534
02:19:06,159 --> 02:19:11,439
Podium and literally stand there in

3535
02:19:08,638 --> 02:19:13,199
front of you know I I get online but I'm

3536
02:19:11,439 --> 02:19:14,800
I'm sitting in my room right it's

3537
02:19:13,200 --> 02:19:15,920
different I know there's people watching

3538
02:19:14,799 --> 02:19:17,398
but it's different than when you're

3539
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:20,280
standing there looking at those eyeballs

3540
02:19:17,398 --> 02:19:21,358
looking back at you and and to stand up

3541
02:19:20,280 --> 02:19:23,760
there and to be be able to get through a

3542
02:19:21,359 --> 02:19:25,129
speech and say what I wanted to say um

3543
02:19:23,760 --> 02:19:26,359
that was huge for me it was a big

3544
02:19:25,129 --> 02:19:29,800
[Music]

3545
02:19:26,359 --> 02:19:31,079
moment that I mean yeah that's that's

3546
02:19:29,799 --> 02:19:32,920
one of the ones that the stories that

3547
02:19:31,079 --> 02:19:35,760
I've heard you tell before that I'm

3548
02:19:32,920 --> 02:19:38,159
always just like so impressed by that uh

3549
02:19:35,760 --> 02:19:39,920
you know that it is a really ballsy move

3550
02:19:38,159 --> 02:19:41,920
like if you think about it uh in terms

3551
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:45,760
of the federal legalization of of

3552
02:19:41,920 --> 02:19:49,439
cannabis right now and doing it on a um

3553
02:19:45,760 --> 02:19:52,120
on a governmental site just as a form of

3554
02:19:49,439 --> 02:19:55,159
uh like civil dis obedience and protest

3555
02:19:52,120 --> 02:19:58,520
of of their laws that are oppressing us

3556
02:19:55,159 --> 02:20:01,280
as users and um as as cultivators and

3557
02:19:58,520 --> 02:20:05,319
just you know we're not Hur hurting

3558
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:07,840
anybody it's a a very um victimless uh

3559
02:20:05,318 --> 02:20:09,920
crime at this point in so many aspects

3560
02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:12,359
that yeah that's like props to you hats

3561
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:15,398

3562
02:20:12,359 --> 02:20:17,880
to be a part of I'm always very very

3563
02:20:15,398 --> 02:20:19,439
happy to hear that stuff like that thank

3564
02:20:17,879 --> 02:20:21,599
you man thank you it was it was

3565
02:20:19,439 --> 02:20:23,680
definitely a proud moment for me and and

3566
02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:26,040
now doing it three years in a row and

3567
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:28,680
now we've got speakers that are

3568
02:20:26,040 --> 02:20:30,880
literally lawmakers that are coming out

3569
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:32,200
from from you know their office right

3570
02:20:30,879 --> 02:20:33,679
there that big capital building and

3571
02:20:32,200 --> 02:20:35,240
they're coming out and standing taking

3572
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:37,079
their turn at the podium which is so

3573
02:20:35,239 --> 02:20:39,000
encouraging I don't care if it's only

3574
02:20:37,079 --> 02:20:41,799
one or two right now guess what it was

3575
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:44,840
zero on on the first one and we're

3576
02:20:41,799 --> 02:20:46,358
getting more and more so that's progress

3577
02:20:44,840 --> 02:20:47,520
have you gotten any of them to light up

3578
02:20:46,359 --> 02:20:52,559
with

3579
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:55,960
you uh if you if you can't say so say on

3580
02:20:52,559 --> 02:20:58,239
record so I'll just say

3581
02:20:55,959 --> 02:21:00,639
no well that's enough of a mystery there

3582
02:20:58,239 --> 02:21:02,639
for people to want to look more into

3583
02:21:00,639 --> 02:21:04,760
this and and maybe even participate a

3584
02:21:02,639 --> 02:21:06,639
little themselves because that's a

3585
02:21:04,760 --> 02:21:09,359
that's a very it's it's like the next

3586
02:21:06,639 --> 02:21:11,519
Frontier uh of like cannabis legislation

3587
02:21:09,359 --> 02:21:13,318
is just getting getting out there and

3588
02:21:11,520 --> 02:21:16,159
participating in these events and and

3589
02:21:13,318 --> 02:21:19,000
helping bring more awareness to the the

3590
02:21:16,159 --> 02:21:20,719
facts that it's not a huge uh problem

3591
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:23,840
that it was made out to be by things

3592
02:21:20,719 --> 02:21:25,599
like Reefer Madness and uh the the

3593
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:28,079
initial uh like what was it the hemp

3594
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:31,200
bill or whatever where um they had the

3595
02:21:28,079 --> 02:21:33,039
stamps that people needed to be able to

3596
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:35,040
marijuana tax act the marijuana tax

3597
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:36,840
stamp there you go yeah and but they

3598
02:21:35,040 --> 02:21:39,160
didn't give out these stamps you know so

3599
02:21:36,840 --> 02:21:40,880
it's like all this stigma that's built

3600
02:21:39,159 --> 02:21:43,000
up over the years to have people out

3601
02:21:40,879 --> 02:21:46,679
there like yourself that are going and

3602
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:49,799
actively trying to gain rights uh for

3603
02:21:46,680 --> 02:21:51,479
people is uh that's one of the biggest

3604
02:21:49,799 --> 02:21:52,599
Endeavors I feel like we could take on

3605
02:21:51,478 --> 02:21:56,039
right now as a

3606
02:21:52,600 --> 02:21:58,079
community yeah it just at the same time

3607
02:21:56,040 --> 02:21:59,920
it makes you feel good right it just

3608
02:21:58,079 --> 02:22:02,439
makes you feel good when you you go you

3609
02:21:59,920 --> 02:22:04,920
know a lot of times people will tell you

3610
02:22:02,439 --> 02:22:06,280
that uh you're it's not going to change

3611
02:22:04,920 --> 02:22:08,398
anything you're not changing anything

3612
02:22:06,280 --> 02:22:09,960
you're not doing anything but then like

3613
02:22:08,398 --> 02:22:12,799
I said you come in year after year and

3614
02:22:09,959 --> 02:22:14,079
you see change so don't listen to those

3615
02:22:12,799 --> 02:22:15,398
people I know it's the thing that you

3616
02:22:14,079 --> 02:22:17,760
hear all the time don't listen to their

3617
02:22:15,398 --> 02:22:21,279
daughters blah blah blah but I'm serious

3618
02:22:17,760 --> 02:22:22,880
it's just like if you keep showing up um

3619
02:22:21,280 --> 02:22:24,640
you're literally on the steps and these

3620
02:22:22,879 --> 02:22:26,759
Congress people have to walk past you as

3621
02:22:24,639 --> 02:22:28,039
you're talking and saying things um

3622
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:30,200
they're going to hear some of that

3623
02:22:28,040 --> 02:22:32,600
they're going to hear something

3624
02:22:30,200 --> 02:22:34,120
absolutely um was there anything else

3625
02:22:32,600 --> 02:22:36,079
that you wanted to touch on before we

3626
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:38,880
wrap this up anything that we didn't uh

3627
02:22:36,079 --> 02:22:42,600
bring up that you wanted to make sure we

3628
02:22:38,879 --> 02:22:44,079
uh talked about no I just wanted to you

3629
02:22:42,600 --> 02:22:46,520
know the biggest thing that I like the

3630
02:22:44,079 --> 02:22:48,398
message I like to get across is um I

3631
02:22:46,520 --> 02:22:50,079
usually end all my shows and sign off

3632
02:22:48,398 --> 02:22:52,119
I'll say keep growing and and the reason

3633
02:22:50,079 --> 02:22:54,039
I say that is is that it's it's more

3634
02:22:52,120 --> 02:22:56,520
than just keep growing canos keep

3635
02:22:54,040 --> 02:22:59,080
growing you know it can apply to so many

3636
02:22:56,520 --> 02:23:01,960
things in your life and don't get

3637
02:22:59,079 --> 02:23:03,959
stagnant right keep keep moving and um

3638
02:23:01,959 --> 02:23:06,119
so the most precious thing for me and

3639
02:23:03,959 --> 02:23:09,398
why I do everything is I think it's to

3640
02:23:06,120 --> 02:23:11,439
uh keep people you know give people the

3641
02:23:09,398 --> 02:23:14,199
right for hom grow so a lot of these

3642
02:23:11,439 --> 02:23:16,200
states you'll see you know and even

3643
02:23:14,200 --> 02:23:18,880
other you know municipalities it'll

3644
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:21,159
it'll come come in and it get gets

3645
02:23:18,879 --> 02:23:23,278
legalized a little bit as medical then

3646
02:23:21,159 --> 02:23:25,920
it goes to recreational then medical

3647
02:23:23,279 --> 02:23:27,840
goes away and then hom grow goes away

3648
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:29,520
and I think if we have to protect

3649
02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:31,398
anything if we have to stand up for

3650
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:32,720
anything um you don't have to stand up

3651
02:23:31,398 --> 02:23:34,519
for commercial cannabis you don't have

3652
02:23:32,719 --> 02:23:36,760
to stand up for anything like that but

3653
02:23:34,520 --> 02:23:39,079
uh when it comes to Homegrown cannabis

3654
02:23:36,760 --> 02:23:41,040
there's still States in this country

3655
02:23:39,079 --> 02:23:42,639
where it's completely legal to walk into

3656
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:44,800
a store and buy commercial cannabis but

3657
02:23:42,639 --> 02:23:47,920
you can't grow it yourself which is more

3658
02:23:44,799 --> 02:23:51,358
medicinal yeah and um it's a travesty in

3659
02:23:47,920 --> 02:23:52,879
my eyes so I just think that uh

3660
02:23:51,359 --> 02:23:55,600
if you know that cannabis is a medicine

3661
02:23:52,879 --> 02:23:57,398
and I think it's not even a shadow of a

3662
02:23:55,600 --> 02:24:01,079
doubt anymore you can do a quick Google

3663
02:23:57,398 --> 02:24:02,278
search um it's it's worth protecting and

3664
02:24:01,079 --> 02:24:04,398
keeping it so that we can do it

3665
02:24:02,279 --> 02:24:08,120
ourselves uh and not be beholden to

3666
02:24:04,398 --> 02:24:10,719
somebody else to have to supply it to us

3667
02:24:08,120 --> 02:24:12,800
nice yeah no I mean I love that it it

3668
