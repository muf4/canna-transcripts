there? Sure. Thank you. Um, so I guess,

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,879
uh, you know, in a former life, I was a

23
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,719
secondary social studies teacher. Um,

24
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,118
and you know, I bartended for years and

25
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,519
stuff like that before that. Um, but you

26
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:14,159
know, sort of graduated college and

27
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,079
then, uh, moved out to Denver, you know,

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,439
I guess it's almost 18ish or so years

29
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:22,000
ago. Um, so I moved out here and then I

30
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,279
got a job at this really cool bar. Um,

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,759
like in, you know, just neighborhood

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,439
spot that had live music three, five

33
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,478
nights a week. Um, and sort of didn't

34
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:31,839
really, you know, you know, like those

35
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:33,679
small sort of things that like really

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,400
change your life forever kind of thing,

37
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,479
you know? So that bar Highland Pacific,

38
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,320
um, we used to joke it was almost like

39
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,400
Highland Pacific Wellness Center at

40
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,239
night. Um, so there's a whole lot of

41
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,680
talented gardeners and just music people

42
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,798
and just, you know, sort of all walks of

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,640
life there. Um, so you know, I got that

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,280
job and I went back to school to finish

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,519
my, you had a social studies degree and

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,960
I went back to get my education sort of

47
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,200
degree as well to be a teacher. So I was

48
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,478
bartending and going to school and then

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,118
one of the owners was like, "Do you want

50
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,959
to come trim for us?" So he kind of

51
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,280
drugged me up the hill to Netherland

52
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,598
where they had some houses going and

53
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,878
started trimming for him and then real

54
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,318
quick after that I was like, "Well, I

55
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,799
want my own lights and I want to do this

56
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,318
on my own." Um, yeah. So started doing

57
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,879
that while I finished my teaching

58
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:21,479
degree. So I would like bartend at night

59
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:24,079
and go to school during the day and

60
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:26,560
somehow started growing a bunch of weed

61
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,319
in between, you know, all of that and

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,800
like I think I hid it from my friends

63
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,399
for about a year what I was doing. Um,

64
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,200
you know, before somebody kind of

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,439
finally figured it out. Um, sure. You

66
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,439
know, that kind of thing. So, um, when I

67
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,120
finished my teaching degree and I, you

68
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,680
know, started teaching and I realized

69
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,200
that I didn't really want to sort of

70
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,040
continue with that. Um, I, uh, called a

71
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,759
buddy at one of the local hydro shops,

72
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,199
uh, way to grow. And I was like, coach,

73
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,560
will you hire me? You know, I want a

74
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,719
job. I don't want to be a teacher. And

75
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,920
he was like, cool. You start Monday.

76
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:02,239
We're going on a fish tour. Um, so then

77
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,318
pretty much, yeah, it was one of the

78
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,158
like they had a happy hour for all the

79
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,560
all the teachers and they were like

80
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:11,840
trying to on like a Friday trying to get

81
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,680
me to like commit to taking this job and

82
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,200
I skipped that happy hour and I went and

83
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,760
I hung up eight lights in a friend's

84
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,439
garage. Um, nice, you know, kind of

85
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,479
thing. And then that Monday, I started

86
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,158
working at Way to Grow. Um so then uh

87
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,000
you know we talk about way to grow and

88
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:29,039
that sort of education as we continue

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,598
but like you know that was like a it was

90
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:34,079
like way to grow university. It really

91
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:36,560
kind of a whole lot of like like-minded

92
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,120
people doing a lot of work working at

93
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,920
the same stores doing everything. So I

94
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,239
worked there for a good four or five

95
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:46,639
years. Um you know and had lots of

96
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,200
projects going on here kind of um like

97
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:51,199
passion projects if you will. And then

98
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,280
uh um you know, you sort of hit that

99
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,639
point where you're like just getting

100
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,598
tired of sitting behind the counter at

101
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,958
Way to Grow and solving everybody else's

102
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:01,919
problems. Um you know, and you sort of

103
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,479
develop this like process of deduction

104
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,639
sort of procedure, instinct, you know,

105
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,238
kind of thing. People just come up and

106
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,079
sort of dump their problems on you. You

107
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,560
try to help them solve it. So I applied

108
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,439
for a job at a local uh local grow here

109
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,519
in town. Um and wait or next big crop

110
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:18,719
was actually managing it. So, they were

111
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,478
kind of like, you're a little

112
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,520
overqualified for the position we're

113
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,959
looking for. Um, and then maybe two,

114
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,439
three months later, I got a job

115
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,799
interview with Next Big Crop. Um, the

116
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,319
group, yeah, the consulting group that

117
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,720
was managing it. And then I got a job

118
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,478
with Next Crop. So, sort of managed that

119
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,600
spot and then we had a spot up in

120
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:40,079
Glenwood Springs, this like beautiful

121
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,120
greenhouse. And then um it turned into a

122
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,879
big like 50,000 square foot spot in

123
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,319
Maryland that was uh like a super

124
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,600
educational experience with a really

125
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,959
good crew. Um like next big crop wrote

126
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,280
all the applications for this group

127
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,879
green leaf uh green leaf which is in

128
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:58,079
like Maryland and then Pennsylvania,

129
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:01,040
Virginia, Ohio, maybe New Jersey. So

130
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,560
sort of designed all their spots um you

131
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,960
know filled it up, taught them how to

132
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,360
operate. Um they sold to Columbia Care

133
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,439
for like couple hundred million dollars

134
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,720
kind of thing after a few years. Yeah,

135
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,199
it was a big one. Like definitely

136
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,199
feather in the hat like you know I think

137
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,759
we designed and started operating with

138
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,160
them like I don't know just shy probably

139
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,639
200,000 square foot kind of thing. Um

140
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,000
you know they really turned it on. Um

141
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,960
and then since then you know did

142
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,959
Oklahoma and next big crop was part of a

143
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,680
publicly traded company uh called

144
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,519
General Cannabis. Um, so when some of

145
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,160
the laws changed about publicly traded

146
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,719
companies actually owning uh sort of

147
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,000
cannabis businesses, they were about to

148
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,520
sell us to one of the competitors

149
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,759
because they wanted to go into a

150
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:47,198
different direction. So myself and now

151
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,680
my two partners, Rich and Christian, um,

152
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,319
sort of decided to buy Next Big Crop

153
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,160
away and went private from general

154
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:55,599
cannabis. So that was I think August

155
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,960
will be four years or maybe five years

156
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,120
at this point that we've been private

157
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,959
and away from the publicly traded group.

158
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,918
So like in that time you know I've done

159
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,439
all kinds of all kinds of stuff you know

160
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:07,279
pretty much every you know just it

161
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:10,079
really depends like where we meet a

162
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,679
client in in their journey you know some

163
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,000
application writing some financial

164
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,840
models and all that kind of stuff um

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,600
then we would design facilities for them

166
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,758
you know we have engineers and like you

167
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,000
know depending on you know building from

168
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,680
the ground up or you know sort of a

169
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,918
retrofit to something else that was

170
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,439
already existing um you know and then

171
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,439
from all the way to grow years sort of

172
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:31,519
had all those contacts with every sort

173
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,680
of supplier and rep and nutrient company

174
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,399
and lighting manufacturer. So pretty

175
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,439
much have every wholesale account um you

176
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:41,198
can you know you can imagine. Um so then

177
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,800
we sort of will outfit those facilities

178
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,520
with all the equipment spec all the

179
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,120
stuff you know do like P and like you

180
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,120
know irrigation designs fertigation

181
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,840
stuff um like all the building

182
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,399
management systems um and then in lots

183
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:57,038
of these spots with like competitive new

184
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:59,598
markets uh it's not like Colorado or

185
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:01,918
California, Oregon, Washington um where

186
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,918
there's sort of that legacy work that

187
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,279
had been done. So then I started getting

188
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:06,318
on planes and flying out there and

189
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,799
teaching people how to run their

190
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,319
facilities kind of thing. Um, for sure.

191
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,840
You know, so did that for a handful of

192
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,199
people. Um, and I guess sort of still do

193
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,638
that till today. You know, now we're

194
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,800
just a little bit more selective of who

195
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,800
we work with and, uh, kind of like the

196
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,680
projects, you know, you have to make

197
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,840
sure everybody's like same values, equal

198
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,840
vision, like that kind of thing. So,

199
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:30,318
right. Um, really kind of whatever

200
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:33,598
somebody needs, we have done and we'll

201
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,759
continue to assist. For sure. Yeah. It's

202
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,159
really hard to take on a project when

203
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,520
the, you know, the vision doesn't align

204
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,800
with uh what you can provide because

205
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:46,399
sometimes people want to like do

206
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,879
something that's so esoteric or like

207
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:51,359
very unique and it's like they want that

208
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,279
uniqueness to be their their sort of

209
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,800
brand and their their stamp that they're

210
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,519
putting on the the product that's coming

211
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,000
out of it. But in a lot of aspects,

212
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,318
these legacy practices are not

213
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,240
sustainable in the current market. And

214
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,560
uh it's really hard to find people that

215
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,720
are willing to change and understanding

216
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,639
that there is ways to improve and that

217
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,599
maybe their secret sauce isn't that

218
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,918
secret. Yeah. Well, and also just like

219
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,360
you know

220
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:21,598
um we don't need to reinvent the wheel

221
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,598
here either kind of thing. Like there

222
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,598
really is sort of like that, you know,

223
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:27,279
every situation is different, like every

224
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,439
every single one is different, but there

225
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:34,319
really has to like sort of be this like

226
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:36,879
sort of uh optimal like execution of

227
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,959
this plan, you know, like so sometimes

228
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,479
people think that I'm going to come in

229
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,559
and do this. So, I'm going to, you know,

230
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,919
and like sure on paper maybe that not

231
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,559
even on paper, maybe just like in

232
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,639
fantasy that sounds great, but on paper

233
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:52,479
it makes whatever as much sense, you

234
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:53,679
know, in reality like um it doesn't when

235
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,639
it comes to some of these more like

236
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:59,039
commercial competitive situations. Um,

237
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,559
you know, like I don't know, like don't

238
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,480
get me wrong, it's fun to fantasize

239
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,599
about all this. I'm going to do this,

240
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,639
I'm going to do that, but like you're

241
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,480
like, yeah, it's expensive. It's costly

242
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,639
to make mistakes or to not have that

243
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,039
right vision. So, like really is a lot

244
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:16,480
of thinking and planning. Do do you have

245
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:18,159
the ability to talk about any um

246
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,240
uh people that were looking to become

247
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,360
your clients that you had to turn down?

248
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,360
I mean, you don't even need to

249
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,159
necessarily name them, but perhaps some

250
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,120
of the things that they were trying to

251
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:33,679
achieve that were untenable and just not

252
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,839
necessarily um feasible with either what

253
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:38,000
they had available to them for resources

254
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,440
or in general, you know, if it was

255
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,440
something where it was just like this is

256
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,680
poor agriculture and you shouldn't be

257
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,480
doing this and if that's your sticking

258
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,879
point, then we're out. Sure. you know, I

259
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,560
guess one some of the, you know, maybe

260
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:54,080
10 and 15 years ago, um, when it was

261
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,518
more of a competitive market, and when I

262
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,240
say competitive, I mean like limited

263
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,720
licenses going out, people would throw

264
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,200
money at you sort of without thinking,

265
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,040
um, you know, so people could raise one,

266
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,480
two, 10, whatever, however many millions

267
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:10,759
of dollars to sort of build these

268
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:13,839
spaceships, if you will, um, to operate.

269
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:16,159
Um, and I guess it's not quite the same

270
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,440
as, you know, today as it is then, you

271
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:19,039
know, so lots of people sort of have

272
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,720
these grand visions, but they really

273
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,078
don't have the capital to back it up or

274
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,320
they don't really have the experience to

275
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,919
back it up. Um, you know, so again, it's

276
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,680
like, sure, dude, you could throw up 10

277
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,399
lights in a garage with your buddies

278
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,078
over a weekend. Um, but you can't do

279
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,360
that with 500 lights when the city's

280
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,599
inspecting you, the fire marshal

281
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,519
inspecting you, and like there's all of

282
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,240
that sort of compliance that has to go

283
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,278
with it. So I'd say like the biggest

284
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,680
hang-up is people really you know sure

285
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,600
it you know the dream of what they want

286
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,958
it to be kind of thing and also like

287
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,120
people don't realize how much it really

288
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,278
costs to operate and you know lots of

289
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,120
people you know now you have lawyers you

290
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,679
have CPAs you have all of this stuff

291
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,440
that kind of goes along with it um in

292
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,879
like that professional world that you

293
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,519
don't have with like a passion project

294
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:05,120
at your house and so I feel like that's

295
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,278
probably the biggest you know are people

296
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,360
trying to show you know one of those

297
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:10,958
things like you can fit this much light

298
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,039
because you have this much power. So,

299
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:15,518
your HVAC, you know, everything's got to

300
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,360
fit numbers wise, right? Um, you know,

301
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,720
for these facilities to work or you

302
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,759
could be like the best grower in the

303
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,839
world, but you don't have enough, you

304
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:26,480
know, dehumidification to have control

305
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:30,320
or, you know, so trying to sort of

306
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,879
balance like the fantasy verse reality

307
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,800
verse like true expectations like you're

308
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,039
never going to

309
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:38,479
hit three and four pounds every time.

310
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,838
there's going to be hiccups, you know.

311
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,240
So, just people having the realistic uh

312
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,480
understanding of sort of how hard it is

313
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,399
to, you know, to sort of hit repeat

314
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,200
repeat repeat

315
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,320
um right um is probably the biggest, you

316
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,640
know, and I guess some of the new stuff

317
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,278
is, you know, I'm going to do autos from

318
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,399
C, you know, and which I love, whatever,

319
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,679
you know, but again, yeah, there's just

320
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,360
like I guess the new the new I'm going

321
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,199
to do this, it's going to re, you know,

322
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,320
I'm going to reinvent the game and all

323
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,079
this kind of stuff. If you're like, "No,

324
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,440
man. Like, don't get me wrong, some of

325
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:13,919
those ideas are totally real. They work.

326
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,920
People are executing them." Um, but

327
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,319
you've never done this before. So, just

328
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:21,519
to sort of gamble on something so big.

329
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,360
Uh, sure. You know, that kind of thing.

330
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,720
Yeah. It almost like helps to set up

331
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,039
people's expectations uh within reason

332
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,040
so that they know that, you know, and we

333
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,719
see this all the time, too. whenever um

334
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,159
we'll I'll go and look at another

335
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,639
facility or something and people are

336
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:39,199
asking for help that they'll you know

337
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,278
they'll be like this is my goal and

338
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,839
sometimes the goal does not match what

339
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,679
you have available to achieve that goal

340
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,279
and setting up more reasonable

341
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:50,359
expectations for what you already have

342
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:53,360
available is so crucial because you can

343
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,360
create you know I I haven't seen a

344
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,879
facility that doesn't have the ability

345
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:02,560
to create awesome product the thing is

346
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:05,838
is that They have to be okay with either

347
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:07,439
a quantity uh of awesome product that

348
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,880
you know may not be what they were

349
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,279
originally hoping for which kind of can

350
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,958
temper some expectations down a little

351
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,879
bit where they're going oh man I really

352
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:19,039
wanted to you know 10x my investment

353
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:22,399
within the first 2 years and you're

354
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:25,519
going that's going to be uh maybe 5 to

355
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,919
10 years from now uh if you're lucky and

356
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:31,440
you don't have crop loss after crop loss

357
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:35,199
due to you you know, your lack of HVAC

358
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,880
or your uh your use of your reuse of

359
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,680
soil if you're in some sort of like

360
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:41,679
living soil facility or, you know, your

361
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:43,599
input costs are, you know, you you

362
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:46,319
initially bought this giant pallet of

363
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,519
inputs, you know, 5 years ago and it's

364
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,040
been sitting there and working great,

365
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,759
but when you start to look into buying

366
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:54,159
it again, it's going to be, you know, 10

367
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,679
times the cost that it was 5 years ago.

368
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:57,679
Um,

369
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,039
and also one of the biggest ones is I

370
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:00,719
feel like right along the lines what

371
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:05,120
you're saying is like when when markets

372
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:09,120
open the price per pound is however high

373
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,639
you know as more facilities open um you

374
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,240
know I don't even know where we want to

375
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,079
start with that number you know kind of

376
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,600
thing but like right you know if you

377
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:18,319
can't basically sell your pounds at

378
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,600
$1,000 a pound and still be profitable

379
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,240
with that you know like you can still

380
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,720
run a profitable business at that um but

381
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,480
if it cost you 800 bucks to pro a pound

382
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,440
and the market's really only offering

383
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,440
$600 to $800 a pound for that, you know,

384
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,360
that that sort of model that you gave

385
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,040
all your investors a year or two years

386
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,240
prior um is just like irrelevant. So

387
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:39,719
that's probably one of the hardest

388
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,320
things

389
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,639
to get everybody on the same page with

390
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,720
is kind of like um sort of understanding

391
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,399
the cost of that operation verse what

392
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,879
when the pound, you know, when a market

393
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,360
gets flooded and it comes down like you

394
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:56,559
know where's that balance point?

395
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,480
I mean, Oklahoma is a great example uh

396
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,399
and case study for anybody that wants to

397
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,879
look into where it started and where it

398
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,198
is. Um, and it happened so quickly, you

399
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,919
know, like I feel like Oregon and

400
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:09,919
California, while they did have, you

401
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,639
know, massive booms in production when

402
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:16,159
everything went legal and recreational,

403
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,759
uh, the price never plummeted as fast in

404
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,759
such a short amount of time. you know,

405
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,519
we we we're all still now around the

406
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:24,639
same price across the country,

407
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,519
unfortunately, but um it took us a

408
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,879
decade to get there versus 18 months.

409
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,799
Yeah. You know, did a lot of work in

410
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:34,639
Oklahoma when that sort of went off. Um

411
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,838
and just like you sort of say like, you

412
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,198
know, everybody's got their own thoughts

413
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,600
about this that whatever, but like in

414
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:40,799
Oklahoma there was like two agents or so

415
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,519
something like that for the whole state

416
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,679
and they gave out 13,000 some licenses,

417
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,519
you know. So there was no inspections,

418
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,519
there was no whatever, you know, like

419
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,120
basically, you know, um, you know, we

420
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,278
built a really beautiful greenhouse for

421
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,879
a client that we operated and like the

422
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:56,639
only rules were basically like you could

423
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,600
do whatever you wanted outside as long

424
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,079
as it was behind a fence, you know. So I

425
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,159
filled up an acre and did what I could,

426
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:05,439
you know, and you know, next summer,

427
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:07,838
yeah, at the end of the summer, we had

428
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,000
4,000 some pounds on the one acre, you

429
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,240
know, and that was just one acre. And I

430
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,759
knew of farms that had 50 and you know

431
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,320
there was the stories of the guys with

432
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:19,680
500 and you know so at that point there

433
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,560
was more product there than you know in

434
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,799
a short time than anywhere else. Yeah.

435
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:27,679
And it it's still not even recreational

436
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:31,359
is it? No. They shot that down. Yeah.

437
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:33,278
That's a medical market. That's insane.

438
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,759
Yeah. without interstate commerce. It's

439
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:37,679
just like I mean of course there's

440
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,839
illicit interstate commerce going on and

441
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,559
and backing and all this other stuff

442
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,720
that that like how could it not there's

443
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:47,599
not you don't see giant you know

444
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,800
thousand pound bonfires of cannabis

445
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,560
going off all the time. Um, yeah,

446
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,399
Oklahoma is a huge state and like, you

447
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,239
know, I'm sure the Oklahoma people would

448
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,600
like say it themselves, like almost

449
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,480
everybody we worked with, they'd be

450
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,159
like, "I own my property. You know, tell

451
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,240
them come out here and tell me I can't

452
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,159
do it." You know, like in Oklahoma,

453
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,838
nobody wanted to pull permits. Nobody

454
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,959
wanted to do it. Yeah. Their buddies

455
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,678
down the street. We're going to help

456
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,279
them build whatever, you know. So, um,

457
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,679
for all the licensed stuff, who knows

458
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:18,480
how much unlicensed work was also done

459
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,480
that fed those markets. For sure. Yeah.

460
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,558
That's it's pretty crazy to think about.

461
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,838
And uh with more states coming online

462
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,000
all the time, you know, there there

463
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:27,759
could be other potentials for something

464
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,359
like that to happen where you have, you

465
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:33,119
know, a set cost of entry, right?

466
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,798
Regardless of the size of the facility

467
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,959
you want to build. So you can basically

468
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:39,599
go in there with you know like you're

469
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:43,360
saying like $10 million in capital spend

470
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:46,639
a tiny amount on the lensure and just

471
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:48,479
blow up a space you know and it would

472
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,320
and then you know sure you might have

473
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,240
this spaceship to operate

474
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:56,960
but man in a saturated market like that

475
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:00,880
it feels like you know your your talent

476
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,798
pool is going to be diluted your um your

477
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,039
overhead costs are going to going to

478
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:07,440
skyrocket after the, you know, the short

479
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:09,919
interval of time in which people realize

480
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,360
that there's this tremendous demand for

481
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,640
certain perishables and consumables that

482
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:17,599
all of a sudden is going to

483
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,880
be, you know, they're they're going to

484
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,240
deplete their stocks. They're going to

485
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,679
have to restock all those things and

486
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,240
they're going to go, "Well, I'm going to

487
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,679
up my price. Why not?" like that. Well,

488
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,839
even along those same lines, I feel like

489
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,240
um I had a handful of friends from

490
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,519
Colorado all run out to Oklahoma because

491
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,200
they couldn't legally work in the

492
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:38,079
industry here because they had felonies.

493
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,080
So, in Oklahoma, there was no regulatory

494
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:42,319
whatever to who could run and operate

495
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:44,319
these gardens. So, I feel like there's

496
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:46,000
probably cultivators from all over Cal,

497
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:47,759
you know, sort of like our legacy stuff

498
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,359
like we were saying out west that were

499
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,279
like, "Yo, here's my chance to get back

500
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,798
in legally and went there." there. So,

501
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:55,119
there were probably a bunch of talented

502
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,119
guys running these gardens, you know,

503
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:58,719
that had that experience and were like

504
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,199
able to pull off what they, you know,

505
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,400
they could walk the walk. Um, and then

506
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,640
sort of again quickly their dreams or

507
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,720
what they were promised didn't work out.

508
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,799
Um, so then things turned to that gray

509
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,798
area for a lot of those projects.

510
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:16,319
Yeah. when you it's and it's really

511
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:19,599
fascinating because the people that I do

512
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:21,759
see operating in Oklahoma still and uh

513
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:24,798
like maintaining a certain amount of

514
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:26,960
success are extremely small farms like

515
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:29,038
you know 20 lighters, right? Like

516
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,200
something where they're just pulling off

517
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:34,319
five really good harvests a year, you

518
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,240
know, maybe pulling 50 60 lbs out of it

519
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:39,200
and then offering other sort of classes

520
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,798
and educational material. And with the

521
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,720
cost of living in Oklahoma being what it

522
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:46,480
is, you know, you can survive pretty

523
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,880
comfortably off of, you know, sub 100k

524
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,038
uh income per year. And if you already

525
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,600
own the property or land, you're pretty

526
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:55,599
comfortable. Some of our um some really

527
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:57,918
good friends, I guess, sort of uh you

528
00:19:55,599 --> 00:20:00,079
know, guys from here from Denver that

529
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,840
went to Oklahoma. Um it's it's one of

530
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,279
the larger I guess maybe sort of groups

531
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:05,759
in Oklahoma. They're called Evo

532
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:07,599
Cannabis. Um they put out I know Evoke.

533
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,279
Yeah. Yeah. You know. Yeah. like the

534
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,759
Amid and Wes. I don't know. Omid's a

535
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:14,798
real good homie. Um, they put out really

536
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,798
a friend. Good. Cool. Um, you know, they

537
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,960
put out really good work. Um, and

538
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:21,440
they've sort of been able to expand and

539
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,519
you know, again, they started out more

540
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,279
of like trying to do like an extraction

541
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:26,879
sort of facil extraction lab for like

542
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:28,720
their facility and then partnership

543
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,360
didn't work out and then we designed

544
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,440
them their 20 their first 20,000 foot

545
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,839
spot. Um, then they just took it and

546
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,600
ran, you know, did what they do. Um,

547
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,000
yeah. You know, then they've expanded.

548
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,759
Um, and I feel like they're I don't

549
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,038
know. I guess you sort of proud of your

550
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:44,558
certain friends. You're like, "Y'all did

551
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:46,480
it." Like kind of thing putting out that

552
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,079
type of work at that scale and stuff.

553
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,759
So, like there are probably those other

554
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:51,119
big examples similar to them. But, you

555
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,519
know, I don't know. If I was in

556
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,359
Oklahoma, that's what I'm going for.

557
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,879
Well, they're they're they were such

558
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:59,759
nice people when I met them. I met them

559
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,000
over in uh in San Jose, California at a

560
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,960
craft farmer meetup for talking about

561
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,640
craft was there. Yeah. Yeah. And I think

562
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,120
it was Amid and his lead grower were

563
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,480
there and it was uh it was awesome to

564
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,879
talk to them and hear what they were

565
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,440
doing and and how they like developed in

566
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,679
Colorado and then took that to Oklahoma

567
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,919
and were one of the more popular brands

568
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,640
already on the shelves of the different

569
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,400
dispensaries and you know that sort of

570
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,080
level of understanding all the different

571
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,679
aspects of like compliance and um like

572
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,678
the buildout and everything. They were

573
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,200
just, it seemed like they were able to

574
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:37,840
go execute and get it into the market in

575
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,200
such a good way that they, it's cool to

576
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:41,519
see something like that that it's still

577
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,679
around cuz a lot of the brands kind of

578
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,038
came and went like flashes in the pan.

579
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,120
Yeah, totally. Yeah. So, like we

580
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:49,119
designed their spot with them um kind of

581
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,558
thing. They actually built it's pretty

582
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:53,199
cool like you know like when it comes to

583
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:54,720
all your dosatron and uh like all the

584
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,319
plumbing like we did all that plumbing

585
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,159
design work for them. they actually

586
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:59,279
built it themselves kind of thing like

587
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,880
you know getting pictures of them

588
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,200
covered in the purple glue and stuff

589
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,880
like that you know um whatever you know

590
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,960
but again like they built it themselves

591
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,760
so that's like a built not brought built

592
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,360
bought not bought brand um

593
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:13,359
you know so like just I don't know super

594
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:15,678
proud of them kind of thing you're like

595
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:17,599
sort of celebrate what they pulled off

596
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,320
um you know I guess we still share a

597
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:22,240
whole bunch of genetics with them um you

598
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:23,839
know kind of thing I saw that actually I

599
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,919
was just talking to Amid the other day

600
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:27,279
about the 8 in bagel and he was saying

601
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,919
that he got it from his buddy in

602
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:32,000
Colorado. And then I saw it on your uh

603
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,759
on your list of uh genetics that you

604
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,359
offer. And you know, this is actually a

605
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,119
great segue into the next thing that I

606
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,199
wanted to kind of touch base with you

607
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:41,678
about and learn more about is the I

608
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,480
Party with Jarrett collection, your uh

609
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,400
your genetics list that you curate. Um

610
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,759
so tell us more about that and sort of

611
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,880
what uh what got that going and uh where

612
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:54,440
your inspiration comes from. I sort of

613
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,080
always been

614
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,679
a call it a collector kind of thing. Um

615
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,480
yeah I think I started growing cannabis

616
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:05,038
in like 2007208

617
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,720
um when I first moved here. Um you

618
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,319
probably touch plants every day since

619
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,240
unless you like leave the country or

620
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:13,918
something. Um and I feel like sort of

621
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,679
yeah sort of when I first started there

622
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,280
was like sort of like two camps that I

623
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,320
was like working with kind of thing if

624
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:21,918
you will. Um, you know, one uh was a

625
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:24,798
bunch of southern dudes from Arkansas

626
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,799
like John and Chuck and GMAC and Jason,

627
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:29,359
you know, they gave me my first plants

628
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:31,279
and lights and stuff. And the other was,

629
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:34,479
uh, you know, one of the bar owners and

630
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:35,960
sort of his sensei, Master Q. Um, so I

631
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,558
basically I was going to

632
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,400
school and doing work for everybody sort

633
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:43,038
of like apprenticing under them, you

634
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,200
know, learning and um, the guys from the

635
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:47,038
south just always had better genetics

636
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,080
and grew better weed than anybody else

637
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:52,079
in town. Um, so like kind of like

638
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:53,359
started to really get into it there and

639
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:54,720
I got a picture somewhere. I could find

640
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:57,359
it and send it to you, you know, but

641
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,558
like out of all the, you know, packages

642
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:00,000
you would get from people, I would

643
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,240
always pull a gram out and put it in a

644
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,519
little nouging jar and label it, you

645
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,200
know. So at one point there was like a

646
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:07,679
hundred some different jars of different

647
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,880
genetics that I'd bought and you know

648
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,400
shared with friends and stuff like that

649
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,520
and have them like all stacked up like a

650
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,360
Jenga you know pile kind of thing. Uh so

651
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:18,639
I sort of always love genetics kind of

652
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:20,319
thing. Um and then as you know you sort

653
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,759
of do it a little bit longer and you

654
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:23,519
start like keeping your own mothers

655
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:26,079
instead of getting clones from friends

656
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,319
and um then you sort of start getting

657
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:30,000
into like popping seeds for yourself.

658
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,639
Um, so I feel like I was always a

659
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,759
collector. Um, just cuz like I don't

660
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,600
know, I thought it was the fun, you

661
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:36,720
know, it's part of the fun part. And as

662
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,399
you start doing it more, you realize

663
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,240
that that kind of is like one of the

664
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,720
things that separates you and makes your

665
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,159
product more memorable, you know, and I

666
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,319
guess sort of in some of the older days

667
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,400
when you would have a couple passion

668
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,839
projects yourself kind of thing, you

669
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,919
know, and everything's going and getting

670
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:56,558
labeled, you know, like um when your

671
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,919
work gets selected first, you know, part

672
00:24:56,558 --> 00:24:59,599
of it because the quality of the

673
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,038
product, part of it was because like

674
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:03,199
diversity of genetics and like, you

675
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:04,960
know, sort of always had stuff that none

676
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,440
of my friends had. um you know because I

677
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,880
would go hunt stuff out. Um you know and

678
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,798
that's going back 16 17 years ago. Um so

679
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,400
fast forward you know sort of became

680
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:17,038
friends with another dude you know chef

681
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,360
in town Johnny like the knife is what we

682
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:20,960
call him. Um and that's when really

683
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:22,558
started yeah that's when we really

684
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,360
started popping lots of seeds kind of

685
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,798
thing. Um I still have this one strain

686
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:28,240
called Cookie Wreck that I've had now

687
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,200
since I think I popped that seed in

688
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,400
2011. Maybe shared it three times. I

689
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,880
think it's like as special as something

690
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,559
as I've ever worked with. Um but yeah,

691
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,278
even back then kind of started popping

692
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:40,639
seeds and holding genetics and sort of I

693
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:43,519
would end up feeding all my friends

694
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,600
gardens clones kind of thing. Um yeah,

695
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,720
far back then. So like yeah, I guess you

696
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,240
know going back to a little bit what

697
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,558
Next Crop does, we outfit these

698
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,400
facilities and then I would show up on

699
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:56,000
site and sort of we'd have numbers that

700
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,559
we'd have to hit right out of the gate

701
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,720
to make everybody profitable. Um, so

702
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:02,240
started bringing my genetics with me so

703
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,159
that I knew what I was doing like right

704
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,640
out of the gate. Sure. Um, so sort of

705
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,960
like those genetics were sort of just

706
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,200
supplied to sort of clients or more of a

707
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,720
private situation. Um, and at this point

708
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,360
as things have loosened up a little bit,

709
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,839
like you know, and like sort of holding,

710
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:19,439
you know, 50, 60, 80, 100 moms kind of

711
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,759
thing to hold your whole library is a

712
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,600
ton of work, you know, kind of thing

713
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:26,879
when it just comes to all of it. People

714
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:29,839
don't realize how hard 120 right now the

715
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,919
facility I'm at. And it's, oh, it's a

716
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:33,599
process. Yes. You know, sort of

717
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,038
repopulation, making sure you have

718
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,759
enough stuff at the right time, all

719
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:39,599
that. Um, so the whole I party with

720
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:40,960
Jerry, you know, I guess when we got all

721
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:42,079
these trade shows, you know, for all the

722
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,120
cannabis trade shows, people are like,

723
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:44,240
"Oh, what do we do at night?" We're

724
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:45,439
like, I'm like, "Oh, we're going to go

725
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,960
party with these guys, you know, we're

726
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,720
going to go party with the Canada team.

727
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,960
We're going to go party with whoever."

728
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,798
Um, so then somebody inside the company,

729
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,200
uh, actually dude named John, he's one

730
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:57,200
of the Croan reps now. You should meet

731
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,600
John as well. He's like, "Well, we're a

732
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,278
party with Jared Joe." So then, uh,

733
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,839
that's where that sort of name starts

734
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:05,880
came from. and then uh sort of started

735
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,158
joking about how I sponsor artists and

736
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,360
athletes. Um just you know people that

737
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,240
are really cool, you're like they're

738
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:13,839
part of the team. Um but basically back

739
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,278
to it, you know, so N sort of trying to

740
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:19,038
do like here's my 18 strains kind of

741
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:21,599
thing for the fall season, winter

742
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:23,759
season, spring season. Um so you kind of

743
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:26,399
like here's this menu. This is what's

744
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,839
available now. Um you know we'll have a

745
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,278
spring, we'll have a summer. So like

746
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,000
every basically three four months that

747
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:34,079
list changes to like the next set of 20

748
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,759
kind of thing. Um we sort of tried to

749
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:36,960
set up a subscription program now kind

750
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,359
of thing just so we could be a little

751
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,600
more prepared as well as like our their

752
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:43,759
clients can be prepared you know. So if

753
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:45,519
somebody wants one strain every 90 days

754
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:47,519
they can sign up for that. Somebody

755
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,200
wants two strains every 60 days you know

756
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,759
we have one person that wants four

757
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,880
strains a month. Um, you know, sort of

758
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:54,798
just like you almost have like your

759
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,600
sushi menu and you sort of like, you

760
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:59,839
know, you're signed up for x amount on

761
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,439
whatever cadence and frequency. Um, so

762
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:02,959
you just sort of this is what you're

763
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,519
going to get every 60 days. You know,

764
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,720
you kind of get your cuts. Um, so that

765
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,038
like, you know, the garden staff,

766
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,240
cultivation team can plan that they

767
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:11,919
have, you know, two new things coming

768
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,839
in. The sales team can also then be

769
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,520
prepared, the marketing team. So, just

770
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:19,599
to kind of try to get everybody like

771
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:22,240
aligned in that uh here's the new this

772
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:24,158
is what we're going to focus on. Um not

773
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,720
have to go pop all the seeds and hunt

774
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,240
for themselves and all the work and

775
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,159
question marks that comes with that. So,

776
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,919
like these are proven genetics that run

777
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,840
in commercial facilities. You know,

778
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,840
here's your COA, here's your pictures,

779
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,278
here's your cheat sheet, like you know,

780
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,798
they sort of try to become friends with

781
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:41,839
all the guys at all the gardens, you

782
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:43,440
know, feel like you are or like I am,

783
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:46,000
you So, it's like, yo, here's my number.

784
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,919
Call me. I'll tell you however I can

785
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,798
sort of help with like a little bit of

786
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,919
growers notes um as well, right? So,

787
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,720
it's sort of something we just sort of

788
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:57,038
launched in January. Um sort of seems

789
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,000
like it's going pretty well so far. Um

790
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:00,960
but, you know, it's just a way for

791
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,880
sort, you know, sort of all these

792
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,120
cultivation teams to just be like, cool,

793
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,278
I got two two new strains coming in

794
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:10,479
every 60 days. And then they can sort of

795
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:12,398
make their garden fresh with that. So, I

796
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,880
really like that. I mean it's it's also

797
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:17,119
really beneficial to see from a a

798
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,360
commercial standpoint that it is

799
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,038
commercially viable because you know

800
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:24,000
there are a lot of popular strains that

801
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:26,798
you get in uh nowadays like that you may

802
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:32,359
be sourcing from someone who is some

803
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:35,839
sort of uh popular curator of flavors

804
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:37,439
and their style of growing might be you

805
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:41,199
know kind of what we touched on earlier.

806
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,440
or it might be this esoteric unique

807
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,480
um you know maybe maybe they don't use

808
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,919
like any sort of uh substrate monitoring

809
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,319
or anything and they're using these

810
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,399
massive pots and running their plants

811
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:54,480
vegetative the entire cycle and so

812
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:56,000
that's how you get the morphology of the

813
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,759
flower that they're sending you but then

814
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,720
you're putting it into a facility that's

815
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:03,359
running small like onegon cocoa pots

816
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,360
using substrate monitoring high EC feed

817
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:06,959
and you're trying to match all of these

818
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:07,959
other parameters that you're used to

819
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,120
following

820
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,960
and it turns out into this, you know,

821
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:14,479
big old boof stick or something along

822
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,000
those lines where it just doesn't work

823
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,759
out in your parameters. But by having

824
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,679
someone like yourself who's also then

825
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:23,679
connected to multiple facilities that

826
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,919
are running different styles of growing

827
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,720
that you've seen similar or the same

828
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,720
cultivar run in already, you can provide

829
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,960
super accurate data to people to say,

830
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,600
"Listen, if you are running it in a

831
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,000
small substrate, then you need to really

832
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:41,359
drive your P2s for bulking or you really

833
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,599
need to um you really need to make sure

834
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:45,519
that you're running a super generative

835
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:47,359
environment all the way from start to

836
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:50,158
finish because it does not do well in

837
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:52,158
high humidity midflower or you know just

838
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,919
different things like that where you can

839
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:57,278
you can really help people hone it in

840
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:59,600
and not misstep when they intake new

841
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:01,119
genetics because for me one of the

842
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:03,119
biggest things is when running new

843
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:05,359
genetics I'll just throw like nine

844
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:08,000
plants in right like one light worth of

845
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:10,639
of this genetics because I'm like I'll

846
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,319
test light it but at the same time

847
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,038
sometimes when I see you know you're

848
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:18,158
you're by day 40 and you're like this is

849
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:20,158
[ __ ] this is not working out. And

850
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,640
but you've already dedicated, you know,

851
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,240
two months to this plant and you got to

852
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,640
ride it all the way out because at this

853
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,120
point you're not going to lose all the

854
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,799
yield potential from all of that input

855
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:33,519
and overhead that you've put into even

856
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:36,240
that one light because that's still in

857
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,599
today's market a significant portion of

858
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,919
a yield in some cases. It's a real

859
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:41,839
estate on the table, you know, and so

860
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,679
it's, oh man, it's frustrating to take

861
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:45,678
in genetics that then don't work out the

862
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,840
way you want or that you run them, let's

863
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,519
say, outdoor, right? And then you're

864
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,439
like, man, this yielded great for me

865
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,519
outdoor. The returns on the hash were

866
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,159
great. The tarpine profile, the color,

867
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,079
the structure, all did really well in an

868
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,159
outdoor setting. you throw it indoors

869
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:03,278
and it, you know, throws

870
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:05,039
in, you know, people have something that

871
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:07,038
works great inside and then they go

872
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:09,359
outside with it and fill up hoop houses

873
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:11,038
or fill up fields and then all of a

874
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:13,199
sudden it doesn't do what they thought,

875
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:15,759
you know, like for sure. Um, I mean,

876
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,480
both both ways, right? It it cuts both

877
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:20,319
ways. You can't really necessarily

878
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,519
uh take an outdoor and run it indoor and

879
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:23,439
you can't take an indoor and run it

880
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,200
outdoor and expect the same things. Like

881
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,480
sometimes they do work out and there are

882
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,960
strains that definitely do great like u

883
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,880
super boof right indoor outdoor it does

884
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,640
the same thing pretty much and it's

885
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:39,440
going to yield significantly for you but

886
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:42,720
you know something like uh what's one

887
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,240
like uh like some of the different grape

888
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,839
strains

889
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,839
you'll run it outdoor and it'll yield

890
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:50,079
great won't throw interex traits have

891
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:52,959
you know phenomenal tarpen and and

892
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:55,439
overall structure throw it indoors

893
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,679
you're seeding out your whole room and

894
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,519
uh it's it's frustrating. Yeah, that's

895
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,519
sort of scary or whatever, you know, and

896
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,038
like I've dealt with it. Anybody's

897
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,880
anybody's like hasn't dealt with this

898
00:33:04,038 --> 00:33:08,720
yet. Question how much plants you plant

899
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,600
work you really do, but like all the

900
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,759
viruses at this point um that come with

901
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:16,319
genetics and all the skeletons that come

902
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:19,519
with them. Um we test regular with tumi

903
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:21,359
genomics out of Fort Collins, Dr. Tasa

904
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,519
like you know I they're just as kind of

905
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:25,278
kind and great people. Um they're sort

906
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,000
of on the cutting edge too of all like

907
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:30,319
SOPs for HLBD testing and all of your

908
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,440
other you know full panel whatever else

909
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:32,798
you want to do you know they'll take

910
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,038
care of you. So we test stuff regularly

911
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:36,879
with them. Um I guess sort of our mutual

912
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:38,879
friend uh Jesse Leech and Mothership

913
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,519
Labs like done full mar dissections

914
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,600
across the whole library. So it's like

915
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:47,359
these plants have this vigor to them

916
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:49,199
that's like sure really exciting. Um,

917
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,119
even cutting branches, cutting clones

918
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,960
off this these plants that have come out

919
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:54,079
of

920
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,360
dissection, like take your scissors and

921
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:57,519
you go right through it and you're like,

922
00:33:55,359 --> 00:34:00,319
"This feels different," you know, kind

923
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,079
of thing. So, um, I don't know. Try to

924
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:04,079
just have like, like I said,

925
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:07,678
everything's tested, everything's been

926
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:08,878
through marathon dissection.

927
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,720
I don't know. Just one of those things

928
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:12,239
you're kind of like done everything we

929
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:15,199
can to provide the people with something

930
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,878
good, right? No. And I feel like all

931
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:20,000
those different steps that you're taking

932
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:23,598
to provide um like clean genetics that

933
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,719
are well tested that have been proven in

934
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:29,679
multiple uh environments. Uh so you can

935
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:31,358
kind of see how the phenotype changes

936
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,000
over those different environments and

937
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:37,199
the different uh operators and how they

938
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,559
have their own unique uh kind of ways of

939
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,000
dealing with things in the grow that

940
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:42,559
produce different structures and

941
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,480
morphologies. It's it's really helpful.

942
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:45,759
Um and so that's back to what you said

943
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,918
earlier a little bit like sometimes

944
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,679
people like I run

945
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:52,000
insert whatever gen or whatever

946
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,079
nutrients this size container under

947
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
these kinds of lights and you're like

948
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,760
huh we have a client that does the exact

949
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,838
same thing like kind of here's pictures

950
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,880
from their facility you so you really

951
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:05,279
can kind of offer

952
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:08,079
uh that sort of specifics to go along

953
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,599
with them um yeah to people so it's I

954
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,960
don't know that's sort of the new fun

955
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,400
thing that we've been working on did

956
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,760
some breeding work really excited to

957
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,559
start popping a bunch of new seeds to

958
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,839
sort of refill that list, you know, with

959
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:20,320
stuff that's going to be like one of one

960
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:22,719
we've made in house. Um, you know, just

961
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,559
like you, I'm guessing got a full fridge

962
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:25,919
of

963
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:27,519
seeds, more seeds than you should have

964
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,680
kind of thing. You know, you're really

965
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:32,079
excited to get to kind of thing as well.

966
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:34,159
Um, so I don't know, like you know, like

967
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,240
I said, the list cycles about every four

968
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:37,920
months. Um, so that way that like, you

969
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:38,959
know, the people that have subscribed

970
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,240
kind of thing. you know, again,

971
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,960
depending on the cadence that they want

972
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:44,799
stuff. Um, you know, realistically that

973
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,280
next list is going to have turned over

974
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,440
and they get to pick off that menu again

975
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,359
and sort of just try to keep everybody

976
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,920
like fresh and excited about what's

977
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:54,960
coming and uh, but at the same time

978
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,440
bring back like some of the older

979
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,760
nostalgic stuff like, you know, got a

980
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,358
like a pre98 bubba that's, you know, in

981
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,520
dissection and a Durban poison and

982
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:05,159
dissection, some of the old chem stuff,

983
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:07,440
you know. sort

984
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:09,118
of yes, there's the new hype and

985
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,838
whatever, but also like the building

986
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,000
blocks of that nostalgic work, you know,

987
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:15,279
that sort of love and you know, like I

988
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,159
I'm sure you're thinking the same thing

989
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,760
too, like if I could have this back, you

990
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:21,838
know, especially going back, you know,

991
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,359
near a couple decades of work, you know,

992
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:25,679
there's certain things that have been

993
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:27,279
lost for a while that, you know, you

994
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:29,039
would do just about anything to have

995
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,519
back at this point. So hopefully at this

996
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:32,480
point never losing anything again. um

997
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:34,960
you know because we'll be able to store

998
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,440
it on the shelf in a vessel, right?

999
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,480
Yeah. It's uh the huge benefit of tissue

1000
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,079
culture. I I um I'm a huge advocate of

1001
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,079
it. It's come up so many times now on

1002
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,480
the show that you know we have we've had

1003
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:49,039
Jesse on and we've had uh one of our

1004
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,719
he's a wizard by you know you know he's

1005
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:53,358
great and he's super helpful. And then

1006
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:56,319
one of our co-hosts Cosmic, he also does

1007
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:58,559
tissue culture at home so that he can uh

1008
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,359
maintain a a large library for his

1009
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:03,838
breeding purposes. and um I do tissue

1010
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:05,358
culture at work and uh it's you know

1011
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:06,799
it's just one of those things that it is

1012
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:08,559
going to be a part a huge part of the

1013
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,079
industry and for anybody that's still

1014
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,719
trying to push back against it I'm going

1015
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,480
to say well that your time's coming and

1016
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:16,319
it's going to you're going to you're

1017
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,760
going to learn one of the things I feel

1018
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,359
like at this point too like I don't know

1019
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,440
I don't say it's like more inspiring

1020
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:23,519
than running the big gardens or whatever

1021
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,320
but like there is something really cool

1022
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:29,599
about how specific and concentrated your

1023
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,680
work is like every knife stroke and M

1024
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,359
it's just so concentrated that like it

1025
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:36,239
really shows the quality of your work

1026
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:38,319
and how much attention to detail you pay

1027
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:40,000
to it because it's not like you're like

1028
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,480
oh that that plant's going to veg for

1029
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,239
three weeks or whatever you know you get

1030
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,119
to be a little bit sloppy and sort of

1031
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:50,078
make up for it. Um you know you're under

1032
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:52,079
a microscope doing like surgical work

1033
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,920
almost. So, I just think it's really

1034
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,760
cool that it's like so specific and

1035
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,039
clean and like, you know, you put on

1036
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,680
your headphones and get under the hood

1037
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,119
and just like go to work and I don't

1038
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:03,919
know, you get in that tunnel and trance

1039
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:07,440
of it and sort of just love it. So, it's

1040
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:09,519
it's a I mean, it is all propagation,

1041
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,000
right? But cloning for me is the same

1042
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:13,920
thing. I love doing clones and and you

1043
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
know, making those that perfect tray of

1044
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,920
clones is really satisfying. similar to

1045
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,838
like filling up a bunch of way I judge

1046
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,720
people like if I was going you know if

1047
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:24,480
I'm going to hire somebody um one of the

1048
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:25,759
I feel like easiest ways to sort of see

1049
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,000
how good they are and like how

1050
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,160
consistent their work is and like you're

1051
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,920
like you know cut a tray of 50 for me

1052
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:34,960
you know kind of thing and like sort of

1053
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,800
their their clone work will really show

1054
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,400
how detailed or how sort of consistent

1055
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,400
or how much control they'll have of the

1056
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,639
entire garden you know so if you like

1057
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,559
call me you know fill a tray and that'll

1058
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:46,159
that'll tell you just about everything

1059
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:48,960
you need to know about how talented

1060
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:50,239
somebody is in your garden. For sure. I

1061
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,240
always look at the cutting board that

1062
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:53,759
they bust out and if they have two lines

1063
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:56,399
on the cutting board that I'm super

1064
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,599
happy. Yeah. Just even like just

1065
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,800
consistent. Well, even just going back

1066
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,119
to like, you know, getting into like the

1067
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,760
garden a little bit. You're like, yeah,

1068
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,440
like your mothers and the clones set the

1069
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,599
pace for the rest, you know, you have

1070
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,760
such like sort of specific timelines and

1071
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,680
deadline, you know, kind of thing to

1072
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,520
everything in your garden that if your

1073
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:15,919
clones are slow out of the gate, it's an

1074
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:18,000
uphill battle. Like you always sort of

1075
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,760
joke like, you know, you start at 100%.

1076
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,280
You know, kind of thing. And every

1077
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,079
little mistake, you know, you go down to

1078
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:26,240
from 100 to 98 to 94 to whatever and you

1079
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,640
never get to go back up. So it's like

1080
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,319
how few mistakes can you make and how

1081
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:32,400
can you hit like all those apex turns

1082
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,000
that you're chasing you throughout this

1083
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,240
round. So it's just you know how far

1084
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,679
forward are you always plan and look and

1085
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:39,679
thinking and it really starts with how

1086
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:43,519
good are your clones. That's like

1087
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:46,078
absolutely. Yeah. Yep. And uh yeah, I

1088
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:47,838
feel like that's a great way to break it

1089
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,640
down for people, even for home growers,

1090
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:53,679
too, where if you're looking at, you

1091
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:56,960
know, the potential for your garden. You

1092
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:58,319
need to definitely start with 100%. And

1093
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,519
you know, if your clones aren't that

1094
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,000
great, then you already need to say,

1095
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:04,400
"Well, I'm not going to have the best

1096
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
harvest I possibly can." And if you

1097
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,760
accept that, then you can still work

1098
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,358
within the parameters that you're using,

1099
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,720
right? you know, let's say your genetics

1100
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:13,440
just aren't that great or you don't have

1101
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:16,239
a veg space that's able to be dialed in

1102
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,000
well, so you're always, you know,

1103
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:20,078
through some environmental parameter

1104
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,079
having some sort of nutrient deficiency

1105
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,760
or other health issue with the plants.

1106
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,280
Well, that's what you get to work with,

1107
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,920
so let's just go from there. Um, and I

1108
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,599
feel like a lot of times when people are

1109
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,519
trying to optimize their

1110
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:37,838
space, they they they miss that point

1111
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:40,639
where it's you have to work with what

1112
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:42,639
you have, but sometimes what you have

1113
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:45,358
isn't ideal and you can still do really

1114
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:48,480
well with it, but knowing how to then

1115
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:50,159
kind of pivot around those issues is

1116
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,320
something that does take a lot of time

1117
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:53,838
and practice and patience. Yeah. you

1118
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,280
like to your point here like you know

1119
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:58,000
sort of I guess this is like a two-part

1120
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,119
answer to this in my like teacher days

1121
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
you know like you know there was

1122
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,039
something at the one school I was

1123
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,719
teaching at you know they would call it

1124
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:04,079
like two kisses in a wish and I feel

1125
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:05,679
like this is like my biggest takeaway

1126
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,359
from being a teacher you know after

1127
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:09,279
you'd sort of finish these projects or

1128
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:11,759
assignments you know the whole class

1129
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,519
would go around and like you know every

1130
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,880
student would like you know one student

1131
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:16,960
would sort of essentially not be in the

1132
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,160
center of the circle but like their work

1133
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,679
would be on on on center stage and the

1134
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:23,440
whole class would go around and sort of

1135
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:25,519
you give them two kisses and a wish like

1136
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,440
two things that they did well and one

1137
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:28,480
thing that they could improve on. So I

1138
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,838
feel like that was like one of the

1139
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,838
biggest takeaways for me because it's

1140
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:34,480
like hard to sort of accept criticism in

1141
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:35,838
that way from peers at times or but you

1142
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,079
know like in the garden you really need

1143
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:40,000
to like as far forward planning as you

1144
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,480
can be you know to put out fires three

1145
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,079
months down the road. Um, and you don't

1146
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,838
want to dwell on mistakes and stuff from

1147
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,000
the past. But you need to connect those

1148
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:49,679
dots and reflect back to really

1149
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,480
understand where that hiccup came from

1150
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:54,078
and how I can, you know, like, okay,

1151
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,079
that happened this time because of,

1152
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:58,240
let's say, your environmental conditions

1153
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,160
or, you know, you don't have the proper

1154
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:02,759
irrigation setup, you know, so how do I

1155
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:05,679
now connect that dot backwards to plan

1156
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:08,160
forwards? Um, that it's all going to

1157
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:11,118
kind of come together. Um so I don't

1158
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:13,039
know like reflection is really you can't

1159
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,400
dwell on stuff and let it bring you too

1160
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:16,480
far down when you like have these

1161
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:20,800
hiccups or mistakes but you do need to

1162
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:22,480
reflect um and sort of how do I improve

1163
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,720
and connect those dots so then that your

1164
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:28,079
plan going forward um you know is

1165
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:29,598
improved and more optimal than it was

1166
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,160
before.

1167
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:35,519
Absolutely. And you know, looking back

1168
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:38,559
at where those hiccups may have started

1169
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:40,880
is kind of a puzzler's dream. If you

1170
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:44,239
like to puzzle and if you like to do

1171
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,318
anything sort of uh like mentally uh

1172
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:48,799
like a mental gymnastic sort of practice

1173
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:50,719
or a mental exercise, then by looking

1174
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,400
back and trying to puzzle this together

1175
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:56,879
and figure out where you had an issue,

1176
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,960
you're going to be able to learn so much

1177
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:03,000
more than just by trying to prevent

1178
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:05,039
everything from ever happening. And by

1179
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,318
having, you know, it's a it's a great

1180
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:10,639
trait in the garden to be able

1181
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:12,400
to problem solve, right? Because

1182
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:14,799
problems arise all the time. We're

1183
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,720
dealing with living plants. It it's

1184
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,720
inevitable. There's bugs, there's

1185
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:21,039
pathogens, there's environmental

1186
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:23,039
conditions, there's electrical failures,

1187
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:24,639
there's other equipment failures. All of

1188
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:26,318
this can go wrong. And rather than

1189
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:27,679
freaking out and saying that piece, you

1190
00:43:26,318 --> 00:43:30,239
know, that one little piece of the

1191
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:31,519
puzzle fell away. How do I I can't do

1192
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:32,879
anything about it? because I needed that

1193
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:34,719
piece to finish the puzzle. You have to

1194
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,480
say, well, this is kind of going back to

1195
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:38,959
what we've talked about before. You're

1196
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,880
now operating at 95%. So, you need to

1197
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,639
bring everything down to match that.

1198
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,079
Otherwise, you're going to hurt the

1199
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:49,598
plants by, you know, oh, oh, so you're

1200
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,800
you can't have the room cooled down far

1201
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,240
enough when you're putting that much

1202
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,000
wattage in the room. Well, guess what?

1203
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:56,318
You can't run your lights at 100%

1204
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,318
anymore. you you got to make sure that

1205
00:43:56,318 --> 00:44:00,400
you're cycling your dehu properly so

1206
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:02,880
you're not dumping all that extra BTU

1207
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,079
into the room as well. U you know all

1208
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,880
these different things that you can then

1209
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:10,079
sort of dial those down to match your

1210
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,000
new baseline because of something that

1211
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,440
isn't working properly or because you

1212
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,679
just don't have the ability to have it

1213
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:21,599
work properly. And so yeah,

1214
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:23,919
it's with so much of like gardening in

1215
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,480
general, you have to be able to pivot on

1216
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,680
the spot and be able to adapt to what

1217
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:31,280
changes in the garden. And so yeah, you

1218
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:33,440
know, now too these days with all the

1219
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,000
data like every sensor in the world that

1220
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,599
we run and all this data, you know, it's

1221
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,400
kind of like, you know, I guess in the

1222
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:43,079
old days like, you know, used to have

1223
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,519
like the big desktop calendars

1224
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:47,760
everywhere, you know, and you would, you

1225
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:49,119
know, you know, back, you know, like you

1226
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,599
click your little thermometer for high

1227
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,519
and low and for temperature, humidity,

1228
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,680
you know, this was my pH, this was the

1229
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:57,759
EC, like you know, you would write all

1230
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:00,480
of those inputs in daily for everything

1231
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,240
you did. Um, you know, and then like I

1232
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,480
don't know, mine too would have like

1233
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:06,239
what concerts I was going to or what,

1234
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,199
you know, so like it really told the

1235
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:10,318
story of uh, you know, that round kind

1236
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:12,159
of thing. So you could look back and

1237
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:13,838
you're like, "Oh, well, you went on tour

1238
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:15,920
for a week or two." You like, you know,

1239
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:18,239
so you could see like the fluctuations

1240
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,680
of certain things to connect those dots.

1241
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:21,279
But now we have sensors and stuff like

1242
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:24,719
that and alerts on your phone or your

1243
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:26,400
computer, you know? So like kind of like

1244
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:27,919
turn it into I don't want to say muscle

1245
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,559
memory but like you know like we're

1246
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,159
saying like this

1247
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:35,199
reactionary my dehuses can't handle this

1248
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:37,519
like well what are you going to do to

1249
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:39,039
now sort of make it so your dew can like

1250
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:41,280
whether it's adjusting temperature and

1251
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:43,279
raising your temps or trying to spread

1252
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,079
the irrigation out in a certain way or

1253
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,000
less plant you know again what good

1254
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,839
decision you know what good decisions

1255
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,239
can I make for what's in front of me and

1256
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:55,159
this kind of thing like y you know sort

1257
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:58,239
of have to like just be comfortable

1258
00:45:55,159 --> 00:46:00,598
to like call that audible, but you still

1259
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:02,799
have to follow the plan, you know,

1260
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:04,480
cuz you know the whole point is have a

1261
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,480
plan that works kind of thing. So, you

1262
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,920
know, but again, one of my buddies is

1263
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,920
another consultant. He's like, "Dude,

1264
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,280
anybody could buy SOPs and they work."

1265
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,880
You know, sometimes like people like us

1266
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,280
are real important when it becomes like

1267
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:18,318
those emergency procedures. You're like,

1268
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:21,359
"That's what you sort of are buying um

1269
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:22,400
is us to help you solve on the fly."

1270
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:24,400
Like I don't know. It's one of my

1271
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,559
favorite parts. You're like how creative

1272
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,240
as creative as you can be to solve is

1273
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:31,679
sort of how much you get out of it. So I

1274
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:34,239
like love that creative problem solving.

1275
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,159
For sure. Yeah. I was a chef for like 10

1276
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:38,318
years and part of you know being a chef

1277
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:40,799
is problem solving because you have to

1278
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:42,639
make sure that your budget works or your

1279
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,720
menu server didn't bring this in and you

1280
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:45,799
need it on the flya like you know like

1281
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:49,118
that's the fun

1282
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:51,359
part. Yeah. Yep. Constantly. And so that

1283
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:53,280
shows a lot in the garden. Yeah, you

1284
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:54,799
know, add another pan or cook this what,

1285
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,240
you know, like I don't know that shows

1286
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,000
how good you are is like cool, I have

1287
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:59,919
all this normal stuff in front of me,

1288
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,159
but now I have to add this and this and

1289
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,480
this and do it as fast as I can. I don't

1290
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:06,399
know. I think that's cool to show how

1291
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,719
much in control are you that you can do

1292
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:13,119
it, right? And one of the biggest

1293
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:16,078
lessons that you learn um is redundancy

1294
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:17,760
because you need to be able to um you

1295
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,880
know, if if something fails, you need to

1296
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,880
be able to continue to execute.

1297
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,480
Sorry, I have a little foster puppy over

1298
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,000
here. Not little. All good. Yeah, no

1299
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,480
worries. No, but yeah, like you said,

1300
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,318
the redundancy, man. Like it's one of

1301
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,240
those things with like you all your me

1302
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:36,400
and paws in a like, you know, like be

1303
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:37,838
prepared like kind of thing like and

1304
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,240
then when stuff does go a little

1305
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:42,719
sideways, like hang, you know, hang in

1306
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:45,199
there with it and solve,

1307
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:48,879
right? Exactly.

1308
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:52,719
Hey, Phil. Sorry UPS guys out front. No

1309
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:54,559
worries. There you go. Tell

1310
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:57,679
um well, you know, I think we've had a a

1311
00:47:54,559 --> 00:48:01,358
great little intro into uh what you do

1312
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:03,919
with uh Next Big Crop and um sort of

1313
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:05,838
your the I Party with Jared collection

1314
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:09,519
and everything that you're doing there

1315
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:12,000
in your sort of uh professional life.

1316
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:14,480
And you know, correct me if I'm wrong,

1317
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,280
but it sounds like your partnership with

1318
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:21,119
Next Big Crop is kind of leading up a

1319
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:23,040
lot of the cultivation aspects of the of

1320
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,599
the the group that you're with because

1321
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:28,639
of your experience with growing and and

1322
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:30,318
cultivating and um you know, helping

1323
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:33,598
other growers out when you were working

1324
00:48:30,318 --> 00:48:36,239
at the gardening store. Um is that

1325
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:38,160
pretty accurate? Yeah, you know, myself,

1326
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:39,838
like, yeah, like you sort of joked about

1327
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:42,639
earlier, like nobody's ever gonna buy a

1328
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:44,159
computer from me. Um, you know,

1329
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:45,838
Christian, my one partner comes from

1330
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:48,558
like the finance world kind of thing.

1331
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:50,239
So, if uh like Excel spreadsheets where,

1332
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,880
you know, you could compete in them, you

1333
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:55,118
know, he would do really well. Um, kind

1334
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,358
of thing. like he's a numbers and

1335
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,960
organized as can be and just like

1336
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:01,279
extremely good at like the project

1337
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,838
management aspect and keeping everybody

1338
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,680
accountable and in row and you know if

1339
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:08,639
this gets backed up you know we didn't

1340
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:10,159
order these you know whatever you know

1341
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:12,400
air conditioning unit or we didn't order

1342
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:13,838
this at time so that moves everything

1343
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,200
back on like the you know the project

1344
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:16,639
management and the buildout charts you

1345
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:18,480
know everything's moved back three weeks

1346
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:20,318
now because of this and yeah so

1347
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,599
Christian doesn't like you know I

1348
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:23,199
couldn't do what he does when it comes

1349
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,519
to sort of that project management and

1350
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:27,358
like financial stuff. Um then my other

1351
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:31,440
partner Rich um he actually founded Next

1352
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:34,318
Big Crop in like 2012 or 14 or you know

1353
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,920
what feels like forever ago. Um he sort

1354
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:37,759
of has a construction and landscaping

1355
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,318
background and he built one of the first

1356
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,640
green houses in Boulder as like a

1357
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:44,880
construction worker and then next thing

1358
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:48,318
you knew he was running it. So he sort

1359
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,599
of has a construction and uh cultivation

1360
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,679
background as well. He ran a bunch of

1361
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,039
spots as well. Um and then that's when

1362
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:54,480
he started doing the application writing

1363
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:58,079
and that's sort of where next big crop

1364
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:00,079
came from um as a whole. So you know I

1365
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,559
couldn't do what either of them do um

1366
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:03,839
for sure kind of thing. Um I would also

1367
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,440
dare them to try and come play with

1368
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:07,279
plants and do you know kind of one of

1369
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,880
those things like you know sort of at

1370
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,680
this point like all these projects are

1371
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,519
just honestly like too big for any one

1372
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:16,000
person. Like there's no unicorn out

1373
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:17,599
there that can do it all. Um, so sort of

1374
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,960
to like have that complimentary team

1375
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,760
where everybody's sort of a subject

1376
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,400
matter expert in their lane. Don't get

1377
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,400
me wrong, we all wear lots of hats, you

1378
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,480
know, and solve and whatever, but like

1379
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,039
um to sort of have that, you know, that

1380
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,800
comfort spot of like, you know, where

1381
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:34,199
you hang out, you know, this is your

1382
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,880
world. You got to own it and you got to

1383
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:38,960
be just on all of it, you know. So sort

1384
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,480
of next to crap like you said, you know,

1385
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,559
we have lots of clients pretty much

1386
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,880
almost every state that, you know, legal

1387
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:47,119
markets working in, you know, design

1388
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,280
facilities, sort of sold gear, sold

1389
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,200
genetics to, helped with operational

1390
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,920
plans or financial models and all that

1391
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:55,199
kind of stuff. Um, so I don't know, I

1392
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,880
feel like sort of the network we've

1393
00:50:55,199 --> 00:51:00,159
built, um, you know, between vendors and

1394
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,599
clients is like something to be proud

1395
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:03,759
of. Just kind of like you can walk in

1396
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:05,200
any room with your head high, you know,

1397
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,800
done everybody right kind of thing over

1398
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:10,000
the years.

1399
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:13,359
For sure. Well, I mean, considering your

1400
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:17,440
uh vast background in dealing with the

1401
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:19,279
cannabis plant, um we I do like to find

1402
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:23,599
out sort of where you started your

1403
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:25,359
journey with, uh plants in general. So,

1404
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:28,079
you know, whether that be when you were

1405
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:31,358
younger, uh, growing up, if there was a

1406
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:33,599
garden in the backyard or, um, you know,

1407
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:36,639
some people say that cannabis is the

1408
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:38,160
gateway plant to gardening and, uh,

1409
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:39,519
sometimes it's the other way around for

1410
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:42,719
people. So, where did your journey with

1411
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:45,599
plants begin? Sure. So, my mother is

1412
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:47,838
like as talented of as an artist as like

1413
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:50,559
you can be kind of thing. Like, she ran

1414
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:52,400
she was an art teacher. um you know when

1415
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,079
she was younger she ran a clothing

1416
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:57,358
company and sort of designed clothes and

1417
00:51:54,079 --> 00:52:00,079
all kinds of stuff there. Um you know

1418
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:02,078
sort of quilting like drawing, painting,

1419
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:03,599
all of it, photography. Um but I guess

1420
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:06,160
she always had like a vegetable garden

1421
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:08,000
at her house growing up. Um you know so

1422
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:10,000
she literally would walk across a creek

1423
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,679
to the other side of the field to

1424
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,039
garden, you know, pick all of whatever

1425
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:16,078
and that was dinner for her. You know,

1426
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:17,759
she just ate salads constantly. Um, you

1427
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,200
know, and I'll send you some pictures of

1428
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,800
it. You know, like they just moved to

1429
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:23,199
Asheville, North Carolina a couple years

1430
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:25,039
ago. You lived in Philly my whole life.

1431
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:27,598
Um, but she has a couple bird of

1432
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:30,519
paradises that are probably like I think

1433
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:32,640
one's like 43 years old. The other's 30

1434
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:34,480
something. Um, she has a few other

1435
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:36,480
plants that are 50 plus years old that,

1436
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,760
you know, she's been carrying around.

1437
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,280
Like at this point, she has to hide

1438
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,440
stuff from my dad when she brings home

1439
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,000
new plants kind of thing. Um, you know,

1440
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,480
she's probably got 500 plus like cact

1441
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,920
cactuses, succulents, cacti, succulent.

1442
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,358
That's so cool kind of thing. And I'll

1443
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,358
send you pictures. It's like pretty

1444
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:53,199
stunning work kind of like like how do

1445
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:55,039
you know the Latin names for all this

1446
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:57,199
stuff? So, I feel like I didn't really

1447
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:58,759
realize it, you know, like how you know,

1448
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:01,519
when you're younger, you don't realize

1449
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:03,680
certain things of it, but like they said

1450
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:05,440
she had plants that, you know, the house

1451
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:07,118
I grew up in, like one of the rooms like

1452
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,679
big glass windows, it was two stories

1453
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:11,440
tall without a second floor above it,

1454
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:14,239
you know. So she had 20 some foot tall

1455
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:16,480
plants my whole life kind of thing. Um,

1456
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:18,000
you grew up around plants. Yes. But I

1457
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,079
didn't really I guess to be honest I

1458
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,280
used to mow lawns like from the time I

1459
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,960
was like I don't know maybe 11 I was

1460
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,680
mowing lawns to make money to buy dirt

1461
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,960
bikes. So like didn't really realize it

1462
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:30,558
you know kind of thing. But like you

1463
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,318
know back when I was a kid I could tell

1464
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:34,480
you all kinds of stuff about sky

1465
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:36,400
whatever insert whatever lawn you know

1466
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,159
we had Kabota tractors whatever you know

1467
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,639
kind of like whatever. just didn't

1468
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:43,199
really maybe realize it till older that

1469
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:46,000
maybe that's where it all started. Um

1470
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:47,519
and then like I said when I got this job

1471
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,599
and I guess sort of always sort of

1472
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:52,318
self-medicated my whole life pretty

1473
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,599
regularly kind of thing. Um so then like

1474
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:55,679
you know I started bartending at that

1475
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:58,880
one bar and they sort of drugg me up the

1476
00:53:55,679 --> 00:54:00,239
hill to get trim for them. Um you know

1477
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,280
and then you're like I want my own

1478
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:04,318
plant. So I lived in this little

1479
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,480
carriage house um you know tiny little

1480
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:08,719
carriage house like in the city and I

1481
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,559
was teaching whatever. I literally moved

1482
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:13,039
my mattress to the staircase. So, I was

1483
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:15,119
like up against staircase and then I

1484
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:16,719
hung a tarp and I hung 20,000 watts on

1485
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:19,760
one side and then I had a little bedroom

1486
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:22,399
with some just T5s. So, I moved all my

1487
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,559
clothes down into my living room and

1488
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:27,358
kitchen and I literally slept on a

1489
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:30,079
mattress next to 2000 watts and did that

1490
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:31,279
for a while I guess until I got robbed,

1491
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,599
you know, and then that's like a whole

1492
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,920
new learning experience kind of thing.

1493
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:38,318
Um, and then I got robbed and sort of

1494
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,159
freaked out. you're like ah you know um

1495
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:42,480
it's sort of one of the you know Q like

1496
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:45,679
the one sort of sensei master mentor

1497
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:49,358
that is you know we could talk about him

1498
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:51,679
you know he's a sensei kind of thing he

1499
00:54:49,358 --> 00:54:53,358
is so far ahead of his time he was part

1500
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:56,078
of a project up in Netherland that he

1501
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:58,400
wanted out of um and he was kind of just

1502
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:00,240
like why don't you you know he told the

1503
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,000
guys his partners why don't you bring

1504
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:04,959
Curly up you know and they used to just

1505
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,318
call me Curly and uh so then I started

1506
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,159
going up the hill

1507
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:09,838
Um, like sir said, like I never really

1508
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:12,558
grew any plants until I started growing

1509
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:15,358
cannabis. And then, yeah, I went from

1510
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:16,960
two lights, you know, with my mattress

1511
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:21,519
next to that tarp here in those white

1512
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:23,599
shoe boxes home all night to uh 10 to 14

1513
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:26,318
to three house, you know, you know, next

1514
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:27,920
thing you know, kind of,

1515
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:29,039
you know, as sort of many houses you,

1516
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,800
you know, and I guess like I was

1517
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:32,318
finishing my teaching degree, like I

1518
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,920
said, it was, you know, the first time I

1519
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:35,679
went through college was like BNC

1520
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,680
student. and I bartended and partied and

1521
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:39,679
had a real good time. Um, but when I was

1522
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:43,279
get my teaching degree and started, you

1523
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:45,039
know, growing. Um, I got a 4.0 kind of

1524
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,400
thing, you know, like all of a sudden it

1525
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:47,519
was like the first time you ever had a,

1526
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,798
you know, with those big desktop

1527
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:51,199
calendars, it was the first time I ever

1528
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:53,199
had a schedule that I guess I followed,

1529
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:55,439
you know. So, like all of a sudden, you

1530
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:56,879
know, school clicked, I got a 4.0,

1531
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,480
graduated with whatever high honors

1532
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,720
from, you know, like that kind of stuff.

1533
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,318
Um, and like I said, you know, kind of

1534
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:04,719
just, you know, I think like a lot of

1535
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:06,239
people, it almost gets addictive kind of

1536
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:08,719
thing to have these gardens and trying

1537
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:10,798
to make something so pretty and, you

1538
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:12,558
know, just uh it's like a very creative

1539
00:56:10,798 --> 00:56:13,838
outlet, you know, where you get to take

1540
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:15,760
something from being like, you know,

1541
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:17,599
small little plant to this final

1542
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,960
finished flower, you know. I feel like

1543
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:21,280
probably like lots of other people, you

1544
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,920
know, in our world, great at starting

1545
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,200
stuff and not finishing stuff projects.

1546
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,440
Um, and this was like the first thing

1547
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:28,639
that ever clicked. Yeah. you know, this

1548
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,559
was the first thing that ever clicked

1549
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:33,118
that like I followed through and in that

1550
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:34,640
way and like finished hard and um you

1551
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,640
know, and just got super proud of your

1552
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:38,639
work and um nice you know, like you

1553
00:56:36,639 --> 00:56:41,118
said, that's now 17 years later, you

1554
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:42,960
know, kind of thing. But um how was that

1555
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:44,559
first grow setup though? Like so you

1556
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,199
said you had just like a tarp kind of

1557
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:48,720
separating the room out, but uh yeah,

1558
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:51,919
what was like your inputs? What were you

1559
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:54,719
feeding these plants? How how did you uh

1560
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:57,680
Yeah, was it a successful first grow?

1561
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:58,719
We'll call it medium. um medium, you

1562
00:56:57,679 --> 00:56:59,838
know, kind of like so it was like a

1563
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:02,480
little carriage house with like, you

1564
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:03,920
know, your sort of sloped roof and a

1565
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,679
little tiny staircase that went

1566
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,760
upstairs. It was a tiny little bathroom

1567
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:09,838
with like a sliding curtain kind of

1568
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,160
thing. Um so I had a mattress up against

1569
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:14,239
the stairs and I used to have to fill up

1570
00:57:12,159 --> 00:57:17,440
five gallon buckets, you know, in the

1571
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:18,959
shower and like walk across my mattress

1572
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,720
to get to the PL, you know, kind of

1573
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:23,039
thing. like like literally it was like

1574
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:26,480
you know and there was like a a little

1575
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:28,880
fire place or there was a chimney in the

1576
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:31,039
middle of this space. So took a hammer

1577
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:33,440
and you know beat a hole in that chimney

1578
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:35,199
to try to exhaust everything out of you.

1579
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,838
So I literally had to T5 you know sort

1580
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:39,598
of tarps down on floors and hung and

1581
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:41,440
like uh you know I guess at that point

1582
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:43,838
we were using like the Dutch bleach

1583
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:46,480
trays like the little you know 6 in

1584
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:48,159
slabs um okay you know kind of thing. So

1585
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,880
I think in the beginning we you know it

1586
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:52,879
was on ionic which I think it's

1587
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:55,200
Australian or but ionic was a one part

1588
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,760
you know recipe you know you veg near

1589
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,960
bloom and like a little PK booster and

1590
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,880
so just basically had little

1591
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:03,920
recirculating pumps you know with those

1592
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:06,318
leech trays and the slabs. Um so like I

1593
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,880
said I slept next to these plants with

1594
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:11,199
you know the lights going at night and

1595
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,039
you know the upstairs in a little tiny

1596
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:15,919
carriage house with no insulation in the

1597
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:17,838
middle of the city. Um, you know, so

1598
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,039
were you doing like eb and flow? Uh,

1599
00:58:17,838 --> 00:58:21,440
were you doing like an eb and flow

1600
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:23,039
system or just like we had like a little

1601
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,400
like your cement mixing bins you get at

1602
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:26,318
Home Depot or Lowe's kind of thing. I

1603
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,680
think they were 11 gallons a piece and

1604
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:29,440
just like a little pump with some drip

1605
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:31,279
stakes, you know, drip line going up to

1606
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,639
each slab kind of thing. And it was I

1607
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,559
guess because these guys, you know, used

1608
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:36,879
to do, you know, big houses up in the

1609
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:39,200
mountain. So it' be two plants of light

1610
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,039
just to keep the counts under 99 and,

1611
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:43,679
you know, so I just basically mimic that

1612
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:45,920
of my house kind of thing. Um, oh, so

1613
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:48,798
you do you did four plants under 2,000

1614
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:50,400
watts? Yeah, kind of. You know, and I

1615
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:51,838
like So, yeah, dude, it was, you know,

1616
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,599
and again, the guys I was getting

1617
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:56,078
genetics from like Chuck and John and

1618
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:57,838
them, like it was as good of like we'll

1619
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,599
get into this, but like if I could have

1620
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:02,480
that cut of sour diesel back, you know,

1621
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:03,960
from back then, I would do anything for,

1622
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,559
you know, it is the

1623
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:08,720
best sort of cut that I've ever touched

1624
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:10,160
that I've lost, you know. Do do you

1625
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:12,078
remember what specific cut of sour

1626
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:14,239
diesel it was again? is this is going

1627
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:16,559
back like the 14 to 17 year mark here in

1628
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:17,919
Denver kind of thing. Um so I don't you

1629
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,519
know they just always just referred to

1630
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,920
as the D you know and they're from the

1631
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:24,559
south with big old beards and yeah big

1632
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,960
dudes like oh the D what you know like

1633
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:28,798
kind of thing. So I wish I knew what cut

1634
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,798
you know it has been long gone kind of

1635
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:34,000
thing and I have been searching ever

1636
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:36,400
since to I'll have to connect you with

1637
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,719
uh one of the uh well with my co-founder

1638
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,559
with the um the craft growers network

1639
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:42,318
Gabby because I got my eyes all over

1640
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:44,640
that. I can't wait to get to meet him

1641
00:59:42,318 --> 00:59:46,318
and go mess with that kind of thing.

1642
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:48,078
Yeah, cuz he's got a few different sour

1643
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:49,639
cuts that uh one of them might be the

1644
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:52,960
one that you're looking for

1645
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:54,879
cuz like 18, 19 years old. Yeah, his

1646
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,440
list is impressive. Um you know, kind of

1647
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,960
thing. So, I can't wait

1648
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:00,720
to trade, collaborate, do whatever kind

1649
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:03,280
of thing with him to get my hands on it.

1650
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:06,239
So, cool. Um, these guys also used to

1651
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:08,480
have this Hawaiian that was like just

1652
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:10,879
like like I said, I would only smoke the

1653
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:13,199
like during like midterms or finals, I

1654
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,519
would only smoke the Hawaiian cuz I

1655
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:17,118
joke, you know, instead of smoking like

1656
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:19,599
instead of smoking dope, I would smoke

1657
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:21,838
smart with that Hawaiian,

1658
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:23,760
you know, kind of thing. So like I don't

1659
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:25,838
know but yeah it's going back a while

1660
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:29,119
and then you so like it was ionic for a

1661
01:00:25,838 --> 01:00:31,279
while and then um you know that was sort

1662
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:33,838
of the one team's recipe and then the

1663
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:35,599
southern guys were all in GH and it was

1664
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:37,599
you know like said they have a bunch of

1665
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:39,680
southern boys like you know shot we

1666
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:40,798
talking shot glasses of green purple

1667
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:43,598
pink you know like your general

1668
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:45,280
hydroponics three part so like yeah like

1669
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:47,119
those recipes were written in certain

1670
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,400
ways from them you know and then I guess

1671
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:50,480
the good you know they introduced me to

1672
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,079
the guys at chlorophyll here in town,

1673
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:55,400
which is no longer around, but like Bow

1674
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:58,200
and Lee definitely like educated me too.

1675
01:00:55,400 --> 01:01:01,119
And so I feel like

1676
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:02,318
super righteously like thankful that I

1677
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:04,400
sort of had like the teachers and

1678
01:01:02,318 --> 01:01:06,079
mentors I did because they were kind of

1679
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,280
like as good as you, you know, sort of

1680
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:10,400
came up on like teams where these guys

1681
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:12,160
really, you know, and I guess even back

1682
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,680
then like I started joking like, well,

1683
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:16,078
in the name of science and like, you

1684
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:17,759
know, you would run have trash cans with

1685
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,519
reservoir, you know, kind of thing. One

1686
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,200
of the next setups after that one that I

1687
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:23,440
loved, we had built out a warehouse in

1688
01:01:21,199 --> 01:01:25,199
Boulder and it was a 10,000 square foot

1689
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,519
warehouse and it was all eight inch PVC

1690
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:29,759
pipe and they cut the tops out of it and

1691
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:32,480
had little handles like kind of thing in

1692
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:34,640
them. So they'd be like 40 foot runs to

1693
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:37,119
mimic the Dutch leech trays kind of

1694
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:38,798
thing with 8 in PVC on just saw horses

1695
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,640
big horse troughs as reservoirs at the

1696
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:42,559
end of it kind of thing. So like three

1697
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:44,960
of us could run this 10,000 foot

1698
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:46,720
warehouse. It was so basic and simple

1699
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,159
like that. So then like after that one

1700
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:50,879
got broken down, I stole a bunch of the

1701
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:52,879
8 inch pipe for my house kind of thing.

1702
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:55,680
But I would even run like, you know, the

1703
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:57,519
exact same strains, you know, you had

1704
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:59,358
4,000 watts in the basement. So like,

1705
01:01:57,519 --> 01:02:01,280
you know, two two eight inch pipes on

1706
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:02,719
one side, two PVC pipes on the other

1707
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,960
side with different reservoirs, but the

1708
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:06,639
exact same genetics but different, you

1709
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,480
know, nutrients and stuff like that. So

1710
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:10,000
Okay. Even back started running some

1711
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,838
side by sides and stuff to see the

1712
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,159
difference. Yeah. Just I don't I guess

1713
01:02:11,838 --> 01:02:16,480
like I love cars and motorcycles, so I

1714
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:18,078
feel like, you know, sort of I don't

1715
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,280
always look at as like race car [ __ ]

1716
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:21,839
you know, and like Sure. Yeah. You're

1717
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,880
racing like, you know, this verse that

1718
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:24,960
and like, you know, you were writing

1719
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:26,480
down the recipes and all this stuff and

1720
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,400
everything was comparable. So, it was

1721
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,798
just like, you know, you sort of

1722
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:33,200
competing with yourself to just see

1723
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:34,960
where you could take it. But when you

1724
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:37,679
were running those 8 in pipes, were you

1725
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:39,519
still uh using like a drip system and

1726
01:02:37,679 --> 01:02:41,759
just letting that be sort of your trough

1727
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:43,119
to drain to waste? Yeah, basically you

1728
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,599
you put your little coverver like half

1729
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:48,480
inch or 3/4 inch like sort of PVC down

1730
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:50,000
it so it hold your slabs up, you know,

1731
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,599
like off the ground kind of thing and

1732
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,639
just put the slabs right all the way up.

1733
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:55,119
It's like, you know, if you could

1734
01:02:52,639 --> 01:02:59,039
imagine big warehouses full just saw

1735
01:02:55,119 --> 01:03:01,640
horses and 8 inch PVC like so simple,

1736
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:04,159
you know, kind of thing. Um, and again

1737
01:03:01,639 --> 01:03:05,759
like I don't know like the simplicity of

1738
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:08,318
it, you know, it's like race car stuff

1739
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,480
like like I was and I love like sleeper

1740
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:12,798
cars like you know you don't want to

1741
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,440
advertise anything but you want to be

1742
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:16,798
real fast. Um, so I always look at like

1743
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:18,880
you know the same kind of thing as like

1744
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:20,960
8 inch PVC was designed to hold water

1745
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,720
and move water. That's what we were

1746
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,480
doing in it, you know, and you sort of

1747
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:27,719
cut it, design it, make it work in that

1748
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:30,559
space. and uh you know

1749
01:03:27,719 --> 01:03:34,000
like I don't know it was so simple but

1750
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:36,000
yet it worked so well kind of thing. Oh

1751
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,798
that sounds awesome. I mean sometimes

1752
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,880
the the best systems are those that are

1753
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:43,920
the simplest to use because you don't

1754
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:46,640
have to there's there's no guesswork and

1755
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:50,159
then if anything fails it's as simple as

1756
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:51,838
you know busting out the uh the sawzall

1757
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:53,759
and and cutting the pipe off and

1758
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:55,599
throwing in a new piece. you know, it's

1759
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,359
it's easy. It's all form and function.

1760
01:03:55,599 --> 01:04:00,480
Nothing to look cool. Like just, you

1761
01:03:57,358 --> 01:04:02,480
know, it is truly like performance

1762
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,599
designed kind of mentality, you know,

1763
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,880
don't get me wrong, like could we get

1764
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:06,480
bored over the years and you be like,

1765
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:08,480
I'm going to do organic, I'm going to

1766
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,079
switch to this, whatever, you know. So

1767
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,440
like have done it, you know, working a

1768
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,599
way to grow like you know, you work

1769
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,760
there at the store, you put your, you

1770
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:18,079
know, eight or 10 hour shifts in and you

1771
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:20,240
just read every bottle on the shelf kind

1772
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:22,400
of thing and like make up fantasy

1773
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:24,159
recipes or you get to like essentially

1774
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,760
watch all your customers buying all this

1775
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:27,358
stuff and who does really good work and

1776
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,280
cherrypick these ideas from them and

1777
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:30,960
stuff. So like you know I've run like

1778
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:32,960
every nutrient you know you could

1779
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:35,440
imagine all the different substrates the

1780
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:37,039
different size containers what you know

1781
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:39,200
like like I said in the name of science

1782
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:42,240
it was just like fun to like practice

1783
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:45,279
and put it all together. Well let's do

1784
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:47,519
like a little uh fun mental exercise

1785
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:49,200
then since you have this experience with

1786
01:04:47,519 --> 01:04:51,838
all the different nutrients and all

1787
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:55,519
these different setups. if you were to

1788
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:58,880
help a home grower set up a 4x4 tent,

1789
01:04:55,519 --> 01:05:02,239
right? Yep. With um and let's talk

1790
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:05,440
hydroponics because organics and stuff

1791
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:07,439
is more of a religion to a lot of the

1792
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:11,838
people that grow that way rather than a

1793
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:13,599
practice. And um I feel like if that's

1794
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:16,798
the route of growing that someone wants

1795
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:20,160
to go, I wholeheartedly support it. But

1796
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:21,480
it's really hard to um to say that this

1797
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:23,838
is, you

1798
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:25,679
know, you know, from from someone who

1799
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:28,719
sold the different inputs and the

1800
01:05:25,679 --> 01:05:30,318
different aspects of growing, it's hard

1801
01:05:28,719 --> 01:05:32,000
to be like this is exactly what you need

1802
01:05:30,318 --> 01:05:35,279
to do to be successful. But with

1803
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,960
hydroponics, in a lot of cases, there's,

1804
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:39,760
you know, there's different recipes.

1805
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:41,358
There's different um there's different

1806
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:44,480
forms and functions of the different

1807
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:48,159
hydroponic systems that you can use that

1808
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:50,480
kind of required either a tweak here or

1809
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:53,440
a change there. So, if you were to help

1810
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:56,240
someone set up a 4x4 tent, what

1811
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:58,400
nutrients are you going for? What style

1812
01:05:56,239 --> 01:06:00,000
of hydroponics are you helping them set

1813
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:02,920
up? And what are some of the things that

1814
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,440
you think you might be able to help

1815
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:07,920
alleviate in terms of the struggles of

1816
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:12,159
hydroponics, whether it be like runoff

1817
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:13,838
capture or nutrient delivering or uh

1818
01:06:12,159 --> 01:06:15,759
tank mixing or anything like that? Just

1819
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:18,318
kind of run through uh if you had to

1820
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:20,960
design your own 4x4 tent at home right

1821
01:06:18,318 --> 01:06:22,400
now. Um I guess what so we'll sort of

1822
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,838
start you know kind of obviously LED

1823
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:28,079
light at this point just

1824
01:06:24,838 --> 01:06:29,759
because you know temperature control

1825
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:31,200
electric you know all of this stuff kind

1826
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,359
of thing for you know that such a small

1827
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:36,480
space I don't know like love fluence

1828
01:06:33,358 --> 01:06:38,239
lights you know love lights ran DLI

1829
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,240
lights for a while like those are my top

1830
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:42,159
three kind of where lights like any of

1831
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:44,399
those you know you have like as good a

1832
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:46,000
fixture as you could get um I don't know

1833
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,400
I guess starting to mess with some BIOS

1834
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,920
lights as well um I haven't run them

1835
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:52,400
yet, but like about to start playing

1836
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:54,159
with their under canopy stuff. Um, so,

1837
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:56,798
you know, get your sort of your standard

1838
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:58,399
bar style LED. I guess when it comes to

1839
01:06:56,798 --> 01:07:02,000
nutrients, I feel like it's a pretty

1840
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:04,599
no-brainer for me. Um, I'm on team Cana,

1841
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,280
you know, kind of thing. Like,

1842
01:07:04,599 --> 01:07:09,519
um, there's an A and a B kind of thing

1843
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:11,920
to it. It's always equal parts of A and

1844
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:14,239
B. So, it's like you could kind of do it

1845
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:16,000
with your eyes closed or, you know, like

1846
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:17,199
the answer is more or less, you know,

1847
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,639
kind of thing. And they both go up and

1848
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:20,719
down at the same time. sort of when you

1849
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:22,400
look at your plants and you're like do

1850
01:07:20,719 --> 01:07:24,639
you know color or this or whatever you

1851
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:26,639
know the answer is more or less so like

1852
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:29,279
and they have an AB veg and an AB flour

1853
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:31,838
right yes but also for their cocoa line

1854
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:33,839
yeah the cocoa specific nutrient line

1855
01:07:31,838 --> 01:07:36,159
it's the same for veg and flour kind of

1856
01:07:33,838 --> 01:07:38,000
thing so for a home grower you literally

1857
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:40,318
could get your cocoa A and your cocoa B

1858
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:43,280
and it's the same nutrient for veg and

1859
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:45,199
flour which would be super convenient um

1860
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,798
you know like I love like said I kind of

1861
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:49,919
love these compressed cocoa blocks at

1862
01:07:46,798 --> 01:07:53,199
this Right. Um they're so just

1863
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:55,599
consistent and easy and no mess and no

1864
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:56,798
pots to wash at the end. Just you know,

1865
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:59,599
you get all like, you know, the

1866
01:07:56,798 --> 01:08:01,440
commercial part like is there a virus in

1867
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:02,640
there? Oh, you didn't wash your pot good

1868
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,480
enough. Now you just spread it to your

1869
01:08:02,639 --> 01:08:06,558
next plants. What? Yeah. So these

1870
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,318
compressed cocoa blocks sort of

1871
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:10,720
eliminate all that and the labor and

1872
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:12,000
stuff. So like in your little 4x4 tent,

1873
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:13,919
like I guess I always like to sort of

1874
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,159
think of it as like pattern on a dice.

1875
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,960
you know, when it comes to your plant

1876
01:08:15,159 --> 01:08:18,880
arrangement, you know, you could do

1877
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,399
four, you could do five, you could do

1878
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,560
nine, you know, kind of thing. But like

1879
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:25,119
the pattern on a dice kind of is like

1880
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:26,798
how we'll set those plants up to sort of

1881
01:08:25,119 --> 01:08:28,798
have just like that sort of even space

1882
01:08:26,798 --> 01:08:30,880
management so that all of our plants

1883
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:32,719
ideally you could take any one plant and

1884
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,920
put it to another spot and they're all

1885
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:35,838
the same shape and you could switch them

1886
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,759
and nobody would ever know. Yeah.

1887
01:08:35,838 --> 01:08:39,600
Because that sort of shows your control.

1888
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:41,679
So like four plants, five plants or nine

1889
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:45,440
plants in that. I guess you could do

1890
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:48,719
eight too, but um you know in that 4x4 I

1891
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:51,278
know again I can of cocoa they have

1892
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:52,880
their like cocoa flex pots now and have

1893
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:55,279
like a one gallon and a three gallon. So

1894
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:57,920
I don't know I love the smaller ones. So

1895
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:59,600
I would stay in that one gallon pot. Um

1896
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,838
and I would build myself you know

1897
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,719
outside your tent you know get yourself

1898
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:06,479
like that 55gallon drum or 20 gallon

1899
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:09,838
trash can whatever you know kind of

1900
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:10,959
thing. um and sort of the correct pump.

1901
01:09:09,838 --> 01:09:13,439
You know, you got to do a little bit of

1902
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:14,640
math when it comes to pumps um just to

1903
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:16,158
make sure the pressure is right. But,

1904
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:18,798
you know, get your pressure compensating

1905
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:20,479
like netin drippers so that you know

1906
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:23,600
every plant's getting the exact same

1907
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:25,759
amount of feed. So, I can't and I guess

1908
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:27,279
the other thing is like um I picked and

1909
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:30,158
it's been this way for years and years

1910
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:31,520
too, but like you know uh there's

1911
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:32,719
certain bottles that I used to love that

1912
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,040
I don't use anymore just for like

1913
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:37,719
cleanliness purposes, but sort of like a

1914
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:40,158
synthetic liquid nutrient like can of

1915
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:42,239
cocoa. The reservoir is always clean,

1916
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:45,039
the drip lines are always clean, like

1917
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:46,399
you know, so like you always sort of you

1918
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:48,399
don't have to worry about that certain

1919
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:50,479
maintenance kind of thing. So like you

1920
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:52,079
know A and B you know you have your PK

1921
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:53,599
booster you could run a little

1922
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:55,760
hypocchloric acid or whatever you know

1923
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:57,520
but you really don't you know don't get

1924
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:00,239
me wrong years ago it used to have 15

1925
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:01,840
part recipes and stuff like that I'm

1926
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:04,000
sure you know but now it's kind of like

1927
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:06,319
yo a b maybe some cow mag depending on

1928
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:09,039
where you live and well water city water

1929
01:10:06,319 --> 01:10:10,719
whatever you know RO stuff but like the

1930
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:13,439
hardest thing I think to teach somebody

1931
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:15,359
especially for a home grower um what is

1932
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:17,599
wet and what is dry if you don't have

1933
01:10:15,359 --> 01:10:20,079
the sensors kind of thing you you know,

1934
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:22,719
like so as long as your environment is

1935
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:24,880
in that sort of window of VPD that's

1936
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,719
going to be happy, you know, kind of

1937
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:28,880
thing. Like you don't need too many

1938
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:30,880
parts of nutrients to really put out

1939
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:34,159
stellar product. You know, the answer is

1940
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:36,000
like what is wet and what is dry and

1941
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:37,599
kind of like, you know, again, just keep

1942
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,560
it between the lines. You don't have to

1943
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:42,239
be perfect, you know, just but like, you

1944
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,640
know, so I go like, you know, pick your

1945
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:47,279
LED light, some can of cocoa nutrients

1946
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:49,280
of the same veg and flour nudes in a

1947
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:51,359
onegon pot with a drip, you know, and

1948
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:52,719
then you go to Home Depot or Lowe's or

1949
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:55,839
whatever and get your little six gallon

1950
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:57,920
waste runoff, you know, kind of like

1951
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:59,360
cement mixing bin and that can catch

1952
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,600
your waste water and you could, you

1953
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:03,359
know, go water your house plants or

1954
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,960
whatever outside with it kind of thing.

1955
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:06,719
Um, if you wanted to reuse it, you

1956
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,480
certainly could, but like I would keep

1957
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:11,198
it simple like that, you know? And then

1958
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:12,879
I'd also focus on make sure you have

1959
01:11:11,198 --> 01:11:13,919
genetics that you're stoked and excited

1960
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,199
about. They're going to give you the

1961
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:18,480
product in the end that you want, but

1962
01:11:15,198 --> 01:11:20,399
like it's that simple kind of for sure.

1963
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:23,678
So, a few questions then in your

1964
01:11:20,399 --> 01:11:25,719
opinion, seed or clone for a first

1965
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:28,640
grower?

1966
01:11:25,719 --> 01:11:30,319
Clone. I guess like hopefully I show you

1967
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:32,320
hopefully you have, you know, a friend

1968
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:33,519
that can kind of coach you along and

1969
01:11:32,319 --> 01:11:35,119
help you out and they'll give you those

1970
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:37,520
first couple clones that they've grown

1971
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:39,198
it then they could tell you the little

1972
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,560
bit of the cheat sheet with it. If you

1973
01:11:39,198 --> 01:11:41,759
kill it or mess it up, who cares?

1974
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,239
They're going to give you a new one, you

1975
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:46,000
know, kind of thing. Um, so I would say,

1976
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:47,599
you know, get clones from a buddy. Um,

1977
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,800
so you know, you got a friend, you got a

1978
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,400
mentor, they're going to like coach you

1979
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:53,279
along. It's fun, you know, that kind of

1980
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:54,960
thing. Right on. Yeah, I agree. Clones

1981
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:56,238
are kind of uh always what I would

1982
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,480
suggest to people when they're starting

1983
01:11:56,238 --> 01:12:00,000
off because you can look and see where

1984
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:02,319
it's what it's produced in other

1985
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,719
settings and have a a goal that you can

1986
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:06,559
have as your target. Um whereas seeds

1987
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:09,039
are just a lot more hit and miss no

1988
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:10,880
matter how good the breeder is. It's one

1989
01:12:09,039 --> 01:12:13,679
of those things where there is no

1990
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:16,319
uniformity in cannabis breeding right

1991
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:18,079
now that you you can't plant a field of

1992
01:12:16,319 --> 01:12:21,679
cannabis seeds at this point and expect

1993
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:26,760
for there to be a um a true uniformity

1994
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:26,760
across that entire crop. So plus

1995
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,840
say that again. Plus you know if you

1996
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,679
love it you're like cool let's do it

1997
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:33,199
again. Same strain. Yeah exactly. How do

1998
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:34,640
I do it better this time? You know what

1999
01:12:33,198 --> 01:12:36,399
improvements am I? You know so it gives

2000
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:38,560
you that ability to baseline and

2001
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:40,399
continue to make good decisions.

2002
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:43,199
Absolutely. Absolutely. I agree with

2003
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:44,639
that. Um and then uh so like I always

2004
01:12:43,198 --> 01:12:48,639
suggest for people that are starting off

2005
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:51,119
with hydroponics to just run a um a

2006
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:52,960
single set of irrigations per day where

2007
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:55,679
they always where they reach field

2008
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:58,640
capacity, achieve some runoff, and then

2009
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:00,239
allow for a dryback over the the

2010
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:04,320
remainder of the day and through the

2011
01:13:00,238 --> 01:13:05,839
night time. And with that in mind, um,

2012
01:13:04,319 --> 01:13:07,920
is that something that you would suggest

2013
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:11,600
for new growers as well, or would you

2014
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:12,960
suggest something slightly different?

2015
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,039
I don't know. I guess it's one of those

2016
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,279
things of like, you know, there's no

2017
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:18,800
like one correct answer here. Obviously,

2018
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:20,639
it's kind of like I would almost say

2019
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,480
like pick that philosophy you're going

2020
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,800
to follow, that methodology from the

2021
01:13:22,479 --> 01:13:26,158
start and follow it all the way through.

2022
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,679
You know, if you want to get cute and

2023
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:30,158
play with like your sort of irrigations

2024
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:32,480
and like push it that way, you start

2025
01:13:30,158 --> 01:13:34,799
that way from day one and you follow

2026
01:13:32,479 --> 01:13:37,119
that plan. If you want to push that one

2027
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,719
big uh, you know, sort of scheduled feed

2028
01:13:37,119 --> 01:13:40,399
or you know, kind of as the plant needs

2029
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:42,480
it and then you're not going to water

2030
01:13:40,399 --> 01:13:44,479
again until the plant is ready to

2031
01:13:42,479 --> 01:13:46,000
accept, follow that the whole way

2032
01:13:44,479 --> 01:13:48,000
through, you know, kind of thing. But I

2033
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,600
would say I don't think there's a right

2034
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,600
answer here. It's kind of what do you

2035
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,960
sure what do you want to learn from? And

2036
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,320
then you have to stick with that the

2037
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:56,319
whole way through to like, you know,

2038
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:59,519
prove it to yourself what you learned.

2039
01:13:56,319 --> 01:14:00,799
So, um, for sure, you know, we could,

2040
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,960
yeah, you know, we could get cute and

2041
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:04,480
start talking like, you know, kind of

2042
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:06,640
where do you live? Like what's the

2043
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:08,479
humidity? Like Colorado's dry. This is,

2044
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:11,360
you know, so certain certain other

2045
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:12,959
factors might lead one of those

2046
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:14,880
decisions to being a better decision

2047
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:16,719
than another. Um, but again, I would

2048
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:20,159
just say you pick one and learn from

2049
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:22,640
that and follow the plan. Absolutely. I

2050
01:14:20,158 --> 01:14:25,279
I really like that it consistency is key

2051
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:26,719
in a lot of aspects and your plants,

2052
01:14:25,279 --> 01:14:28,599
especially when they're on drip

2053
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:30,960
irrigation, they're going

2054
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:35,360
to I if they're getting consistent

2055
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:37,198
irrigations daily or at a specific um uh

2056
01:14:35,359 --> 01:14:38,960
volutric water content, let's say like

2057
01:14:37,198 --> 01:14:40,879
where it it dries back to a specific

2058
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,679
number and then boom, it triggers an

2059
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:46,159
irrigation event. um as long as you're

2060
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:48,079
triggering it consistently at whatever

2061
01:14:46,158 --> 01:14:51,679
set point that is, the plants are going

2062
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:55,198
to tend to respond positively to that.

2063
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:58,158
And um so yeah, I I suggest doing the

2064
01:14:55,198 --> 01:14:59,919
the the one set of irrigations event of

2065
01:14:58,158 --> 01:15:01,679
events per day and doing that all the

2066
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:04,000
way through because then they'll see

2067
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:06,560
this extremely generative and I I think

2068
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:09,439
the morphology of the plant tends to be

2069
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:11,039
very uh desirable in that aspect and

2070
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:13,439
then people can start to mess with how

2071
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:16,880
they want to manipulate their yields.

2072
01:15:13,439 --> 01:15:18,799
But um or you know if it's at a specific

2073
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,880
dryback point making sure that you just

2074
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,800
hit it with the irrigation then all

2075
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:26,239
those things I think work really well.

2076
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:27,840
Um what what EC and what pH would you

2077
01:15:26,238 --> 01:15:30,238
suggest for people if they're running

2078
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,360
the uh the can of nutrients? I don't

2079
01:15:30,238 --> 01:15:33,359
know. You could probably just always

2080
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:34,639
stay safe and just be like six point you

2081
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:36,079
know kind of thing plus or minus

2082
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:38,400
whatever but like you know your six is

2083
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:40,800
just like will hang out right there in

2084
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:42,879
the middle kind of thing. Um, and I

2085
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:45,520
guess in all honesty, yeah, P, sorry,

2086
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:48,920
6.0 PS. Um, and when it comes to like

2087
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:51,760
sort of EC at this point, you

2088
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:53,359
know, what we used to do 5 years ago, 10

2089
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,039
years ago, whatever, 15 years ago, you

2090
01:15:53,359 --> 01:15:57,599
know, kind of thing is very different

2091
01:15:55,039 --> 01:16:01,439
than sort of um what people are

2092
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:02,960
currently doing. Um, you know, again,

2093
01:16:01,439 --> 01:16:05,678
all the sort of different nutrient

2094
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:08,079
manufacturers, you know, like, you know,

2095
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:10,800
Canon, Athena, Front Row, GH, whatever,

2096
01:16:08,079 --> 01:16:12,238
you know, like all of them have their

2097
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,520
recommendations kind of thing, you know,

2098
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:15,519
but again, I think it's going to go back

2099
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,960
a little bit to like how many watts is

2100
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,400
your light, you know, do you have a PAR

2101
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:20,800
meter and what's, you know, what is your

2102
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:23,119
reading at canopy, you know, kind of

2103
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,560
thing, you know, do you have CO2? sort

2104
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:27,198
of some of these other factors are going

2105
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:28,719
to swing that, but just to play it safe

2106
01:16:27,198 --> 01:16:30,639
and sort of straddle a fence, like you

2107
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:34,000
could probably hang out at like a 2.0 EC

2108
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:35,119
the whole time and be pretty

2109
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,600
comfortable. You're not leaving

2110
01:16:35,119 --> 01:16:40,158
something on the table kind of thing.

2111
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:42,640
Um, but you are pushing hard enough to

2112
01:16:40,158 --> 01:16:44,399
get that desired result, you know. Um,

2113
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:48,320
and again like sort of different

2114
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:49,319
nutrients sort of concentrations and um,

2115
01:16:48,319 --> 01:16:51,599
you

2116
01:16:49,319 --> 01:16:53,920
know, all situations are different, but

2117
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,960
basically if you sat at a 6.0 pH and a

2118
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:58,480
2.0 EC, you could probably go hang out

2119
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:01,439
and be super comfortable throughout a

2120
01:16:58,479 --> 01:17:03,039
whole run. For sure. I think that's a

2121
01:17:01,439 --> 01:17:04,799
great answer, especially for new growers

2122
01:17:03,039 --> 01:17:07,840
and especially if they're not uh

2123
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:10,239
providing any supplemental CO2. And you

2124
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:11,440
know, within that same uh line of

2125
01:17:10,238 --> 01:17:13,839
thought, keeping all the other

2126
01:17:11,439 --> 01:17:16,319
environmental and lighting factors at an

2127
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:19,360
acceptable level rather than trying to

2128
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:20,799
push them to the nth degree. Um because

2129
01:17:19,359 --> 01:17:23,039
at that point, there are going to be

2130
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,560
different nutrient packages that need to

2131
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:27,039
be increased in order to make sure that

2132
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:29,360
the metabolism of the plant is uh

2133
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:30,960
operating at its full potential with the

2134
01:17:29,359 --> 01:17:33,119
photosynthetic potential of the light

2135
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:35,600
that you're providing to it. And so all

2136
01:17:33,119 --> 01:17:37,439
of those factors, you know, it's like uh

2137
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,840
the the Liebig's law, you know, you have

2138
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:42,079
your limiting factors within like the

2139
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:44,319
staves of a of a barrel. So if as long

2140
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:46,238
as you're raising them all up together

2141
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:47,759
and going little bits at a time on all

2142
01:17:46,238 --> 01:17:49,678
of them to make sure that nothing spills

2143
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:51,520
over, you should be able to achieve a

2144
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:55,039
pretty optimal result for your

2145
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:57,199
situation. Yeah, totally. Cool. Well, I

2146
01:17:55,039 --> 01:17:58,800
think that that was fun uh to tell

2147
01:17:57,198 --> 01:18:00,479
people a little bit about how they would

2148
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:02,400
might uh how someone with your

2149
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:04,879
experience might set up a new home grow.

2150
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:06,799
And um yeah, one of the random other

2151
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,800
things if possible. Yeah. You know,

2152
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:10,320
doing this little homegrow, if you could

2153
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:12,560
set yourself up, like this is one thing

2154
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:13,920
I feel like you I've pushed on a couple

2155
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:16,719
of friends over the like if you could

2156
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:18,560
set yourself up a 4x8 tent, but really

2157
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:21,158
only have one blade in it so that you

2158
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:23,520
can contain everything inside

2159
01:18:21,158 --> 01:18:25,839
there. You know, you don't have to worry

2160
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,199
about stuff spilling. You know, you

2161
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:30,239
could fit if you had to fit a little

2162
01:18:27,198 --> 01:18:32,238
portable air conditioner or humidifiers

2163
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:34,319
or whatever kind of other factors. You

2164
01:18:32,238 --> 01:18:36,079
know, if you had the space to put a 4x8

2165
01:18:34,319 --> 01:18:37,359
tent, but truly only put one light in

2166
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:39,119
it, but put all of your other

2167
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:42,639
environmental controls in there, like

2168
01:18:39,119 --> 01:18:44,158
that's the sty way to like absolutely do

2169
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:48,079
some killer work in a small space like

2170
01:18:44,158 --> 01:18:50,079
that. For sure. It's like um the the

2171
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:52,399
step up from a lung room, but right

2172
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:54,319
before you actually meet a fully uh

2173
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:56,719
sealed environment. So you can, you

2174
01:18:54,319 --> 01:18:59,279
know, you can still do passive intake or

2175
01:18:56,719 --> 01:19:01,520
exhaust or even active intake or exhaust

2176
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:03,840
and something like that if you need to

2177
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:06,080
because like yeah, you could have maybe

2178
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:08,319
an AC inside the tent, but you need to

2179
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:10,479
exhaust the AC still at that point if

2180
01:19:08,319 --> 01:19:12,158
it's like a standing one or you know,

2181
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:13,599
you cut a hole in it and you stick it up

2182
01:19:12,158 --> 01:19:15,759
against a wall where you already have a

2183
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,120
wall-mounted AC or something like that.

2184
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,960
Then you're still having some sort of

2185
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:20,640
air exchange. And you know, I've seen

2186
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:23,198
all sorts of different styles of that,

2187
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:26,719
but I do really like the idea of having

2188
01:19:23,198 --> 01:19:28,639
a 4x8 or a 5x10 with just one light. You

2189
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:30,719
have a lot of room to work around your

2190
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:32,960
plants. You can even center that light

2191
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:35,439
in the tent so you have an extra like 3

2192
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:36,960
feet and 2 feet on either side and you

2193
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:39,198
can get to all different sides of your

2194
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:41,198
plant really easy that way. Um, it's a

2195
01:19:39,198 --> 01:19:43,519
great way to learn. I think that's it.

2196
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:46,158
Also containing smell, containing

2197
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:47,760
spillage of water, sort of all of those

2198
01:19:46,158 --> 01:19:48,879
things. Plus, like while you're working

2199
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:50,480
in there, you could watch this

2200
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:53,440
humidifier kick on or you hear an

2201
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:55,119
exhaust, you know, kind of it's like it

2202
01:19:53,439 --> 01:19:56,639
it's one of those things. It's just it

2203
01:19:55,119 --> 01:19:58,800
turns the same thing that we do in these

2204
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:00,400
big big buildings now just to a smaller

2205
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:03,840
scale kind of thing. So, you get to like

2206
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:05,439
see how this turns on, this turns off,

2207
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:07,920
you know, like just all the moving parts

2208
01:20:05,439 --> 01:20:10,639
pulling levers and how it all works. So,

2209
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:12,560
absolutely. I think that that's a a

2210
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:15,440
great advice for new growers, especially

2211
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:17,280
if they have the ability to and the

2212
01:20:15,439 --> 01:20:18,960
space, right? because there's, you know,

2213
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:21,759
a little bit of overhead cost that you

2214
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:24,319
got to con deal with there. And then the

2215
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,840
space of a 4x8 tent is significant if

2216
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:27,840
you're in like a small apartment or

2217
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:29,679
something. So all these different

2218
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:32,719
factors need to be taken into account.

2219
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:34,800
But, you know, if for an ideal, you

2220
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:36,560
know, one light setup, that sounds

2221
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:38,640
awesome. like a lot of people I think

2222
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:41,480
would be able to hit the ground running

2223
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:43,920
and ex and succeed, you know, on their

2224
01:20:41,479 --> 01:20:45,119
first however many harvests that they

2225
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:46,640
get out of something like that if

2226
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:48,319
they're and you could do quite a bit of

2227
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:50,800
work out of that little space. Like, you

2228
01:20:48,319 --> 01:20:53,599
know, Oh, yeah. I mean, you're not

2229
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:54,880
really Yeah. Yeah. You're probably if

2230
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:57,600
you're doing everything correctly,

2231
01:20:54,880 --> 01:21:00,000
you're you're easily pulling 12 to 15

2232
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,760
pounds out of that space per year. And

2233
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,198
if that's just for your own consumption

2234
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:05,440
at home and you're going through more

2235
01:21:03,198 --> 01:21:06,879
than a pound a month, then you might

2236
01:21:05,439 --> 01:21:08,319
need to slow down a little bit. I don't

2237
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:10,560
know. I'd be impressed. But yeah,

2238
01:21:08,319 --> 01:21:12,359
whatever. You know, that kind of thing.

2239
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:16,640
For sure.

2240
01:21:12,359 --> 01:21:19,839
Um well, uh let's see. So, we kind of

2241
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:22,920
we've touched base on your background,

2242
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:25,360
what you do at Next Big Crop.

2243
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:26,960
Um, let's talk about some of the current

2244
01:21:25,359 --> 01:21:30,000
things and current projects that you're

2245
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:31,279
working on and uh maybe some of the

2246
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,679
things that you've seen within the

2247
01:21:31,279 --> 01:21:37,840
cannabis industry that you either might

2248
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:39,920
want to see change or see move in a

2249
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:41,039
certain direction. Um, like what are

2250
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:43,199
some of the trends that you're seeing

2251
01:21:41,039 --> 01:21:45,198
and things that you're currently

2252
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:48,000
experiencing through your consultation

2253
01:21:45,198 --> 01:21:49,678
services? Um, sure. So I guess like one

2254
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:53,920
of the you know like I said we kind of

2255
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:55,359
have projects um every you know lots of

2256
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,960
markets kind of thing even at this point

2257
01:21:55,359 --> 01:21:59,198
like internationally kind of thing. So

2258
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:01,520
that's like something shiny you know and

2259
01:21:59,198 --> 01:22:02,719
fun to talk about and dream about and

2260
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:04,719
stuff like that you know hoping it gets

2261
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:06,158
closer. Yeah. You know been working on

2262
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:09,039
one project in Costa Rica for almost

2263
01:22:06,158 --> 01:22:10,799
three years now. Um so that's real close

2264
01:22:09,039 --> 01:22:13,039
to getting across the finish line and

2265
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:14,560
can't wait. Um

2266
01:22:13,039 --> 01:22:17,000
um but I guess sort of like sort of

2267
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:19,039
certain things see in the market these

2268
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,479
days one of the things I guess like the

2269
01:22:19,039 --> 01:22:22,399
hardest thing as a consultant sometimes

2270
01:22:20,479 --> 01:22:25,198
is to like come in and sort of try to

2271
01:22:22,399 --> 01:22:26,158
prove to you know like the team that

2272
01:22:25,198 --> 01:22:28,238
you're coming in to work with you're

2273
01:22:26,158 --> 01:22:30,638
like yo dude I don't want your job like

2274
01:22:28,238 --> 01:22:32,638
I'm not here for your job kind of thing

2275
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:34,480
like I'm here to help you solve stuff

2276
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:36,560
and sort of get in and get out kind of

2277
01:22:34,479 --> 01:22:38,158
thing. Um, you know, so like it is a

2278
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,199
it's a dance and like trying to figure,

2279
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:41,439
you know, you got to become friends with

2280
01:22:39,198 --> 01:22:42,799
the cultivation team. You got to sort of

2281
01:22:41,439 --> 01:22:44,238
put your time in the trenches a little

2282
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:46,480
bit and show that like, yo, I've done

2283
01:22:44,238 --> 01:22:48,000
this. I'm going to work right alongside

2284
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:52,079
with you to help solve this, you know,

2285
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:53,439
kind of thing. Like I win when you solve

2286
01:22:52,079 --> 01:22:55,519
problems and get better kind of thing.

2287
01:22:53,439 --> 01:22:57,599
So like that's like, you know, one of

2288
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:59,920
the biggest and like most immediate

2289
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:02,320
obstacles like everywhere you go. Um,

2290
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:04,719
you know, sort of like I don't know. I'm

2291
01:23:02,319 --> 01:23:06,000
gonna sort of probably maybe upset some

2292
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:07,039
people is like saying, you know, but

2293
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,119
there's just like certain things that

2294
01:23:07,039 --> 01:23:11,279
are just unrealistic. Like when it comes

2295
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:13,439
to like sales teams and accounting stuff

2296
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:15,439
and whatever spreadsheets, you're like,

2297
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:17,759
you know, bro, like your spreadsheets's

2298
01:23:15,439 --> 01:23:19,519
not real. Like, you know, so sort of

2299
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,920
again bringing those expectations back

2300
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:24,360
to reality and, you know, kind of thing.

2301
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:27,199
It's like, you know, people

2302
01:23:24,359 --> 01:23:29,519
want something that tests this high that

2303
01:23:27,198 --> 01:23:33,000
finishes this fast and, you know, and

2304
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:35,520
like it sort of just puts like

2305
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,359
unrealistic goals or like, you know,

2306
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:39,040
objectives in front of everybody, which

2307
01:23:37,359 --> 01:23:41,279
then causes like teams to clash, you

2308
01:23:39,039 --> 01:23:43,359
know, the garden's like, I need more

2309
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:44,800
time or I need more money or I need

2310
01:23:43,359 --> 01:23:46,960
whatever, you know, to make this happen

2311
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:48,719
and so it's sort of like it's sort of

2312
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:50,639
hard to, you know, and then certain

2313
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:52,880
people have like certain egos that are

2314
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:55,920
like you know, sort of hard to work

2315
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:57,199
around kind of thing. And like um you

2316
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:59,359
know, and again like lots of it's

2317
01:23:57,198 --> 01:24:01,119
opinion based like this is flowers

2318
01:23:59,359 --> 01:24:03,119
impressive, this could be better, what

2319
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:06,039
you know. So like I don't know. It's

2320
01:24:03,119 --> 01:24:08,079
just I wish there was a little bit

2321
01:24:06,039 --> 01:24:09,760
more. I don't know. I guess like said

2322
01:24:08,079 --> 01:24:11,359
sort of I feel very lucky to have sort

2323
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:13,520
of become friends with the people like

2324
01:24:11,359 --> 01:24:15,039
I'm friends with and the network and all

2325
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:16,880
that kind of thing. And like you know

2326
01:24:15,039 --> 01:24:18,319
your people really take care of you like

2327
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:20,639
you know I like to think I take care of

2328
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:22,319
you know kind of thing. Um, you know, so

2329
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:24,560
like protecting yourself by like

2330
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:26,880
building this killer team around you,

2331
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:28,120
uh, vendors, friends, clients, you know,

2332
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,719
kind of thing.

2333
01:24:28,119 --> 01:24:33,039
Um, you know, so I don't know. I guess I

2334
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:34,319
wish people would treat you. I guess I

2335
01:24:33,039 --> 01:24:36,639
wish people would treat you the way you

2336
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:38,399
treat them kind of thing. Um, you know,

2337
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:40,400
kind of thing, which is like I guess

2338
01:24:38,399 --> 01:24:42,000
it's a you know, in the old days like

2339
01:24:40,399 --> 01:24:43,519
etiquette was everything and you know,

2340
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,679
people sort of stepped out of line like

2341
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:47,120
you know, people got blacklisted or like

2342
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:49,279
you know, kicked off the what, you know,

2343
01:24:47,119 --> 01:24:52,559
kind of thing differently than now.

2344
01:24:49,279 --> 01:24:54,800
Um, you know, you know, it almost seems

2345
01:24:52,560 --> 01:25:00,159
like a bunch of what you're saying boils

2346
01:24:54,800 --> 01:25:04,159
down to education. Um, where, um, as

2347
01:25:00,158 --> 01:25:05,920
producers, you need to educate the, uh,

2348
01:25:04,158 --> 01:25:07,759
your marketing team. They need to

2349
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:10,880
educate the buyers and the buyers need

2350
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:12,960
to educate the consumers. And that needs

2351
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:15,840
to be there needs to be some continuity

2352
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:19,119
there in education so that you aren't

2353
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:20,719
facing people that have um like as a as

2354
01:25:19,119 --> 01:25:23,399
a consultant you're not going into a

2355
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:26,639
situation where you're facing these

2356
01:25:23,399 --> 01:25:28,799
undesirable expectations where it's not

2357
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:31,400
necessarily unrealistic in certain

2358
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:35,119
aspects but it's

2359
01:25:31,399 --> 01:25:36,879
not it's not feasible within what they

2360
01:25:35,119 --> 01:25:38,238
have available to them to work with

2361
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:40,639
which is something that keeps coming up

2362
01:25:38,238 --> 01:25:42,959
in this conversation. Right? Like how

2363
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:45,840
often it is that you see people

2364
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:48,319
expecting something that they can't uh

2365
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:51,199
they can't execute on or they don't have

2366
01:25:48,319 --> 01:25:54,079
the team or the resources to execute on.

2367
01:25:51,198 --> 01:25:57,599
But then working with that expectation

2368
01:25:54,079 --> 01:25:59,840
as though it's going to happen and you

2369
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:02,159
know watching the sort of bricks crumble

2370
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:04,960
around those expectations as it doesn't

2371
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:07,279
come to fruition and the frustration and

2372
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:08,880
the anger and the blaming and the ego

2373
01:26:07,279 --> 01:26:12,238
clashing and all these different things

2374
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:15,600
that come up from just miscommunication

2375
01:26:12,238 --> 01:26:18,079
or an uneducated person. Um, and not

2376
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:20,239
necessar I'm I'm using uneducated simply

2377
01:26:18,079 --> 01:26:21,920
because like there's parts of this

2378
01:26:20,238 --> 01:26:24,399
community and this and the culture

2379
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:26,158
around cannabis that I feel like when

2380
01:26:24,399 --> 01:26:27,599
you're growing the plant, you have this

2381
01:26:26,158 --> 01:26:29,198
connection to it. When you're consuming

2382
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:31,280
the plant, you have this connection to

2383
01:26:29,198 --> 01:26:33,599
it. And everything in between is kind of

2384
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:35,279
not it's not necessary in a lot of

2385
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:39,320
aspects. And so when there's whole

2386
01:26:35,279 --> 01:26:41,840
industries built around that unnecessary

2387
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:45,198
part, you lose a lot to this

2388
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:47,279
capitalistic uh suck hole, right? Where

2389
01:26:45,198 --> 01:26:49,359
it's it's it's unfortunate because it's

2390
01:26:47,279 --> 01:26:51,599
how we are able to get the product to

2391
01:26:49,359 --> 01:26:55,119
the consumers because of all the

2392
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:59,360
different regulations and you know the

2393
01:26:55,119 --> 01:27:01,519
actual uh logistics of it. Um, but there

2394
01:26:59,359 --> 01:27:03,679
is this huge disconnect then between

2395
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:05,760
what people are saying, I want this in

2396
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:09,920
my joint versus what the grower is going

2397
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:12,880
like, I can't grow a 14-week sativa and

2398
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:15,920
get it to you in a $10 joint. There's no

2399
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:18,719
way I can do that. No one in their right

2400
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:21,158
mind is going to grow that. And so when

2401
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:24,480
the sales team is saying, "We need

2402
01:27:21,158 --> 01:27:25,759
sativas. I need I need a 14week sativa."

2403
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:27,359
That's what people ask. Bro, I've had

2404
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:29,280
that conversation three times in the

2405
01:27:27,359 --> 01:27:31,759
last two weeks kind of thing. You know,

2406
01:27:29,279 --> 01:27:34,158
it's it's it's unfortunate, but like

2407
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:36,639
it's almost hilarious how uneducated it

2408
01:27:34,158 --> 01:27:38,559
is because it's something as simple as

2409
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:41,600
the disconnect of you're saying you want

2410
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:44,080
a 14week sativa. Do you you're doubling

2411
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:46,560
our input cost and our overhead to

2412
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:49,039
produce that single gram. Let's just

2413
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:50,239
talk about it as a gram, right? 100%

2414
01:27:49,039 --> 01:27:51,679
correct what you're saying. How are we

2415
01:27:50,238 --> 01:27:53,039
going to do that? Tell me how we're

2416
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:54,719
going to do that and tell me how it's

2417
01:27:53,039 --> 01:27:56,800
going to maintain profitability because

2418
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:59,279
you're getting enough ask for it, right?

2419
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:01,039
But yeah, so

2420
01:27:59,279 --> 01:28:03,599
Oh, it's it's frustrating. I've been

2421
01:28:01,039 --> 01:28:05,840
there and I've, you know, you know, like

2422
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:07,440
plants. We've done like grower events,

2423
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:09,520
you know, you go to the dispensaries so

2424
01:28:07,439 --> 01:28:11,519
you could customers can come ask you

2425
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:13,360
questions and, you know, and you sort of

2426
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,320
put out like blogs and newsletters and

2427
01:28:13,359 --> 01:28:15,519
stuff like that, you know, and again,

2428
01:28:14,319 --> 01:28:17,599
it's I just feel like it's one of those

2429
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:19,040
things of and I'm we're not the only

2430
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,480
ones that talk about it obviously like

2431
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:23,679
everybody talks about like sort of that

2432
01:28:20,479 --> 01:28:25,359
consumer education plans and all that

2433
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:26,960
kind of stuff. And it's just one of the

2434
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:29,519
harder parts and like you know sometimes

2435
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:31,600
deal with like you know sort of I don't

2436
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:34,000
know like was at a grow the other day

2437
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:36,320
and like you know sort of they had their

2438
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,520
wish lists and thoughts and like you

2439
01:28:36,319 --> 01:28:40,158
know we're trying to push stuff on you

2440
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:41,600
and you're kind of like like bro I've

2441
01:28:40,158 --> 01:28:43,839
had bigger bedrooms than your whole

2442
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:45,360
facility like you know kind of thing

2443
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:47,679
like you've never worked in a garden

2444
01:28:45,359 --> 01:28:50,880
like what you're telling me we need to

2445
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:53,520
do or asking us to try to help you do is

2446
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:55,039
just not real kind of thing. and like

2447
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:57,159
like I said, I've had bigger bedrooms

2448
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:59,639
than the whole facility kind of thing.

2449
01:28:57,158 --> 01:29:01,839
And just like

2450
01:28:59,639 --> 01:29:03,920
the stubbornness or whatever, you know,

2451
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:06,319
kind of thing to to try to like achieve

2452
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:08,239
these, you know, goals at the end is

2453
01:29:06,319 --> 01:29:10,238
really hard. And again, like the other

2454
01:29:08,238 --> 01:29:11,678
thing again, like I feel like, you know,

2455
01:29:10,238 --> 01:29:13,599
we were we mentioned earlier some of

2456
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:16,800
these smaller more craft growers, like I

2457
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:18,800
love those craft licenses. like if I

2458
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,760
could have my own that's what I would do

2459
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:23,520
you know like absolutely you know um

2460
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:26,239
because then it's like authentic it's

2461
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:28,239
real like it's owner operated you know

2462
01:29:26,238 --> 01:29:30,559
kind of thing um I think some of these

2463
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:32,000
facilities get in trouble you know maybe

2464
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:34,320
this is a part people don't want to talk

2465
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:37,679
about but you're like how much of these

2466
01:29:34,319 --> 01:29:39,519
big big facilities staffs um don't

2467
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:41,119
really make the company money they're

2468
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:43,280
there to fulfill roles because they're

2469
01:29:41,119 --> 01:29:46,238
such a big company and it needs it all

2470
01:29:43,279 --> 01:29:48,000
those salaries drain

2471
01:29:46,238 --> 01:29:49,519
you know kind of and make it really

2472
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,960
difficult for them to be profitable

2473
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:53,520
which then lead to cutting all the

2474
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:56,000
corners and you know that kind of stuff.

2475
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:58,239
So again like I don't know I just give

2476
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,238
me an opportunity for like you know

2477
01:29:58,238 --> 01:30:04,079
those crafts size facilities where it's

2478
01:30:00,238 --> 01:30:06,399
a team of you know four 10 maybe what

2479
01:30:04,079 --> 01:30:09,198
you know but those small crews together

2480
01:30:06,399 --> 01:30:11,279
and like some of the best uh product

2481
01:30:09,198 --> 01:30:13,198
I've seen here in Colorado you know from

2482
01:30:11,279 --> 01:30:16,719
like smaller grows you know their

2483
01:30:13,198 --> 01:30:18,319
stuff's pre-sold at a pound and it's

2484
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:20,399
like two growers and two trimmers and

2485
01:30:18,319 --> 01:30:21,359
that's it. These guys are about seven,

2486
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:23,119
you know, but they've all been there

2487
01:30:21,359 --> 01:30:25,679
seven guys in this facility, but they've

2488
01:30:23,119 --> 01:30:28,960
been together for four or five years and

2489
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:30,560
their work is killer. Like, I'd be

2490
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:32,399
excited to go buy it, you know, kind of

2491
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:35,120
thing. It's in the flow guys in Boulder.

2492
01:30:32,399 --> 01:30:37,599
Um, you know, kind of thing. Like, I

2493
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:39,359
don't know, but like that's what a team,

2494
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:41,440
you know, they pay their guys well.

2495
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:43,439
Their team is super loyal to them. They

2496
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:46,319
go perform and execute in the garden.

2497
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:48,960
like their product is killer, you know,

2498
01:30:46,319 --> 01:30:51,679
like that's the success successful like

2499
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:53,198
facilities and teams. I think um I

2500
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:55,199
agree.

2501
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:57,279
I see that all the time like you got to

2502
01:30:55,198 --> 01:30:59,919
have a happy staff in order to have a a

2503
01:30:57,279 --> 01:31:02,840
good product and uh unfortunately so

2504
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:06,800
many people are just trying to go for

2505
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:09,039
um like uneducated and uh and unskilled

2506
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:11,600
labor and then just trying to like bring

2507
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:13,760
them up in a certain way which can help.

2508
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:16,920
But also there's so many opportunities

2509
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:20,880
there for there to be

2510
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:22,639
um a mis a mist transfer of information

2511
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:24,960
where you can't then apply that

2512
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:27,039
knowledge elsewhere. And so you're like

2513
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:28,639
training them to do this specific task

2514
01:31:27,039 --> 01:31:30,880
and when you ask them to try and then

2515
01:31:28,639 --> 01:31:33,639
apply that knowledge in a different way,

2516
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:36,480
it doesn't always work. And

2517
01:31:33,639 --> 01:31:38,400
um it's it's tough because it is an

2518
01:31:36,479 --> 01:31:40,158
agricultural product and so I don't see

2519
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:41,519
the price ever going back up. And a lot

2520
01:31:40,158 --> 01:31:43,039
of people for a while there were saying,

2521
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:45,199
"Oh, we're waiting for the market to

2522
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:48,880
rebound. It's not going to happen.

2523
01:31:45,198 --> 01:31:51,039
There's there's no there's no reason for

2524
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:53,279
it to happen. There's only a reason for

2525
01:31:51,039 --> 01:31:55,359
the price to continue to go down." I

2526
01:31:53,279 --> 01:31:58,960
feel like, you know, my only back little

2527
01:31:55,359 --> 01:31:58,960
push back to that is I do think that

2528
01:31:59,479 --> 01:32:03,839
like people will be brand loyal to

2529
01:32:02,399 --> 01:32:05,119
somebody that has treat, you know, kind

2530
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,960
of thing. like some with some of these

2531
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:08,960
smaller ones like you know you'll always

2532
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:10,800
be able to get you'll always be able to

2533
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:12,239
be profitable with your work. you're

2534
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:14,560
good enough to hit, you know, grams per

2535
01:32:12,238 --> 01:32:15,678
square foot kind of thing. Um, and and

2536
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:17,120
dot dot dot, you know, all that stuff

2537
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:19,359
down the line. You know, maybe you're

2538
01:32:17,119 --> 01:32:20,479
not printing money like the old days

2539
01:32:19,359 --> 01:32:22,399
kind of thing, but like it is

2540
01:32:20,479 --> 01:32:23,399
profitable. You know, you can pay your

2541
01:32:22,399 --> 01:32:25,679
people,

2542
01:32:23,399 --> 01:32:28,000
right? You know, all of the correct

2543
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:30,560
inputs that you want without like

2544
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,600
skipping something. Um, so I don't know.

2545
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:33,440
I think that that's just kind of why

2546
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:35,880
it's like that balance point of that

2547
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:39,678
sort of craftsiz garden

2548
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:41,520
um is a very happy medium for um for

2549
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:44,239
sure. you know, to go hang out in kind

2550
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:45,600
of thing. It's safe. Yeah, absolutely.

2551
01:32:44,238 --> 01:32:47,678
I'm I'm sorry. I was kind of more

2552
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:48,880
referring to this uh constant race to

2553
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:52,560
the bottom that you see a lot of

2554
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:54,719
different operators. Yeah. And and so

2555
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:58,400
like by by racing to the bottom and and

2556
01:32:54,719 --> 01:33:01,679
by uh you know by showing that the value

2557
01:32:58,399 --> 01:33:03,839
of the product can be reduced, you're

2558
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:06,319
not going to then trick anybody by

2559
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:09,679
trying to raise the price of something

2560
01:33:06,319 --> 01:33:11,679
uh at the same quality point and saying

2561
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:14,960
this is worth more now when they were

2562
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:18,319
already paying, you know, yeah, a lower

2563
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:20,239
price for it. And when it comes to those

2564
01:33:18,319 --> 01:33:21,840
larger facilities and those larger

2565
01:33:20,238 --> 01:33:25,678
producers that are still producing

2566
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:27,199
quality at scale, th that's where I feel

2567
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:29,440
like it's it's a problem for the

2568
01:33:27,198 --> 01:33:31,519
overarching market because when you do

2569
01:33:29,439 --> 01:33:34,079
have small craft farms like you're

2570
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:37,360
talking about that are able to achieve

2571
01:33:34,079 --> 01:33:39,198
uh $1,600 price point per pound or even

2572
01:33:37,359 --> 01:33:41,359
some people that are breaking it up into

2573
01:33:39,198 --> 01:33:43,279
eighs or quarter ounces or ounces even

2574
01:33:41,359 --> 01:33:45,839
and selling those at a high price point

2575
01:33:43,279 --> 01:33:48,198
so that their overall pound price is,

2576
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:51,360
you know, significantly

2577
01:33:48,198 --> 01:33:53,759
more if there's there's only room for

2578
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:55,839
like extremely small boutique and highly

2579
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:57,679
sought after with limited supply

2580
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:59,199
cannabis to be able to achieve those

2581
01:33:57,679 --> 01:34:01,440
high price points. It's never going to

2582
01:33:59,198 --> 01:34:03,919
be for anything that's mass-produced.

2583
01:34:01,439 --> 01:34:05,198
Um, at least in my mind, that's what

2584
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:07,119
that's where I make that

2585
01:34:05,198 --> 01:34:08,719
differentiation. even working at like

2586
01:34:07,119 --> 01:34:10,238
way to grow like you know people would

2587
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:12,560
come in with receipts from three other

2588
01:34:10,238 --> 01:34:14,000
grow stores and be like they said they

2589
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:16,560
would sell it to me at that you know

2590
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,760
like so like every you know it's one of

2591
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:19,520
those things I feel like across the

2592
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:21,760
board everybody's getting beat up with

2593
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:24,600
that race to the bottom idea you know

2594
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:26,880
and right

2595
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:29,120
um yeah it's one of those things of like

2596
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:30,880
it just it beats everybody up like

2597
01:34:29,119 --> 01:34:32,719
across the board and it's hard to deal

2598
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:33,920
with but it does but yeah I'm with you I

2599
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:35,760
don't think it's certain things will

2600
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:38,079
never come back up you know certain

2601
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:41,360
things will be good because they're

2602
01:34:38,079 --> 01:34:43,039
they've earned it. Yep. Those guys with

2603
01:34:41,359 --> 01:34:44,799
eight lights that are still operating in

2604
01:34:43,039 --> 01:34:46,479
the gray market, they they're the ones

2605
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:48,560
that are making a killing right now. And

2606
01:34:46,479 --> 01:34:51,439
uh hats off to them. Let them keep doing

2607
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:54,480
it. I know. I miss those days,

2608
01:34:51,439 --> 01:34:56,960
right? It I'm envious. I'm envious, but

2609
01:34:54,479 --> 01:34:58,959
I I have uh other obligations. So,

2610
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:01,679
that's it's Yeah. Now we're all grown up

2611
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:03,679
and Yeah. kind of like Yeah. I'm not

2612
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:05,600
about to be running midnight runs with

2613
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:07,440
uh you know 20 pounds in the in the

2614
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:08,800
trunk. Yeah, it's one of those things of

2615
01:35:07,439 --> 01:35:10,319
like sometimes you joke about you know

2616
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:11,679
you're like waited for all these years.

2617
01:35:10,319 --> 01:35:12,880
You're like is my door getting kicked in

2618
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:15,679
tonight? Am I getting robbed or

2619
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:19,199
arrested? You know kind of thing. And um

2620
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:20,800
so I guess glad to sort of have moved on

2621
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:22,399
from some of that. But I guess at the

2622
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:25,119
same time some of the romance and the

2623
01:35:22,399 --> 01:35:27,119
sparkle of that was a whole lot of fun.

2624
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:29,279
Oh for sure. I mean aren't the the

2625
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:31,439
greatest like the greatest novels are

2626
01:35:29,279 --> 01:35:33,599
like tragedies? I feel like, you know,

2627
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:35,879
and so we don't want to live that

2628
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:39,280
tragedy though anymore.

2629
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:42,319
Um, let's see. What's um what are some

2630
01:35:39,279 --> 01:35:44,559
of the successes that you've uh

2631
01:35:42,319 --> 01:35:46,719
encountered when helping out a facility

2632
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:49,840
that are uh a highlight for you? And

2633
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:52,480
then also um if you don't mind sharing

2634
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:55,199
what might be a couple of or a failure

2635
01:35:52,479 --> 01:35:56,799
point in when trying to help implement

2636
01:35:55,198 --> 01:35:59,519
these different things at facilities

2637
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:01,039
where um through both the success and

2638
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:03,040
the failure you learn something

2639
01:36:01,039 --> 01:36:05,600
tremendous from it. Sure. So I guess

2640
01:36:03,039 --> 01:36:07,519
we'll start with the failure part kind

2641
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:09,120
of thing you know. Um I feel like

2642
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:11,440
sometime again it gets just back to like

2643
01:36:09,119 --> 01:36:13,760
communication education kind of stuff.

2644
01:36:11,439 --> 01:36:17,039
Um, and like Sarah said, like teaching

2645
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:19,039
teacher, um, you know, if you could just

2646
01:36:17,039 --> 01:36:21,119
imagine the class behaves differently

2647
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:23,198
when you have a substitute teacher than

2648
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:25,679
like the regular teacher, you know, so

2649
01:36:23,198 --> 01:36:27,839
when it comes to some of this stuff, um,

2650
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:29,359
if you're not tight with the cultivation

2651
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,960
team that's on the ground there, you

2652
01:36:29,359 --> 01:36:32,799
know, like sometimes you fly in for a

2653
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:34,319
week and then you're back in Colorado

2654
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:35,840
for a week or to a different site for

2655
01:36:34,319 --> 01:36:37,198
that week, you know, you sort of stagger

2656
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:40,079
back and forth and you still have your

2657
01:36:37,198 --> 01:36:41,119
sort of cultivation meetings and uh, you

2658
01:36:40,079 --> 01:36:42,719
know, like that kind of stuff, but like

2659
01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:45,920
you know when you're away if the staff

2660
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:48,239
isn't like backing you and sort of

2661
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:50,000
performing to

2662
01:36:48,238 --> 01:36:53,519
um you know what they were supposed to

2663
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:55,198
do that day you or even almost like a

2664
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:56,639
little malicious or like oh we're not

2665
01:36:55,198 --> 01:36:58,799
going to do that cuz he's not here this

2666
01:36:56,639 --> 01:37:00,880
week you know then it really turns into

2667
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:02,239
a battle of like us verse them you know

2668
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:04,079
and they have a whole staff on there

2669
01:37:02,238 --> 01:37:05,678
they all live there you know and I'm

2670
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:08,000
just a guy getting on a plane flying

2671
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:09,600
back and forth you know that's coming to

2672
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,920
tattle on them or whatever you know kind

2673
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:13,679
of thing so like that's like the hardest

2674
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:15,118
thing. Um, you know, and some of them

2675
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:18,079
have really hurt cuz like you get really

2676
01:37:15,118 --> 01:37:20,238
close with cultivation team, you know,

2677
01:37:18,079 --> 01:37:21,439
kind of thing. But then the owner

2678
01:37:20,238 --> 01:37:23,839
doesn't want to pay for something

2679
01:37:21,439 --> 01:37:25,359
anymore. Well, you know, kind of it just

2680
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:26,880
turns into a little bit of a battle of

2681
01:37:25,359 --> 01:37:30,238
like us versus them. So that's kind of

2682
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:32,239
just why at this point, you know,

2683
01:37:30,238 --> 01:37:33,759
uh now that we're like private and it's

2684
01:37:32,238 --> 01:37:35,359
just like sort of myself, Rich and

2685
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:37,600
Christian versus like this whole big

2686
01:37:35,359 --> 01:37:40,000
publicly traded company, it's easier for

2687
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:41,840
us to like sort of insert ourselves in

2688
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:44,719
as being like an owner's rep and being

2689
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:46,159
with them kind of thing versus, you

2690
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:48,560
know, sort of the bosses over here

2691
01:37:46,158 --> 01:37:50,238
trying to push revenue for whatever

2692
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:52,239
board in New York and stuff like that,

2693
01:37:50,238 --> 01:37:54,718
you know, kind of thing. So, you know,

2694
01:37:52,238 --> 01:37:56,479
it's like you get to, you know, one

2695
01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:58,079
sometimes I'll joke or complain like why

2696
01:37:56,479 --> 01:38:01,039
do I care about your garden more than

2697
01:37:58,079 --> 01:38:02,399
you do, you know? Um,

2698
01:38:01,039 --> 01:38:04,639
you know, like that's a tough

2699
01:38:02,399 --> 01:38:06,479
conversation to have. Yes. you know, so

2700
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:08,239
I feel like that's like that I don't say

2701
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:10,000
failure part, but it's like the uglier

2702
01:38:08,238 --> 01:38:12,399
part kind of thing, you know, because

2703
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,960
like as a consultant, you know, there's

2704
01:38:12,399 --> 01:38:16,238
lots of, you know, high fives, hugs, and

2705
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:18,319
partying, you know, when things are

2706
01:38:16,238 --> 01:38:19,519
working, but you know, things, you know,

2707
01:38:18,319 --> 01:38:21,359
there's the hiccups, lots of

2708
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:23,199
fingerpointing kind of thing, you know,

2709
01:38:21,359 --> 01:38:25,118
sort of. So, like, you know, when things

2710
01:38:23,198 --> 01:38:27,519
work, there's like almost say no praise,

2711
01:38:25,118 --> 01:38:28,799
but like, you know, everybody expects it

2712
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:31,440
to be that way, you know, and then stuff

2713
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:33,520
gets a little sideways and, you know,

2714
01:38:31,439 --> 01:38:34,960
fireworks kind of thing. So, Oh, for

2715
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:36,960
sure. Oh, I mean, no one brings it up

2716
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:39,359
when it's working, right? No one takes a

2717
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:41,118
a lawn mower into the the shop to get it

2718
01:38:39,359 --> 01:38:42,559
fixed because it's working. They they go

2719
01:38:41,118 --> 01:38:44,238
in because it's broken and it's not

2720
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:46,400
working. And when you're the one in

2721
01:38:44,238 --> 01:38:49,359
charge of the fixes, right? Like you're

2722
01:38:46,399 --> 01:38:50,879
you're the repair man for their grow. Um

2723
01:38:49,359 --> 01:38:52,880
they're looking at you for all the

2724
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:55,679
failure points, especially if any of it

2725
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:58,239
happens after you've already come on to

2726
01:38:55,679 --> 01:39:00,319
the team to help them execute on what

2727
01:38:58,238 --> 01:39:01,839
they're doing. A lot of it though, like

2728
01:39:00,319 --> 01:39:03,599
you're saying, especially with larger

2729
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:05,679
teams, and if that team doesn't feel

2730
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:07,520
connected to this style of growing and

2731
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:10,719
the direction that they're being given,

2732
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:13,840
then you start to run into um little

2733
01:39:10,719 --> 01:39:16,000
clashes that might not even be uh like

2734
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:19,520
you might not even see it as what it is

2735
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:21,520
that's uh generating this issue, but the

2736
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:24,480
outcome of that issue is still then

2737
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:25,960
affecting the grow in one way or the

2738
01:39:24,479 --> 01:39:28,799
other.

2739
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:31,600
And sometimes it's like you need to get

2740
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:34,159
on board or hop the [ __ ] off because

2741
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:36,159
this train is going and uh we're here to

2742
01:39:34,158 --> 01:39:38,319
make sure that it's going to continue to

2743
01:39:36,158 --> 01:39:40,158
go. And when Yeah. When you give

2744
01:39:38,319 --> 01:39:44,319
someone, you know, something simple like

2745
01:39:40,158 --> 01:39:48,238
let's say it's a IPM SOP and there's two

2746
01:39:44,319 --> 01:39:50,000
people that are ex Oh, it is. Oh, it is.

2747
01:39:48,238 --> 01:39:52,399
And when you have people that are you

2748
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:54,479
you say, "This is what you do these days

2749
01:39:52,399 --> 01:39:57,118
of the week. You do it every single week

2750
01:39:54,479 --> 01:39:58,559
and you do not fail to do it." And then

2751
01:39:57,118 --> 01:40:00,719
you come in and they say, "I've been

2752
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:02,159
doing it." And you go in and you're

2753
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:04,560
like, "There's [ __ ] russet

2754
01:40:02,158 --> 01:40:07,118
mites on these plants." If you were

2755
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:09,360
doing it, you know, like these right

2756
01:40:07,118 --> 01:40:11,439
here. Yeah. Sulfur and oil and sulfur

2757
01:40:09,359 --> 01:40:12,559
and oil don't mix. And so you're like,

2758
01:40:11,439 --> 01:40:13,519
you're like, you come in and they're

2759
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:14,320
like, "Well, I sprayed, you know,

2760
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:15,679
they're like, I don't know what

2761
01:40:14,319 --> 01:40:18,679
happened." And you're like, bro, that

2762
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:21,679
phototoxicity from that, you know,

2763
01:40:18,679 --> 01:40:24,239
application, every le leaf in this room

2764
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:27,199
is burned up. Like there's nothing left.

2765
01:40:24,238 --> 01:40:30,000
Sprayed suffoil on Monday and and sulfur

2766
01:40:27,198 --> 01:40:31,359
on Tuesday. Oh,

2767
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,800
I wonder why it looks like, you know,

2768
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:36,960
like so there's that. Um, you know, kind

2769
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:39,600
of thing. Um, I guess along those same

2770
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:41,198
lines though, like the sort of the most

2771
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:42,159
like rewarding part, you know, like I

2772
01:40:41,198 --> 01:40:43,599
feel like I've been asked this question

2773
01:40:42,158 --> 01:40:45,359
a handful of times and like the answer

2774
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:46,719
has evolved a little bit, but like you

2775
01:40:45,359 --> 01:40:49,599
know, when you're working in a garden

2776
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:51,439
where like everything's jamming, like

2777
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:53,760
all the plants look good, people are in

2778
01:40:51,439 --> 01:40:56,319
a good mood, like music's bumping in

2779
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:59,600
every growroom kind of thing, like that

2780
01:40:56,319 --> 01:41:01,519
vibe is like intoxicating kind of thing.

2781
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:02,880
So like that's contagious. Totally. you

2782
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:05,199
know, so like there's that, but like

2783
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:07,118
along the lines of that, like some I

2784
01:41:05,198 --> 01:41:09,678
feel like my like greatest success

2785
01:41:07,118 --> 01:41:11,439
story, you know, home girls, you got

2786
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:13,039
your first harvest at a new spot. And

2787
01:41:11,439 --> 01:41:14,638
they're like, "Does anybody have any

2788
01:41:13,039 --> 01:41:16,319
friends that can come in and help

2789
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:18,719
harvest or whatever, you know?" So the

2790
01:41:16,319 --> 01:41:20,880
one girl uh brought her boyfriend in,

2791
01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:23,118
like no job, no whatever, never touched

2792
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:24,880
a cannabis plant before, you know. But

2793
01:41:23,118 --> 01:41:26,559
on day one of harvesting, like, you

2794
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:29,440
know, his hands were moving faster than

2795
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:30,960
anybody else's. So like hired him on and

2796
01:41:29,439 --> 01:41:32,960
then he was working just in the you know

2797
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:34,719
the harvest and like the trim team and

2798
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:37,760
then so I moved him up to like the sort

2799
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:39,039
of processing space. Um, and then next

2800
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:41,760
thing you know, I brought him outside

2801
01:41:39,039 --> 01:41:43,840
with me to run the outdoor. And you know

2802
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:46,320
within a year he went from being some

2803
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:49,039
you know one of the girls boyfriends

2804
01:41:46,319 --> 01:41:50,880
that came in for like temp work to

2805
01:41:49,039 --> 01:41:52,800
running the whole facility you know and

2806
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:54,239
it was like you know kind of thing where

2807
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:55,760
like when you get to like sort of like

2808
01:41:54,238 --> 01:41:57,519
said maybe what I run a you know

2809
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:59,600
teaching background but like you know

2810
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:01,320
you find like the younger version of you

2811
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:04,480
know yourself or just somebody super

2812
01:42:01,319 --> 01:42:06,079
like in it for the plant kind of thing

2813
01:42:04,479 --> 01:42:08,479
and you get to like sort of bring them

2814
01:42:06,079 --> 01:42:11,039
up like that's [ __ ] rad you know kind

2815
01:42:08,479 --> 01:42:12,799
of thing cuz like I don't know This this

2816
01:42:11,039 --> 01:42:14,319
analogy might be distasteful, but

2817
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:16,800
sometimes you need them to drink the

2818
01:42:14,319 --> 01:42:19,599
Kool-Aid. Like you need them to be like

2819
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:21,360
on board with the process and not um

2820
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,960
hey, you know, I read somewhere over

2821
01:42:21,359 --> 01:42:25,039
here that this might work. Do you think

2822
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:26,480
we should try? It's like, yeah, maybe in

2823
01:42:25,039 --> 01:42:28,158
a couple years when you have everything

2824
01:42:26,479 --> 01:42:29,759
that's already here down and it's

2825
01:42:28,158 --> 01:42:31,519
operating properly and then we can start

2826
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:33,199
to play and have fun. But even with that

2827
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:34,400
though, they're reading on their own.

2828
01:42:33,198 --> 01:42:36,319
They're doing what you know, kind of

2829
01:42:34,399 --> 01:42:37,198
thing. You're like, it does. Yeah. You

2830
01:42:36,319 --> 01:42:38,880
know, kind of thing. You're like, I'll

2831
01:42:37,198 --> 01:42:40,559
give you the books. Here's the websites.

2832
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:43,118
Listen. Yeah. So, it's like when

2833
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:44,480
somebody does like go to do homework

2834
01:42:43,118 --> 01:42:46,079
after, you know, you just worked eight

2835
01:42:44,479 --> 01:42:48,559
or 10 hours or however long in the

2836
01:42:46,079 --> 01:42:50,238
fields 100 degrees in Oklahoma, you're

2837
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:52,639
still going home and reading about

2838
01:42:50,238 --> 01:42:54,959
cultivation methodologies to come in and

2839
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:56,400
ask me more questions. Like, yep. I'll

2840
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:57,920
take you to lunch every day. Like, let's

2841
01:42:56,399 --> 01:42:59,679
do it, you know, kind of thing. Yeah,

2842
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:01,359
absolutely. You know, so like when you

2843
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:02,639
find those, you know, at the same time,

2844
01:43:01,359 --> 01:43:04,000
like I said, the rewarding part is like

2845
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:05,520
when you find those, you know, you can

2846
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,039
sort of build those relationships and

2847
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:09,199
those teams and like you see somebody's

2848
01:43:07,039 --> 01:43:11,039
life change because of the plant and

2849
01:43:09,198 --> 01:43:12,960
learn in the same way as you did, like

2850
01:43:11,039 --> 01:43:14,880
it's [ __ ] cool, you know, and like

2851
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:17,520
Oh, absolutely. You know, one thing that

2852
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:21,359
I like to Oh, sorry. One thing that I

2853
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:22,960
like to do with people is is um you know

2854
01:43:21,359 --> 01:43:24,719
if they have an idea for something that

2855
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:26,480
they want to implement in the grow I'll

2856
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:28,639
say listen I want you to tell me why we

2857
01:43:26,479 --> 01:43:30,000
do the things that we are doing now and

2858
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:31,760
when you can tell me why we're doing

2859
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,600
those things then I want you to tell me

2860
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:35,679
why we should implement this other thing

2861
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:37,360
and if it works and if it makes sense

2862
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:39,279
and you understand how it's going to

2863
01:43:37,359 --> 01:43:41,279
interface with these other processes

2864
01:43:39,279 --> 01:43:43,198
then let's give it a try. let's let's go

2865
01:43:41,279 --> 01:43:45,359
cuz it you know if it's something I

2866
01:43:43,198 --> 01:43:46,719
didn't think of I never be the smartest

2867
01:43:45,359 --> 01:43:48,559
person in the room right you don't want

2868
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:50,800
to be there and try to be like I know

2869
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:53,600
everything and I am the allseeing eye

2870
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:54,800
you know it's it doesn't work yeah say

2871
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:56,719
so like I encourage it's one of those

2872
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:58,400
things you're like you sort of present

2873
01:43:56,719 --> 01:44:00,000
the idea discuss it whatever you know

2874
01:43:58,399 --> 01:44:01,118
like is it can we do this in a

2875
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,359
controlled setting where we're going to

2876
01:44:01,118 --> 01:44:05,359
get to actually see a result like so I

2877
01:44:03,359 --> 01:44:08,479
don't know like it is really fun and

2878
01:44:05,359 --> 01:44:10,158
super rewarding to and I guess like one

2879
01:44:08,479 --> 01:44:11,519
of my other favorite parts of it I guess

2880
01:44:10,158 --> 01:44:13,359
is like, you know, you've done this

2881
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:15,760
forever long and like lots of people

2882
01:44:13,359 --> 01:44:17,118
that have done it like we have. You

2883
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:19,600
know, you can walk in somewhere and

2884
01:44:17,118 --> 01:44:21,519
you're like, takes five minutes to put

2885
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:23,679
together that like lowhanging fruit list

2886
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:24,800
of ways that we could improve this.

2887
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:25,920
You're like, ding, ding, ding. You know,

2888
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:27,840
like you're already, all right, we're

2889
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:30,960
already done. Like, we just stepped this

2890
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:33,119
up. Yeah. In whatever sort of I guess

2891
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:34,639
grading scale that we are, but like I

2892
01:44:33,118 --> 01:44:36,559
don't know. Like I love the creative

2893
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:38,000
problem solving part of it, you know,

2894
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:40,000
and then when like the light bulbs go

2895
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:43,439
off with them and you actually get to

2896
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:46,479
see those improvements like quickly. Um

2897
01:44:43,439 --> 01:44:48,359
I don't know like for sure again it's

2898
01:44:46,479 --> 01:44:50,718
like you know at this

2899
01:44:48,359 --> 01:44:53,439
point there's no secret sauce, there's

2900
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:55,279
no whatever. It's basically how

2901
01:44:53,439 --> 01:44:58,079
controlled of like an understanding do

2902
01:44:55,279 --> 01:45:01,198
you have across like all of the aspects

2903
01:44:58,079 --> 01:45:02,158
to balance it out?

2904
01:45:01,198 --> 01:45:03,519
Yeah. Yeah. I feel like one of the

2905
01:45:02,158 --> 01:45:05,920
things I've seen someone that I've

2906
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:07,840
worked with do that I was just like,

2907
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:11,840
"You get it? You're starting to get it

2908
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:14,639
is uh when they uh started to understand

2909
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:16,319
why the EC would increase in the

2910
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:18,960
substrate, I I tried to have them

2911
01:45:16,319 --> 01:45:21,719
problem solve it by giving them the idea

2912
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:24,639
of saying, "Make a salt solution in

2913
01:45:21,719 --> 01:45:26,880
water. Keep one in a cup, like a full

2914
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:28,239
cup, and then keep one in a half a cup.

2915
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:30,159
How much salt's going to be left when

2916
01:45:28,238 --> 01:45:32,479
that water evaporates?" and watch them

2917
01:45:30,158 --> 01:45:34,879
problem solve that out and then go the

2918
01:45:32,479 --> 01:45:36,959
the substrate's the cup and what we're

2919
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:39,279
putting into it is the salt solution and

2920
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:41,118
what's coming out is when you're uh

2921
01:45:39,279 --> 01:45:42,639
you're adding more water to that salt

2922
01:45:41,118 --> 01:45:44,399
solution but still maintaining the

2923
01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:46,159
volume and I I'll go through this like

2924
01:45:44,399 --> 01:45:48,158
process with them to try and have them

2925
01:45:46,158 --> 01:45:51,118
just relate it to table salt in water

2926
01:45:48,158 --> 01:45:53,359
and in a cup and it um it usually works

2927
01:45:51,118 --> 01:45:55,759
pretty well to get them to go oh my gosh

2928
01:45:53,359 --> 01:45:57,359
I see that if I'm I'm allowing it to dry

2929
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:59,039
back too much and I'm not pushing that

2930
01:45:57,359 --> 01:46:00,719
extra salt off it's just going to keep

2931
01:45:59,039 --> 01:46:02,399
building and I don't want it to go too

2932
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:03,760
high. But you say I do want it to go a

2933
01:46:02,399 --> 01:46:05,359
little high and you start to go, "Yep,

2934
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:07,520
just just keep an eye on it. Keep

2935
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:09,198
monitoring it." And it you see some

2936
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:12,360
tremendous results. I have I have a

2937
01:46:09,198 --> 01:46:14,919
buddy right now who is he swapped over

2938
01:46:12,359 --> 01:46:18,880
from, you know, this uh

2939
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:20,639
multi-part um uh semi-organic,

2940
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:23,520
semi-organic

2941
01:46:20,639 --> 01:46:26,719
uh large pot system to where I'm like

2942
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:28,880
just I want you to do one gallon cocoa.

2943
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:31,039
I want you to do drain to waste and

2944
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:32,560
we're going to up your EC slowly. And

2945
01:46:31,039 --> 01:46:34,639
he's

2946
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:36,480
um amazed by how fast the plants are

2947
01:46:34,639 --> 01:46:38,480
growing. And I'm like this is it's fun

2948
01:46:36,479 --> 01:46:40,638
to watch, isn't it? That's what like

2949
01:46:38,479 --> 01:46:42,959
said like give me can of cocoa flex

2950
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:45,319
pots, the one gallons, your cocoa A and

2951
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:47,760
B nutrient with a little bit of a

2952
01:46:45,319 --> 01:46:49,118
drip and like you know put somebody on

2953
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:50,880
with that and you're like yo if you can

2954
01:46:49,118 --> 01:46:52,880
do this then you can get it creative and

2955
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:54,960
do whatever you want later kind of

2956
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:56,400
thing. But like it really is that

2957
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:57,840
simple.

2958
01:46:56,399 --> 01:47:00,879
to knock it out of the park kind of

2959
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:03,199
thing. And uh definitely I don't know.

2960
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:04,880
But yeah, like you like explain it like

2961
01:47:03,198 --> 01:47:06,960
you're talking to a second grader. You

2962
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:08,880
if everybody can understand that kind of

2963
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:10,719
level then like that's true

2964
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:13,279
comprehension and we can move forward.

2965
01:47:10,719 --> 01:47:16,399
No. Don't need to absolutely ever try to

2966
01:47:13,279 --> 01:47:18,719
be too smart. Yeah. And and you know

2967
01:47:16,399 --> 01:47:20,638
such a huge part of education is uh the

2968
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:24,079
continual education of the people who

2969
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:25,760
are teaching, right? And so by teaching

2970
01:47:24,079 --> 01:47:27,840
other people, I feel like it's always

2971
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:30,320
been the best way for me to hone my own

2972
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:32,079
knowledge of a of a subject because if I

2973
01:47:30,319 --> 01:47:34,399
can teach it, then I have a better grasp

2974
01:47:32,079 --> 01:47:37,319
on it. And if I can teach it to people

2975
01:47:34,399 --> 01:47:40,238
across a multitude of, um, learning

2976
01:47:37,319 --> 01:47:43,439
preferences, then I can know it even

2977
01:47:40,238 --> 01:47:45,039
better, right? And so, um, that's why I

2978
01:47:43,439 --> 01:47:47,039
love doing this podcast and talking to

2979
01:47:45,039 --> 01:47:49,000
all different people and and, you know,

2980
01:47:47,039 --> 01:47:52,960
honing my own skill through these

2981
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:54,960
conversations. Um, and with like even

2982
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:56,560
trading stories though, you know, like

2983
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:58,960
this worked for me, you know, and like

2984
01:47:56,560 --> 01:48:00,960
along those same lines like I don't know

2985
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:02,880
sometimes I really wish I had my my

2986
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:04,480
garden that's my like showpiece,

2987
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:06,480
masterpiece, whatever, you know, kind of

2988
01:48:04,479 --> 01:48:08,399
thing. Um, you know, sometimes I

2989
01:48:06,479 --> 01:48:12,079
certainly really wish I had that right

2990
01:48:08,399 --> 01:48:14,000
now. it kind of but other times like I'm

2991
01:48:12,079 --> 01:48:16,439
talking to a different you know half

2992
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:19,039
dozen to a dozen different gardens

2993
01:48:16,439 --> 01:48:21,359
that you know you're sort of like

2994
01:48:19,039 --> 01:48:23,439
invested and involved in all at the same

2995
01:48:21,359 --> 01:48:25,519
time. So like if you're trying to sort

2996
01:48:23,439 --> 01:48:27,759
of make whatever one correction here and

2997
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:29,760
there and whatever I'm waiting six days

2998
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:31,440
or 10 days before I imp implement

2999
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:34,000
certain things you know versus waiting

3000
01:48:31,439 --> 01:48:36,000
two months. So you're able to like with

3001
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,719
that process of deduction and like hone

3002
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:41,439
in on whatever like you're trying to

3003
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:43,319
achieve and uh you know sort of get to

3004
01:48:41,439 --> 01:48:46,079
that result so much faster

3005
01:48:43,319 --> 01:48:47,599
by having your hands in you know so many

3006
01:48:46,079 --> 01:48:49,039
friends gardens or whatever you know

3007
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:51,760
that kind of stuff. So it's just like

3008
01:48:49,039 --> 01:48:54,639
for sure I don't know again simple

3009
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:55,920
control like reflect on it but like you

3010
01:48:54,639 --> 01:48:57,520
know one of the other things I feel like

3011
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:59,199
you know along the same lines we're

3012
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:01,520
talking about you know when it comes to

3013
01:48:59,198 --> 01:49:03,839
success and failure stuff sometimes it's

3014
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:05,800
like fail faster like this person

3015
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:08,079
doesn't fit this

3016
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:10,800
role move on to the next deserving

3017
01:49:08,079 --> 01:49:12,559
person or like you know this application

3018
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:14,159
of whatever you know we're trying to

3019
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:16,560
manipulate the plant with like doesn't

3020
01:49:14,158 --> 01:49:19,719
fit like don't keep forcing it. It's

3021
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:21,840
not. Yeah, it didn't work three times

3022
01:49:19,719 --> 01:49:23,679
already. You know, you hoping it's going

3023
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:26,000
to work the fourth time like isn't going

3024
01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:28,239
to make it happen. Like move on. That is

3025
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,920
the definition of insanity, sir. Yeah.

3026
01:49:28,238 --> 01:49:31,919
Yeah. Yeah. So, like just that idea is

3027
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:36,079
like fail faster, you know, again,

3028
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:38,079
reflect and get back at it. Absolutely.

3029
01:49:36,079 --> 01:49:38,920
I you know and I feel like with both of

3030
01:49:38,079 --> 01:49:41,679
our

3031
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:45,118
um I feel like we we both have sort of

3032
01:49:41,679 --> 01:49:46,880
this uh passion and and uh focal point

3033
01:49:45,118 --> 01:49:48,719
of education in a lot of what we're

3034
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:49,840
doing like me with the podcast you with

3035
01:49:48,719 --> 01:49:51,920
what you're doing through your

3036
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:54,480
consulting services with next big crop

3037
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:56,239
and even in your past with you know

3038
01:49:54,479 --> 01:49:58,559
helping educate people and even learning

3039
01:49:56,238 --> 01:50:01,198
from your interactions with people at

3040
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:03,039
the grow shop and and um at all the

3041
01:50:01,198 --> 01:50:05,198
different aspects of the grow world that

3042
01:50:03,039 --> 01:50:05,920
you've uh encountered through your

3043
01:50:05,198 --> 01:50:08,000
career.

3044
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:11,440
So, I feel like you'll be a great person

3045
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:13,920
to ask this question to. Um, and I want

3046
01:50:11,439 --> 01:50:18,000
to break it up into two parts. So, the

3047
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:20,158
question is, what uh advice would you

3048
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:22,000
give to new growers? What's that one

3049
01:50:20,158 --> 01:50:24,719
piece of golden advice you'd give to new

3050
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:27,198
growers? And I want it to be for someone

3051
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:29,760
who is homegrowing for their medicine as

3052
01:50:27,198 --> 01:50:32,399
part one. And for someone who is trying

3053
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:36,400
to enter the cannabis industry as part

3054
01:50:32,399 --> 01:50:39,039
two. Sure. So part one

3055
01:50:36,399 --> 01:50:40,719
um for home grower for like medicine and

3056
01:50:39,039 --> 01:50:42,960
passion projects and just like the craft

3057
01:50:40,719 --> 01:50:45,679
and like the love of it you know like

3058
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:47,760
these days like I guess it's people like

3059
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:51,039
you with these podcasts you know that

3060
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:53,039
are such an open book of information um

3061
01:50:51,039 --> 01:50:55,118
all the YouTube channels all just the

3062
01:50:53,039 --> 01:50:58,319
reading that is out there kind of things

3063
01:50:55,118 --> 01:51:00,158
like do your homework um and sort of uh

3064
01:50:58,319 --> 01:51:01,439
you know again you know also at this

3065
01:51:00,158 --> 01:51:03,198
point you probably have a friend

3066
01:51:01,439 --> 01:51:06,960
somewhere whether it's in your state or

3067
01:51:03,198 --> 01:51:08,960
town or across the country somewhere um

3068
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:10,639
that is like totally invested in like

3069
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:14,239
this is their life and like lifestyle

3070
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:17,440
and career. It's to sort of like pick

3071
01:51:14,238 --> 01:51:19,799
pick a team essentially that you want to

3072
01:51:17,439 --> 01:51:22,559
sort of join like a philosophy a

3073
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:24,560
methodology and sort of like follow that

3074
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:27,119
you know do your research so that you

3075
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:29,440
like pick the correct team kind of thing

3076
01:51:27,118 --> 01:51:31,599
but then really follow that plan that

3077
01:51:29,439 --> 01:51:32,879
those people give you or that you like

3078
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:34,800
you know put together yourself kind of

3079
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:36,880
thing until it's sort of a little bit

3080
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:38,960
exhausted or like you're ready for the

3081
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:42,000
next one you know and again like you

3082
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:44,239
don't need all the fanciest everything,

3083
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:47,198
you know, like you don't need that much

3084
01:51:44,238 --> 01:51:49,439
space, but like you do need a plan kind

3085
01:51:47,198 --> 01:51:51,319
of thing. So, like really do your

3086
01:51:49,439 --> 01:51:54,238
homework and put together a

3087
01:51:51,319 --> 01:51:56,479
plan and then go execute it kind of

3088
01:51:54,238 --> 01:51:57,678
thing. Um, don't shoot from the hip, you

3089
01:51:56,479 --> 01:52:01,439
know? So, it's like that's what I would

3090
01:51:57,679 --> 01:52:04,960
say for the home grower is the most

3091
01:52:01,439 --> 01:52:08,319
and just like de make a plan and then

3092
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:10,880
follow it and your next round is going

3093
01:52:08,319 --> 01:52:13,158
to be different than your first one. Um,

3094
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:16,480
but like you sort of need to make those

3095
01:52:13,158 --> 01:52:18,638
mistakes. Push it too hard underwater.

3096
01:52:16,479 --> 01:52:21,039
What you know, it got too hot, it got

3097
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:23,679
too cold, what, you know, like the only

3098
01:52:21,039 --> 01:52:26,560
way to sort of find that

3099
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:29,359
uh sort of happy medium across the board

3100
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:30,880
is to push it too hard to go under, you

3101
01:52:29,359 --> 01:52:32,000
know, one of my buddies and I talk about

3102
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:33,760
you're like, "How long does it take you

3103
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,520
to figure out a strain?" You know, and

3104
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:37,199
the answer is maybe four runs, maybe

3105
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:39,040
five runs. You know, first one's sort of

3106
01:52:37,198 --> 01:52:40,879
shooting in the dark. The second one,

3107
01:52:39,039 --> 01:52:43,198
you probably push it too hard. The third

3108
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:45,039
one, you probably back it down too much.

3109
01:52:43,198 --> 01:52:46,399
Fourth one, ideally, you know, you're

3110
01:52:45,039 --> 01:52:47,840
right in that butter zone and like

3111
01:52:46,399 --> 01:52:50,158
really hit it. But if not, the fifth

3112
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:51,440
one, you should totally be able to. Um,

3113
01:52:50,158 --> 01:52:52,799
yeah. So, maybe a home grower should

3114
01:52:51,439 --> 01:52:55,279
almost think of it like that way kind of

3115
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:56,119
thing. Like it'll take you four rounds

3116
01:52:55,279 --> 01:52:58,238
to

3117
01:52:56,118 --> 01:52:59,839
hopefully be comfortable and happy with

3118
01:52:58,238 --> 01:53:01,039
what you did, you know, because you're

3119
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:02,560
going to learn a whole lot in those

3120
01:53:01,039 --> 01:53:04,399
first four.

3121
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:06,800
And I feel like that's uh that's

3122
01:53:04,399 --> 01:53:08,960
applicable to not only a a specific

3123
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:11,440
genetic, but any sort of style of

3124
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:14,399
growing and then any adjustment to that

3125
01:53:11,439 --> 01:53:16,079
style of growing. And um you know once

3126
01:53:14,399 --> 01:53:18,479
you start to learn about the different

3127
01:53:16,079 --> 01:53:20,000
aspects of growing more, you definitely

3128
01:53:18,479 --> 01:53:22,479
have the ability to make those

3129
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:24,800
adjustments on the fly as well as make

3130
01:53:22,479 --> 01:53:27,519
more adjustments at once rather than

3131
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:29,840
only tweak one or two things in order to

3132
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:34,400
make sure that you're tracking what

3133
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:36,239
those changes do to your grow. Um, so I

3134
01:53:34,399 --> 01:53:38,319
I think that that's great advice for

3135
01:53:36,238 --> 01:53:40,000
people and it it falls in line with a

3136
01:53:38,319 --> 01:53:42,079
lot of what other people have said to

3137
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,760
that answer or to answer that question,

3138
01:53:42,079 --> 01:53:45,439
which is patience. You know, have

3139
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:48,079
patience with yourself, have patience

3140
01:53:45,439 --> 01:53:50,719
with the growth style, trust the process

3141
01:53:48,079 --> 01:53:52,639
that you put um in place and if it

3142
01:53:50,719 --> 01:53:54,158
doesn't work, that's where you get to

3143
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:55,520
start to be your puzzler and you start

3144
01:53:54,158 --> 01:53:56,960
to get to try and figure out why it

3145
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:59,840
didn't work and make an adjustment from

3146
01:53:56,960 --> 01:54:00,960
there. Um, so I think that's great. One

3147
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:03,599
of the things just yeah you I guess it's

3148
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:06,079
the other one too but like I think one

3149
01:54:03,599 --> 01:54:08,480
thing that I realized you know through

3150
01:54:06,079 --> 01:54:11,039
gardening um you know I don't think I

3151
01:54:08,479 --> 01:54:12,638
was ever very patient before of a person

3152
01:54:11,039 --> 01:54:15,599
but like through gardening you realize

3153
01:54:12,639 --> 01:54:18,319
that like you can't fake time like it

3154
01:54:15,599 --> 01:54:21,119
takes twoish weeks to clone a plant. It

3155
01:54:18,319 --> 01:54:23,118
t you know like like you know you can't

3156
01:54:21,118 --> 01:54:25,279
fake time kind of thing. And you also

3157
01:54:23,118 --> 01:54:27,598
can't fake how much time you invest into

3158
01:54:25,279 --> 01:54:29,679
your project. you know, the guy that or

3159
01:54:27,599 --> 01:54:32,239
the person that puts in 20 minutes a day

3160
01:54:29,679 --> 01:54:34,158
versus the person that's put in an hour

3161
01:54:32,238 --> 01:54:37,039
in a day or whatever, you know, but you

3162
01:54:34,158 --> 01:54:38,719
can't fake time kind of thing. Like the

3163
01:54:37,039 --> 01:54:41,920
more you put in, the more you get out

3164
01:54:38,719 --> 01:54:44,158
and just like, you know, again, even if

3165
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:46,480
that first harvest or second harvest

3166
01:54:44,158 --> 01:54:47,839
isn't, you know, these big nugs like

3167
01:54:46,479 --> 01:54:49,198
you're seeing all, you know, like kind

3168
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:50,960
of thing, you're still learning. So,

3169
01:54:49,198 --> 01:54:55,118
just like you really can't fake that

3170
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:57,520
time that you invest. Um, so for sure

3171
01:54:55,118 --> 01:54:58,639
that's great. I guess along the second

3172
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:01,639
line for somebody wanting into the

3173
01:54:58,639 --> 01:55:01,639
industry,

3174
01:55:02,039 --> 01:55:08,039
um, man, I feel like this is a loaded

3175
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:12,800
one kind of thing.

3176
01:55:08,039 --> 01:55:15,198
Um, um, I guess we have don't. Yeah.

3177
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:18,159
Well, not going to say that, but maybe.

3178
01:55:15,198 --> 01:55:19,839
No, I know. I know kind of thing. uh you

3179
01:55:18,158 --> 01:55:22,000
know kind of you really have to want it

3180
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:24,639
is maybe the first thing like you have

3181
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:27,520
to want this to be your lifestyle. It's

3182
01:55:24,639 --> 01:55:30,880
not just a job. It's not a career like

3183
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:32,960
this is a lifestyle that uh you know and

3184
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:34,440
again I going back to some of my

3185
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:36,800
beginning feel like very lucky that I

3186
01:55:34,439 --> 01:55:38,960
started you know cultivating like sort

3187
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:40,880
of when it was still a little bit outlaw

3188
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:42,399
in Colorado like you know they started

3189
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:44,880
having medical cards. And I remember

3190
01:55:42,399 --> 01:55:46,638
going and getting my medical card at a

3191
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:48,800
dispensary and then you know you meet

3192
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:50,400
the doctor and you pay your tab and then

3193
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:52,800
like you walk out of the back of the

3194
01:55:50,399 --> 01:55:55,359
doctor's office into a dispensary

3195
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:57,199
there's somebody's grandma packing bowls

3196
01:55:55,359 --> 01:55:58,960
for you you know while he could wait and

3197
01:55:57,198 --> 01:56:00,399
pay with a credit card or you know debit

3198
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:02,880
card to get a gram or what you know and

3199
01:56:00,399 --> 01:56:05,359
you're like what is you know kind of

3200
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:07,199
thing you know what is going on. Yeah.

3201
01:56:05,359 --> 01:56:08,559
You know kind of so like but again like

3202
01:56:07,198 --> 01:56:11,439
I don't know looking back you're like

3203
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:13,599
that was cool. Um, but you really have

3204
01:56:11,439 --> 01:56:14,678
to want it to be like it is a lifestyle.

3205
01:56:13,599 --> 01:56:16,719
It's

3206
01:56:14,679 --> 01:56:18,239
exhausting. It's a commitment kind of

3207
01:56:16,719 --> 01:56:21,599
thing. There's a whole lot of sacrifice

3208
01:56:18,238 --> 01:56:22,479
that goes along with it. Um, you know,

3209
01:56:21,599 --> 01:56:25,440
kind of thing, especially in the

3210
01:56:22,479 --> 01:56:28,399
cultivation side of it. Um, you know, so

3211
01:56:25,439 --> 01:56:29,759
um I don't know, some people want to

3212
01:56:28,399 --> 01:56:30,879
work in the retail side of it. Some

3213
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:32,239
people want to be say, you know, again,

3214
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:36,719
like, you know, you really got to want

3215
01:56:32,238 --> 01:56:38,238
it to do it. Um, and again, I would say

3216
01:56:36,719 --> 01:56:40,399
at this point, a lot of places are

3217
01:56:38,238 --> 01:56:42,319
established enough where you could find

3218
01:56:40,399 --> 01:56:45,039
out the reputation of how a company

3219
01:56:42,319 --> 01:56:46,559
treats their people. Um, and I would

3220
01:56:45,039 --> 01:56:49,198
just make sure that you're joining a

3221
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:50,880
team with values and sort of like you

3222
01:56:49,198 --> 01:56:52,759
feel like is like a like-minded facility

3223
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:56,760
or group of people. Um, because

3224
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:59,119
otherwise some of them are pretty toxic

3225
01:56:56,760 --> 01:57:00,639
and it's just not like a positive part

3226
01:56:59,118 --> 01:57:02,319
of life or what you should be doing, you

3227
01:57:00,639 --> 01:57:04,560
know, kind of thing. The whole point of

3228
01:57:02,319 --> 01:57:06,399
like cannabis and self-medicating and

3229
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:08,639
like the plant and all that is to make

3230
01:57:06,399 --> 01:57:11,519
people better, happier, like things

3231
01:57:08,639 --> 01:57:13,359
better, brighter, shinier. Um, so make

3232
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:16,400
sure you're joining a team that that

3233
01:57:13,359 --> 01:57:18,880
like is their purpose kind of thing. Um,

3234
01:57:16,399 --> 01:57:20,960
and if a place isn't that, maybe you got

3235
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:23,440
to pull a rip cord faster than you want.

3236
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:26,158
Um, so that you don't like tarnish, you

3237
01:57:23,439 --> 01:57:28,799
know, something that is so sparkly. Oh,

3238
01:57:26,158 --> 01:57:32,799
for sure. I've um I have definitely

3239
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:35,920
bailed on um different grows, not

3240
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:38,159
necessarily like just like cut cord and

3241
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:39,920
run, but I've I've had to exit different

3242
01:57:38,158 --> 01:57:43,519
companies just for the simple fact that

3243
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:45,760
their values while uh were, you know,

3244
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:47,920
purported to be one thing ended up being

3245
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:49,920
something completely different or you

3246
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:51,599
know, you go into some place thinking

3247
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:52,880
that you're going to learn and all of a

3248
01:57:51,599 --> 01:57:55,199
sudden you're hearing stuff that you're

3249
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:56,480
like, I I know that this is wrong. like

3250
01:57:55,198 --> 01:57:58,559
I've been this has already been

3251
01:57:56,479 --> 01:58:00,238
disproven. I've heard a multitude of

3252
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:02,880
other people say that this is wrong and

3253
01:58:00,238 --> 01:58:05,359
so why are they saying this? Or you know

3254
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:08,079
on on the worst end of things, you run

3255
01:58:05,359 --> 01:58:10,719
into people that are

3256
01:58:08,079 --> 01:58:13,599
doing a bunch of coke, drinking a bunch

3257
01:58:10,719 --> 01:58:15,279
of booze, you know, smoking on the job

3258
01:58:13,599 --> 01:58:18,000
and not paying attention to what they're

3259
01:58:15,279 --> 01:58:21,920
doing. Um yeah, like cleanliness, dude.

3260
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:23,198
like people in like this is similar to I

3261
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:24,560
don't want to say food production or

3262
01:58:23,198 --> 01:58:26,479
what you know but like we've done all

3263
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:29,760
that food production stuff we've done

3264
01:58:26,479 --> 01:58:32,158
classes and what you know like like

3265
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:33,760
needs to be clean

3266
01:58:32,158 --> 01:58:35,279
kind of thing like that's one of the

3267
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:37,280
first things like sometimes you walk in

3268
01:58:35,279 --> 01:58:39,279
places and you're like oh wow I could

3269
01:58:37,279 --> 01:58:40,399
eat off this floor like [ __ ] yeah this

3270
01:58:39,279 --> 01:58:42,000
is going to you know kind of thing or

3271
01:58:40,399 --> 01:58:44,000
you walk in and you're just like

3272
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:46,319
disgusted from the you're like yo I need

3273
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:48,639
to burn these clothes kind of thing. So

3274
01:58:46,319 --> 01:58:51,759
if you don't walk in and immediately

3275
01:58:48,639 --> 01:58:53,920
say, "Wow, this place is clean."

3276
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:56,719
I don't, you know, that's one of my, you

3277
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:59,520
know, kind of I'd say, "Oh, I agree."

3278
01:58:56,719 --> 01:59:02,480
And and clean is sort of a a spectrum,

3279
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:05,199
right? Like depending on each facility,

3280
01:59:02,479 --> 01:59:08,238
the the level of cleanliness that can be

3281
01:59:05,198 --> 01:59:09,759
achieved is is on a spectrum. And so you

3282
01:59:08,238 --> 01:59:12,559
have to have, you know, temper

3283
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:15,520
expectations, but then also, yeah, if if

3284
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:17,280
the end goal is to create a product that

3285
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:21,040
you are putting into your body, whether

3286
01:59:17,279 --> 01:59:23,279
it be through smoke, vapor, an edible, a

3287
01:59:21,039 --> 01:59:26,079
consumable, a topical, anything like

3288
01:59:23,279 --> 01:59:27,759
this, like it's going into your body.

3289
01:59:26,079 --> 01:59:29,439
You you don't want to go into a place

3290
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:31,920
where you don't want your body to be in

3291
01:59:29,439 --> 01:59:34,879
the room where it's being produced.

3292
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:37,118
And don't get me wrong, like point some

3293
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:40,239
of the best cannabis like ever grown's

3294
01:59:37,118 --> 01:59:42,000
probably been grown in some old basement

3295
01:59:40,238 --> 01:59:43,359
somewhere or whatever, you know, doesn't

3296
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,279
mean it's not clean. Like doesn't mean

3297
01:59:43,359 --> 01:59:47,118
they don't follow plans, whatever. Like,

3298
01:59:45,279 --> 01:59:48,559
so it doesn't have to be this spaceship.

3299
01:59:47,118 --> 01:59:51,279
It doesn't have to be so cutting edge

3300
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:53,119
and robots and, you know, but like you

3301
01:59:51,279 --> 01:59:55,759
walk in and tables are dirty or floors

3302
01:59:53,118 --> 02:00:00,000
are dirty or whatever. Like that's a

3303
01:59:55,760 --> 02:00:01,360
flag. Yep. Absolutely. I agree. I I

3304
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:04,399
think the dirty floors thing is one of

3305
02:00:01,359 --> 02:00:05,679
the big ones that uh Oh, man. You walk

3306
02:00:04,399 --> 02:00:07,279
in and there's just like muddy

3307
02:00:05,679 --> 02:00:10,399
footprints everywhere and you go, "Oh,

3308
02:00:07,279 --> 02:00:12,439
fuck." Yeah. Like, you've never

3309
02:00:10,399 --> 02:00:15,598
downhill.

3310
02:00:12,439 --> 02:00:17,198
Yeah, absolutely. Well, Jared, this has

3311
02:00:15,599 --> 02:00:18,880
been a wonderful conversation and I

3312
02:00:17,198 --> 02:00:21,678
think that this is a great point for us

3313
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:23,199
to start wrapping up and uh going into a

3314
02:00:21,679 --> 02:00:25,440
couple of these last little questions

3315
02:00:23,198 --> 02:00:28,719
that I like to ask. Um, was there

3316
02:00:25,439 --> 02:00:31,279
anything else uh about Next Big Crop or

3317
02:00:28,719 --> 02:00:33,039
what you do or about uh cannabis

3318
02:00:31,279 --> 02:00:35,198
cultivation in general that you wanted

3319
02:00:33,039 --> 02:00:38,079
to touch base on before we get into this

3320
02:00:35,198 --> 02:00:39,559
these last few wrap-up questions? Um, I

3321
02:00:38,079 --> 02:00:41,840
don't know. I guess maybe

3322
02:00:39,560 --> 02:00:43,199
just like I said going back I've said it

3323
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:45,119
how many times now but like sort of feel

3324
02:00:43,198 --> 02:00:48,158
really lucky to have gotten to sort of

3325
02:00:45,118 --> 02:00:51,118
come up with certain people like you

3326
02:00:48,158 --> 02:00:53,238
know in an ideal world like give me some

3327
02:00:51,118 --> 02:00:55,839
dosatrons like Wall-E and

3328
02:00:53,238 --> 02:00:58,238
Chris you know I feel like I remember

3329
02:00:55,840 --> 02:01:00,880
the first time I installed a dosatron

3330
02:00:58,238 --> 02:01:02,319
you know I you know I was running a spot

3331
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:03,599
out in Maryland that came home to a

3332
02:01:02,319 --> 02:01:06,279
whole bunch of dead plants in my

3333
02:01:03,599 --> 02:01:09,360
basement kind of thing and you're

3334
02:01:06,279 --> 02:01:10,960
like Chris, I think it's time. So, he

3335
02:01:09,359 --> 02:01:12,238
like whipped me up one and then Wally

3336
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:14,158
helped whatever, you know, kind of

3337
02:01:12,238 --> 02:01:16,079
thing. And then all of a sudden, it

3338
02:01:14,158 --> 02:01:18,158
removes so much time and mental, you

3339
02:01:16,079 --> 02:01:20,319
know, that mental exercise of filling a

3340
02:01:18,158 --> 02:01:21,079
res and whatever, you know. So, it's

3341
02:01:20,319 --> 02:01:23,759
kind of

3342
02:01:21,079 --> 02:01:25,359
like I don't know like like I said, I

3343
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:27,920
love race cars and building race cars

3344
02:01:25,359 --> 02:01:29,679
and stuff like that. And so, like look

3345
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:32,840
at this like so, you know, you have like

3346
02:01:29,679 --> 02:01:35,359
that part of it, you know. Um, and then

3347
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:36,639
like there's like the other part about

3348
02:01:35,359 --> 02:01:41,198
like we were just talking about being

3349
02:01:36,639 --> 02:01:43,118
clean like Zach Homie over at Biosafe is

3350
02:01:41,198 --> 02:01:45,158
a wizard again, you know, when it comes

3351
02:01:43,118 --> 02:01:48,799
to like the clean chemistry behind this

3352
02:01:45,158 --> 02:01:50,158
stuff, you know, like I could keep going

3353
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:51,599
on sort of about the certain groups of

3354
02:01:50,158 --> 02:01:53,519
people, you know, like the Canada guys

3355
02:01:51,599 --> 02:01:55,039
that work real close with, the Fluence

3356
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:58,840
guys and the Dvita guy what, you know,

3357
02:01:55,039 --> 02:02:00,880
so like make friends with people and

3358
02:01:58,840 --> 02:02:02,880
like learn from the subject. subject

3359
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:05,599
matter experts and I feel like I guess

3360
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:07,199
I've done a pretty good job at that and

3361
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:09,039
like sort of always take care of them

3362
02:02:07,198 --> 02:02:13,359
for them taking care of like educating

3363
02:02:09,039 --> 02:02:15,198
you. Um and like I don't know like for

3364
02:02:13,359 --> 02:02:17,118
have a network to solve you know any

3365
02:02:15,198 --> 02:02:19,519
garden in this country I feel like we're

3366
02:02:17,118 --> 02:02:21,839
one degree away from you know solving

3367
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:24,080
any major problem next to crop is one

3368
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:25,760
degree away from like I'm not going to

3369
02:02:24,079 --> 02:02:28,399
pretend I have all the answers cuz I

3370
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:30,079
absolutely don't but I know who does you

3371
02:02:28,399 --> 02:02:31,598
know and all it takes is just like a

3372
02:02:30,079 --> 02:02:34,238
phone call to get these answers.

3373
02:02:31,599 --> 02:02:36,639
Absolutely. Um so go hang out in a

3374
02:02:34,238 --> 02:02:39,839
network like that and like it's a real

3375
02:02:36,639 --> 02:02:41,279
good spot to be for sure. I mean, along

3376
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:43,119
the lines of what you're saying, there's

3377
02:02:41,279 --> 02:02:44,800
there's so many different things that,

3378
02:02:43,118 --> 02:02:47,439
you know, someone can introduce you to

3379
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:49,520
that will change your life as a grower.

3380
02:02:47,439 --> 02:02:51,919
And one of those things kind of with

3381
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:53,599
what you're saying is, uh, you know,

3382
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:55,359
give me any grow that doesn't have a

3383
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:57,599
dosing system and give me three

3384
02:02:55,359 --> 02:03:00,960
dosatrons, an open sprinkler, and a

3385
02:02:57,599 --> 02:03:04,400
liter pump, and I will change your life.

3386
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:06,198
Yeah. Uh, in a heartbeat. And you will,

3387
02:03:04,399 --> 02:03:08,559
you know, you'll think that

3388
02:03:06,198 --> 02:03:10,319
it's it's it's crazy what you can do

3389
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:13,599
with something just as simp with as

3390
02:03:10,319 --> 02:03:15,279
simple as that. And uh and people will,

3391
02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:17,279
you know, it'll change their life. They

3392
02:03:15,279 --> 02:03:19,279
they or when it comes to time in the

3393
02:03:17,279 --> 02:03:21,599
garden. Yeah. when it comes to IPM stuff

3394
02:03:19,279 --> 02:03:23,759
or when it comes to insert whatever sort

3395
02:03:21,599 --> 02:03:25,000
of subject matter expert you're pulling

3396
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:27,480
in for

3397
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:30,000
this using people that are that

3398
02:03:27,479 --> 02:03:32,238
expertise and have done it and like

3399
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:34,000
actually walk the walk and do it like

3400
02:03:32,238 --> 02:03:36,559
nationwide or even internationally at

3401
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:39,359
this point like problem solve with those

3402
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:42,080
people and learn from them and you're

3403
02:03:39,359 --> 02:03:43,198
like whoa things work you know kind of

3404
02:03:42,079 --> 02:03:45,679
thing like

3405
02:03:43,198 --> 02:03:48,158
you know so they're going to look at

3406
02:03:45,679 --> 02:03:49,679
problems in a whole new way Yeah, you're

3407
02:03:48,158 --> 02:03:50,960
like, not that it's a problem at this

3408
02:03:49,679 --> 02:03:52,319
point. You're like, cool, I got it. I've

3409
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:54,960
done it, you know, kind of thing. Like,

3410
02:03:52,319 --> 02:03:57,359
yeah. Um, there's other fires to put out

3411
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:59,920
besides the sort of mechanical aspects

3412
02:03:57,359 --> 02:04:02,399
to this stuff like that. So, yeah,

3413
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:03,920
without any problems, growing cannabis

3414
02:04:02,399 --> 02:04:05,598
starts to become pretty boring,

3415
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:07,039
actually. Uh, that's the point. It

3416
02:04:05,599 --> 02:04:09,440
should be it should go to plan. It

3417
02:04:07,039 --> 02:04:11,238
should be boring. Yeah, it it like at

3418
02:04:09,439 --> 02:04:13,678
the end of the day if if

3419
02:04:11,238 --> 02:04:16,000
uh if you if everything's going off

3420
02:04:13,679 --> 02:04:19,039
right, you can probably run a 100 light

3421
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:21,198
facility with two or three people um in

3422
02:04:19,039 --> 02:04:23,039
the garden and each one of them should

3423
02:04:21,198 --> 02:04:26,000
not be spending more than 40 hours there

3424
02:04:23,039 --> 02:04:29,599
a week. So yeah. Yeah, I think your

3425
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:31,520
numbers are pretty right on. Yep. And uh

3426
02:04:29,599 --> 02:04:33,679
for anybody that's a home grower, think

3427
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:34,960
about it. You can take knowledge that

3428
02:04:33,679 --> 02:04:37,440
you're learning either from these

3429
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:39,840
podcasts or from other shows or other

3430
02:04:37,439 --> 02:04:41,598
educational resources and you can put

3431
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:43,520
yourself in that position if it is

3432
02:04:41,599 --> 02:04:45,840
something like Jarrett said that you are

3433
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:48,639
driven to do because it does require a

3434
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:51,119
lot of dedication but it can be really

3435
02:04:48,639 --> 02:04:53,920
rewarding and in the end if it's working

3436
02:04:51,118 --> 02:04:55,679
well it's not that hard of work and it's

3437
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:58,399
really re like it like I said it's

3438
02:04:55,679 --> 02:04:59,920
rewarding and it's it's not bad and you

3439
02:04:58,399 --> 02:05:02,399
got to find the right people though with

3440
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:04,239
the right uh mindsets to work with and

3441
02:05:02,399 --> 02:05:07,000
work for in this community though

3442
02:05:04,238 --> 02:05:09,198
because there are still a lot of

3443
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:11,359
um let's just say what it is. There's a

3444
02:05:09,198 --> 02:05:13,519
lot of [ __ ] and it's not just in

3445
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:15,598
this community and industry. It's across

3446
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:17,760
every industry and it's you know a life

3447
02:05:15,599 --> 02:05:20,079
lesson to take to find people that you

3448
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:22,000
like working with and that you can align

3449
02:05:20,079 --> 02:05:24,559
your philosophies with to make sure that

3450
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:26,719
you are not there struggling to get

3451
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:28,639
through to the end of your shift or the

3452
02:05:26,719 --> 02:05:31,039
end of the day. Yeah. Like honestly like

3453
02:05:28,639 --> 02:05:33,679
that's like me and Jesse like met up at

3454
02:05:31,039 --> 02:05:35,679
a spot that you know he's you know had

3455
02:05:33,679 --> 02:05:36,719
to walk away from and what you know that

3456
02:05:35,679 --> 02:05:37,920
it's one of those things but like you

3457
02:05:36,719 --> 02:05:39,679
know you meet somebody you get to talk

3458
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:42,158
to him for 20 minutes and you're like

3459
02:05:39,679 --> 02:05:43,760
huh you're pretty cool you know kind of

3460
02:05:42,158 --> 02:05:44,879
thing and like you know like next thing

3461
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:46,719
you know you're like how many years

3462
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:48,960
later how much do I talk to you every

3463
02:05:46,719 --> 02:05:50,399
you know kind of um you know across the

3464
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:52,239
board like we'll probably start talking

3465
02:05:50,399 --> 02:05:54,559
a lot after this too you know one of

3466
02:05:52,238 --> 02:05:57,118
those things of like you know like I

3467
02:05:54,560 --> 02:06:00,000
don't know I literally almost every

3468
02:05:57,118 --> 02:06:02,000
facility we've ever worked at. I like

3469
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,719
still talk to people at those spots like

3470
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:06,399
regularly. Yeah. Whether it's

3471
02:06:03,719 --> 02:06:09,359
like talking genetics or whatever, plant

3472
02:06:06,399 --> 02:06:11,519
stuff or even cars, sneakers, food,

3473
02:06:09,359 --> 02:06:12,719
whatever, you know, kind of like, you

3474
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:14,080
know, you become friends with these

3475
02:06:12,719 --> 02:06:16,399
people in the garden because you shared

3476
02:06:14,079 --> 02:06:19,359
something with them and uh it's real and

3477
02:06:16,399 --> 02:06:20,960
it like carries on. Yeah, it's a

3478
02:06:19,359 --> 02:06:23,359
tight-knit community when it comes down

3479
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:25,279
to it. Um, you know, there's a there's a

3480
02:06:23,359 --> 02:06:26,719
lot of uh issues with communities that

3481
02:06:25,279 --> 02:06:29,800
are that tight-knit. you get a lot of

3482
02:06:26,719 --> 02:06:32,000
incestuous uh

3483
02:06:29,800 --> 02:06:33,920
reciprocal, you know, [ __ ] that is

3484
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:36,238
not necessarily the best in some cases,

3485
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:38,319
but then you can build these long-term

3486
02:06:36,238 --> 02:06:40,319
friendships and and bonds with other

3487
02:06:38,319 --> 02:06:43,920
people that are within this industry.

3488
02:06:40,319 --> 02:06:45,519
And in a lot of ways that's you know

3489
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:47,840
those are the people that will be in the

3490
02:06:45,520 --> 02:06:49,840
future the giants whose shoulders other

3491
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:51,360
people are standing on whereas we're

3492
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:54,000
standing on the shoulders of so many

3493
02:06:51,359 --> 02:06:55,039
giants before us and all of the [ __ ]

3494
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,279
that they went through in the

3495
02:06:55,039 --> 02:06:58,880
prohibition era and are you know even

3496
02:06:57,279 --> 02:07:01,118
still there's a lot of issues with that

3497
02:06:58,880 --> 02:07:02,880
now but there's so much of the

3498
02:07:01,118 --> 02:07:04,960
information that we're drawing from to

3499
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:07,199
be able to help all these different

3500
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:09,920
growers perfect what they're doing in

3501
02:07:07,198 --> 02:07:11,439
their own style. We didn't start it.

3502
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:13,359
We're not even the people that are

3503
02:07:11,439 --> 02:07:14,719
continuing to discover it because that's

3504
02:07:13,359 --> 02:07:17,279
happening in other agricultural

3505
02:07:14,719 --> 02:07:19,599
industries. And we're just trying to

3506
02:07:17,279 --> 02:07:22,078
make it the best that we can with the

3507
02:07:19,599 --> 02:07:25,199
information and the circumstances that

3508
02:07:22,078 --> 02:07:27,118
were given given the legality and

3509
02:07:25,198 --> 02:07:28,799
history and everything. Fun stories of

3510
02:07:27,118 --> 02:07:31,679
it. Like one of my homies went to

3511
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:33,599
college with in Ohio 20ome years ago.

3512
02:07:31,679 --> 02:07:35,920
Yeah. When he moved out here too. And

3513
02:07:33,599 --> 02:07:38,239
yeah, he's a raft guide and ski bum and

3514
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:41,679
all that kind of stuff. um and he used

3515
02:07:38,238 --> 02:07:43,678
to trim all my um product for me with

3516
02:07:41,679 --> 02:07:45,840
me, you know, then he went and got his

3517
02:07:43,679 --> 02:07:47,840
MBA and so we would listen to his like

3518
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:49,440
textbooks while he's getting his MBA and

3519
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:51,920
trim circles and stuff, you know, and

3520
02:07:49,439 --> 02:07:53,678
like now his company's hired my company,

3521
02:07:51,920 --> 02:07:55,599
I've hired it like whatever. So like

3522
02:07:53,679 --> 02:07:58,000
nice, you know, like and like even just

3523
02:07:55,599 --> 02:08:00,400
going back to other stuff like I don't

3524
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:02,238
know who doesn't love traveling, you

3525
02:08:00,399 --> 02:08:04,879
know, kind of thing, but like can't tell

3526
02:08:02,238 --> 02:08:07,959
you how many trips to Mexico, Costa

3527
02:08:04,880 --> 02:08:10,679
Rica, you know, Europe, like Croatia,

3528
02:08:07,960 --> 02:08:13,039
Italy, like, you know,

3529
02:08:10,679 --> 02:08:14,880
like different sort of groups of

3530
02:08:13,039 --> 02:08:16,679
cultivation people that have traveled

3531
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:18,560
the world and done really cool [ __ ]

3532
02:08:16,679 --> 02:08:21,118
together, you know, and it all is

3533
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:23,840
because of this plant, you know, you're,

3534
02:08:21,118 --> 02:08:26,158
you know, on some sailboat in Croatia

3535
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:28,078
doing whatever you know kind of just you

3536
02:08:26,158 --> 02:08:30,399
know rafting the Grand Canyon like with

3537
02:08:28,078 --> 02:08:31,599
a whole bunch of wild [ __ ] that

3538
02:08:30,399 --> 02:08:33,439
you know like so it's just one of those

3539
02:08:31,599 --> 02:08:36,880
things like you know there's like I said

3540
02:08:33,439 --> 02:08:39,118
it's a lifestyle and you know like sort

3541
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:41,840
of you stay you know I'm from Philly so

3542
02:08:39,118 --> 02:08:44,158
like Alan Iverson has a tattoo CT on his

3543
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:46,078
neck like crew thick you know it stands

3544
02:08:44,158 --> 02:08:49,759
for and I feel like that's one of those

3545
02:08:46,078 --> 02:08:52,000
things of uh you I don't know I sort of

3546
02:08:49,760 --> 02:08:55,440
subscribe to it like you take care of

3547
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:57,198
your people and like Yeah, definitely.

3548
02:08:55,439 --> 02:08:58,638
So,

3549
02:08:57,198 --> 02:09:00,319
yeah, I feel that. I feel like yeah,

3550
02:08:58,639 --> 02:09:02,400
finding finding the real ones in this

3551
02:09:00,319 --> 02:09:03,840
industry, you you latch on and you try

3552
02:09:02,399 --> 02:09:06,559
to just build that group up even

3553
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:08,400
further. Um, and so, yeah, I think

3554
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:11,119
that's a a great place to kind of end

3555
02:09:08,399 --> 02:09:12,719
our main conversation on. So, uh, let's,

3556
02:09:11,118 --> 02:09:14,880
uh, let's go into a couple of these fun

3557
02:09:12,719 --> 02:09:17,279
little wrap-up questions and, uh, we'll

3558
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:22,480
wrap up from there. So, uh, favorite

3559
02:09:17,279 --> 02:09:25,519
strain of all time. Loaded question, but

3560
02:09:22,479 --> 02:09:27,598
of course. Yeah. Maybe when I was

3561
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:29,679
younger and I guess like we talking

3562
02:09:27,599 --> 02:09:32,078
about still chasing it. I talk about it

3563
02:09:29,679 --> 02:09:33,800
too often. You know, I feel like the

3564
02:09:32,078 --> 02:09:37,279
first time like you're

3565
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:39,520
like I don't know, like a like a a sour

3566
02:09:37,279 --> 02:09:41,519
diesel or just a diesel that like when

3567
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:43,199
you would walk in the bar 15 years ago,

3568
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:45,119
you know, with a ziplockc baggie and you

3569
02:09:43,198 --> 02:09:46,559
could have a gram in your pocket,

3570
02:09:45,118 --> 02:09:48,158
everybody in the bar would point at you

3571
02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:50,880
and go, "You have sour diesel in your

3572
02:09:48,158 --> 02:09:53,118
pocket." Like I miss that diesel. Um, so

3573
02:09:50,880 --> 02:09:54,960
I love some diesel

3574
02:09:53,118 --> 02:09:58,238
first. Then nowadays we're talking older

3575
02:09:54,960 --> 02:10:01,840
stuff. also like really love like a good

3576
02:09:58,238 --> 02:10:04,718
Indiana bubble gum is like I don't know

3577
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:06,159
love it kind of thing. Um so like for

3578
02:10:04,719 --> 02:10:08,800
some of the older stuff like your diesel

3579
02:10:06,158 --> 02:10:11,439
your bubble gum I don't know like some

3580
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:13,119
headband like same kind of family in our

3581
02:10:11,439 --> 02:10:17,279
circle of friends like Chuck and John

3582
02:10:13,118 --> 02:10:18,799
had this cut of Hong Kong that um I've

3583
02:10:17,279 --> 02:10:20,158
bought a bunch of different cuts of Hong

3584
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:21,360
Kong over the years. None of them have

3585
02:10:20,158 --> 02:10:24,638
been anything like it so I don't know

3586
02:10:21,359 --> 02:10:26,479
what this really was. But this Hong Kong

3587
02:10:24,639 --> 02:10:28,400
was stellar. You know, a buddy got

3588
02:10:26,479 --> 02:10:31,439
arrested one time and they walked him

3589
02:10:28,399 --> 02:10:32,879
into the police office with it and um

3590
02:10:31,439 --> 02:10:34,719
you know, he had smoked a couple grams

3591
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:37,039
out of the ounce kind of thing. But

3592
02:10:34,719 --> 02:10:39,599
every cop in the police office, I guess,

3593
02:10:37,039 --> 02:10:41,920
kind of congratulated him on the way out

3594
02:10:39,599 --> 02:10:43,360
because it made the whole office smell

3595
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:45,279
kind of thing. And that Hong Kong was

3596
02:10:43,359 --> 02:10:47,118
like anytime used to that would come

3597
02:10:45,279 --> 02:10:48,319
around like I would load up for myself

3598
02:10:47,118 --> 02:10:49,439
just because it was like nothing I'd

3599
02:10:48,319 --> 02:10:52,399
ever seen. Like that was probably the

3600
02:10:49,439 --> 02:10:55,519
first like exotic cannabis I'd ever like

3601
02:10:52,399 --> 02:10:58,879
latched on to. Um so yeah, diesel,

3602
02:10:55,520 --> 02:11:02,000
bubblegum, Hong Kong in the old days. Um

3603
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:03,520
heard of Hong Kong. Oh, again I have

3604
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:06,560
not. This one might have been something

3605
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:08,239
else and mislabeled or whatever because

3606
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:10,960
all these Hong Kongs I've had since have

3607
02:11:08,238 --> 02:11:14,399
been not like you would not, you know,

3608
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:16,158
it's just not the same. Um so hunting

3609
02:11:14,399 --> 02:11:19,279
for it kind of thing. If anybody has a

3610
02:11:16,158 --> 02:11:20,559
Hong Kong, I'd love to trade for it. Um,

3611
02:11:19,279 --> 02:11:23,279
then the cookie wreck, you know, those

3612
02:11:20,560 --> 02:11:25,760
seeds that I popped like 2011. I think

3613
02:11:23,279 --> 02:11:27,759
it's just smell, taste, whatever. Like

3614
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:29,199
it's performance-enhancing, like, you

3615
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:31,599
know, it like makes you like creative

3616
02:11:29,198 --> 02:11:33,118
and tunnel vision of, you know, like

3617
02:11:31,599 --> 02:11:34,639
every broomstroke would be the same if

3618
02:11:33,118 --> 02:11:36,198
you're sweeping a floor, you know, like

3619
02:11:34,639 --> 02:11:38,480
I swear you leave the house and you're

3620
02:11:36,198 --> 02:11:40,000
like uncomfortable and then the same

3621
02:11:38,479 --> 02:11:41,919
spot on the highway, you're like windows

3622
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:43,118
down, turn music up, like I got this,

3623
02:11:41,920 --> 02:11:44,440
you know, it's like artistic and

3624
02:11:43,118 --> 02:11:46,158
creative weed, like

3625
02:11:44,439 --> 02:11:48,479
performance-enhancing. And then I guess

3626
02:11:46,158 --> 02:11:50,319
some some of the more recent stuff like

3627
02:11:48,479 --> 02:11:52,879
I don't know like now I'm older and

3628
02:11:50,319 --> 02:11:55,198
don't want to be so sped up. So like I

3629
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:56,560
love some Koshmet like proper kosher. So

3630
02:11:55,198 --> 02:11:59,198
I know like like people might say

3631
02:11:56,560 --> 02:12:01,520
whatever like smell, taste, whatever. I

3632
02:11:59,198 --> 02:12:04,238
love how it makes me feel you know at

3633
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:05,840
this point I want herb that like yeah we

3634
02:12:04,238 --> 02:12:08,479
all sit like this too much. Yeah. So

3635
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:11,199
like something that opens your chest up

3636
02:12:08,479 --> 02:12:12,839
and gives you better posture is like one

3637
02:12:11,198 --> 02:12:15,439
of the ways I like sort of judge

3638
02:12:12,840 --> 02:12:17,039
cannabis. So like I don't know one stuff

3639
02:12:15,439 --> 02:12:19,118
that makes me feel better. Yeah. I love

3640
02:12:17,039 --> 02:12:21,039
some like archive had that pie face that

3641
02:12:19,118 --> 02:12:23,039
came out a couple years. Yeah. H long

3642
02:12:21,039 --> 02:12:24,960
time ago at this point without a bunch

3643
02:12:23,039 --> 02:12:27,760
of THCV in it. So it was like a diet

3644
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:29,679
weed. So my girlfriend had me go hunt

3645
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:32,239
that out and we found a really killer

3646
02:12:29,679 --> 02:12:34,319
winner of that. I guess most recent

3647
02:12:32,238 --> 02:12:36,559
thing that's my new favorite skunk tech

3648
02:12:34,319 --> 02:12:38,639
and mean jeans piec. That's like that's

3649
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:40,800
like the best tasting herb. I [ __ ]

3650
02:12:38,639 --> 02:12:42,400
love that piec.

3651
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:45,679
I've heard nothing but good things about

3652
02:12:42,399 --> 02:12:48,279
the pie scream. It is so, you know, it's

3653
02:12:45,679 --> 02:12:50,399
stunning, attractive. It's like as

3654
02:12:48,279 --> 02:12:51,599
advertised. It's as attractive as you

3655
02:12:50,399 --> 02:12:53,359
could hope something is. And it's not

3656
02:12:51,599 --> 02:12:56,480
purple. It's like your seaf green, like

3657
02:12:53,359 --> 02:12:58,719
almost sweet like gum green color.

3658
02:12:56,479 --> 02:13:00,158
Stunning. Test 35 plus at a bunch of

3659
02:12:58,719 --> 02:13:02,319
different spots for us that, you know,

3660
02:13:00,158 --> 02:13:06,039
handful of spots we've shared it with.

3661
02:13:02,319 --> 02:13:09,679
Um, it's like you're

3662
02:13:06,039 --> 02:13:11,599
like as advertised like it smells. It

3663
02:13:09,679 --> 02:13:12,880
tastes as good as it smells, which is as

3664
02:13:11,599 --> 02:13:14,880
good as it looks. like, you know, ding

3665
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:16,880
ding ding, like down that line. And it's

3666
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:19,520
just a very unique flavor. You know,

3667
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:21,679
it's fruity without being runish, you

3668
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:24,400
know, like it's just it's very unique in

3669
02:13:21,679 --> 02:13:26,880
its own way. And um I don't know. That's

3670
02:13:24,399 --> 02:13:28,399
like my new favorite. It's unfortunate

3671
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:30,639
because I have this thing where like I

3672
02:13:28,399 --> 02:13:33,118
really don't want to grow ugly weed even

3673
02:13:30,639 --> 02:13:34,639
though I know sometimes like a good

3674
02:13:33,118 --> 02:13:36,238
diesel or something is just going to

3675
02:13:34,639 --> 02:13:38,639
look like [ __ ] when you're growing

3676
02:13:36,238 --> 02:13:40,879
it. um compared to what you might be

3677
02:13:38,639 --> 02:13:43,199
used to if you are growing these purples

3678
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:44,800
and the different runts and you know

3679
02:13:43,198 --> 02:13:46,638
candy gases and all these different

3680
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:48,719
things that are you know popular within

3681
02:13:46,639 --> 02:13:50,560
the market those are pretty and fun to

3682
02:13:48,719 --> 02:13:52,158
grow the you know the scinessence in

3683
02:13:50,560 --> 02:13:54,000
them the color change everything that

3684
02:13:52,158 --> 02:13:57,439
happens to that plant as it grows you're

3685
02:13:54,000 --> 02:14:01,599
just like oh this is fun and enjoyable

3686
02:13:57,439 --> 02:14:02,799
visually um olofactory you know all

3687
02:14:01,599 --> 02:14:06,000
these different things that you're just

3688
02:14:02,800 --> 02:14:07,520
like oh I love I love this um and I

3689
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:09,039
think that's one of my pitfalls where

3690
02:14:07,520 --> 02:14:11,440
I'm just like I don't want to grow any

3691
02:14:09,039 --> 02:14:14,078
green weed. I I know that it might be

3692
02:14:11,439 --> 02:14:16,479
good, but I'm I'm sorry. I don't really

3693
02:14:14,078 --> 02:14:18,078
want to grow it. I have this new like

3694
02:14:16,479 --> 02:14:20,000
Mercy, you know, not really new, but

3695
02:14:18,078 --> 02:14:22,719
it's from Gage Green, you know, out of

3696
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:24,238
Michigan. It's like TK by Glue by High

3697
02:14:22,719 --> 02:14:27,279
School Sweetheart, and it's like green

3698
02:14:24,238 --> 02:14:28,000
and sort of rubber nostalgic cush. I

3699
02:14:27,279 --> 02:14:29,198
don't know. It's one of those things

3700
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,639
you're like, I haven't tasted anything

3701
02:14:29,198 --> 02:14:33,359
like that in a while. So, that's sort of

3702
02:14:30,639 --> 02:14:35,840
like a new favorite on the list as well.

3703
02:14:33,359 --> 02:14:37,279
But grow it and love it either way.

3704
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:39,279
Yeah, it's green again though. You know,

3705
02:14:37,279 --> 02:14:41,198
it's really shiny. It's got the sparkle,

3706
02:14:39,279 --> 02:14:44,238
whatever. But again, it's like green. It

3707
02:14:41,198 --> 02:14:45,678
is nowhere near purple. And whatever.

3708
02:14:44,238 --> 02:14:47,759
We've been growing a cut of sherb

3709
02:14:45,679 --> 02:14:50,319
cocktail lately and it is green with

3710
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:52,880
just, you know, tinges of purple as as

3711
02:14:50,319 --> 02:14:55,198
it like in the last couple days. But it

3712
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:56,960
is so loud and it's such a yielder that

3713
02:14:55,198 --> 02:14:59,118
I'm just like, "Oh, I guess I'm growing

3714
02:14:56,960 --> 02:15:03,198
green weed right now." Yeah. There you

3715
02:14:59,118 --> 02:15:05,519
go. Yep. Cool. Well, uh, so that you

3716
02:15:03,198 --> 02:15:06,799
know, you have a a of course with

3717
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:08,480
someone with your experience, it's going

3718
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:10,719
to be really hard to pick out one strain

3719
02:15:08,479 --> 02:15:12,078
that you like. And so I I'm totally fine

3720
02:15:10,719 --> 02:15:14,399
with it just being a bunch of different

3721
02:15:12,078 --> 02:15:16,399
ones that are kind of developed over the

3722
02:15:14,399 --> 02:15:18,238
time. Nobody at this point's just got

3723
02:15:16,399 --> 02:15:19,439
one jar on their table, man. You know,

3724
02:15:18,238 --> 02:15:20,638
that kind of thing. You're like, "What

3725
02:15:19,439 --> 02:15:24,158
time of the day is it? What are we

3726
02:15:20,639 --> 02:15:25,760
doing?" Like, you know, that's there. We

3727
02:15:24,158 --> 02:15:27,679
all have, I guess, options in front of

3728
02:15:25,760 --> 02:15:30,639
us kind of thing. So, but I guess I'm

3729
02:15:27,679 --> 02:15:32,719
trying to pick one. I know.

3730
02:15:30,639 --> 02:15:34,239
Yeah. So, and I just kind of got to cut

3731
02:15:32,719 --> 02:15:36,800
a Durban poison back and put that

3732
02:15:34,238 --> 02:15:38,399
through dissection. I can't wait to run

3733
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:40,239
that because that used to be a favorite,

3734
02:15:38,399 --> 02:15:43,198
too. And hadn't really seen something

3735
02:15:40,238 --> 02:15:47,039
that was like that textbook Durban

3736
02:15:43,198 --> 02:15:50,000
poison, you know, where it is 100% like

3737
02:15:47,039 --> 02:15:51,679
recognizable, whatever. So, um, that's

3738
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:53,279
just coming out of dissection like as we

3739
02:15:51,679 --> 02:15:54,960
speak pretty much kind of thing. So, I

3740
02:15:53,279 --> 02:15:56,599
can't wait to get that back on a table.

3741
02:15:54,960 --> 02:16:00,800
Um,

3742
02:15:56,599 --> 02:16:04,520
nice question. Yes, cool. uh favorite

3743
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:04,520
breeder of all time.

3744
02:16:05,679 --> 02:16:08,960
I don't know if I can even pick one in

3745
02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:11,360
all honesty. I guess sort of I go

3746
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:15,399
through phases, you know, like went

3747
02:16:11,359 --> 02:16:18,399
through an archive phase for a while.

3748
02:16:15,399 --> 02:16:20,078
Um you know, yeah, I guess did a whole

3749
02:16:18,399 --> 02:16:22,078
lot of archive work for a long time and

3750
02:16:20,078 --> 02:16:24,399
just sort of like kept finding winners,

3751
02:16:22,078 --> 02:16:25,479
you know, out of everything. That cookie

3752
02:16:24,399 --> 02:16:27,920
wreck came from

3753
02:16:25,479 --> 02:16:31,239
Canadenture I guess during COVID went on

3754
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:34,719
a total like 808 genetics at a Hawaii

3755
02:16:31,239 --> 02:16:36,760
run. Um I don't know Bloom does killer

3756
02:16:34,718 --> 02:16:40,159
work too.

3757
02:16:36,760 --> 02:16:43,120
Um you know let's let's kind of curtail

3758
02:16:40,159 --> 02:16:46,079
this question for specific set of uh

3759
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:48,880
interests and skill sets. So, if you had

3760
02:16:46,079 --> 02:16:51,079
to choose one breeder that you were to

3761
02:16:48,879 --> 02:16:54,718
curate your next

3762
02:16:51,079 --> 02:16:56,079
quarterly cut menu from and hunt all of

3763
02:16:54,718 --> 02:16:57,598
the seeds yourself, you have, you know,

3764
02:16:56,079 --> 02:16:59,439
you have unlimited time to hunt the

3765
02:16:57,599 --> 02:17:02,000
seeds and unlimited space to hunt all

3766
02:16:59,439 --> 02:17:04,398
the seeds that you want to hunt, but you

3767
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:06,599
have to curate your 18 cultivars or

3768
02:17:04,398 --> 02:17:10,718
however many cultivars for your clone

3769
02:17:06,599 --> 02:17:12,079
list. What breeder would you go for to

3770
02:17:10,718 --> 02:17:13,919
start hunting through a bunch of

3771
02:17:12,079 --> 02:17:15,760
different packs? first. Great job

3772
02:17:13,920 --> 02:17:17,079
narrowing that question down. You nailed

3773
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:19,280
that.

3774
02:17:17,079 --> 02:17:23,318
Um, that was a really good sort of

3775
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:23,319
parameters to put it in.

3776
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:28,319
It makes it harder but easier at the

3777
02:17:26,799 --> 02:17:30,000
same time. Yeah. So, I'm just trying to

3778
02:17:28,318 --> 02:17:32,199
think like who's got 18 different things

3779
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:36,000
that's going to cross my menu that I

3780
02:17:32,200 --> 02:17:39,000
want kind of thing.

3781
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:42,239
Maybe Bloom at this point

3782
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:45,040
like kind of diverse enough where it's

3783
02:17:42,239 --> 02:17:48,159
like gonna touch your soury going to

3784
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:50,960
touch like fruit in the like different

3785
02:17:48,159 --> 02:17:52,799
fruit categories kind of thing. Going to

3786
02:17:50,959 --> 02:17:56,718
touch some nostalgic with also being

3787
02:17:52,799 --> 02:17:56,718
relevant and new.

3788
02:17:57,879 --> 02:18:02,959
Um I don't know. That's probably my

3789
02:18:00,159 --> 02:18:04,558
answer for lack of for sure with your

3790
02:18:02,959 --> 02:18:05,839
parameters just kind of like who would I

3791
02:18:04,558 --> 02:18:08,478
go holler at? Like that's who I'd go

3792
02:18:05,840 --> 02:18:11,280
holler at to go try to pick 20 different

3793
02:18:08,478 --> 02:18:12,318
things to to go chase cuz like I don't

3794
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:14,319
know like you know you need the

3795
02:18:12,318 --> 02:18:15,760
diversity who like you know cuz like or

3796
02:18:14,318 --> 02:18:17,039
you know I don't know like Alex from

3797
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:19,200
Clear Water has done a whole bunch of

3798
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:21,359
killer work over the years and I've lot

3799
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:24,000
of his seeds because he's really diverse

3800
02:18:21,359 --> 02:18:25,760
too. So, I'd probably call Alex to be

3801
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:27,439
honest or whatever between the two of

3802
02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:30,639
them. Either Clear Water or Bloom just

3803
02:18:27,439 --> 02:18:34,318
because I want a menu that's not so

3804
02:18:30,638 --> 02:18:35,759
focused on one trait or, you know, I

3805
02:18:34,318 --> 02:18:38,318
need a diversity. My mind immediately

3806
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:42,559
goes to CSI Humboldt.

3807
02:18:38,318 --> 02:18:44,000
Great answer. Classic answer.

3808
02:18:42,558 --> 02:18:45,599
Especially if you're trying to curate

3809
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:47,679
with a bunch of different flavors. I

3810
02:18:45,599 --> 02:18:50,639
just pick up S1's of everything that I

3811
02:18:47,679 --> 02:18:53,120
wanted to run and hunt 120 seeds of

3812
02:18:50,638 --> 02:18:54,959
them. Yeah. you nailed it on like being

3813
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:57,040
able to diversify a menu out of the gate

3814
02:18:54,959 --> 02:18:59,279
that way. Um, and it's also your

3815
02:18:57,040 --> 02:19:01,599
nostalgic classic plus new, you know,

3816
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:04,159
kind of thing. Like, all right, your

3817
02:19:01,599 --> 02:19:05,920
answer's better than mine.

3818
02:19:04,159 --> 02:19:07,840
Oh, it's not about better or worse. I

3819
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:11,679
feel like it's um because, you know, a

3820
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:14,159
fully curated Clearwater uh menu or a

3821
02:19:11,679 --> 02:19:16,079
Bloom menu, oh my god, you're going to

3822
02:19:14,159 --> 02:19:17,959
kill it. like you're going to have

3823
02:19:16,079 --> 02:19:19,920
you're going to have uh commercial

3824
02:19:17,959 --> 02:19:21,759
viability out of you know you'll

3825
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:24,879
probably only need to pop two or three

3826
02:19:21,760 --> 02:19:27,439
packs of each genetic to find a true

3827
02:19:24,879 --> 02:19:29,279
unicorn and and and run it and run it

3828
02:19:27,439 --> 02:19:32,159
across facilities across the entire

3829
02:19:29,280 --> 02:19:35,439
country whereas you know my methodology

3830
02:19:32,159 --> 02:19:37,519
I need to pop like a couple hundred of

3831
02:19:35,439 --> 02:19:39,679
each one. Well, like I don't know. Like

3832
02:19:37,519 --> 02:19:41,439
both those guys too I feel like are very

3833
02:19:39,679 --> 02:19:43,840
like they touch older work but they're

3834
02:19:41,439 --> 02:19:45,439
also very current, you know? So like

3835
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:47,120
you're making everybody happy with their

3836
02:19:45,439 --> 02:19:48,720
menus kind of thing. I don't know. I

3837
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:51,120
guess I've run lots of Alex's seeds over

3838
02:19:48,719 --> 02:19:53,760
the years and like always found winner.

3839
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:55,680
Like I don't think I ever walked away

3840
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:59,359
without something from packs of that we

3841
02:19:55,680 --> 02:20:02,159
popped. Um for sure. So I'll stick with

3842
02:19:59,359 --> 02:20:04,640
Bloomer Alex and Clear Water. Cool. I'd

3843
02:20:02,159 --> 02:20:08,559
be happy. Awesome. All right. Well, last

3844
02:20:04,639 --> 02:20:10,639
question. What is a uh most memorable

3845
02:20:08,559 --> 02:20:13,359
cannabis related experience that you've

3846
02:20:10,639 --> 02:20:13,358
had and want to

3847
02:20:16,439 --> 02:20:21,920
share?

3848
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:23,559
Um, whoa, tough question. Um, kind of

3849
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:26,079
thing

3850
02:20:23,559 --> 02:20:27,359
like I don't know. I feel like there's

3851
02:20:26,079 --> 02:20:29,120
some I'm going to do this in like a

3852
02:20:27,359 --> 02:20:31,520
three-part answer kind of thing. Like

3853
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:33,200
first one, you know, you remember the

3854
02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:34,399
first time you hit two pounds of light,

3855
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:36,079
then you remember the first time you hit

3856
02:20:34,398 --> 02:20:37,279
three pounds of light, then you hit

3857
02:20:36,079 --> 02:20:38,398
four. Like, you know, kind of like So,

3858
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:40,920
like, yeah, have like those like

3859
02:20:38,398 --> 02:20:42,398
specific memories of like

3860
02:20:40,920 --> 02:20:45,120
self-accomplishment, you know, kind of

3861
02:20:42,398 --> 02:20:46,799
thing like where you're like, "Oh, wow.

3862
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:48,079
I didn't know I could do that. I did

3863
02:20:46,799 --> 02:20:51,599
that." You know, and you pulled

3864
02:20:48,079 --> 02:20:54,318
something off. Um, I guess maybe also

3865
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:57,200
like this cookie wreck strain like never

3866
02:20:54,318 --> 02:20:58,719
shared it really in like you know the 13

3867
02:20:57,200 --> 02:20:59,760
or 14 years or whatever, you know, kind

3868
02:20:58,719 --> 02:21:01,279
of been running around with that and

3869
02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:03,920
finally started a whole breeding project

3870
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:05,640
with it. Um, I feel like there's just

3871
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:08,159
sort of like

3872
02:21:05,639 --> 02:21:10,000
nothing the way it makes you feel. Like

3873
02:21:08,159 --> 02:21:12,000
out of all the genetics like Evergrown,

3874
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:13,760
nothing is like this. Like if there is a

3875
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:15,840
certain medicine in it, you know, to to

3876
02:21:13,760 --> 02:21:18,840
do the studies and the research with,

3877
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:21,359
like this is the specimen I would pick.

3878
02:21:18,840 --> 02:21:23,840
Um, so like excited to have finally

3879
02:21:21,359 --> 02:21:25,318
started breeding with it. Um, you know,

3880
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:27,600
and that kind of thing.

3881
02:21:25,318 --> 02:21:29,039
But Canada specific memory. I don't

3882
02:21:27,600 --> 02:21:31,120
know. Like also going just back to sort

3883
02:21:29,040 --> 02:21:33,200
of like the friends like you know what

3884
02:21:31,120 --> 02:21:35,280
it's like showing up somewhere Costa

3885
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:37,040
Rica, Mexico, wherever. even like when

3886
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:39,359
like went say on through Croatia for a

3887
02:21:37,040 --> 02:21:41,439
couple weeks and you show up with like

3888
02:21:39,359 --> 02:21:43,200
your work, you know, and these guys are

3889
02:21:41,439 --> 02:21:45,359
like, you know, and you're with a group

3890
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:47,439
of friends that have supported you and

3891
02:21:45,359 --> 02:21:49,359
helped you like manage and get through

3892
02:21:47,439 --> 02:21:51,200
all the, you know, but you you're on the

3893
02:21:49,359 --> 02:21:53,520
sailboat in the middle of Croatia, you

3894
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:56,720
know, running around island hopping and

3895
02:21:53,520 --> 02:21:58,239
the captain of your boat is like, you

3896
02:21:56,719 --> 02:21:59,920
know, calling ahead to the restaurant.

3897
02:21:58,239 --> 02:22:02,318
So all the chefs come out to your table

3898
02:21:59,920 --> 02:22:03,760
and serve you. all you got to do is give

3899
02:22:02,318 --> 02:22:05,760
them a little bit of, you know, taste of

3900
02:22:03,760 --> 02:22:07,760
your work kind of thing. So, it's like

3901
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:08,520
just like these rad opportunities and

3902
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:10,800
like

3903
02:22:08,520 --> 02:22:12,159
friendships that like it really, you

3904
02:22:10,799 --> 02:22:14,318
know, and again, it's probably a cop out

3905
02:22:12,159 --> 02:22:16,318
of an answer, but like you know, like

3906
02:22:14,318 --> 02:22:18,398
been through the was the gateway into

3907
02:22:16,318 --> 02:22:20,478
it, right? Like cannabis was the

3908
02:22:18,398 --> 02:22:22,398
connecting tie for for that experience

3909
02:22:20,478 --> 02:22:24,159
to occur. And then I guess all right

3910
02:22:22,398 --> 02:22:26,079
just to wrap that up you sort of become

3911
02:22:24,159 --> 02:22:28,239
friends with you know I guess like I've

3912
02:22:26,079 --> 02:22:30,239
always seen lots of music you know I

3913
02:22:28,239 --> 02:22:31,680
think there was a good fiveyear run you

3914
02:22:30,239 --> 02:22:34,000
know when I was younger where I saw like

3915
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:38,239
200 plus nights of live music a year

3916
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:41,359
kind of thing. Wow. Um yeah, quite a you

3917
02:22:38,239 --> 02:22:42,639
know um um you know so made lots of

3918
02:22:41,359 --> 02:22:45,200
friends in the music industry and like

3919
02:22:42,639 --> 02:22:46,959
at this point sort of you know have one

3920
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:49,600
friend that photographer so like I'll

3921
02:22:46,959 --> 02:22:51,119
trade him um you know some product and

3922
02:22:49,600 --> 02:22:53,280
he'll give me prints from the shows and

3923
02:22:51,120 --> 02:22:54,720
stuff like that but like you know sort

3924
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:57,760
of I guess at this point sort of like

3925
02:22:54,719 --> 02:22:59,920
you get to sort of share your work with

3926
02:22:57,760 --> 02:23:01,760
the band you know that's playing at Red

3927
02:22:59,920 --> 02:23:03,920
Rocks you know so like you're getting

3928
02:23:01,760 --> 02:23:05,040
the band high that's got 10,000 people

3929
02:23:03,920 --> 02:23:06,719
in the crowd

3930
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:08,800
getting high off this music and stuff

3931
02:23:06,719 --> 02:23:10,159
like that. So, like sort of goes back to

3932
02:23:08,799 --> 02:23:11,438
like I guess it's sort of a joke, but

3933
02:23:10,159 --> 02:23:12,559
I'm trying to be serious about and like

3934
02:23:11,439 --> 02:23:14,159
really want to put together this whole

3935
02:23:12,559 --> 02:23:16,239
team of like sponsored artists and

3936
02:23:14,159 --> 02:23:18,559
athletes, but like I'll sponsor any

3937
02:23:16,239 --> 02:23:20,079
artist. Like I'd give out herb to all

3938
02:23:18,559 --> 02:23:22,478
lots of local musicians and stuff like

3939
02:23:20,079 --> 02:23:25,920
that just because it's like I don't know

3940
02:23:22,478 --> 02:23:27,279
like go get the musician high that then

3941
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:29,920
plays the music that makes all the

3942
02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:32,159
people happy, right? You know, kind of

3943
02:23:29,920 --> 02:23:34,799
thing or whatever. So, it's like I don't

3944
02:23:32,159 --> 02:23:36,159
know that sort of whatever. That's

3945
02:23:34,799 --> 02:23:37,840
probably the highlight for me. Like I

3946
02:23:36,159 --> 02:23:39,200
said, go [ __ ] get the people high

3947
02:23:37,840 --> 02:23:41,280
that make the other people happy and

3948
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:42,960
like sort of get to stand there in the

3949
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:44,880
crowd with nobody knowing that you gave

3950
02:23:42,959 --> 02:23:46,000
the band all that weed that they smoked

3951
02:23:44,879 --> 02:23:48,079
and now they're playing for the whole

3952
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:49,359
Red Rocks venue or whatever. Like that's

3953
02:23:48,079 --> 02:23:51,600
the highlight. Like that's the coolest

3954
02:23:49,359 --> 02:23:54,159
part. That's cool. Yeah, that's really

3955
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:56,720
cool. I think that's a a perfect thing

3956
02:23:54,159 --> 02:23:59,200
to a perfect way to answer that question

3957
02:23:56,719 --> 02:24:00,959
