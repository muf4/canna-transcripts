19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,680
on some of the videos that we' been

20

making and when I started to talk to him

21
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,200
I realized that he was somebody that we

22
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:15,599

37
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,640
like I just wanted to make a comment

38
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:01,000
like I do normally when I like something

39
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,239
you know um I think uh

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,519
it's quite a lot to explain but I will

41
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:08,318
be quite short about things but uh I've

42
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,719
been uh growing up I mean I was born in

43
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:13,679
the end of ' 70s in

44
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:16,680
Yugoslavia uh and particularly in a

45
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,519
place called Slovenia today because this

46
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:24,560
was one other country when I was born

47
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:26,200
you know so Yugoslavia was uh you I

48
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,000
don't know we will not do some

49
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:31,159
Geographic uh lecture now here but

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,080
Yugoslavia was one country that consists

51
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:36,400
of many other many countries that are

52
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:39,319
today separate uh but this is basically

53
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,000
Slovenia Croatia Bosnia Serbia

54
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:46,598
Montenegro Macedonia and Kosovo we are

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,280
we are the Balkans uh we belong to the

56
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:51,598
the European Peninsula that is called

57
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,280
the Balkans we are called South

58
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,878
Europe uh we are not the Western Europe

59
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:01,280
because the Western Europe starts uh

60
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:04,318
like 10 m from my house it is uh because

61
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,840
I am separated by a river uh between

62
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,958
Slovenia and

63
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:14,158
Austria uh historically this is a very

64
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:16,598
very um interesting place for war times

65
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:18,719
and blood shedding you know like it was

66
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:22,280
a lot of blood was spilled here in this

67
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:25,799
region a long time ago and you know it's

68
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,000
like there was a lot of War so uh

69
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:31,400
culture wise uh I've been growing up on

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,519
a property where I've been actually

71
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:38,000
exposed to a garden uh as a young child

72
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,719
by my grandmother I've been growing up

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,120
in a garden you know like there was no

74
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:46,919
babysitters you know so my grandmother

75
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,840
just said go outside you know so I went

76
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:52,639
outside so maybe in mesino where maybe

77
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,878
most of the people are that least I know

78
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:59,199
uh is uh the same thing it's a wild we

79
00:03:55,878 --> 00:04:00,318
have Slovenia is uh half of the country

80
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,759
is Forest

81
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:05,759
we have 2 million people it's uh 20

82
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:07,798
times smaller than

83
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,719
California

84
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:14,000
um mostly people have Gardens here and

85
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,919
still today people have Garden at home

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,399
so everybody grows

87
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:22,800
food uh so basic uh thing is that also

88
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,599
everybody that not grow today or

89
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,759
something in the sense of not cannabis

90
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:33,680
food or cannabis too is uh you inh

91
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:36,639
herited that maybe a land even if you

92
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,879
are not growing up in a Countryside you

93
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,639
know because slovenians normally they

94
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,879
are owners of land so there is a lot of

95
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,360
culture of

96
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:48,759
gardening that's the first thing so

97
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,280
normally when you when you have a

98
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:54,080
culture like this that everybody has a

99
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:57,038
garden an eye that been exposed to a

100
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:59,839
garden as a child and been growing up

101
00:04:57,038 --> 00:05:02,360
without internet without phone without

102
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:05,560
the things that we know today as common

103
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:10,439
common sense uh you you I've been

104
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:13,680
interested in um um ants and uh

105
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:16,478
butterflies and this stuff first because

106
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,639
you know as a kid you search for that

107
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:21,038
but after a while I realize today

108
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,519
because I'm dealing uh a lot with uh

109
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:27,839
plants today uh is that you uh you I was

110
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:30,359
exposed with plants all my life so I

111
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,599
came to to the realization

112
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,160
in life um I won't tell you my whole

113
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,319
story because this would be for another

114
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:41,400
podcast but how I come to it yeah is um

115
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:43,680
my parents were very uh open-minded uh

116
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:48,318
in that times and they were like the

117
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:51,600
Hipp generation you know and um we was

118
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:54,319
uh also cannabis is itself as a plant

119
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,720
was um my grand-grandfather was a hemp

120
00:05:54,319 --> 00:06:00,639
farmer in Old Time Yugoslavia so we used

121
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,440
to grow hemp you know hemp we I as a

122
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,759
child I know a machine it's not a

123
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:09,038
machine it was a it was a bit cutting

124
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:12,479
knife for cutting hemp stems you know

125
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:16,038
because you what we grew my my my

126
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:19,199
ancestors grew hemp was because of fiber

127
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:21,519
they grew it for rope they grew it for

128
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,240
you know it was a material you know

129
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:27,959
nobody smoked him I uhy can I ask you a

130
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:31,680
question real fast yeah please so you

131
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:33,680
said that most people have land in

132
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,959
Slovenia yes

133
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,240
um to me that was already something

134
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:40,279
that's very interesting because in the

135
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,079
US it's not like that you wouldn't have

136
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:46,000
a corporate uh you know some corporation

137
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,719
that would come and buy uh 1,000 hectar

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,598
of land here you know you don't have

139
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:54,880
that so people own their own land they

140
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:56,719
they uh and even if they if I own it if

141
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,598
they never been to a farm because they

142
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,360
live in lublana and the grandmother and

143
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:05,719
grandfather died now so you inherit

144
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,759
inherit land you know it's yours now

145
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:12,199
many people from Liana that don't own

146
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:15,000
land in that sense they got um

147
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,280
possibility to to to not even Liana

148
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,038
everywhere you know what I mean in

149
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:22,079
Slovenia but I was living so long time

150
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:24,519
in lublana so that's why I tell the this

151
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,918
capital of Slovenia is you know we we

152
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:30,038
are a 2 million people country it's like

153
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:32,399
if you have a one big Capital the third

154
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:35,159
of population is there because of it's a

155
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,279
student place and it's the place where

156
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,199
centralization kicked in here really

157
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:42,478
fast so we are politically really like

158
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:45,199
centralized country you know so the the

159
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:48,079
peripheral I call the countryside is

160
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,759
quite um yeah

161
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:53,120
it's how I tell it it's harder to live

162
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,439
here but it's better to live here you

163
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,158
know I guess my question that I wanted

164
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,879
to know was is there poverty there cuz

165
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:03,560
like when you said that everyone owns

166
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:05,720
land it sounds like very it is a poverty

167
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,478
but it's not a poverty in sense of your

168
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,280
country you know we don't have people on

169
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:12,279
the street here in the countryside you

170
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:15,799
have some some people in the street in

171
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:17,878
lbl because there are heroin addicts or

172
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,319
uh I don't know Fenton kicked in also

173
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:22,560
now and you know that that's stuff but

174
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,919
in the countryside you don't have that

175
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,280
it's it's not there so there is no

176
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:29,878
poverty in that s they're alcoholics you

177
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:32,958
know because we are a nation that do a

178
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:36,320
lot of wine we have a wine culture like

179

182
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:48,200
exposure of sun here is also at the

183
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:52,200
place I live is in East uh North East

00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,480
Slovenia yeah which is south of Austria

185
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,959
so uh this is the place that the most

186
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,360
the sun is in the year you're like south

187
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:02,278
side of the mountain range yeah southide

188
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,800
of the mountain range and also we have

189
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:07,799
panonian region which is you know here

190
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:10,359
was panonian sea thousands years ago you

191
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:12,519
know uh Slovenia is a small country but

192
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,560
we have like different regions where I

193
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:17,600
live is flat then you have the little

194
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:20,319
mountain region and then have a high

195
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,200
mountain region to the Alps julan Alps

196
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,040
and then you have the seaside yeah uh

197
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,959
and a lot of wheat is also forest all

198
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:30,159
the time Slovenia is traditionally a

199
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:33,879
country that uh is growing wheat since I

200
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:36,078
was born you know like because it's a

201
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:38,120
you know sometimes people think that

202
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:42,120
wheed has been only

203
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:46,360
grown you know as a land race uh and

204
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:48,560
then it came to Western Europe and USA

205
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,360
and Canada yeah but it came to

206
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:52,518
Yugoslavia and to all the other

207
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,680
countries that it's all tradition here

208
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:58,200
you know um but the different kind of

209
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,439
cultural background uh with a different

210
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:04,720
sense of the con

211
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,360
we treat Canabis as medicine here uh

212
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,839
Canabis is not I mean it's a

213
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,399
recreational drug of course but cannabis

214
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:14,360
as a in a sense of cultural what I know

215
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:17,720
now that Slovenia will legalize soon I

216
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:21,120
think and it will be because of medical

217
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,639
uh I have a question really quick so um

218
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,440
since it sounds like they they may

219
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:27,799
legalize soon um what what do the

220
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,079
current um like what is the current

221
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:33,278
political stance on Canada AB like do

222
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:37,599
they do they ever arrest people for it

223
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:39,600
or like um yeah and and I guess like

224
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,519
that would be like one question for like

225
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,839
does like someone small who's just

226
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,000
growing at home for themselves as

227
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,480
medicine as you would say um like would

228
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,919
they ever be prosecuted or would it just

229
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,959
be people who are doing it yes yes I can

230
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:56,919
tell you many things is um there been

231
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:59,799
many cases now in the last years uh

232
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:01,799
people have been prosecuted for uh all

233
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:04,199
kind of growing because there is a lot

234
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:06,399
of people who grow here I mean there is

235
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,920
you don't even know now anymore if it's

236
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,839
left right wing people you know we don't

237
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:13,360
have like this political system of two-

238
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:15,160
party system here it's many parties it's

239
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,639
like the Christians and the others and

240
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:20,679
the one and the green ones and you know

241
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:23,839
let's like that so we treat uh Canabis

242
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:26,199
as a cultural plant and

243
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,519
um for example there there have been

244
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:32,759
cases that guys been growing 5 kilo of

245
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:36,200

249
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:47,278
giving it to people and they they've

250
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:48,838

00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,799
they've been growing and they've been

252
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:54,480

253
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:57,559
giving it out to people who are sick

254
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,839

255
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:03,078
medical certification

256

342
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:18,879
it was a culture and then I called zigy

343
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:21,599
up and say where is Ja bong you know

344
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:24,838

345
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:28,278
said what is uh he's been arrested in

346
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:30,160

security of High Times cannabis cops in

350
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:42,519
the 9s you know he was there so I think

351
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:45,519
he did some shady business then and he

352
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:47,839
was in prison I don't know 2 years or

353
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,720
something everybody knows today about

354
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,560
this because he's telling his story also

355
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:56,440
that's why I tell it open here so Alex

356
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:57,518
when he went out of prison um started

357
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,360
this

358
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:04,359
ICBC which is actually a a business

359
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,199

368
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,679

382
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,919
The Story About Slovenia like this I'm

383
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,880
admiring him because he opened uh some

384
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:18,480
window he says that Slovenia is the most

385
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,559
tolerant country for Canabis in Europe

386
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,120
or the world and I was like what you

387
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:27,000
know and actually he explains like this

388
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:29,479
you can sit anywhere in any Cafe in

389
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,759
lublana or outside

390
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,240
and smoke a

391
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:38,158
joint which is true you

392
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:41,480
can uh nobody will call the police

393
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:44,440
nobody they will they will tell you in

394
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:47,679
certain places definitely please put it

395
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:50,840
out but they will never call the

396
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,640
police you know what I mean you will not

397
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:56,480
have a problem because of that it is

398
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:59,120
like come on can you step like 10 ms

399
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,279
away or you know and then come back to

400
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:03,918
or I don't know you know it the smoke

401
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:06,000
might be bothering people so they'll ask

402
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,120
you to move away

403
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,919
but same is like a cigarette yeah and

404
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,759
also the wheat culture because so many

405
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:16,559
people you know left right wing uh

406
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:20,079
because Rick Simpson was in Slovenia so

407
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:21,678
long time already um Rick Simpson

408
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:25,158
everybody knows about Rick Simpson I

409
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:28,480
think yeah he went in Exile from Canada

410
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:31,000
into the world and he actually stayed in

411
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:35,279
the balans I think he's married to a

412
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,440
Croatian woman now or with her and he

413
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:40,918
had a stroke that's why he's not present

414
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,679
anymore on the internet so uh actually

415
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,640
Rick Simpson is somebody that is not a

416
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:47,798
grower you know but he's been spreading

417
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,000
the word about wheat and he's been

418
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:52,119
growing actually in can in Canada at

419
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,519
that time and he's been making a lot of

420
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:57,119
this oil which is essential for

421
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:59,599
Slovenian story because we are the

422
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,798
nation of Rick Simpson steers oil you

423
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,359
know like there is so many Gardens there

424
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:06,599
is old

425
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:08,639
grandmothers uh that grow cannabis

426
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:12,519
because of the oil nobody smoke joints

427
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:15,240
from this type of people you know but

428
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:17,720
they they they grow it for oil and of

429
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:21,120
course there is a longtime culture of

430
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,960
smok economies here also of course yeah

431
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:26,038
like everywhere you were telling me a

432
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,120
little bit about how in Slovenia you

433
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:30,079
know it's tolerant to smoke but you

434
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:33,038
aren't allowed to grow or you're not

435
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:34,918
allowed to harvest flour so I think that

436
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:38,240
would be a something before we talk

437
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:40,799
about your business tell us about that

438
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:44,279
in Slovenia wheat is absolutely illegal

439
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:46,359
that means the plant is already illegal

440
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:49,279
that's what I want to tell the plant in

441
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:51,798
Slovenia is illegal but it's been used

442
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,038
so much that it's you know even if it's

443
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:56,599
illegal it's

444
00:20:53,038 --> 00:21:00,359
still it's weak you

445
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:02,038
know like few hundred k M from here is I

446
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:04,519
mean it's very near the border to

447
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:06,599
Hungary but in Hungary there is some

448
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:11,319
feral wheat

449
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:14,798
growing everywhere it's Canabis but it's

450
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:16,558
0.2 THC or something but it's FAL it's

451
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:20,359
feral you know so it grows everywhere

452
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:23,519
like wild wheat wild wild and nobody

453
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:26,558
touches it because it's really I mean

454
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:28,639
you know somebody would say yeah it's we

455
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:31,678
can work with it yeah you should but I

456
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,880
it's not my life you know you know I

457
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,840
don't have time for this but uh this is

458
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:40,240
feral wheed which is really wild wild so

459
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:41,038
the culture of Canabis here is quite old

460
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,278
very

461
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:46,480
old that's why people you know one thing

462
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:48,359
a difference between USA and the place

463
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,240
where I

464
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:53,278
live it is always been

465
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,240
illegal but it's never been so

466
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:58,798
prosecutive you know if you have a few

467
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:01,440
few plans they will give you a bill

468
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:04,158
nobody will put you in prison for that

469
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,120
ever it's been since I've been growing

470
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,200
up like this so it's still legal and

471
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:11,239
people don't really care so much about

472
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:15,480
it you know that's why legalization took

473
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:17,679
so long because it was not so uh you

474
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,720
know you you you would not go to jail

475
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,759
because of five to 10 plants you know

476
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,558
you would

477
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:28,079
not definitely I mean people went to

478
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:31,720
jail but they normally did other stuff

479
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:33,759
too yeah you know they have like I know

480
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,960
I mean one friend of mine I will not

481
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:41,158
tell his name he had 300 kilo of wheat

482
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:44,079
been harvested from a greenhouse Fresh

483
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:47,559
So 300 kilo would be how much 100 kilo

484
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:51,119
dry 600 700 lb oh okay you're talking

485
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:55,000
about dry he was in prison for one and a

486
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,000
half years and he's

487
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:01,359
out you know what I mean it's like you

488
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:04,038
will not spend your life in prison

489
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:06,759
because of wheat so that's why people

490
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:10,319
made the decision also to grow big here

491
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:12,400
they do so they did they you know I will

492
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:15,960
not talk about too much but uh it's

493
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,159
still illegal here so have in mind yeah

494
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,679
there still there's still a risk but

495
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:23,278
it's just less it's still a risk of

496
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:26,320
course yeah nobody is story go ahead

497
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:30,319
yeah the story you told me about like

498
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:31,918
you can grow um weed as long as you

499
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:34,558
don't Harvest it that what makes it

500
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,360
illegal was that in Austria Austria of

501
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,079
course oh okay that's why I got confused

502
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:40,479
so we'll talk about that in a moment

503
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:43,399
that's why because I live on the border

504
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,839
to Austria and Slovenia I've been

505
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,200
growing up here I've been born in

506
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:51,119
Austria because my mother worked here in

507
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:54,080
the town it's a town from the 13th

508
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:57,879
century it's a town that is like known

509
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:59,199
for uh thermal Spas you know tourism is

510
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,480
here

511
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:05,278
um and it's like for all people that

512
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,440
want to enjoy their life on the end of

513
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:10,359
life it's a very quality place it's

514
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,679
beautiful it's surrounded by castles and

515
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:17,399
and forests and we have good breweries

516
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:22,840
here and we have a good uh Nursery here

517
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:25,320
you know so I uh the law in Austria is

518
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:29,038
like this you can grow any kind of

519
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:33,639
Canabis any kind of Canabis plant

520
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:37,519
cannabis is not a drug THC Delta 9

521
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:40,480
substance is the drug so until the

522
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:43,278
Cannabis flowers there is no

523
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,278
drug you see they are

524
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:50,240
practical

525
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:52,839
um in the sense of the even you can go

526
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,839
that far that I would assume that if you

527
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:58,599
would grow at home the plant till the

528
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:02,678
end until it flowers and you would not

529
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:04,918
cut one flower from the plant and you

530
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:07,880
would have a police raid and they would

531
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:11,080
not find any dry flower in your house

532
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:14,080
not any clue that you would use it and

533
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:17,678
you say to them that you actually use it

534
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:20,240
for uh aroma therapy because you go with

535
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,559
your hands on the back to the plant and

536
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,079
you smell on

537
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:27,960
it and that is your aroma therapy every

538
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:29,639
judge in the country will free you

539
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,120
because there is no there is no

540
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:36,080
production of drugs when you don't cut a

541
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:38,558
flow from it you know what I mean it's

542
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:41,480
crazy it's kind of like opium like

543
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:44,158
poppies so like in the US as long as you

544
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,679
don't cut it that's that's right you

545
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:50,240
know until then you know cuz in in the

546
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:53,278
US it's legal to grow uh poppy flowers

547
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,038
it's illegal to cut them and you know

548
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:59,640
make them you know drop the sap that you

549
00:25:56,038 --> 00:26:02,038
know becomes you know op yeah then you

550
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:05,640
produce the drug at that moment when you

551
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:08,359
make this action you know so in Austria

552
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,399
it's like this that there is many many

553
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:14,959
shops with uh living plants already you

554
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:20,599
know I used to buy clones in Austria 20

555
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:22,558
years ago as a grower yeah so I turned

556
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:26,519
my illegality into

557
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:29,240
legality and I made the business I went

558
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:32,319
over uh the the the border here and I

559
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:35,319
said okay I will make a company and I

560
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:37,240
will sell clones and they check you if

561
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:39,960
you are uh you know if you have any

562
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:43,960
record you know if you did something I

563
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:47,360
didn't so I was clean so I could do that

564
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:50,440
and I made a facility uh with different

565
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:53,719
cultivars that I gathered uh for 20

566
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:57,038
years because I have uh I know a lot of

567
00:26:53,720 --> 00:27:00,399
people that grow that are growing I'm a

568
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:03,398
grower h still but I'm a legal grower

569
00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:05,398
now you know what I mean yeah I just

570
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:09,759
turned it into a business you know you

571
00:27:05,398 --> 00:27:13,398
know I have four employees now um we

572
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:16,879
have also another uh company which our

573
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:20,798
company is name is her betics her betics

574
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:24,679
is like herb ethics you know the herb

575
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:27,960
and the ethics so atics is a company in

576
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:34,080
Slovenia we have extraction company we

577
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:37,360
do extract with uh Buton gas with N1 gas

578
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:40,960
which is the most clean butane which is

579
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:45,759
allowed in food production uh in

580
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:48,200
Europe uh so we extract all kind of uh

581
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:52,798
materials

582
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:55,159
uh all kind of uh uh biomaterials you

583
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:59,038
can get yeah so we're not extracting

584
00:27:55,159 --> 00:28:02,278
only cannabis uh which is in Slovenia we

585
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:04,879
extract CBD and CBG cannabies we are not

586
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:07,880
allowed to extract THC because we are

587
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:11,278
not pharmaceutical satified company with

588
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:14,039
GMP status we we're not having that yet

589
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:16,919
we try to in the future but you know we

590
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:19,919
are working on that for a long time um

591
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:23,399
GMP means good manufactur practice that

592
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:27,038
means this is the standard for uh for uh

593
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:28,959
drugs you know you can actually you know

594
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,119
uh sell it then for big money you know

595
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,000
what I mean but we're not uh we actually

596
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:38,079
do a lot of other extractions for you

597
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,798
know we do uh serum oils which is which

598
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:44,519
means you get grape seed oil and uh uh

599
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:47,038
um different kind of seeds that we can

600
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:49,720
extract the oils from this is the oil

601
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:53,558
which is called absolute oils and you

602
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:56,880
can use them in any shampoo any skin

603
00:28:53,558 --> 00:29:00,319
cream normally the the the Cosmetic

604
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:04,320
industry comes to and buys this you know

605
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:06,319
so we actually did this but in Austria

606
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:09,599
we have this facility with Canabis

607
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:14,119
plants uh which is specializing in we

608
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:17,759
have now 35 different cultivar in our

609
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:21,038
library um I know Gabby

610
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:23,679
knows I've been saying a few days ago

611
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:26,038
the the list he knows about it is it's a

612
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,600
very interesting link I think because

613
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:31,759
I'm a I'm a nerd you know

614
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:34,359
I'm a cannabis nerd I'm listening you

615
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:36,398
know how I come to Gabby because I

616
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:38,839
listen to Nato dog for years and I

617
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:42,518
listen to SK every time I hear something

618
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:44,959
about SK VA I go I want to hear it you

619
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:47,798
know like this guy was so in cnit for me

620
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,759
and the whole genetic that uh I really

621
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:53,960
thank this guy for for some genetics

622
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:56,038
that I acquired uh in

623
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:58,880
spanis uh over the

624
00:29:56,038 --> 00:30:01,558
years um

625
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,880
that I know the you know the American

626
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:07,038
genetics are very different from the

627
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:10,240
Europeans first of all something that

628
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:13,519
you grow now there it's so craft and

629
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,038
it's so made for also for looks

630
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,919
and some of them are interesting some of

631
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:21,480
them are very boring you know it's like

632
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,679
that it's the truth you know not yeah it

633
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:26,200
is actually some of them are really

634
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:29,600
interesting because we as we we people

635
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:32,240
we appreciate this but when it comes to

636
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:34,278
some genetics that you uh because the

637
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,079
the lack of uh you know when you go only

638
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:41,440
for THC levels when you breed only for

639
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:44,759
THC up you know then I think the it uh

640
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:48,480
the game changes and you lose some very

641
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:52,038
good effects on your body I think that's

642
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:55,319
my opinion because you can smoke uh or

643
00:30:52,038 --> 00:30:59,919
consume cannabis that is um very much

644
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:59,918
less DC and you have a better

645
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:06,000
experience yeah I

646
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:07,319
mean the THC levels there's two things

647
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,200
about it number

648
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:13,798
one in most cases there's a good chance

649
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,480
that it's not accurate right because

650
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:18,038
here the testing Labs you know

651
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,599
everybody's going to take their weed to

652
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:21,200
the lab that says that they've got the

653
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:25,319
highest percentage of

654
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:28,319
THC the other thing is we don't really

655
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:30,519
know everything about cannabis or even

656
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:34,638
maybe the smallest bit about cannabis

657
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:37,200
about what gets you high and you know

658
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:39,079
all the other cannaboids that could be

659
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:43,679
in cannabis and the

660
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:47,158
tpin and what effect they have when you

661
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:50,038
consume it so I mean I was telling you a

662
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:51,440
story yesterday the chem dog it's one of

663
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:54,638
the most potent

664
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,600
weed you know I've ever smoked I I still

665
00:31:54,638 --> 00:32:00,199
think to this day but it didn't test

666
00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:03,240
very high yeah you know why as far as

667
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:06,600
the cannaboids go ahead I have a theory

668
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:09,638
uh it's because of turpins tpin are

669
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:12,319
consisting from mono and from CES so

670
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:15,479
they are like combination of Co it's a

671
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:17,918
code and it's so complicated that I

672
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:21,558
think we need like 50 years of research

673
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:24,679
for that that we will we will little bit

674
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:29,599
understand why you know is tping all the

675
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:32,559
time I mean we have the Shiva the old

676
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:34,798
Shiva um we call it Shiva this is one of

677
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:36,480
the strs on on his list that when I saw

678
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:39,440
it I was like oh my God I started dra I

679
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,720
mean we tasted Shiva for Content Paul

680
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,480
Hornby did this which is very

681
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:47,120
interesting guy I have to tell you about

682
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:49,558
him Paul Hornby is a Canadian he came

683
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:52,038
he's he died a few years ago he was the

684
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:54,440
researcher of Canabis a very very good

685
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:58,558
one you know he's been working cannabis

686
00:32:54,440 --> 00:33:01,558
for 30 years um and he's been actually

687
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:05,879
paid by the government of Canada to do

688
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:08,278
it research and he he told me also that

689
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,720
the tpin are the the key to the thing

690
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:15,798
you know everything every substance that

691
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:19,200
you have like CBD or THC or THC V or any

692
00:33:15,798 --> 00:33:21,200
kind CBG doesn't matter the Turpin have

693
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,840
to be there also because of the end to

694
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:27,360
rush effect you know there is this kind

695
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:29,119
of thing that we still can explain today

696
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:32,240
but for for example the wheat from the

697
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:35,000
the equator has a very specific turent

698
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,000
profile right right the wheat from

699
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,480
Afghanistan and Pakistan which is

700
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:44,319
actually OG and the indicas has also

701
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:47,679
very very similar uh uh picture of the

702
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:50,839
Turpin again you know and but we don't

703
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,278
still know the sequences between those

704
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:55,158
it will take us so many years I think

705
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:58,638
it's it's a very nice science actually

706
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:59,960
to do I I would assume because somebody

707
00:33:58,638 --> 00:34:02,558
hopefully our children will figure that

708
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:05,919
out for us I think so too I mean I hope

709
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:08,358
so it's just uh the wheat the Shiva that

710
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:13,440
I was I mentioning before she will get

711
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:16,878
you couch locked with 17 or 18% THC only

712
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:20,960
what she has yep but I just I just threw

713
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:24,199
one that came out at 16% and it uh but

714
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:27,838
it was very very Stony put me right into

715
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:29,719
the couch and I um and I tried the other

716
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:32,320
one that we grew right in the same room

717
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:35,439
same fertilizers and everything and it

718
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,519
tested at I believe was like 28% and it

719
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,918
just didn't do anything for

720
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:44,398
me yeah and on the other hand some Yeti

721
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,838
OG that I have for years from lompa

722
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:49,719
farms test for

723
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:54,119
25% I can smoke it I mean not in the

724
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:57,279
morning but you can smoke it's uplifting

725
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:59,320
High it makes it's a headband actually y

726
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,920
so it's it's like it's a back Cross of

727
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:05,039
headband so it makes you it doesn't make

728
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:08,720
you like this Stone like the Shiva cut

729
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:11,279
which has less percent a lot like 6%

730
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:13,879
less or something on the test we we had

731
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,960
it from the same lab you know it's like

732
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,280
but I don't believe in this kind of test

733
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,320
anymore because it's just a PCR test I

734
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:24,040
think you know like like you would um

735
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:26,838
it's not so it's not so accurate as we

736
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:29,320
think actually I think so right now I

737
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:32,199
think in the future will be a much more

738
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:34,480
accurate picture of of the testing

739
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:37,759
because they will uh in they will also

740
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:40,039
include the turpins you know they they

741
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:43,119
do here in the

742
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:46,000
US in the US when you do testing you can

743
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,160
get the Turpin tested and you know they

744
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,679
test for other cannaboids and stuff like

745
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:54,799
that but we still don't know what that

746
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:58,879
means so for instance if it you know

747
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:03,240
something tests at 2% THC

748
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,838
well oh not TC Turpin yeah okay well the

749
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:08,358
the different Turf Pines could have a

750
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:12,239
different effect on people and maybe it

751
00:36:08,358 --> 00:36:16,559
only takes 1% of those tpin to have a

752
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:20,719
dramatic effect where other um strains

753
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:23,358
might test that four or even 5% terpenes

754
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:26,639
but does that mean that it's going to be

755
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:28,759
more potent no I mean often it'll mean

756
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:32,679
that you can smell it more you know

757
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:35,119
which is nice Definitely yes and and

758
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:37,598
maybe taste it but as far as the

759
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,920
effect we just don't know like you said

760
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,760
hopefully our children will figure this

761
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:45,200
out for us yes and also you know uh here

762
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:47,720
in Slovenia there is a lot of farmers

763
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:52,519
that grow in the seaside region they

764
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:54,318
grow uh lavender a lot I have a very

765
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:58,358
good friend that is a weed grower and

766
00:36:54,318 --> 00:37:00,719
also a lavender grower you know and uh

767
00:36:58,358 --> 00:37:04,039
he's testing his material so he says for

768
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:05,039
the Le lavanda that is tasting normally

769
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:09,519
for

770
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:10,199
6% of turpins but he has two strains of

771
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,679
the

772
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:15,239
lavender not the uh cannabis the normal

773
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:19,838
lavanda you

774
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:23,118
know but the one with 4% that he has

775
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:27,039
smells much much more

776
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:29,358
powerful explain it to me where the 6%

777
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:32,480
does not smell that much than the the

778
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:37,480
four you know because of only testing

779
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:39,760
for tpin TP tpin yeah mm so but you know

780
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:42,760
the problem is they make the steam

781
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,920
distillation very old old this is 3,000

782
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:49,079
year old technique technique to to to

783
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,400
get out the turpins you know I told them

784
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:54,079
already that they should tast it in my

785
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,280
facility with the butane because we will

786
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,560
make it on a lower temperature and we

787
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,200
will get the full spectrum you know from

788
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,639
the smell only you know because the

789
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:05,719
Turpin you can with butane is beautiful

790
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:08,480
to extract the turpins you know it's

791
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:11,480
really yeah it's better than any other

792
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,440
so well I I also wonder just because of

793
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,280
the um like even within cannabis we only

794
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,318
test for Turpin but there's other

795
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,960
volatile organic compounds that are

796
00:38:18,318 --> 00:38:24,000
giving off a lot of the smells that that

797
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,960
we're picking up um you know like uh

798
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,760
like a lot of people hunt for like

799
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,159
roadkill skunk smell and stuff like that

800
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,760
that can't be explained through a

801
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:35,598
specific turine profile but can be

802
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:39,160
explained through things like um methyl

803
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:42,960
groups and um different uh different

804
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:46,078
other um like carboxy groups it it uh it

805
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,920
doesn't necessarily just fall into uh

806
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,240
tpin so it's I ALS I also just wonder

807
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,159
how much of that is playing a role in

808
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:55,719
the different effects felt by different

809
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:58,399
uh absolutely and the thing is that you

810
00:38:55,719 --> 00:39:01,679
mention it already now you know

811
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,480
the thing is that it has to go on the

812
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:08,039
the research I think until we didn't

813
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,119
research it we don't know I have here I

814
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:12,880

your first you were high you had high

848
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,280
times we had grow magazine from Germany

849
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:03,960

guano and the bad guano and always was

853
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:16,000
guano we knew about I was reading about

854
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:17,838
guano Wars man the wars of guano you

855
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,079
know they they were having Wars for that

856
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:22,838
for bad [ __ ] you in South America you

857
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:25,400
know what I mean yeah in the old times

858
00:41:22,838 --> 00:41:28,000
you know in the you can Google it it's

859
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:31,519
true they were having pirating like they

860
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,679
were fighting for sugar and you know all

861
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:35,199
kind of stuff they were fighting for the

862
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:39,318
bad [ __ ] you

863
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:41,078
know yeah you know yeah such a good

864
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:43,199
fertilizer yeah it's still actually a

865
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:46,800
problem there's still actually a lot of

866
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:48,919
um uh slavery and child slavery used to

867
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,680
collect different bird guanas and bad

868
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,838
guanas out of South America and it's

869
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:55,919
it's one of the least uh sustainable

870
00:41:52,838 --> 00:41:59,559
products on the market laed as organic

871
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,159
mhm yeah absolutely I to people about it

872
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:05,078
problematic absolutely problematic one

873
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:07,719
of my friends from libl went to Jamaica

874
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:09,599
and he was in some caves and they were

875
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:12,078
harvesting some guano because he was

876
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,760
like this guy of wheat you know like

877
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,240
let's go Harvest some guano you know

878
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:20,720
they went into some caves they harvest

879
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:23,159
some guano but then he almost lost his

880
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:26,519
lung because he's breathing this [ __ ]

881
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:27,960
you know the dust yeah it's I you know

882
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:29,880
it's funny

883
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:33,159
I don't want to get too far off topic

884
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:35,800
but um you know when we talk about the

885
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:38,960
difference between growing with minerals

886
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:42,720
like hydron nutrient Organics people for

887
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:46,838
some reason think Organics are clean but

888
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:50,159
like it's literally [ __ ] and yes you

889
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:52,358
know and like wolf said there are you

890
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:54,920
know children dying and getting you know

891
00:42:52,358 --> 00:42:58,119
lung diseases because they're harvesting

892
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:01,079
this stuff without proper protection

893
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:04,720
and without pay it's it's slavery it's

894
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:08,359
it's terrible yes yes so people should

895
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:11,279
be aware I think this need to be aware

896
00:43:08,358 --> 00:43:14,558
yeah we don't sell guano in my shop I

897
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:17,760
mean I I used to grow with it but I

898
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:20,599
don't do it anymore you know I don't cuz

899
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:23,520
it's I know it's also exploiting n

900
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:25,960
nature you know when you buy one you buy

901
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:28,358
it because some they destroy these

902
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:32,480
islands which is actually inhabited by

903
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:34,239
birds only or Penguins only you know

904
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,000
what I

905
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:39,078
mean like a whole ecosystem within the

906
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,880
caves that the that the bats live in and

907
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:43,519
so once you're the guano you destroy the

908
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,800
the ecosystem and some of those

909
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:48,199
ecosystems are you know they're older

910
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,039
than a lot of human civilizations

911
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:53,558
they're they're thousands and thousands

912
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:56,199
of years old yeah we have this issue

913
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:58,519
maybe I can talk about this now because

914
00:43:56,199 --> 00:44:00,358
uh people have problem s now here in

915
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:02,639
Slovenia there is a lot of outdoor

916
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:04,880
growing let me tell you like maybe in

917
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:06,078
Austria also there is a lot of people

918
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,838
that grow

919
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:14,400
outside uh the problem is that from year

920
00:44:08,838 --> 00:44:17,759
to year uh I see uh a lot of um more and

921
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,280
more increase of different Predator uh

922
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,359
you know uh

923
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:25,000
um we have this from the corn fields

924
00:44:22,358 --> 00:44:28,078
there is this worms you know eating our

925
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,760
butts then is this worm goes inside of

926
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,920
your steam it's crazy how much of it

927
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:35,800
changed because there is no more winter

928
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:41,159
here winter used to be minus

929
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:45,240
20° now they are like if there is - one

930
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:49,199
2 you know you here used to be a lot of

931
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:53,598
snow half a meter now there is no snow

932
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:55,480
since the last 5 years wow yeah that's

933
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,079
how it's going on you know people think

934
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,000
global warming doesn't exist

935
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,960
you know and the Earth is the proof is

936
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,679
right there in

937
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,800
Slovenia and so you're saying you're

938
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:09,440
getting a lot more of these uh different

939
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,000
um tests like these different Wars

940
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:15,200
because uh we never had them before and

941
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:19,239
now we fighting you know how we fight

942
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:22,519
against them we plant late in the season

943
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:26,479
because uh sometimes you can escape

944
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:29,719
uh the time when this the the the

945
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:34,440
butterfly goes and uh puts the eggs into

946
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:38,239
your plants is maybe later you plant the

947
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:41,318
later he he can do it so this year we

948
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:44,919
planted already some Growers that they

949
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:48,880
went they came and they said uh on the

950
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:51,400
end of July they get bigger plants you

951
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,480
know so they put them outside and there

952
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:57,358
is not so much problems if you put them

953
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:59,519
out too early they are full of warm they

954
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:03,159
are full of it's

955
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:06,159
catastrophic from here use any like

956
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:09,078
sorry do you use any sprays no most of

957
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:11,239
those people they don't want to because

958
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:13,839
we are used to grow organically here you

959
00:46:11,239 --> 00:46:16,679
know normally people never sprays their

960
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:18,920
plants even you know maybe in veget

961
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:22,598
vegetation when they are vegetative

962
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:24,760
plants but not in flower You Don't Spray

963
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:27,519
nothing on when it's flowering that's

964
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,200
that is like ridiculous you know for us

965
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:31,239
we

966
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:35,039
don't you consume it you know like you

967
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:36,679
will put it in your body no way you know

968
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:39,719
so there I don't even want to spray

969
00:46:36,679 --> 00:46:41,519
organic stuff on flour you can you can I

970
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:43,759
don't want to like you know like not

971
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:46,079
even I you know spraying anything on

972
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,040
your flow is just is you know like for

973
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,760
instance people will spray products that

974
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:52,679
are considered acceptable for organic

975
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,480
cultivation that contain an oil but if

976
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:56,318
you spray an oil on your

977
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:01,559
flour you know you're going to be

978
00:46:56,318 --> 00:47:03,079
consuming that oil yes and so um I'm

979
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:05,519
sure Nick was going to say something

980
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:07,839
about products that we use here for

981
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:10,358
caterpillars oh yeah I was just thinking

982
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:13,799
like Bia basana or something that's just

983
00:47:10,358 --> 00:47:16,000
like a um like a m insecticide where

984
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:19,280
it's uh it's basically just like a a

985
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,599
predatory mushroom that just attacks the

986
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,400
um yeah people use that here in

987
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,280
agriculture yeah they I know about this

988
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,280
because they use it you know we are Farm

989
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,480
you know the plants that we grow here in

990
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:33,960
the area is all there is a lot of tomato

991
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:36,358
Growers and uh uh all kind of salads

992
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:40,480
here everybody has a garden you know so

993
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:44,358
there is all time alltime grow yeah um

994
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:48,838
what I think also is uh point would be

995
00:47:44,358 --> 00:47:52,000
that you um use nettle nettle you know

996
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:55,318
when you put nettle into water and you

997
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:58,519
sit it for 12 hours you can spray with

998
00:47:55,318 --> 00:48:02,079
it when you sit it for 24 hours you will

999
00:47:58,519 --> 00:48:04,000
kill your plants with it really yeah

1000
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,800
yeah it's so strong because it's so

1001
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,838
strong yeah it's so strong here um

1002
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:12,920
people just need dilute it more yeah you

1003
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:16,480
need to dilute it more and but actually

1004
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:17,240
everything what we need to know is in

1005
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,039
the

1006
00:48:17,239 --> 00:48:23,479
nature everything all the plants are

1007
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:26,000
there they have uh different uh uh

1008
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:27,639
elements so actually if you would

1009
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,920
ferment them

1010
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:32,118
you would get everything you know you

1011
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,599
would you don't need animal products to

1012
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:36,119
do that you know I'm not vegetarian you

1013
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:39,599
know I don't tell you because of that

1014
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:42,640
but I know that it's possible just the

1015
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:46,519
trace element you need for example

1016
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:50,318
cannabis as itself is uh a plant that

1017
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:52,599
consumes the most iron in the world

1018
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:55,159
there is no plant in the world that

1019
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:57,240
would consume more iron than

1020
00:48:55,159 --> 00:49:00,199
Canabis h

1021
00:48:57,239 --> 00:49:02,959
very interesting also they use cannabis

1022
00:49:00,199 --> 00:49:06,558
here in my region and in this area of

1023
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:10,199
the world as a cleaning of the soil

1024
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:12,960
remediation of soil sure when you put

1025
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:16,598
when you put hemp plants which is for me

1026
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:20,159
when somebody says hemp is not wheat or

1027
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:23,680
hemp is not Canabis it's Canabis it can

1028
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:25,879
it can fertilize your your your plants

1029
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:27,279
you know we have a lot of hemp growing

1030
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:30,160
in Slovenia

1031
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:34,559
a lot of hemp you know growing yeah so

1032
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:38,118
people who who who grow uh traditional

1033
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:40,640
uh plants you know let me say

1034
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:42,798
traditional have a problem sometimes

1035
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:45,558
because they are pollinated by hemp

1036
00:49:42,798 --> 00:49:48,719
fields in the in the

1037
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:50,680
area which is problematic you know how

1038
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:52,639
can you protect that you know because

1039
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:55,440
these things if if you have a rainy

1040
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:57,719
season and in this time you have luck

1041
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,720
but sometime it's very dry High season

1042
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:03,000
and then the Poland gets blown 10 kilm

1043
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:06,279
not three as they tell you I had really

1044
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,798
good clones outside years ago and there

1045
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:12,079
was this haa which I still have in my

1046
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:14,440
facility we call it the Isabella the

1047
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:17,359
good one the the one that smells so good

1048
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,519
you know it's it smells like Isabella uh

1049
00:50:17,358 --> 00:50:21,759
grapes I don't know if you know Isabella

1050
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:24,199
grapes with we have we have a wine

1051
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:27,119
region and these are blue grapes very

1052
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:30,279
big one they have really this um very

1053
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:32,680
sweet and they have this certain Aroma

1054
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:34,920
is is it for wine production it is for

1055
00:50:32,679 --> 00:50:38,318
wine production yeah is there is that I

1056
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,318
might know it if there is a French

1057
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:44,239
equivalent it is because French people

1058
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:46,960
came here 300 years ago and they made

1059
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:48,719
wine here so we still use their

1060
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,119
tradition to do it you know we have

1061
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:53,078
sparkling champagne wine which is not

1062
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:55,318
champagne because it's not from

1063
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:59,119
Champagne region you know but it's the

1064
00:50:55,318 --> 00:51:02,400
same grapes you know grown in our region

1065
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:04,440
with uh the same process of how you do

1066
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,280
champagne wine with sparkling you know

1067
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:09,679
the same thing you know it's not Crystal

1068
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,079
but but so these are called is Isabella

1069
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:15,519
grapes they are called Isabella but we

1070
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:18,318
call it yka WEA in my language we say

1071
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:21,400
Ura everybody knows what kind of and

1072
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:23,639
when people come and they buy my clone

1073
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,559
the wapa clone from Paradise seats that

1074
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:27,400
I have so long I got it from the

1075
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:30,599
mountains

1076
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:33,440
2015 I got it from mountain region in

1077
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:34,960
Slovenia I will not expose anybody but

1078
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,400
uh my friends I will tell from the

1079
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:41,679
mountains these are very old Growers

1080
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:44,880
they're older than me they teach me how

1081
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:47,358
to grow moms they teach me how to do

1082
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:50,680
clones and then I went to Austria and do

1083
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:52,440
my business you know very much later uh

1084
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:54,399
the culture is there but these people

1085
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:56,639
grow in they are living in the mountains

1086
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,960
maybe in mesino is the same you far away

1087
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:01,558
away from a from a city and you like to

1088
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:04,318
stay at home so these people don't go to

1089
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:06,119
shops to buy clones you know they keep

1090
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:08,079
their own moms their own selections

1091
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:09,318
their own in the beginning they were not

1092
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:12,559
depending on

1093
00:52:09,318 --> 00:52:15,318
nobody so the same thing a little little

1094
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:17,839
mesino a little California in our

1095
00:52:15,318 --> 00:52:20,920
country is there too but I will not tell

1096
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:23,798
which place because it's so

1097
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:26,559
small but it's in the mountains so these

1098
00:52:23,798 --> 00:52:29,719
are people who are who are depending on

1099
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:32,599
nature they cannot survive uh just like

1100
00:52:29,719 --> 00:52:34,679
that you know there is no shop you know

1101
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:36,920
it's very similar you know the stories

1102
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:39,318
that I hear from our countries I mean

1103
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:43,798
from California especially and from USA

1104
00:52:39,318 --> 00:52:47,199
as it is we are I mean we still the same

1105
00:52:43,798 --> 00:52:49,440
you know I don't know I mean we we speak

1106
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:52,358
different languages and everything but

1107
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,920
we are all the same people black white

1108
00:52:52,358 --> 00:52:57,358
Chinese you don't Name It We Are the

1109
00:52:54,920 --> 00:53:00,400
human race actually you should go

1110
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:02,639
together out in space without Wars and

1111
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:05,559
without anything you know this my idea

1112
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:09,078
of the future but you know I'm a I'm a

1113
00:53:05,559 --> 00:53:13,119
optimist so I like it cares yeah I like

1114
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:15,400
it yeah um so you're saying this uh this

1115
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:19,160
Isabella it smells like

1116
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:21,760
grapes it's very grapy yes mhm nice I I

1117

1118
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,559
that time those guys are like that you

1119
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:29,440

1120
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:33,280
few packs and they have the numbers you

1121
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:36,000
know the vaa number you know 25 or the

1122
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:38,960
vaa number three or the vaa number five

1123
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,440
you know it's and then the winner from

1124
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:45,880
those my vaa is the vaa number

1125
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:48,280
four and they never could grow it in

1126
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:51,640
their region because they are in the

1127
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:55,200
mountains but I live in the Flatlands in

1128
00:53:51,639 --> 00:53:57,879
my region outside she always performed

1129
00:53:55,199 --> 00:54:01,838
always no no mold

1130
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:04,400
nothing in their region she she didn't

1131
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:05,960
perform and they have another wapa which

1132
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,639
is called number

1133
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:13,119
two and the two I think they don't have

1134
00:54:09,639 --> 00:54:15,318
anymore but it performed for them and

1135
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,440
after a few years they came back to me

1136
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:19,400
and said can you give us the four again

1137
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:23,079

80s uh so that we dealer he quit to deal

1163
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:43,118
with but he got the customers that were

1164
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:46,279
used to come to this apartment so the

1165
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:49,358
guy you know my guy I call him lucky let

1166
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:53,319
let Call Him Lucky CU that was his name

1167
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:56,318
we call him lucky lucky took all his

1168
00:55:53,318 --> 00:55:58,199
customers so he started to grow wheat

1169
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:01,038
indoors also because he went to

1170
00:55:58,199 --> 00:56:03,838
Amsterdam in the beginning of the 8 '90s

1171
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:07,280
and he saw the indoor wheight you know

1172
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:10,639
like he's a guy from you know after

1173
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:13,839
Yugoslavia split up there was no control

1174
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:18,279
Slovenia in one moment had no visa for

1175
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:21,078
Iran or USA can you imagine I could get

1176
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:23,880
I could travel to USA without a Visa and

1177
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:26,599
in the next day I would travel to Iran

1178
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:29,318
without the Visa it's crazy crazy you

1179
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:32,280
know it's crazy we had one year that you

1180
00:56:29,318 --> 00:56:35,159
could travel like this so he went but he

1181
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:38,039
went after also but he was this guy you

1182
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:41,159
know and he actually acquired this cut

1183
00:56:38,039 --> 00:56:43,599
let me say on a high times can of cop

1184
00:56:41,159 --> 00:56:45,558
when he was a judge like he you could

1185
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:48,680
buy a judge P because I was always

1186
00:56:45,559 --> 00:56:50,960
thinking long time uh that he was like

1187
00:56:48,679 --> 00:56:53,679
chosen to be a judge you know which is

1188
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:57,280
for me ridiculous because who knows this

1189
00:56:53,679 --> 00:57:00,199
guy you know from from Slovenia you know

1190
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,880
nobody knew him of course he paid for

1191
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:03,919
for to be a judge because you have to

1192
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:06,760
pay to go from coffee shop to coffee

1193
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:10,920
shop in the 19s to get the wheat that

1194
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:14,000
they were like judging on right yeah so

1195
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:17,039
how he get the cut will never be known

1196
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,239
because he got it and he he came with it

1197
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:22,319
but he always said it's the

1198
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:25,558
Shiva and we don't know is the Shiva one

1199
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:29,318
Shanti Shiva Shanti 1 Shiva Shanti 2 is

1200
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:33,359
the Shiva skunk or is it the super skunk

1201
00:57:29,318 --> 00:57:36,558
because he said it is labeled s s you

1202
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:38,440
know and he always call it the Shiva he

1203
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:42,640
said it's a

1204
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:46,400
Shiva so actually you know but is one

1205
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:50,000
plant that is very very uh fast fast

1206
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:53,720
rooting it is absolutely the fastest

1207
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,960
rooting plant in my facility definitely

1208
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:59,759
it roots in the first plant start to

1209
00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:02,960
root in 6 days they start you know start

1210
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:06,000
and then on the 10th day you have to

1211
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:09,280
open the lead and put it out and crazy

1212
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:12,440
crazy you know and all the pry what what

1213
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:15,119
we cross because KV smes that we you

1214
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:17,720
know we search for weed that is not

1215
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:21,079
related to this wheat to make F1

1216
00:58:17,719 --> 00:58:23,519
generation to make one good hybrid and

1217
00:58:21,079 --> 00:58:25,760
we choose Kung V's gear in the beginning

1218
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:27,838
because he was the one with the cand do

1219
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:30,920
you know we couldn't get the cam do from

1220
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:34,558
you guys at that time but still now we

1221
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:37,200
don't have it but uh we wanted something

1222
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:40,920
that is very very far away genetically

1223
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:43,480
from this plant yeah so we crossed it

1224
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:44,960
and we got one hybrid from that which is

1225
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:48,280
one of the best selling plants in my

1226
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:49,079
facility now you know nice yeah what do

1227
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:52,359
you call

1228
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:55,640
it rodigo

1229
00:58:52,358 --> 00:58:57,679
express say the first word again rodig

1230
00:58:55,639 --> 00:59:00,960
[ __ ]

1231
00:58:57,679 --> 00:59:05,358
expresso I can show

1232
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:08,039
you Bank logo that I develop no maybe

1233
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:09,038
it's uh turned uh but this is a hand

1234
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:10,640
with a

1235
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:13,240
sprout

1236
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:14,960
uh this is something I will put out in

1237
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:17,118
the future sometime you know and make a

1238
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,838
little send me some photos and I'll I'll

1239
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:21,280
add the photos but one thing I wanted to

1240
00:59:18,838 --> 00:59:24,558
tell you is don't feel bad about not

1241
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:26,720
having the chem dog because most people

1242
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:29,200
in the US don't have it either

1243
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:32,759
it's it's like one of the most tightly

1244
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:34,838
kept strains that that exist that's

1245
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:36,319
really never been circulated actually

1246
00:59:34,838 --> 00:59:37,719
because you told me why because it's

1247
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:39,838
hard to

1248
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:42,838
grow well that and because the people

1249
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:45,599
that have it hold it closely you know

1250
00:59:42,838 --> 00:59:48,558
because of that it's a very people want

1251
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:50,798
to buy it but it's very difficult to to

1252
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:54,359
buy it

1253
00:59:50,798 --> 00:59:57,199
mhm actually the only way we could get

1254
00:59:54,358 --> 01:00:00,639
to the flavor of this C dog which I

1255
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:04,000
believed that is the truth you know uh

1256
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:06,279
is through V's gear you know and uh the

1257
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,039
friend of mine which I will shout out

1258
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:12,000
now uh is old school genetics from

1259
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:15,200
Barcelona his old man green and his crew

1260
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:18,480
of people that grow those are true

1261
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:21,480
Growers I love them they are the ones

1262
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:23,960
that still put out regular seats in

1263
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:27,599
European market which is a [ __ ]

1264
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:31,880
Rarity besides Shanti and Karma genetics

1265
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:35,599
Nobody Does it it's it's very rare to do

1266
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:39,480
that it me Europe the femin seeds are

1267
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:41,960
dominating now and I'm with Gabby we

1268
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:44,559
talked already about femin seeds we have

1269
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:48,639
both uh our different opinions about

1270
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:52,559
femin seeds uh but both of us are the

1271
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:54,159
same uh I think uh opinion that regulars

1272
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:58,798
should not die

1273
01:00:54,159 --> 01:01:03,118
out y ever if we get rid of males then

1274
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:06,318
we are [ __ ] you know really [ __ ] and

1275
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:09,519
also we agree on one point that uh

1276
01:01:06,318 --> 01:01:11,480
finding the real male is [ __ ] [ __ ]

1277
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:13,759
difficult it's the most difficult maybe

1278
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:17,119
you will find it or you will never find

1279
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:19,039
it you will never find it yeah I agree

1280
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:22,519
it's like maybe the guy somebody who

1281
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:26,799
will find it will not know that it's so

1282
01:01:22,519 --> 01:01:28,480
valuable and he'll throw it away

1283
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:33,119
I think that is really I think that

1284
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:35,960
happens with females too yeah yes yes

1285
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:38,318
definitely uh the male cannabis plant is

1286
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:41,039
like the male cannabis plant is the most

1287
01:01:38,318 --> 01:01:43,318
underappreciated plant on the

1288
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:46,039
planet you know like considering what

1289
01:01:43,318 --> 01:01:50,920
its real value is to to how little

1290
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:50,920
appreciation it gets it's it's pretty

1291
01:01:51,079 --> 01:01:55,640
ridiculous yeah it's like all trial and

1292
01:01:53,199 --> 01:01:57,719
error with males and you got to I feel

1293
01:01:55,639 --> 01:02:02,078
like the best ones that I've found are

1294
01:01:57,719 --> 01:02:04,118
always structure and stem rubs like as

1295
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:06,079
long as they got a a good branching

1296
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:09,640
structure I'm happy with them

1297
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:11,278
usually I mean I few years ago I listen

1298
01:02:09,639 --> 01:02:13,318
you know you have to understand I live

1299
01:02:11,278 --> 01:02:16,199
on the other side of this planet but I

1300
01:02:13,318 --> 01:02:20,038
still I'm very updated what you guys are

1301
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:22,598
talking yeah so I listen to minin from

1302
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:25,480
and thein a few years ago mhm and he

1303
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:26,599
tells uh Theory like he has one

1304
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:30,000
technique

1305
01:02:26,599 --> 01:02:31,278
of finding males a little bit better

1306
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,559
than you would

1307
01:02:31,278 --> 01:02:37,239
normally you have to grow them out for

1308
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:39,119
sure yeah but how do you grow them out

1309
01:02:37,239 --> 01:02:41,118
you grow them and then you find out it's

1310
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:44,160
the males you separate them put them

1311
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:47,599
into a place where they are for

1312
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:50,399
themselves and you label them and then

1313
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:54,039
you wait that they are like growing and

1314
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:56,358
putting out the the flowers and then

1315
01:02:54,039 --> 01:03:00,680
before they opening

1316
01:02:56,358 --> 01:03:03,038
you're cutting them you cut the most of

1317
01:03:00,679 --> 01:03:04,159
this plant cut away and you leave the

1318
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:08,599
lower

1319
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:11,838
branches so they have to grow again and

1320
01:03:08,599 --> 01:03:15,200
put a little bit of sex again and pollen

1321
01:03:11,838 --> 01:03:18,159
right they're getting older you have

1322
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:21,639
more of the aroma for from

1323
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:23,719
steamr uh and maybe they have some

1324
01:03:21,639 --> 01:03:27,879
crystals you

1325
01:03:23,719 --> 01:03:30,318
know so before I like that yeah me mean

1326
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:34,240
Jean from Andino told this few years ago

1327
01:03:30,318 --> 01:03:36,599
you he your guy so oh yeah but if you

1328
01:03:34,239 --> 01:03:39,959
ask him he will definitely say yeah I

1329
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:42,480
told it because that's a way how to skip

1330
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:46,400
a little bit if you are trying to find

1331
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:48,318
from one generation you know uh of males

1332
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:51,519
from the same you know Brothers you know

1333
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:54,159
from the same cross try to find the best

1334
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:55,960
one you know maybe the one that smells

1335
01:03:54,159 --> 01:03:58,440
better not looks better is the one you

1336
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:02,358
know because I choose a mail that is

1337
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:05,760
looks good you know but it's make

1338
01:04:02,358 --> 01:04:07,880
actually pretty decent weat so I know

1339
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:11,359
you know you never know you have to work

1340
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:14,640
work work work yeah and something that I

1341
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:16,038
recently heard on another podcast um and

1342
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:18,159
we talked about it Sasha but I want to

1343
01:04:16,039 --> 01:04:20,680
see if Nick knows anything about this I

1344
01:04:18,159 --> 01:04:23,639
was hearding hearing about reversing

1345
01:04:20,679 --> 01:04:26,318
males and that when you reverse a male

1346
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:28,159
and try to make it into a female you

1347
01:04:26,318 --> 01:04:30,639
know it's not going to produce buds like

1348
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:32,798
a female but you can get it to do

1349
01:04:30,639 --> 01:04:35,078
something so that maybe you can get more

1350
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:38,639
of a smell off of

1351
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:41,278
it e you can provide a mail with uh like

1352
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:44,400
ethylene gas supplements and have it

1353
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:46,838
produce more female sex Parts yeah it's

1354
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:48,200
it's something you can do but it's a

1355
01:04:46,838 --> 01:04:50,119
it's a whole different process cuz you

1356
01:04:48,199 --> 01:04:53,078
have to have an enclosed chamber to

1357
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:56,480
provide the ethylene gas exchange

1358
01:04:53,079 --> 01:04:59,880
properly H it's very and I were talking

1359
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:02,240
about yesterday was how when people talk

1360
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:05,240
about selecting the

1361
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:06,879
male you know you're doing the best you

1362
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:09,598
can

1363
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:13,079
but you know the only way to really

1364
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:17,160
select a male is to pollinate plants

1365
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:19,278
with it and then grow those plants out

1366
01:05:17,159 --> 01:05:22,639
and then pollinate the same plants with

1367
01:05:19,278 --> 01:05:24,880
another male and then grow those plants

1368
01:05:22,639 --> 01:05:27,278
out that's the only way you can tell

1369
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:31,358
which male is doing better work we can

1370
01:05:27,278 --> 01:05:35,278
make guests guesses

1371
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:38,078
but I I think it's a lot of arrogance

1372
01:05:35,278 --> 01:05:41,318
when people think that you know they

1373
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:42,920
pheno hunted a male you know and also

1374
01:05:41,318 --> 01:05:45,400
you know these are the same people that

1375
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:47,599
they say they F feno hunted a male from

1376
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:51,240
a 10 pack of

1377
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:55,838
seeds you know it's like proper feno

1378
01:05:51,239 --> 01:06:00,399
hunt you need many many seats and you

1379
01:05:55,838 --> 01:06:03,078
know picking one male out of five you

1380
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:08,240
know males that you got out of a seed

1381
01:06:03,079 --> 01:06:10,240
pack that's not a a feno hunt it's luck

1382
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:13,399
you know if you get something good it's

1383
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:15,479
it's a hell of a lot of luck yes I mean

1384
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:18,200
females are obviously easy you see them

1385
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:20,760
you can smoke them you can smell them

1386
01:06:18,199 --> 01:06:22,798
right so choosing a female you know is

1387
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:26,799
easier choosing a

1388
01:06:22,798 --> 01:06:30,000
male you know like

1389
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:32,759
people in sh pollen get a lot of uh I

1390
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:36,278
don't want to say grief but you know

1391
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:38,359
they look they get looked down upon by

1392
01:06:36,278 --> 01:06:41,920
you know people that are real

1393
01:06:38,358 --> 01:06:43,679
breeders but you know the real breeders

1394
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:46,680
are doing the same thing they're

1395
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:50,078
chucking pollen the real breeders they

1396
01:06:46,679 --> 01:06:54,278
don't know until they're using

1397
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:56,440
accidental Cuts their bases like with

1398
01:06:54,278 --> 01:06:59,079
anything that was like like

1399
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:00,278
in the lineage or anything that has Sour

1400
01:06:59,079 --> 01:07:03,318
Diesel in the

1401
01:07:00,278 --> 01:07:05,719
lineage that's they're they're using

1402
01:07:03,318 --> 01:07:08,119
accidental

1403
01:07:05,719 --> 01:07:11,038
genetics I mean who does line breeding

1404
01:07:08,119 --> 01:07:14,200
today you know line real line breeding

1405
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:16,720
to multiple generation line breeding so

1406
01:07:14,199 --> 01:07:21,318
there is a guy that

1407
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:22,639
um that I met on Reddit and he goes by

1408
01:07:21,318 --> 01:07:26,639
lemon

1409
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:29,358
hoko and that's what he's doing

1410
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:31,598
and you know when I listen to him I'm

1411
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:34,078
like this is one of the real breeders of

1412
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:36,720
today you know that's you know where

1413
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:39,839
everyone else is doing a lot of pollen

1414
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:45,239
chucking he's actually trying to

1415
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:47,759
make um you know stabilized lines like

1416
01:07:45,239 --> 01:07:51,639
that I think like skunk Tech with his

1417
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:53,559
like lario gf9 or whatever that he's uh

1418
01:07:51,639 --> 01:07:56,838
he's already taken to like the I think

1419
01:07:53,559 --> 01:08:01,278
he's at like the F10 or f11 St

1420
01:07:56,838 --> 01:08:04,038
where Burg STS come from and um he like

1421
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:08,000
the guy that found GMO and

1422
01:08:04,039 --> 01:08:11,240
stuff lemon lemon Larry OG

1423
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:13,719
Kush uh lemon hoko I think is his name

1424
01:08:11,239 --> 01:08:16,079
is that you're talking about lemon hoko

1425
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:19,158
and then I'm talking about skunk Tech

1426
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:21,960
skunk that did uh like uh

1427
01:08:19,158 --> 01:08:24,399
Larry you know I only know about these

1428
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:27,439
people because of Instagram you know for

1429
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:31,679
example how I came you know I will tell

1430
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:34,278
you now how I came to you guys actually

1431
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:38,560
first guy that I really

1432
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:42,480
followed was a guy is a guy named named

1433
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:46,560
Duke Diamond you know uh he has this

1434
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:50,678
Dominion SE company and I actually know

1435
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:52,679
about him because I I I'm a really big

1436
01:08:50,679 --> 01:08:56,798
fan of the old Cindy

1437
01:08:52,679 --> 01:09:00,600
99 uh uh strain which came from Brothers

1438
01:08:56,798 --> 01:09:04,399
Grim seeds at a certain time in the '90s

1439
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:07,920
and I like the story how he cubed it and

1440
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:12,639
he made back crosses several generation

1441
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:16,600
back crosses until he found the C the99

1442
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:17,600
yeah and then uh I heard about how it

1443
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:21,239
was

1444
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:24,199
resurrected by an american guy and I was

1445
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:28,399
like who is this guy and it was Duke

1446
01:09:24,198 --> 01:09:30,158
diamond and and uh over Duke Diamond I

1447
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:32,960
came to skan

1448
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:35,798
VA because they were like you you can

1449
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:38,359
still find it on YouTube there is some I

1450
01:09:35,798 --> 01:09:41,359
don't know Affair where they sit

1451
01:09:38,359 --> 01:09:43,039
together and they having a talk on the

1452
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:46,798
stage both of

1453
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:50,198
them and I think after that Duke went to

1454
01:09:46,798 --> 01:09:53,278
prison again and he disappeared and then

1455
01:09:50,198 --> 01:09:56,599
he came back and I think he's one of the

1456
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:59,760
most underrated breeders in

1457
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:02,840
USA the the [ __ ] that he does I mean I

1458
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:06,480
don't know but I from the far that what

1459
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:10,360
I can read and I can see this is the

1460
01:10:06,479 --> 01:10:11,198
most humble guy next to Shanti in Europe

1461
01:10:10,359 --> 01:10:14,559
that I

1462
01:10:11,198 --> 01:10:18,359
know the most humble guy

1463
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:22,600
ever uh I met him I never met Duke I

1464
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:25,000
hope I will um I hope he's he's good

1465
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:28,120
he's well he's living a good life with

1466
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:30,840
his family family now and I know that

1467
01:10:28,119 --> 01:10:33,920
he's done time and it's been horrible

1468
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:36,319
what he has gone through definitely I

1469
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:38,960
mean what this guy has but the genetics

1470
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:41,679
that he put out have you seen the logo

1471
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:45,520
of him he has a Virginia

1472
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:49,279
logo with instead of the guy that lying

1473
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:51,960
you know a skunk with a with a butt is

1474
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:54,439
over it standing on it you know and

1475
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:55,760
that's Dominion SE company and all the

1476
01:10:54,439 --> 01:11:00,519
gear that he's put

1477
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:02,719
out uh I mean and then I came to SK VA

1478
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:04,920
and all the kok story and everything

1479
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:07,560
around it yeah so that's why we sit

1480
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:10,480
together here without Duke Diamond I

1481
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:13,120
think and all the the stuff I heard

1482
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:17,238
about him I would not be so motivated to

1483
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:20,319
listen to the story because he's a very

1484
01:11:17,238 --> 01:11:23,839
uh professional humble guy the guy that

1485
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:27,359
grew up in a Countryside like me he

1486
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:30,440
knows about plants he has a torture

1487
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:34,679
chamber before he puts out

1488
01:11:30,439 --> 01:11:38,079
gear can you imagine he's putting to the

1489
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:41,359
stress test he's putting out uh the gear

1490
01:11:38,079 --> 01:11:45,238
to the stress that he can explain to you

1491
01:11:41,359 --> 01:11:49,960
if there will be nanners in the e n

1492
01:11:45,238 --> 01:11:52,519
week no no don't worry you know it's

1493
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:56,279
just you know so he explains the

1494
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:59,239
genetics uh with uh very

1495
01:11:56,279 --> 01:12:00,920
truthful I mean nobody writes about

1496
01:11:59,238 --> 01:12:04,839
seeds like him

1497
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:08,000
does and you know that's fantastic I

1498
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:09,199
mean he's a Marvel and I I don't have no

1499
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,800
seats from

1500
01:12:09,198 --> 01:12:15,399
him I would like to have one day you

1501
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:17,960
know but um you know I got to skan VA

1502
01:12:15,399 --> 01:12:21,079
seats and I consider them actually I

1503
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:24,198
have seats from him because I bought the

1504
01:12:21,079 --> 01:12:25,880
first generation of Brothers GM seeds

1505
01:12:24,198 --> 01:12:29,638
when they came out again

1506
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:32,440
I think Tommy his name is Tommy Duke

1507
01:12:29,639 --> 01:12:36,400
Tommy was working on those so I got the

1508
01:12:32,439 --> 01:12:39,279
Rosetta Stone I got the the C the 99 we

1509
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:41,879
had we we had a clone for years and we

1510
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:45,880
don't have it anymore but we have still

1511
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:47,880
some genetics from him still so uh Hey I

1512
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:52,840
want to interrupt you real fast Sasha I

1513
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:55,520
want to say that my hope and dream is

1514
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:58,319
that someday this podcast that we're

1515
01:12:55,520 --> 01:13:01,199
having together with you does the same

1516
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:03,439
inspiration for someone else you know

1517
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:06,158
and particularly you know

1518
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:11,519
like you know you're in Slovenia and I'm

1519
01:13:06,158 --> 01:13:15,519
in California and next uh Oregon and you

1520
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:19,400
know Instagram or the podcast or

1521
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:21,040
whatever it it brought us together you

1522
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:23,158
know we always talk about how we're

1523
01:13:21,039 --> 01:13:25,119
6,000 Mi away but we're talking to each

1524
01:13:23,158 --> 01:13:28,439
other live and seeing each other live so

1525
01:13:25,119 --> 01:13:31,119
so hopefully more people from Slovenia

1526
01:13:28,439 --> 01:13:33,399
and and you know throughout the world

1527
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:36,800
will be inspired by conversations like

1528
01:13:33,399 --> 01:13:41,638
that like this but I want to get back to

1529
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:45,520
talking about your nursery and what um

1530
01:13:41,639 --> 01:13:49,319
what growing cannabis in Austria and and

1531
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:53,000
Slovenia is like I started my Nursery in

1532
01:13:49,319 --> 01:13:55,238
2019 yeah I mean started it started for

1533
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:58,479
me as a business because I was was

1534
01:13:55,238 --> 01:14:00,638
working for other people before yeah in

1535
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:06,000
Austria this business is

1536
01:14:00,639 --> 01:14:08,639
already more than 35 years so 25 years

1537
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,520
and I started my bus business 5 years

1538
01:14:08,639 --> 01:14:14,359
ago so when I went into this business it

1539
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:18,120
was already a 20 year business in the

1540
01:14:14,359 --> 01:14:21,759
country so I was asking myself do you

1541
01:14:18,119 --> 01:14:24,279
have to offer something that you can

1542
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:27,880
compete because you know you have to

1543
01:14:24,279 --> 01:14:30,719
compete you can't not be some idiot [ __ ]

1544
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:35,679
and start a business with that you know

1545
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:39,600
if you don't know [ __ ] so I did you know

1546
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:45,158
and uh I was successful in that sense

1547
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:49,000
that I my all the library that I have uh

1548
01:14:45,158 --> 01:14:52,799
before I acquired clones from other

1549
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:56,520
countries uh I put in

1550
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:58,960
myself because of my connections

1551
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:01,440
um I got clones from the mountains I got

1552
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:04,079
my own clones I got clones from the

1553
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:06,519
Flatlands I got clones from you know let

1554
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:09,479
me tell you this you know like so many

1555
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:13,239
people contributed to this library that

1556
01:15:09,479 --> 01:15:15,718
is not only mine this is not my library

1557
01:15:13,238 --> 01:15:18,718
this is also people who died already

1558
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:21,600
they are gone but I still keep their

1559
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:23,480
plans all like and the Legacy goes on

1560
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:27,400
you know it's a beautiful thing in that

1561
01:15:23,479 --> 01:15:30,439
sense that I can still sell the the the

1562
01:15:27,399 --> 01:15:35,439
Shiva cut which is uh lucky you know

1563

called me like lucky has cancer and like

1568
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:55,920
four five months after they called me

1569
01:15:52,479 --> 01:15:56,799
that he died so he was like it was

1570
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:01,480
really

1571
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:04,000
fast and uh he I met him on a concert

1572
01:16:01,479 --> 01:16:06,158
before before I even know that he has

1573
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,198
cancer or something and he told me can

1574
01:16:06,158 --> 01:16:12,719
you name that cut after

1575
01:16:08,198 --> 01:16:15,839
me I said I will his name was s and that

1576
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:17,960
means Lucky in our language

1577
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:22,319
to means

1578
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:24,719
luck so his name wasko the lucky one you

1579
01:16:22,319 --> 01:16:26,000
know and he was the lucky one in that

1580
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:30,399
sense

1581
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:34,039
and um the library consists of many Cuts

1582
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:37,119
Like This one of those cuts is his Shiva

1583

don't know you know it's

1595
01:17:07,399 --> 01:17:12,439
like the there very interesting story

1596
01:17:10,399 --> 01:17:16,039
about this plant because I was attacked

1597
01:17:12,439 --> 01:17:19,559
by um one year ago I have to change the

1598
01:17:16,039 --> 01:17:23,960
name of my list because it's only plank

1599
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:25,840
clone only now before that it was Santa

1600
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:28,439
Maria PL

1601
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:32,440
no mercy Supply was the company that put

1602
01:17:28,439 --> 01:17:35,879
this clone out and no mercy Supply is a

1603
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:39,319
company from Holland from NE

1604
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:42,119
Netherlands which uh was owned by a guy

1605
01:17:39,319 --> 01:17:44,880
named C and he was a

1606
01:17:42,119 --> 01:17:48,279
legend I don't I don't know much about

1607
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:51,639
him but I got last year a threatening

1608
01:17:48,279 --> 01:17:54,399
male that I should put this plant out of

1609
01:17:51,639 --> 01:17:57,639
my list and that is his intellectual

1610
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:59,920
intellectual property and you know I

1611
01:17:57,639 --> 01:18:02,400
just said okay I will remove the company

1612
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:04,679
the No Mercy Supply you know I talk

1613
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:06,399
about it no but it's like people should

1614
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:09,199
know it's funny you were giving him

1615
01:18:06,399 --> 01:18:12,479

generation

1633
01:18:56,198 --> 01:19:03,759
and I I know that this plank cut is

1634
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:04,960
definitely older than any cut in my

1635
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:10,119
facility

1636
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:14,079
because in N uh 2005 when I uh first see

1637
01:19:10,119 --> 01:19:17,679
it in GRS in Austria I saw it in GRS in

1638
01:19:14,079 --> 01:19:19,880
a shop called Pyon NOA and still exist

1639
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:23,119
and the guy that runs the shop is called

1650
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:54,759
think with your shop like so many people

1651
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:57,319
that benefited from your energy and from

1652
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:59,760
your experience you know uh this the

1653
01:19:57,319 --> 01:20:02,359
same it's the same story everybody in

1654
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:03,600
grats you know this is south of Vienna

1655
01:20:02,359 --> 01:20:07,119
you know Vienna is the capital of

1656
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:10,679
Austria grat is South it's the capital

1657
01:20:07,119 --> 01:20:13,559
of sta the the land where we live so

1658
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:15,960
this shop still sells plants they don't

1659
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:18,719
make any advertisement they're like the

1660
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:20,439

1662
01:20:20,439 --> 01:20:25,039
like my site Gabby I have I'm not really

1663
01:20:23,279 --> 01:20:28,639
advertising but you know what I mean

1664
01:20:25,039 --> 01:20:31,519
it's like I I have a site you know this

1665
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:34,119
guy does not he has a Google info site

1666
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:36,480
or something you know with the list of

1667
01:20:34,119 --> 01:20:39,920
clones and he's still work doing his

1668
01:20:36,479 --> 01:20:42,718
thing he's the oldest one and and Maran

1669
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:47,199
told me uh when I acquired the clone

1670
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:49,880
from him 2005 he told me hey sash this

1671
01:20:47,198 --> 01:20:53,198
is the oldest clone I have and I said

1672
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:55,679
how old is it it's like it's 15 years

1673
01:20:53,198 --> 01:20:59,960
definitely from the Netherlands you know

1674
01:20:55,679 --> 01:21:02,880
and that was in 2005 so ' 90s so '90s

1675
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:03,840
you know like end of the 80s nobody can

1676
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:06,719
know for

1677
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:10,679
sure yeah nobody can really know for

1678
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:14,158
sure I don't I will not uh argue because

1679
01:21:10,679 --> 01:21:16,880
we all know this uh we stories yeah I

1680
01:21:14,158 --> 01:21:20,119
think Noto was talking about it a lot

1681
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:23,560
how we have our own perception of each

1682
01:21:20,119 --> 01:21:25,639
card that we acquired or you know people

1683
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:28,199
live through life and nobody really

1684
01:21:25,639 --> 01:21:32,039
thought at a certain point of time that

1685
01:21:28,198 --> 01:21:35,158
it believe it will be so important you

1686
01:21:32,039 --> 01:21:37,479
know I I didn't you know the the the

1687
01:21:35,158 --> 01:21:40,759
cuts that I have maybe for you the most

1688
01:21:37,479 --> 01:21:44,479
interesting in my facility is the least

1689
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:47,119
interesting cuts for the people that are

1690
01:21:44,479 --> 01:21:50,119
around me you know they all want the

1691
01:21:47,119 --> 01:21:53,198
American Cuts now they all want Cali

1692
01:21:50,119 --> 01:21:56,519
with you know yeah but we already have

1693
01:21:53,198 --> 01:22:00,238
that the and the plank and and the other

1694
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:02,840
thing that's becomes super rare here is

1695
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:06,599
sativa you know seven we flowering

1696
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:08,960
sativa I was like yeah that would sell

1697
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:12,840
really well he said a seven week

1698
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:16,279
flowering sativa that grows short short

1699
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:19,039
short it cannot handle its own weight

1700
01:22:16,279 --> 01:22:21,759
that's also it produces too much dense

1701
01:22:19,039 --> 01:22:24,600
flowers to to keep it you know you have

1702
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:26,800
to net you have to put netting because

1703
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:29,600
can't handle my own weight

1704
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:32,600
either when you say sativa do you mean

1705
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:35,800
in in effect or like is the flower

1706
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:37,480
structure uh no the flow structure is

1707
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:40,520
absolutely

1708
01:22:37,479 --> 01:22:43,638
Indica it has three leaf tips it has

1709
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:47,040
three leaf uh when you Google it on seed

1710
01:22:43,639 --> 01:22:52,000
finder you will find the real uh cut the

1711
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:54,079
Santa Maria plank cut that's it it is CL

1712
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,719
I'm going to make a note but there is

1713
01:22:54,079 --> 01:22:59,279
like you know uh because the seed

1714
01:22:56,719 --> 01:23:01,600
company still sells it a seed they went

1715
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:05,039
into F

1716
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:07,120
f8 because this should be F6 or F7

1717
01:23:05,039 --> 01:23:09,198
because I acquired it so long time ago

1718
01:23:07,119 --> 01:23:12,599
it is production plant you know and it's

1719
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:14,559
a silver Pearl cross to Mexican I think

1720
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:16,880
you know and what do the leaves look

1721
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:18,679
like you said the bud but does it have

1722
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:20,079
fat leaves like in Inda or is it more

1723
01:23:18,679 --> 01:23:23,158
skinny leaves like a

1724
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:25,439
sativa oh it has a mix between and it

1725
01:23:23,158 --> 01:23:29,799
has three fingers

1726
01:23:25,439 --> 01:23:30,839
only always not only sometimes five but

1727
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:34,400
mostly

1728
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:38,600
three and it's uh smelling like mango

1729
01:23:34,399 --> 01:23:41,319
fruit and it has only 14 to 15%

1730
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:43,760
THC it's a very uplifting plant it

1731
01:23:41,319 --> 01:23:46,799
sounds amazing that sounds really

1732
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:49,880
good I'm I haven't had breakfast and I'm

1733
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:51,560
drooling I'm like I mean people tell

1734
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:53,440
about it you know there is a old story

1735
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:57,400
about this particular cut that is from

1736
01:23:53,439 --> 01:23:59,719
the Brazilian Amazon used for ritual

1737
01:23:57,399 --> 01:24:03,319
purposes blah blah blah blah but this is

1738
01:23:59,719 --> 01:24:06,119
all fake I think this is not true this

1739
01:24:03,319 --> 01:24:09,158
they breed it in Holland maybe they got

1740
01:24:06,119 --> 01:24:13,079
the genetics from South America maybe

1741
01:24:09,158 --> 01:24:17,079
but they it was stabilized and breed in

1742
01:24:13,079 --> 01:24:19,559
Holland in the in the green houses yeah

1743
01:24:17,079 --> 01:24:22,238
so it also a it was a purposely bread

1744
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:25,159
plant for production

1745
01:24:22,238 --> 01:24:29,439

01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:03,880
cookies you know it's a good it's very

1776
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:06,440
similar to Mac those are the first four

1777
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:10,800
and we got it from a source that will

1778
01:26:06,439 --> 01:26:14,719
not name now then the second round of

1779
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:17,119
American clones we got from finest

1780
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:21,319
condoms in

1781
01:26:17,118 --> 01:26:25,039
California and uh we got them by Co

1782
01:26:21,319 --> 01:26:27,238
coincidence coincidence means I was in

1783
01:26:25,039 --> 01:26:29,679
my shop one

1784
01:26:27,238 --> 01:26:33,279

almost and a guy that is my actually a

1786
01:26:33,279 --> 01:26:38,719
guy that I know he's also working for

1787
01:26:35,639 --> 01:26:41,760
UPS by the way you know for the

1788
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:43,920
delivery and he came with a package and

1789
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:47,600

1790
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:51,840
560 this is like $700 or

1791
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:55,199

1792
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:58,719
Yuri why you know I don't know why

1793

1802
01:27:23,118 --> 01:27:32,198
nothing and open it and they were hidden

1803
01:27:27,359 --> 01:27:33,960
inside into into small zip bags clones

1804
01:27:32,198 --> 01:27:38,839
and all of the Clones have

1805
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:42,800
names it is U apple banana Joker

1817
01:28:15,118 --> 01:28:23,198
tell from which country now yeah but in

1818
01:28:19,279 --> 01:28:26,519
2021 I had an export which is official

1819
01:28:23,198 --> 01:28:28,079
from Austria to a country that is

1820
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:30,560
outside of

1821
01:28:28,079 --> 01:28:32,439
Europe it is outside of Europe it's not

1822
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:37,639
European Union

1823
01:28:32,439 --> 01:28:40,359
yeah and uh it's a company and they I

1824
01:28:37,639 --> 01:28:42,639
exported officially to this

1825
01:28:40,359 --> 01:28:45,839
place with uh food and rug

1826
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:49,520
Administration it took me 4 months for

1827
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:51,400
the paperwork it was very

1828
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:55,280
complicated

1829
01:28:51,399 --> 01:28:59,920
uh these same people went to

1830
01:28:55,279 --> 01:29:02,519
USA and buy clones and send it to me

1831
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:05,679
first because they knew that they can

1832
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:06,840
import it again because otherwise they

1833
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:09,719
could not be

1834
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:11,440
imported because of the paperwork I will

1835
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:14,520
not tell who it

1836
01:29:11,439 --> 01:29:17,000
is I will not tell which country it is

1837
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:17,000
but it's not

1838
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:26,039
Europe so understand these people say me

1839
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:27,359
these clones were uh uh also sent to me

1840
01:29:26,039 --> 01:29:29,560
without being

1841
01:29:27,359 --> 01:29:33,399
rooted they send

1842
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:35,360
it in one day and the next day they were

1843
01:29:33,399 --> 01:29:39,279
in Austria from

1844
01:29:35,359 --> 01:29:43,238
California unrooted in in tissue which

1845
01:29:39,279 --> 01:29:47,319
is wet in zip bags that are

1846
01:29:43,238 --> 01:29:49,198
closed and I got a lot of I mean and so

1847
01:29:47,319 --> 01:29:51,359
do you still have all those genetics

1848
01:29:49,198 --> 01:29:54,559
then at your facility or did you uh just

1849
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:58,799
kind of were you a pit stop for them

1850
01:29:54,560 --> 01:30:01,520
no I I keep the moms cool I keep the

1851
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:03,360
moms those are some good ones I I have a

1852
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,480
few of those at my facility that I that

1853
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:07,639
I work

1854
01:30:04,479 --> 01:30:10,359
at what was weird about that story is

1855
01:30:07,639 --> 01:30:12,840
that they didn't ask you first they

1856
01:30:10,359 --> 01:30:15,519
didn't say hey Sasha we want to send

1857
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:18,960
these genetics we can't get them we want

1858
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:21,800
to send them to you and then you know I

1859
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:25,960
mean they just like you open up a box

1860
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:25,960
plausible deniability baby

1861
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:32,199
yeah nobody asked I think I was not the

1862
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:34,279
only address for them also you know what

1863
01:30:32,198 --> 01:30:35,479
I mean oh for sure you were one of the

1864
01:30:34,279 --> 01:30:36,800
many that they probably sent the

1865
01:30:35,479 --> 01:30:39,079
genetics to so that they would

1866
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:41,600
eventually get them I have a feeling I

1867
01:30:39,079 --> 01:30:45,238
know which country was the destination

1868
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:49,119
but we won't talk about that here

1869
01:30:45,238 --> 01:30:51,759
no yes so I acquired also this American

1870
01:30:49,118 --> 01:30:56,039
American genetics from which I'm very

1871
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:59,280
you know I I'm excited of course I mean

1872
01:30:56,039 --> 01:31:00,639
you know I'm totally excited about it

1873
01:30:59,279 --> 01:31:04,399
but on the other

1874
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:06,480
hand uh some of them are really

1875
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:09,158
boring yeah you're going to find a lot

1876
01:31:06,479 --> 01:31:11,559
of them are and that a lot of them are

1877
01:31:09,158 --> 01:31:15,000
similar you

1878
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:17,239
know if you breed only for THC that what

1879
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:20,800
I wanted to tell before if you only

1880
01:31:17,238 --> 01:31:24,799
breed for THC and looks it's not uh

1881
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:29,000
going to the end product will result in

1882
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:31,000
lower quality for the experience I think

1883
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:33,600
because on the end what do you care

1884
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:36,560
about how the weed looks when you when

1885
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:40,480
you consume it right I mean well who

1886
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:43,000
cares I I hold on let me just say this

1887
01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:43,000
that's like

1888
01:31:43,158 --> 01:31:49,399
saying and I'm going to try to say this

1889
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:51,840
delicately um what do you care about how

1890
01:31:49,399 --> 01:31:54,719
beautiful your woman is if you're having

1891
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:58,520
sex with her right

1892
01:31:54,719 --> 01:32:01,279
you know so I mean like I I

1893
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:05,480
think I think physical appearance isn't

1894
01:32:01,279 --> 01:32:08,639
as important as we make it and you know

1895
01:32:05,479 --> 01:32:11,638
but I think it does mean something and I

1896
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:14,319
do think that you can tell

1897
01:32:11,639 --> 01:32:18,000
something about the quality of cannabis

1898
01:32:14,319 --> 01:32:20,960
by looking at it right so when something

1899
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:24,960
looks better when something looks better

1900
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:27,239
you know but I mean with qu

1901
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:29,800
right right chem dog was some shitty

1902
01:32:27,238 --> 01:32:33,439
looking weed it really didn't look great

1903
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:35,360
you know um but the way it smelled the

1904
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:37,519
way it smelled you know so you have to

1905
01:32:35,359 --> 01:32:39,639
kind of look at all the parameters you

1906
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:42,000
know first the way it looks then the way

1907
01:32:39,639 --> 01:32:44,440
it smells you know then of course you

1908
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:47,079
smoke it you know or consume it how

1909
01:32:44,439 --> 01:32:51,879
however you would do that

1910
01:32:47,079 --> 01:32:56,760
um but you know it's the same with any

1911
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:58,639
um any plant right with all plants we

1912
01:32:56,760 --> 01:33:03,840
breed for

1913
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:06,199
looks okay even in you know the organic

1914
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:07,920
section you know of the supermarket

1915
01:33:06,198 --> 01:33:09,919
where I shop when you look at the

1916
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:11,480
tomatoes they like to get the tomatoes

1917
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:15,118
that have lots of different

1918
01:33:11,479 --> 01:33:17,638
colors right you know the the heirloom

1919
01:33:15,118 --> 01:33:20,359
varieties but you know people want their

1920
01:33:17,639 --> 01:33:21,800
food to look pretty you know you don't

1921
01:33:20,359 --> 01:33:24,118
want to put something on a plate that's

1922
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:27,360
ugly and it's it's kind of the same

1923
01:33:24,118 --> 01:33:30,960
thing with cannabis also in the US

1924
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:33,399
particularly or I I think it's probably

1925
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:36,039
everywhere but definitely in California

1926
01:33:33,399 --> 01:33:40,679
you don't even get to smell the weed

1927
01:33:36,039 --> 01:33:42,399
before you buy it at a dispensary no you

1928
01:33:40,679 --> 01:33:46,118
get to see it in a

1929
01:33:42,399 --> 01:33:48,519
jar right so the only right so the only

1930
01:33:46,118 --> 01:33:50,880
way you could wait and it gets worse so

1931
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:54,000
the way you judge weed when you don't

1932
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:57,199
know right when the average consumer who

1933
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:59,679
is not a cultivator he goes into a club

1934
01:33:57,198 --> 01:34:02,118
they can look at two things they look at

1935
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:06,239
what does the bud look like you know in

1936
01:34:02,118 --> 01:34:08,719
a jar and then what is the THC

1937
01:34:06,238 --> 01:34:11,479
content right those are the two metrics

1938
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:14,000
that they have to make their decision so

1939
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:17,198
a a lot of the breeding for high

1940
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:19,600
THC is based on the

1941
01:34:17,198 --> 01:34:22,158
bureaucracy of that's one of the two

1942
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:24,600
metrics that people have to choose their

1943
01:34:22,158 --> 01:34:26,799
weed right when it was only it was one

1944
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:30,280
of the only metrics that was able to be

1945
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:31,800
Quantified early on as well and so it

1946
01:34:30,279 --> 01:34:35,519
that like when you went into a

1947
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:38,279
dispensary like in the 25 prop 215 days

1948
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:41,440
you would maybe get th I think you were

1949
01:34:38,279 --> 01:34:44,359
able to get THC percentage uh in most of

1950
01:34:41,439 --> 01:34:46,238
the places smell the weed they would let

1951
01:34:44,359 --> 01:34:48,198
you smell the weed back absolutely some

1952
01:34:46,238 --> 01:34:50,519
places will let you touch it if it was

1953
01:34:48,198 --> 01:34:53,919
just like their uh their grab jar or

1954
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:56,880
whatever they called it at the time umh

1955
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:58,920
but uh yeah they they still like THC was

1956
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:00,639
still the only actual quantifiable

1957
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:03,039
metric that they could give you I give

1958
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:06,239
you I give you a one example you know I

1959
01:35:03,039 --> 01:35:09,560
got a lot of uh inquiries from Germany

1960
01:35:06,238 --> 01:35:12,198
now right now you know from April this

1961
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:16,239
year because Germany

1962
01:35:12,198 --> 01:35:19,759
legalized and in one day to another you

1963
01:35:16,238 --> 01:35:23,118
can actually send plans to Germany which

1964
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:24,480
was absolutely impossible before that

1965
01:35:23,118 --> 01:35:27,799
absolutely

1966
01:35:24,479 --> 01:35:30,879
and I was not uh even I'm the last shop

1967
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:33,520
in Austria that start to do it because

1968
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:36,840
I'm the I'm the guy that will you know

1969
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:39,080
look for I will not be you know in any

1970
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:42,560
risk of anything because I can lose my

1971
01:35:39,079 --> 01:35:46,439
whole business just because one one male

1972
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:49,520
you know I will not do that so we tried

1973
01:35:46,439 --> 01:35:51,719
to know how many plants we can sell to

1974
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:53,840
Germany to one person in the beginning

1975
01:35:51,719 --> 01:35:56,000
nobody knew

1976
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:59,600
uh and now we know that it's like they

1977
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:02,520
can grow three plants we can send five

1978
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:04,440
plants we can send seven

1979
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:07,040
seats per

1980
01:36:04,439 --> 01:36:11,359
person wow it's still it's still going

1981
01:36:07,039 --> 01:36:14,560
to be um like it is uh a personal use

1982
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:19,920
you know so so any German citizen can

1983
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:22,639
order from you yes oh that's really cool

1984
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:25,679
yes it started now that's why you know

1985
01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:29,400
and uh my my genetic libraries also is

1986
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:31,039
very vast for that and people who like

1987
01:36:29,399 --> 01:36:33,158
wheat you know of course Germany is a

1988
01:36:31,039 --> 01:36:36,600
big Market you know they they already

1989
01:36:33,158 --> 01:36:40,238
called me years ago if I could send

1990
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:43,360
plants I I always said no because it's

1991
01:36:40,238 --> 01:36:47,678
illegal yeah they even Germany even had

1992
01:36:43,359 --> 01:36:50,599
a law EXT extra law for not selling

1993
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:52,840
cannabis seeds in the country even seeds

1994
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:55,679
were forbidden which in all the other

1995
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:59,560
countries are not they are souvenirs

1996
01:36:55,679 --> 01:37:04,158
they are sold as souvenirs which you as

1997
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:07,719
an 18 or older year old person can

1998
01:37:04,158 --> 01:37:09,439
sprout in your country or not depending

1999
01:37:07,719 --> 01:37:13,158
on your

2000
01:37:09,439 --> 01:37:16,479
law you know so Germany is a big market

2001
01:37:13,158 --> 01:37:21,599
now I want to tell you this that I get

2002
01:37:16,479 --> 01:37:23,718
inquiries every day uh almost and uh I

2003
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:25,719
don't sell to everybody because uh I

2004
01:37:23,719 --> 01:37:29,960
don't want to risk you know some some

2005
01:37:25,719 --> 01:37:32,639
people ask for too lot too much and um

2006
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:35,359
but I you know the things that we have

2007
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:38,520
in our facility as genetic

2008
01:37:35,359 --> 01:37:41,359
material grow people that does not uh

2009
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:43,520
you know in your place they cannot buy

2010
01:37:41,359 --> 01:37:46,039
this because it's too

2011
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:48,560
expensive but they are

2012
01:37:46,039 --> 01:37:52,599
Hobbits so they can grow

2013
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:54,840
it and they grow it nice and uh you

2014
01:37:52,599 --> 01:37:57,560
change perception

2015
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:59,679
you change perceptions you help people

2016
01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:02,800
with cancer you help people with

2017
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:04,679
different kind of diseases they are you

2018
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:07,119
know I'm not actually for that that

2019
01:38:04,679 --> 01:38:10,679
everybody should cook their own oil at

2020
01:38:07,118 --> 01:38:14,238
home because people are stupid also so

2021
01:38:10,679 --> 01:38:17,800
they would use uh bad solvents and uh

2022
01:38:14,238 --> 01:38:20,039
you know yeah also I'm for that that

2023
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:22,360
that the government takes over and has

2024
01:38:20,039 --> 01:38:24,760
the the standard you know the quality

2025
01:38:22,359 --> 01:38:27,759
control for that you know that would be

2026
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:30,360
appropriate in a civilized society that

2027
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:33,039
doesn't work

2028
01:38:30,359 --> 01:38:34,158
this that doesn't work here you put it

2029
01:38:33,039 --> 01:38:36,599
in the hands of the government they're

2030
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:39,920
going to [ __ ] it up how many countries

01:40:18,158 --> 01:40:22,479
really I mean you have to follow rules

2068
01:40:20,238 --> 01:40:24,799
of course you know you you're not

2069
01:40:22,479 --> 01:40:27,399
standing in front of of a social club in

2070
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:29,920
front of in Barcelona Screaming in the

2071
01:40:27,399 --> 01:40:32,960
Night drunk you know and high you don't

2072
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:35,800
do that cuz they have problems and they

2073
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:39,560
always tell you walk as soon as you're

2074
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:40,920
out walk you know and don't have

2075
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:43,159
anything with you because you are not

2076
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:45,359
allowed actually you allowed to consume

2077
01:40:43,158 --> 01:40:47,839
cannabis in these certain places but

2078
01:40:45,359 --> 01:40:51,000
it's not allowed to buy like I don't

2079
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:54,119
know how much and then go home I mean of

2080
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:56,399
course logically everyone does

2081
01:40:54,118 --> 01:40:59,639
but they are very quiet about it and

2082
01:40:56,399 --> 01:41:04,158
they respect the rules that's why you

2083
01:40:59,639 --> 01:41:06,319
know they want shut down yeah and you

2084

am and I I know Nick is as well I mean

2134
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:31,118
this is just so fascinating to just hear

2135
01:43:28,198 --> 01:43:33,039
that from someone a similar mindset in a

2136
01:43:31,118 --> 01:43:34,679
different area of the world like it's

2137
01:43:33,039 --> 01:43:38,880
you know we talk when I see the photos

2138
01:43:34,679 --> 01:43:41,920
of your grow it's it's so beautiful you

2139
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:46,039
know it's so clean it's like a retail

2140
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:47,599
environment you know and um it's not

2141
01:43:46,039 --> 01:43:50,039
something that you see every day over

2142
01:43:47,599 --> 01:43:52,520
here and you know like they're being

2143
01:43:50,039 --> 01:43:55,599
like a place that's that's legal to just

2144
01:43:52,520 --> 01:44:00,719
buy plant like that it doesn't even

2145
01:43:55,599 --> 01:44:03,400
exist here so here what happens is like

2146
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:04,480
you can have a nursery no no you can

2147
01:44:03,399 --> 01:44:07,719
have a

2148
01:44:04,479 --> 01:44:09,959
nursery a licensed cannabis Nursery that

2149
01:44:07,719 --> 01:44:12,800
maybe they sell to a

2150
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:14,880
dispensary right and that dispensary has

2151
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:17,400
a couple of plants there that they don't

2152
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:19,239
know how to care for you know because

2153
01:44:17,399 --> 01:44:20,879
they don't have cultivators there you

2154
01:44:19,238 --> 01:44:24,319
know so the plants are basically just

2155
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:25,760
there dying yeah you know like you know

2156
01:44:24,319 --> 01:44:28,679
what you have to do is if you buy plants

2157
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:31,000
from a nurs a dispensary you have to buy

2158
01:44:28,679 --> 01:44:32,440
them like the day they show up you have

2159
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:35,000
to like talk to The Dispensary you want

2160
01:44:32,439 --> 01:44:37,158
to say when do the plants show up 9:00

2161
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:39,158
on Monday so 9:00 on Monday you got to

2162
01:44:37,158 --> 01:44:42,198
be there waiting online so that you can

2163
01:44:39,158 --> 01:44:44,479
choose the best plants before you know

2164
01:44:42,198 --> 01:44:46,638
they get hurt or or picked by other

2165
01:44:44,479 --> 01:44:49,079
people you know so when I saw the photos

2166
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:51,039
of your place so it's you know yeah it's

2167
01:44:49,079 --> 01:44:53,880
either that or you can order clones

2168
01:44:51,039 --> 01:44:58,158
online but even that is still somewhat

2169
01:44:53,880 --> 01:45:00,800
of a um a risky business just

2170
01:44:58,158 --> 01:45:05,158
because yeah it's it's it's falling

2171
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:07,039
still under the the US hemp bill um or

2172
01:45:05,158 --> 01:45:09,198
the the farm bill that includes the hemp

2173
01:45:07,039 --> 01:45:11,560
bill but it it's something that could be

2174
01:45:09,198 --> 01:45:13,598
repealed at any time and and that's the

2175
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:16,280
only legal way that seeds and clones are

2176
01:45:13,599 --> 01:45:20,319
being shipped across state lines and

2177
01:45:16,279 --> 01:45:23,158
even within States now um so it's it's

2178
01:45:20,319 --> 01:45:25,000
not nearly as open as that I'm I I feel

2179
01:45:23,158 --> 01:45:27,479
like Gabby was also just as blown away

2180
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:32,039
as me just to hear that you can ship

2181
01:45:27,479 --> 01:45:36,158
clones to Germany to a home grower yeah

2182
01:45:32,039 --> 01:45:37,960
that's MH that's insane that's so cool

2183
01:45:36,158 --> 01:45:40,839
but you have he has

2184
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:43,840
is you have the like yeah you have the

2185
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:46,159
phyto uh what is it called the phyto

2186
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:48,599
sanitary certificate so that's basically

2187
01:45:46,158 --> 01:45:51,679
like if somebody wants to ship any

2188
01:45:48,599 --> 01:45:53,800
plants you know not cannabis of course

2189
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:56,079
but any plants throughout the

2190
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:57,599
you're supposed to have that certificate

2191
01:45:56,079 --> 01:46:00,439
just to ship it from one state to

2192
01:45:57,599 --> 01:46:05,319
another and in Europe that's the way it

2193
01:46:00,439 --> 01:46:08,158
is for you know the whole uh you know

2194
01:46:05,319 --> 01:46:11,039
you know all the continent of Europe is

2195
01:46:08,158 --> 01:46:14,039
that you know because they have the

2196
01:46:11,039 --> 01:46:16,279
European Union you could ship and the

2197
01:46:14,039 --> 01:46:17,880
plants are considered legal and you know

2198
01:46:16,279 --> 01:46:20,198
one thing I was Sasha was telling me

2199
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:22,599
about is how like once a month or you

2200
01:46:20,198 --> 01:46:23,919
know very often they come to inspect you

2201
01:46:22,599 --> 01:46:26,319
to make make sure that your plants have

2202
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:27,560
no virus and right you want to tell a

2203
01:46:26,319 --> 01:46:29,599
little something about that it's once

2204
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:34,920
it's once a year Gabby once a year once

2205
01:46:29,599 --> 01:46:37,760
a year but very they're very uh you know

2206
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:40,719
if you if you they see everything first

2207
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:44,079
of all uh let me not say that now that

2208
01:46:40,719 --> 01:46:46,319
new virus came the the the Hop latent

2209
01:46:44,079 --> 01:46:48,238
you know that is now the they of course

2210
01:46:46,319 --> 01:46:51,759
don't know about that from when they see

2211
01:46:48,238 --> 01:46:54,158
the plants but they make the the tests

2212
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:55,719
the Deep scans they make you know it

2213
01:46:54,158 --> 01:46:59,839
cost

2214
01:46:55,719 --> 01:47:02,719
500 every time they come every year yes

2215
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:04,840
oh so it's like uh you pay also for

2216
01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:07,840
other they check for everything there's

2217
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:11,400
like they check for Mosaic and for tabac

2218
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:13,480
virus also not only hop plent you know

2219
01:47:11,399 --> 01:47:15,559
there is other viruses still The Hop

2220
01:47:13,479 --> 01:47:18,519
plent is more prevalent now in cannabis

2221
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:21,239
for the last years but uh I think in the

2222
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:23,360
future there will be others and Endo

2223
01:47:21,238 --> 01:47:26,000
fights will come you know V was talking

2224
01:47:23,359 --> 01:47:28,759
about this uh one week or two weeks ago

2225
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:32,439
in a podcast on the on

2226
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:34,360
the he talks about the truth actually we

2227
01:47:32,439 --> 01:47:36,919
have to fight this [ __ ] you know

2228
01:47:34,359 --> 01:47:39,198
especially with older plants with older

2229
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:41,639
CS that been old through the closets and

2230
01:47:39,198 --> 01:47:44,759
all kind of environments that they been

2231
01:47:41,639 --> 01:47:47,199
through you have to be careful you mean

2232
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:50,360
you know whole plent is so like a like a

2233
01:47:47,198 --> 01:47:55,118
white fire you can you cannot stop it if

2234
01:47:50,359 --> 01:47:57,158
if it comes so yeah it's like the tissue

2235
01:47:55,118 --> 01:48:00,118
culture thing is real so we have to do

2236
01:47:57,158 --> 01:48:02,839
it actually all of us I think do you

2237
01:48:00,118 --> 01:48:05,479
have a tissue culture lab set up not yet

2238
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:08,159
but we are working on it very very uh

2239
01:48:05,479 --> 01:48:10,079
much now it's going to be very fast now

2240
01:48:08,158 --> 01:48:13,279
yeah I feel like that'll be such a such

2241
01:48:10,079 --> 01:48:16,559
an uh amazing way to also have genetics

2242
01:48:13,279 --> 01:48:19,118
imported um with with as little risk as

2243
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:21,679
possible found this so fascinating to to

2244
01:48:19,118 --> 01:48:25,000
hear from somebody else that has you

2245
01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:27,279
know a a gen Library as large as you do

2246
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:29,479
that and and you're keeping it in such

2247
01:48:27,279 --> 01:48:33,079
great health with with such strict

2248
01:48:29,479 --> 01:48:36,198
regulations that's very impressive the

2249
01:48:33,079 --> 01:48:39,079
regulations for the health of plants in

2250
01:48:36,198 --> 01:48:41,678
the Cannabis industry out here are

2251
01:48:39,079 --> 01:48:44,559
basically zero until it reaches final

2252
01:48:41,679 --> 01:48:48,359
product um like there there would be no

2253
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:52,840
testing for any pathogens even in the

2254
01:48:48,359 --> 01:48:54,039
final flower of of plants um

2255
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:56,239
only thing they would test for would be

2256
01:48:54,039 --> 01:48:57,760
like molds and and that's not even

2257
01:48:56,238 --> 01:48:59,158
necessarily the case or wasn't

2258
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:00,800
necessarily the case in all the

2259
01:48:59,158 --> 01:49:04,879
different states that have

2260
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:07,039
legalized um you know from the Inception

2261
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:10,760
of their legalization they they just

2262
01:49:07,039 --> 01:49:13,079
didn't have that in place to uh to test

2263
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:15,400
for molds or pathogens and now only some

2264
01:49:13,079 --> 01:49:18,198
of them test for molds and um some of

2265
01:49:15,399 --> 01:49:20,399
them it's only for the like a Mot toxin

2266
01:49:18,198 --> 01:49:21,638
that could have formed from a mold uh so

2267
01:49:20,399 --> 01:49:23,439
they don't actually test for like the

2268
01:49:21,639 --> 01:49:25,359
molds themselves

2269
01:49:23,439 --> 01:49:27,559
um but it's just it's just really

2270
01:49:25,359 --> 01:49:29,039
fascinating to hear that like you're

2271
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:32,920
you're

2272
01:49:29,039 --> 01:49:35,639
uh required by the local or by the

2273
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:37,840
regulatory body to have inspectors come

2274
01:49:35,639 --> 01:49:40,480
in that you pay for the testing and have

2275
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:44,239
the proper testing done to their

2276
01:49:40,479 --> 01:49:46,839
specific standards like that's I'm I'm

2277
01:49:44,238 --> 01:49:48,559
sure that if the US goes legal that's

2278
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:50,199
how it's going to go as well where it's

2279
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:52,000
going to have these more stricter

2280
01:49:50,198 --> 01:49:54,319
standards and it's just interesting to

2281
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:56,520
see that it there's models already out

2282
01:49:54,319 --> 01:49:58,840
there where this is happening there is

2283
01:49:56,520 --> 01:50:00,880
there is actually it's very smart to do

2284
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:03,800
that because otherwise we will infect

2285
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:06,480
each other with different kind of stuff

2286
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:08,880
that you you know it's not it's it's

2287
01:50:06,479 --> 01:50:11,000
grown here but I send it to you in to

2288
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:13,599
America and the whole economy will drop

2289
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:16,000
because of some virus you know it's like

2290
01:50:13,599 --> 01:50:18,520
that's not uh it it's irresponsible to

2291
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:20,039
do that actually it's very responsible

2292
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:22,840
to have a

2293
01:50:20,039 --> 01:50:25,000
certification to pay for that you know

2294
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:27,279
that normally people don't ask do you

2295
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:29,439
test regularly on a regular basis yeah

2296
01:50:27,279 --> 01:50:33,158
test but one time in a year on the on

2297
01:50:29,439 --> 01:50:36,279
the government basis not on

2298
01:50:33,158 --> 01:50:39,158
uncertificated Labs that will tell me

2299
01:50:36,279 --> 01:50:42,000
PCR tests that I that I don't buy you

2300
01:50:39,158 --> 01:50:44,479
know that's is like he tells me it's €2

2301
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:47,479
a test it's so cheap yeah but it doesn't

2302
01:50:44,479 --> 01:50:51,039
mean anything to me I rather pay

2303
01:50:47,479 --> 01:50:54,078
500 to have it really done the

2304
01:50:51,039 --> 01:50:57,078
professional way that ISO certification

2305
01:50:54,078 --> 01:51:00,359
that is also required for shipment into

2306
01:50:57,078 --> 01:51:02,719
other countries if you have that I will

2307
01:51:00,359 --> 01:51:05,399
pay if not you I will not you know

2308
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:08,039
that's very leg so important yes it does

2309
01:51:05,399 --> 01:51:10,839
it is and it's also for other crops not

2310
01:51:08,039 --> 01:51:12,960
for Canabis only I mean this system this

2311
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:15,078
was built for other stuff you not

2312
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:18,800
