excited about it um so as many of you

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,199
know I've been doing some podcasting on

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,518
the craft Growers Network it actually

11
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,480
all started off on I made a channel

12
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:29,358
called Gabby Staten Island where I

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,558
wanted a place to tell my story and then

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:35,760
I realized that I want a place where

15
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:37,079
many people can tell their story not

16
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,679
just my story you know while a lot of

17
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,719
people want to tell their story there's

18
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:43,920
a lot of people that don't realize how

19
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,960
interesting their story is and how much

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,600
people would enjoy and benefit from

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:53,198
their stories perfect example is Sasha

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,399
from Slovenia he sent a comment on one

23
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:57,439
of my

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,480
Instagram uh posts and you know I

25
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:02,358
started talking with him and then the

26
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:04,719
conversation went to man you really need

27
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,159
to tell your story and at first he was

28
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,879
surprised he didn't think people would

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,159
be interested in his story but you know

30
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,839
the response has been

31
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,600
tremendous and so I think we've proven

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,118
that you know there's a lot of people

33
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,478
that don't know that they should tell

34
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,640
their story and I hope we can convince

35
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:24,000
them to do it here I've talked to a few

36
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,320
small hom Growers and asked them if they

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,560
wanted to tell their story on our

38
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,559
Channel and the response is always like

39
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,159
well I just have this one tent why would

40
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,920
anyone want to hear from me and what

41
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:37,000
I'll tell you is is that if somebody

42
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,320
posts a video of their hom grow that's

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,680
going to inspire more people to grow

44
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:44,599
than if we post a video of a giant

45
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,680
corporate cannabis farm right because

46
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:49,239
when they see your tent with four plants

47
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,240
growing in it they say to themselves man

48
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:53,839
maybe this is something that I can do

49
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,839
you know it makes it more

50
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,960
approachable so yeah I definitely think

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,880
that homeg Growers

52
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:05,078
can Inspire more people to grow and so

53
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,478
we want to hear your stories and you

54
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:09,239
know we want to hear everyone's Stories

55
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:12,520
We want you to tell us how uh cannabis

56
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,920
is a part of your life and um if you

57
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,519
grow how you

58
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:20,199
grow so yeah that's my idea and we're

59
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:22,200
going to give everybody a place to do it

60
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:24,238
here um what you're going to need to do

61
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:27,280
is you're going to need to have some

62
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,560
type of um online service like Dropbox

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,080
or Google Drive where you can um put the

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,719
videos and send it to me because you

65
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,160
can't email me a 5-minute

66
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:39,800
video and yeah just try to have your

67
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:42,000
garden clean um maybe think about what

68
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,080
you're going to say um for a few minutes

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,439
before you post the video but um don't

70
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,560
be too intimidated by it and don't think

71
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,560
people won't be interested and you know

72
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,560
one thing I'll tell you is that like for

73
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,759
instance if a small grower were to make

74
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,640
a video and post it to YouTube you know

75
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,439
probably no one would see it very few

76
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:05,199
people people but our Channel we already

77
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:08,439
have thousands of views on all of our

78
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:10,719
videos and so by giving us a video that

79
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:13,799
we can post you're instantly going to

80
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:18,598
expose it to thousands of people and I

81
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:20,799
hope that this idea becomes catchy and

82
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:23,798
you know this is a place where like I

83
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:26,439
said before we can inspire people to

84
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,920
grow and share their stories anyway let
