Hello and welcome to another episode of

3
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:16,079
the Way We Grow podcast, a production of

4
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:19,278
the Craft Growers Network. Today our

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,439
guest is Drew Madison. Now Drew was

6
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:26,118
suggested for the podcast by our last

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:30,079
guest, Jared Richie. and um you know he

8
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:32,320
was introduced to me as Jared's teacher

9
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:35,280
when Jarrett enter entered the cannabis

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,520
space and sort of his sensei and uh the

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,120
the grow guru that he got all of his

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,120
information from. And so after hearing

13
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:46,399
that introduction and enjoying my

14
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:49,439
conversation with Jared so much, I knew

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,239
that I had to get Drew on the show. So,

16
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:54,000
um, Drew, welcome. And, uh, tell us a

17
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,839
little bit about your cannabis journey

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,359
and, you know, where it all sort of

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,960
started for you. Thanks, Nick. It's a

20
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,479
pleasure to meet you. Um, yeah, Jared's

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,439
a good friend. Uh, we've known each

22
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,359
other for a couple decades now. Um, met

23
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:07,599
in Denver long time ago through a mutual

24
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,599
friend uh, in the restaurant business.

25
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:10,959
Uh, I think a lot of us in this industry

26
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,199
have had some time in the restaurant

27
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,759
business at one time or another uh, due

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,320
to its flexibility and such. Um, but

29
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:22,400
yeah, I um I I grew up in Florida

30
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:25,839
originally, East Coast, and uh where the

31
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,880
laws and uh the the mindset on cannabis

32
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,799
is is very different um than than in the

33
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,319
West where I ended up meeting Jared and

34
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,960
so forth and really beginning my

35
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:37,679
cannabis uh career. Um but you know

36
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,118
started in Florida growing up and then

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,840
uh went to college at University of

38
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,118
South Florida and uh graduated there and

39
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,439
I couldn't get out of Florida quick

40
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:51,118
enough and um so back in uh 90 1993 I

41
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:52,559
bolted to Denver uh met a friend who had

42
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,959
escaped Florida a couple of years

43
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,960
earlier and um and just hit the ground

44
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:00,158
running. Absolutely fell in love with

45
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,199
Colorado. the people uh were probably my

46
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,118
favorite part. Even though, you know,

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,520
the mountains and the the snow and the

48
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:09,280
snowboarding, I I grew up surfing, so

49
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:11,439
snowboarding was a natural segue. Um but

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,919
I absolutely fell in love with Colorado

51
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:16,400
and but as I was saying, the people and

52
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,519
the mindset of just the kind of live and

53
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,159
let live um kind of mentality really

54
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,360
struck me and uh I took a liking to

55
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:27,560
right away. And um and about a year

56
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,040
after I moved to Colorado, I had a

57
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,199
friend, my roommate had a friend visit

58
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,878
him from University of Florida. And down

59
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,039
in Florida University, there were two

60
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:40,479
hot spots for cannabis back in the day.

61
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:42,479
Long time ago, uh really when Kind Bud

62
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,399
when that name really didn't even exist

63
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,280
in Florida, it was called Crippy back in

64
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,000
the day. That was the name. And it was

65
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,800
it came from Miami and it quickly came

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,719
and went to uh uh Gainesville, Florida,

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,120
which is where the University of Florida

68
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:00,120
is, the Gators. And those two places

69
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,200
seem to be the epicenter of of

70
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,840
high-grade quality homegrown cannabis in

71
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:08,238
Florida for quite a while. And uh I was

72
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,598
lucky enough, as I said, uh when I moved

73
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,640
to Colorado to have a friend come out

74
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:16,560
from UF who had a little bit of cannabis

75
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:20,318
cultivation experience. and he had some

76
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,479
amazing genetics for back then. Um it

77
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:26,399
was it was very hard to come come about

78
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:29,439
or come by uh kind bud crippy um just

79
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,280
really good dank seedless you know sense

80
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,039
of media back then and this is one of

81
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,080
the few cats one of the few guys that

82
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:39,120
had it and I was very impressed um by

83
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,159
what he had and um and I was I was

84
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,560
intrigued and I asked I picked his brain

85
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,079
and uh unfortunately he was and I'm sure

86
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,080
a lot of people have experienced this in

87
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,560
this uh industry is that u some people

88
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,959
are very forthcoming with information

89
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,560
and some people hold it tight to their

90
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,400
chest and uh I don't know if it's pride

91
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,438
or ego or just their own hard work and

92
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,920
they don't want to give it away and

93
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:01,438
that's that's understandable and uh but

94
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:05,119
he was one of those that kept it close

95
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:06,560
and so um I began my cannabis journey

96
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,799
kind of figuring things out on my own

97
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,438
and learning the hard way making many

98
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,120
many many many mistakes as a matter of

99
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:14,560
fact almost all the things I have taught

100
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,720
people over the years have been because

101
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,720
of I've screwed them up learn the hard

102
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,400
way and will never forget those lessons

103
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,520
So sometimes those are the best things.

104
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,638
And so um yeah, so I I started growing

105
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,000
in Colorado in about

106
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,918
1994 just about a year after moving out

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,560
there. And it all began in a little

108
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:35,839
closet in a apartment complex off of 6th

109
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,600
Avenue um west right by Red Rocks

110
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,839
Amphitheater, which is where I lived for

111
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,639
a while. So it all started there in a

112
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,560
little apartment with a 400 watt metal

113
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,319
halli, a hydroarm eb and flow, one of

114
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,319
those orange plastic ones they used to

115
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,759
make a long time ago. all a kit ready to

116
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,478
go right in the box. You just take it

117
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,319
out of the box, get it set up and and we

118
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:56,478
had some seeds from a couple of uh you

119
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:57,839
know bags that we got uh on the black

120
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,959
market. Of course, everything was black

121
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,399
market back in the mid '90s. And I just

122
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,239
had a couple of seeds that we were lucky

123
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,638
enough to find and uh popped them and

124
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,280
they they germinated and got a few

125
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,759
ounces of incredibly good incredibly

126
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:14,000
good cannabis my first uh time around. I

127
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,680
was quite lucky. Nice. So it started

128
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,038
there and uh you know I didn't and I

129
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,360
then I went from one project to the next

130
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,959
uh all personal projects. Um I didn't

131
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,360
really get into commercial growing for

132
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,120
maybe about 5 years after that just I've

133
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,439
been a connoisseur

134
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,478
um and uh and so it's just been more of

135
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:34,319
a personal project taking care of my own

136
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:36,560
health. Um, I do have chronic back

137
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,639
issues and so that's been a very good

138
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,319
thing for me to get into it producing it

139
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,840
for myself so that I can uh take care of

140
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,680
my back and help me sleep a little

141
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,119
better because that's that's my main

142
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,280
thing is I don't sleep very well. So

143
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,360
cannabis helps me significantly at night

144
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:53,359
especially the heavier indicica dominant

145
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,800
strains high high mine u tarpine strains

146
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,680
uh help me significantly when it comes

147
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,160
to sleep. So that's how I got my start

148
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,800
in Colorado in the mid 90s and then

149
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,840
graduated from place to place. I' I'd

150
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,840
rent a house uh talk with the landlord,

151
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,478
examine the basement, determine if it

152
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,560
was worthy or not, and uh put some time

153
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:14,959
and money into it and uh usually have it

154
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,319
for one hopefully two years instead of

155
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,079
having to bounce from year to year. It

156
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,479
gets uh costly and it's kind of a pain

157
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:23,038
in the butt after all the setup to uh

158
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:25,918
have to bounce. So So base was my thing

159
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:28,240
for quite a while. I feel like basements

160
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,639
were uh the thing for a lot of people

161
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,400
for quite a while because you know I I

162
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,519
always see the old pictures of people

163
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,359
trying to do it in their u attic and if

164
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,120
you're in a place like Colorado that

165
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,720
becomes a problem in the winter when

166
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,560
you're the only house on the block

167
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,240
without snow on the roof and so um yeah

168
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,240
I've seen like a lot of people kind of

169
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,240
trend towards the basement in that time

170
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,960
and especially in colder areas you know

171
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,800
you have a a more um your your

172
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,120
temperatures can won't fluctuate weight

173
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,879
as much, you'll have a little bit better

174
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,560
control, especially considering the

175
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,719
different controls you had access to in

176
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,959
the '90s are far different than what we

177
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,199
have access to today. And, you know, you

178
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,638
were having to maggyver a lot of things

179
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,919
to make sure that it worked properly.

180
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:14,720
Um, what were some of those first

181
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,318
experiences? Indeed. Yeah. What were

182
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,919
some of those first experiences like

183
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,520
when you were growing? Well, you know,

184
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:21,279
it's interesting you bring up the the

185
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:22,639
climate issue and that that that's one

186
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,079
of the biggest things we deal with and

187
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,840
that's why we're so blessed for the

188
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,478
growers luckily enough lucky enough to

189
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:31,198
grow in Colorado. Uh we have some very

190
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,879
nice uh weather uh and it's very

191
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,000
conducive of growing and cultivation.

192
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,159
You know, in in a in a grow your

193
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,720
parameters are very important. Humidity

194
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,240
and temperature being two of the most

195
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,720
important. And Colorado were blessed

196
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,240
with incredibly low humidity. And you

197
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,400
know plants do you know with vapor

198
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,079
pressure etc. They do enjoy a certain

199
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:55,038
amount of humidity for maximum growth

200
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:56,719
etc etc. However can you go too far and

201
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,159
create too much humidity and all of a

202
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,360
sudden you're dealing with major issues

203
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,280
mold bud rot um all sorts of other

204
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,800
issues that you have to you know whether

205
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:08,559
it's spring um to mitigate and it's just

206
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,639
opens up a whole can of worms. And so

207
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,120
Colorado is a beautiful place to grow

208
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,960
because of that lack of humidity um

209
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,478
squashes that potential for the mold and

210
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,478
mildeo. Now, of course, things can still

211
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:21,038
grow and fester, but it's just a great

212
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,959
head start we have in Colorado. Um also,

213
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:26,800
the uh just the climate being cool,

214
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:29,198
almost every night, I didn't I my first

215
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,360
probably my first 15 years of growing, I

216
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,360
didn't use air conditioning once. I

217
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,918
didn't need air conditioning one time. I

218
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,320
I I I specialized in growing up in the

219
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:40,559
mountains up in the foothills. Evergreen

220
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,919
um was was an area that I I enjoyed

221
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,158
growing very much. You know, we have

222
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:46,399
about a elevation of 7 to 8,000 ft above

223
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:49,120
sea level. So, every night of the year,

224
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,480
even when it's 95°, even 100° in Denver,

225
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,560
it'll be 68° at night in Evergreen. Even

226
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,240
Denver will be in the low 70s on a very,

227
00:08:54,559 --> 00:09:01,919
very hot day. And when you're pumping

228
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,320
dry air at 72° into a grow, that's even,

229
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,079
you know, and that's the warmest it

230
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,600
gets. Um, in those summer months at

231
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,759
night, it's it's very conducive of

232
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,320
healthy healthy plant vigor. And so I

233
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:14,399
was very lucky to have that.

234
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,080
Were you running your plants uh the

235
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,399
lights at night then so that you could

236
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,480
kind of offset those day temperatures?

237
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:24,240
Um, all right. Yeah, indeed. It's still

238
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,680
something that's super suggested to a

239
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,278
bunch of growers. It's it's something

240
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:29,278
that I feel like a lot of people miss

241
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,799
that that one key point of it. It it

242
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,120
works good in the summer and in the

243
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:35,759
winter because you have that ability to

244
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,959
heat or cool more efficiently.

245
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,039
Absolutely. And another thing to

246
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,838
consider too is the electrical uh the

247
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:45,360
the tiered uh service of electrical uh

248
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,959
service provided uh XL Energy whomever

249
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,959
it happens to be always charge less

250
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:51,838
money at night for uh those less in

251
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,759
demand hours. And so that's also another

252
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,160
uh benefit of being able to grow or

253
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:59,519
using your 12 and 12 cycle to be on at

254
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:01,199
night. Um it's it's it's it's cheaper as

255
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,639
well. So but yeah, between the

256
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,399
temperature and the and the price, it's

257
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,278
a no-brainer to pretty much put that 12

258
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,360
hours on at night every night. And so

259
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:11,039
yeah, Colorado just did me did me so

260
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,560
right early on. Like I said, I was able

261
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:13,679
to skip the charge of the air

262
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:15,518
conditioning and then of course the

263
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,879
costly maintenance and then the

264
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,159
purchases of the air conditioning and

265
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,240
installation and all that and getting

266
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,759
the HVAC guy down in your basement and

267
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,039
all those things we've had to deal with

268
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,639
um you know having people in our grows

269
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,039
or in our areas and our or in our

270
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,759
sensitive areas. So it's been very very

271
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,519
nice uh just pumping pumping air in

272
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,319
pumping air out. I had things on you

273
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,679
know temp stats and uh you know so the

274
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,760
temperature would get at a certain

275
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,838
degree get maybe above let's say 84

276
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:43,200
degrees boom fan cuts on. I've got some

277
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,120
massive, you know, 7 800 900 CFM fans

278
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,040
pumping air in and pumping air out at

279
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,120
the same time. Obviously with carbon

280
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,000
filters back in the day when things were

281
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,399
on the on the uh DL and underground, I

282
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,480
had some ozone inline ozone generators

283
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,799
that were also used in conjunction with

284
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,959
the carbon filters that seem to scrub

285
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,958
the air even uh you know getting what

286
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,278
the carbon filters missed. So it was

287
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,879
quite an effective uh scrubbing process

288
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,958
because of all that air I had to pump

289
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,519
out of my house in lie of the air

290
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:15,119
conditioners. So for sure but it was

291
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,440
quite effective. That's awesome. Um I

292
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,278
mean it sounds like you were already

293
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,760
thinking early on about you know the uh

294
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:26,480
environmental needs of the plants and

295
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:29,519
making sure that you were also targeting

296
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,278
a low cost. So budget, you were very

297
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,120
budget-minded, which I feel like is

298
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:34,958
something that is so important. And you

299
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,240
can't just look at, you know,

300
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:40,799
necessarily buying the perfect equipment

301
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,560
to make everything run as smoothly as

302
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,799
possible. And sometimes you really need

303
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,799
to

304
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:49,919
uh you need to look at it as like a

305
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:52,240
costbenefit benefit analysis and see how

306
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,719
much you actually can spend feasibly and

307
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,879
what you can get with that price. And

308
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,040
you know, air exchange in a room while

309
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,799
not necessarily ideal for you know some

310
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:03,919
of the things that you mentioned you

311
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:06,000
were uh you know controlling for with

312
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:09,120
like the ozone and the carbon filters

313
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,120
for molds and pests and pathogens. You

314
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,360
were already you have those in mind and

315
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,159
you have that as part of like your SOP

316
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,120
already which is such an important thing

317
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:21,278
to do. Um, and since you were like kind

318
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,720
of already geared towards really tuning

319
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:26,000
in to what you had the capability of

320
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,639
achieving, what were some of those

321
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,958
initial harvests like? Did you kind of

322
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,799
hit the ground running and start to see

323
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,278
success right off the bat or did you

324
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,958
have a few large failures? I know you

325
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,838
kind of mentioned earlier that you learn

326
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:41,518
from failures as we all do, but um, what

327
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,519
were some of those early on successes

328
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,679
and some of those early on failures that

329
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,159
taught you some lessons? Absolutely. Um

330
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:50,239
well, luckily I I hit the ground running

331
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,159
with a successful little three ounce or

332
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,399
so harvest with my first harvest in the

333
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:57,120
closet um in the one apartment complex

334
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,679
where I started on my adventure. Um I

335
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,200
was so pleased and so amazed and you

336
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,359
know I grew up gardening first of all.

337
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,040
So I grew up in in the southeast as I

338
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,560
said in Florida. I was also in Atlanta

339
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,399
for a handful of years which is where my

340
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,159
father stayed. And I would go visit him

341
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,440
and he always had a wicked garden in the

342
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,679
backyard. I was always, you know,

343
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,760
helping him pick, helping him plant,

344
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,399
helping him weed, all those good things.

345
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,838
And and I love just, you know, just like

346
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,519
and I wouldn't see it every day. So

347
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,200
every 3 4 days I'd go out in the garden.

348
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,120
I'm like, "Oh my god, that pepper is

349
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,920
twice as it was." It just blew me away.

350
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,440
Just nature blew me away. So extending

351
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,278
this over into the cannabis realm was

352
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,680
just a natural geeky thing for me to do

353
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:36,320
and just enjoy watching it grow. And

354
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,919
cannabis explodes. like just every day

355
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,760
you see a difference with cannabis and

356
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,919
and how it how it's affected by your

357
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:46,000
stimuli and the environment that you

358
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:48,078
create and so um so some of the so I was

359
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,559
quite successful at the very beginning

360
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,239
um had as I said because I didn't read

361
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:54,719
it in a book we didn't have the freaking

362
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,039
internet back then um I wasn't able to

363
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,879
just you know press a key and see how

364
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,319
somebody else is doing it down the road

365
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,838
or on the other side of the country or

366
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,440
whatever and so you know my cloning for

367
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:08,000
instance my first cloning

368
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,360
Um, and I f my first fora was with seeds

369
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,639
as I said and they they popped and

370
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,360
germinated and they worked quite well.

371
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,120
Got rid of the the males. The females

372
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,680
worked. I got the 3 ounces from it. But

373
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,240
soon thereafter I tried some cloning and

374
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:22,479
I didn't have any direction and I was I

375
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,000
took clones. I took leaves as clones.

376
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,560
Like I would take I took, you know, did

377
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,958
the 40 the 45 degree angle dipped it

378
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,039
into the solution and they wouldn't root

379
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,879
because they were leaves. They weren't

380
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,480
branches. And so I you know I just

381
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:35,919
didn't know anything back then. So the

382
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,879
leaves failed and then I tried bigger

383
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:38,559
pieces and that happened to have

384
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,639
branches and hey those worked and I just

385
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,919
figured that out on my my own and and

386
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,198
you know back then I'm using some cheap

387
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:46,799
powderized hormone that you got from the

388
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:48,799
garden store. They didn't have clonex.

389
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,759
They didn't have you know grow tech or

390
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:54,240
any of these better brands of gels. And

391
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:56,000
so um so quite a bit of failure back

392
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,519
then. So once the cloning thing started

393
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,078
working I had some more and more

394
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,720
success. But, you know, I would my f one

395
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:04,159
of my first grows was in Evergreen,

396
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,399
Colorado, and it gets cold at night, as

397
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,159
you alluded to earlier in your comment,

398
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,320
and even in the garage. I was growing in

399
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:12,240
a garage uh above. I had a kind of like

400
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,839
a mother-in-law suite of a big master

401
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,278
house up the driveway. And so, I was in

402
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,160
this guest house, and there's a garage

403
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:21,198
on the bottom and the and the habitation

404
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:23,120
up above, and I'm growing downstairs,

405
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,639
and it's not insulated. And I had to

406
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,480
get, you know, and I didn't realize the

407
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,879
space heater thing and what the minimum

408
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,560
temperature could be without screwing up

409
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,600
the plants and what that would even look

410
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,879
like. You know, how do you even

411
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,159
recognize if you're screwing up the

412
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,320
plants if they're too cold? Well, I

413
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,919
learned quickly that they will continue

414
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,120
to grow. Let's and let's say they're in

415
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,958
the, you know, clearly in the 30s,

416
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,198
they're going to wilt and die. But let's

417
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,559
say they're in the low 40s or mid-40s or

418
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:45,679
or higher, they're going to still grow.

419
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:47,439
They're going to still look very green

420
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,919
and lush, but what's going to happen is

421
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,079
that the inner nodal space is going to

422
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,159
stay. They're not going to fill in the

423
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,439
gaps on the colas. So your little nodes

424
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:56,799
are going to be spread out like they are

425
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,160
at the very beginning of growth, maybe

426
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,319
around the third, fourth week when they

427
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,000
start to really flower, but what they do

428
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,440
is they just don't end up filling in.

429
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,440
You don't end up getting colas. So you

430
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,360
have these beautiful plants with hella

431
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,959
crystals, hella tricoms everywhere

432
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,959
because the cold actually brings out the

433
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,198
tricoms as we know the cold temperatures

434
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,479
at night. But you have these little nugs

435
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:16,000
everywhere and they don't add up and

436
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,519
they don't look that great and they end

437
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,919
up being covered in trikes but just

438
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,720
little popcorn buds. So, I've had

439
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:25,120
multiple sessions with temperatures too

440
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,800
cold, not realizing that until I figured

441
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,639
that out. And bringing the temperature

442
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:31,039
up. In my opinion, I like the

443
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,440
temperatures not to get down below 60. I

444
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,519
like the low 60s, maybe 63. Get that

445
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,759
really frosty look going, but not hurt

446
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,560
the plant and not ruin that potential of

447
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,959
those big fat colas growing. So, I like

448
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:46,239
to keep my temperatures between about 63

449
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:48,638
64 at the very very coldest and right

450
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,560
around maybe the mid 80s to low 80s.

451
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,039
Some people talk about the high 70s and

452
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,119
the very low 80s. I personally like the

453
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:58,240
metabolic absorption of the water, the

454
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,399
nutrient in that mid80s, mid to low 80s.

455
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,360
I don't like higher 80s cuz funk starts

456
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,199
forming in the reservoirs, etc. But I

457
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,599
really do like those low 80s. It seems

458
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,519
like the plants ve uh are very vigorous

459
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,759
and they grow quite well in that that

460
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:13,119
kind of range. And so so yes, and then

461
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,720
and then on the opposite side,

462
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,838
temperatures getting too hot. Back in

463
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,759
the day, we're growing with thousand

464
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,078
watt metal halli lights. Hordalux was

465
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:22,640
the cream of the crop bulb. Those things

466
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:25,000
have like the most hot centers ever.

467
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,839
Like if you see them on a on a a thermal

468
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,679
scan, it's just like molten lava in the

469
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,759
center by the bulb and then going out

470
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,600
from there, it's exponentially cooler.

471
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:36,079
And so you have these crazy hot spots.

472
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,918
And so, you know, the the the the

473
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:39,918
tricoms are much less around the hot

474
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,880
spot. The the the hairs, the actual

475
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,880
pistols of the flower of the of the buds

476
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,360
are much smaller, too. And those are

477
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,880
thwarted as well. And so it so getting

478
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,639
too hot is a big deal. And then I

479
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,520
started adding fans right under the

480
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,038
lights to push cooler air between the

481
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,720
light and the top of the bud. And that's

482
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:58,400
that helped a lot. And that's before air

483
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,480
cooled lights. And that was a that was a

484
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,519
big deal when air cooled lights came in

485
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,000
because then we didn't have to have

486
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,839
those fans. But then we fig figured out

487
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,839
the glass was cutting around cutting out

488
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:09,439
some of that energy that the plants

489
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:11,839
wanted. So we soon got rid of the air

490
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,480
cooled lights and and moved toward just

491
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,079
heavy air conditioning and and uh and so

492
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,120
forth in these larger grows that we've

493
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:21,038
been doing. So lots lots of failure with

494
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:22,879
just temperature. Um humidity has been

495
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:25,200
huge failures as well, frankly. Um you

496
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,120
know, as I said earlier, plants love a a

497
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,558
decent humidity up until a certain point

498
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,279
where they start growing mold and then

499
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:33,038
bud rot. And so, but I don't like

500
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:34,879
spraying a bunch of stuff. Even organic

501
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:36,240
stuff. I' I'd rather not spray it. So,

502
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,400
the best thing to do is just keep those

503
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,960
parameters, keep the humidity, in my

504
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,480
opinion, in the low 50s is perfect cuz

505
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,720
then you get that vapor pressure. You

506
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,960
get the maximum um the the maximum

507
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,440
absorption of nutrient, maximum growth

508
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,000
without the chance of uh mold and mildew

509
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,679
uh happening all over your bud. So, just

510
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,319
keeping those parameters in check seems

511
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,759
to minimize those problems. And so

512
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,639
temperature and humidity were big

513
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:05,359
problems with my my early grows.

514
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,480
Sure. And you have such a different uh

515
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:10,959
like nutrient assimilation rate uh rate

516
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,440
of assimilation when you're under these

517
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,840
um highintensity discharge lights

518
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,160
because they do push off so much like

519
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,480
heat down right onto the canopy that

520
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,320
adjusting for that heat and the leaf

521
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,240
surface temperature can be a little

522
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,319
harder than what growers are

523
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,240
experiencing now with LED lights where

524
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:29,599
they actually need to maintain a much

525
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,319
higher temperature and much higher

526
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:34,798
humidity for maximum transpiration rates

527
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:38,480
within and the same grow spaces that you

528
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:40,720
know had maybe a one:1 fixture uh

529
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,120
replacement where they had HIDs and now

530
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,798
they're on to LEDs and boom they have to

531
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:47,439
completely change their environmental

532
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:51,798
parameters to to still achieve the same

533
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:54,320
highquality product. Um so when when you

534
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:56,720
were when you were growing all these

535
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:58,879
different methods what were some of the

536
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,038
biggest innovations that you saw? I

537
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,880
mean, you mentioned air cooled ballasts,

538
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:06,798
which was huge for HID growers. Um, and

539
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,799
I know that Jarrett mentioned to me that

540
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:12,879
you owned a grow shop at one point. So,

541
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:15,599
you must have encountered numerous uh

542
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,760
innovations throughout your career and

543
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,359
both growing as well as retailing these

544
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,679
different products. What were some of

545
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:24,159
the ones that you look back at now with

546
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,080
like a really fond memory of being just

547
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,640
the most cutting edge thing that you had

548
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,240
seen at that time? and maybe give give

549
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,759
me like the top three things that you

550
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,960
you witnessed. Yeah, that's a great

551
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:36,480
question. Um, you know, I have to say,

552
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,880
you know, one of the one of the first

553
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,400
things I saw, you know, I saw a lot of

554
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,000
different technologies come out as far

555
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,840
as the type of hydroponics cuz

556
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,759
hydroponics is fun. It's uh it's

557
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:46,879
engineering. So much of the hydroponic

558
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:49,440
industry is engineering from the

559
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,600
lighting to the to the actual plumbing

560
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,038
um and pressurized water systems, spray

561
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:57,038
systems, aeroponics, aquaponics. Um, so

562
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:58,879
one of the most interesting things I saw

563
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:01,038
early on was uh I went to there was a

564
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,720
guy named Gordon Creaser and he's his

565
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,919
he's a really popular Australian

566
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,798
hydroponic um grower that is uh an

567
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,240
innovator from probably almost 50 years

568
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:13,000
ago at this point. He was early

569
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,440
hydroponics, but he did aquaponics with

570
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,440
fish and it was incredible. And I got to

571
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,919
go to his house in Orlando probably

572
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,480
about 30 years ago right during my first

573
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,000
couple of years of of growing. And uh he

574
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,480
had his whole garage with an aquarium

575
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,679
and an entire self- sustained fish

576
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,279
aquaponic setup and it blew my mind. Um

577
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,440
and you know back then I was just doing

578
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:36,720
top drip with rockwool and top drip is

579
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,320
still my favorite even today. Um but I

580
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,240
was just just getting started and it's

581
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:44,158
going to this guy's garage and seeing no

582
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,319
nutrient, no anything and not even pH,

583
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,320
just the fish keeping everything in a

584
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,960
homeostasis

585
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:53,279
uh situation was just blew my mind. And

586
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,279
so to me that was the first thing that

587
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,720
like was revolutionary and different and

588
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:59,038
I know that's still being done today.

589
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,400
Aquaponics all across the world uh for

590
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:04,480
sustainability etc. Um the next thing

591
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,519
that really blew my mind was probably uh

592
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,159
the lighting thing. Um you know the LED

593
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:13,519
thing was is absolutely revolutionary.

594
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,360
um going from just the same old same old

595
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,279
for really a couple few decades with the

596
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:19,038
HID lighting whether it was metal halli

597
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,359
for the veg cycle and you know high

598
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:23,119
pressure sodium for the the bloom cycle

599
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:25,038
but just to have this LED and

600
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:26,479
essentially kind of the same LED can be

601
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:28,720
used for veg and bloom which kind of

602
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,558
blew us away as well. Um you know we do

603
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,159
have some specific spectrums that go

604
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,319
back and forth between grow and bloom

605
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,240
but in general a lot of people use the

606
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:38,960
same light for veg and bloom and do

607
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,279
quite well. Um but the l you know that

608
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,640
literally the half the you know double

609
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:47,200
the amount of lumens, double the amount

610
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:49,360
of par watts um going out with half the

611
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,200
amount of energy being consumed and and

612
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:53,678
less than half the amount of heat was

613
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,279
absolutely revolutionary especially for

614
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,640
home growers. You know commercial

615
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,399
systems are different. You can get away

616
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,038
with with mass air conditioning units,

617
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,640
etc. And and um yes, it costs money to

618
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:04,640
run, but you can get it done. But with

619
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,880
some home systems, you can't even do it.

620
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,559
It's it's it's it's a it's a non-starter

621
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,240
for a lot of guys in whether in their in

622
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:13,359
the bedroom or a basement or whatever or

623
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,519
in a closet like where I started. And so

624
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,119
having access to LEDs just opened the

625
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,359
door for so many more people to be able

626
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:21,918
to tap in, use their facil, use their

627
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:25,038
home to be able to grow, maximize, grow

628
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,880
their own medicine. Um, and so this and

629
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:29,440
and then just better quality product,

630
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,039
you know, um, less airy bud buds that

631
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,720
didn't get the the burn like I was

632
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:34,640
saying, uh, with those hot spots that

633
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,640
were created so often with the HID

634
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,919
lighting. Um, and so the quality went

635
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,440
up, the cost went down, and I think more

636
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,720
more and more people just entered the

637
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,880
market and started growing for

638
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,679
themselves because it was uh, it was

639
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,159
just it was just easier to do and uh,

640
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,320
and less money to to do it. And so I

641
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:55,200
think the lighting was a huge huge part

642
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:57,119
of it as well. Um and thirdly, I think

643
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,840
uh these climate control systems are are

644
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:01,678
badass, man. Um I remember 20 years ago

645
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:04,480
dreaming and wishing that I had engineer

646
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,960
friends that could have developed a um a

647
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,480
rockwool or a media sensing hydro um

648
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,079
hydrometer with a probe that could sense

649
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,000
if your rockwool didn't if the pump

650
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:15,199
broke your rock, you know, your plant.

651
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,038
And because in rockwool you don't have

652
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,798
much of a buffer. If your system goes

653
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,038
down 24 hours, you're going to be dead.

654
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:22,639
Your plants are going to be dead. And so

655
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:24,000
if you had some sort of sensor, and of

656
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,360
course we have smartphones now, and we

657
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,119
have all of this present today, which is

658
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,439
a beautiful thing, but I would have died

659
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,719
for this 20 years ago. You know, I I get

660
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,159
a little message on my phone saying,

661
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,679
"Hey, I'm low. I'm sensing 10% humidity

662
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,000
in your rock cube, whereas it should be

663
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,798
20% or more. You have clearly have a

664
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,798
problem." I'd race home, fix my my uh my

665
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:44,158
my pump or my dripper got, you know,

666
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:46,240
clogged or something, and problem

667
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,159
solved. Um, I can't tell you how many

668
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,759
times I walked into a room and even

669
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,240
before looking, I could smell I could

670
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,839
smell rot. I could smell the rot. And

671
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,200
so, if anything is different, every time

672
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:56,720
you're walking down the stairs and going

673
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,960
into your grow room, if anything is

674
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,558
different from the smell, the sound is

675
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,400
different, you know something is wrong

676
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:04,240
and you're and you're bracing yourself.

677
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,400
And so, the smell of a little rot or

678
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,640
something different even for 24 hours. I

679
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,640
go down, it's like, okay, my plants are

680
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,000
are are dying because they got too much

681
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,759
water. They didn't get enough water.

682
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,839
Something's going on. All of these

683
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:18,480
automated systems are just absolutely

684
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:21,119
amazing today that can let you know on

685
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,880
your phone. You can on your app, you can

686
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,439
turn on an exhaust fan, you can turn off

687
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,200
an exhaust fan, you can you can turn on

688
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,759
water, you can adjust pH with these

689
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,679
doser systems. It's so to me these

690
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,919
automated systems that aren't just for

691
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:37,200
these big commercial box places, but for

692
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:40,000
you know Joe in his basement um are just

693
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,159
really badass and and fun to use, fun to

694
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,679
dial in. And as I kind of alluded to

695
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,039
earlier, you know, we're kind of we're

696
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,720
hobbyists, but we're also little

697
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:48,558
engineers ourselves. There are not many

698
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,079
people that are growing that don't know

699
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:52,558
how to use their brains and their hands

700
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:54,399
to fix things because things happen and

701
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:55,918
the growth store is not always open down

702
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,080
the road and you need to make something

703
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,679
happen right now at 11:00 at night when

704
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,199
you discovered it and you need to fix

705
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,200
the problem right then and there. So, I

706
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,278
think every grower has a little bit of

707
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,240
uh engineering inside them whether they

708
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:10,759
admit it or not. For sure. I I agree

709
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,839
with that wholeheartedly. And you know

710
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:16,000
it there is so much more peace of mind

711
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:19,278
when you do have the ability to monitor

712
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,759
your grow from a distance. But it also

713
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:23,839
then it it's almost a double-edged sword

714
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,679
sometime because you know maybe there

715
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:28,798
was a little bit of ignorance is bliss

716
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,559
at times. You know it it it always sucks

717
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:33,278
walking into a room when you start to

718
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:35,759
smell that that rot smell where you know

719
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:38,240
leaves have wilted and are not coming

720
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:40,400
back and it's just that it's a very

721
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,759
obvious smell. you said it and it I like

722
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,278
had a [ __ ] reaction to that to that

723
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:49,200
thought because I'm like, "Oh, I [ __ ]

724
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:51,359
smell it right now." Um, but you know,

725
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,400
if you have the ability to monitor it,

726
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:56,000
then when you do see a problem and if

727
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,240
you're the only person that can go and

728
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,480
fix

729
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,400
it, you're almost obligated to because

730
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,880
if you don't, then you can't blame

731
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,519
anything else besides yourself or your

732
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,799
own lazy ass, you know? Um whereas

733
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:10,639
before you might have just been like

734
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:12,400
well I just I check on it twice a day.

735
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,480
If it's not within my checks I don't

736
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:19,120
know what else to do. I can't I can't go

737
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:21,919
out there every 15 minutes. Um so yeah I

738
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:23,918
I do love monitoring though because it

739
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,080
also helps with a lot of these newer

740
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,240
technologies or techniques I should say

741
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:30,879
such as like crop steering which isn't

742
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,278
new. It's just new for cannabis, but you

743
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,919
know, people in tomato and cucumber

744
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:38,640
industries have been using crop steering

745
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:41,120
techniques for decades successfully as

746
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,159
well and and you know, being able to

747
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:48,319
produce that much more uh produce off of

748
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:52,240
each plant. So, um let's see. So, you

749
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:55,918
know, you said that uh your father was

750
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:59,599
sort of your start into gardening in

751
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:02,080
general. Um, what what were some of the

752
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:04,158
first plants that you remember growing

753
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:05,960
that you were like really excited about

754
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:10,399
that maybe sort of

755
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:13,120
uh uh excited your um your senses to

756
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:15,278
where you really wanted to follow this

757
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:17,678
plant, this path that you've taken with

758
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:19,919
plants. And then you said you also went

759
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,720
to university and I was wondering does

760
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,360
that happen does your degree happen to

761
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,360
um play into your love with of plants?

762
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,719
Good questions. Um yeah, my dad started

763
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,398
me off. He was always a gardener. He's

764
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,000
actually a landscape architect. So he

765
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,798
was um worked for the US Fish and

766
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,798
Wildlife Service and he would design

767
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:39,278
wildlife refugees across the southeast

768
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:41,918
of the country. Um US wildlife refugees

769
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:43,919
like you know 100 acre 200 acre refugees

770
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,720
where the visitor center would be where

771
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,960
the you know uh like in a swamp the Oki

772
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,038
Finoi swamp in in North Florida, South

773
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,038
Georgia area. He uh you know designed

774
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,879
that whole refuge and you know where

775
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,558
everything went, the bathrooms and the

776
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,559
where where the swamp you know would go

777
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:00,000
and the the boat launches would be and

778
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:01,918
just everything and where the plants he

779
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,440
he know knew every plant what every

780
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,520
plant was every tree was he could

781
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,360
identify. So, I had a little bit of that

782
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,599
in me and we, like I said, in Atlanta,

783
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:11,359
we always had the garden. And honestly,

784
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:13,439
my favorite plants were tomatoes and

785
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:15,439
beans. And I think because I because I I

786
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,360
got the satisfaction. I'm not a very

787
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,360
patient person, and I wasn't a very

788
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:22,079
patient kid. And so, being able to see

789
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:24,639
something every day grow and change blew

790
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,720
me away and and it kept me going. If it

791
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,240
took weeks for things to happen, it it's

792
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,558
a little harder for me to stay involved

793
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,399
and stay chomping at the bit. But

794
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:35,038
watching a tomato grow every day, coming

795
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:37,038
from a little flower to a little ball of

796
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:38,558
fruit and just grow literally every day

797
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:40,319
and see that. And the same thing with a

798
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:42,480
bean. And beans were really cool to me

799
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:44,240
as a little kid cuz they would follow a

800
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,079
string up or a pole up and just and

801
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,359
every day it's like another 6 in. And

802
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:50,558
I'm like, "Oh my god." You know, and

803
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:52,879
then and then eating eating the the you

804
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:55,759
know, our our our fruits of our labor

805
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,159
literally. Um that was awesome. you

806
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,759
know, we would cook and eat the the

807
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,760
vegetables in our garden, you know, on a

808
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,519
on a weekly basis. We'd harvest, then

809
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:05,759
cook them the next week. Sometimes we'd

810
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:08,240
can and preserve them as well. And so,

811
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:10,960
just all of that all the way from farm

812
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,240
to in my belly uh was neat seeing that

813
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,159
whole cycle and then expanding on that

814
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,798
in in cannabis later in my life and

815
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,640
being able to grow my own medicine. And

816
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:22,319
as I said, I've had a, you know, it

817
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,320
started recreationally with me with

818
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:26,079
cannabis because of just absolutely

819
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:28,480
loving the plant, loving the effect on

820
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:29,839
me, you know, in college, etc. in late

821
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,399
high school, which is pretty much where

822
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:34,759
I started. But it it soon happened after

823
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:37,359
I hurt my back in my mid to late 20s to

824
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:39,599
where cannabis was a lifesaver as far as

825
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:43,038
a medicine for me. And so the the

826
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:45,839
ability to produce my own chemical-free

827
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:48,798
organic medicine that I know has zero

828
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:51,678
anything bad on it. Uh and then consume

829
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:53,359
that cannabis both eating it and mostly

830
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,038
smoking it. The edibles don't aren't

831
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:56,479
quite as effective for me. They're very

832
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:58,240
effective for others. They don't work

833
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,159
quite as well for me. So consuming it,

834
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,798
smoking it or vaping is best for me for

835
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,480
sure. But being able to follow that all

836
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:06,879
the way from where I germinate the seed

837
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:11,278
or take the cutting from a host plant,

838
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:13,919
growing it, curing it, smoking it, and

839
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,440
feeling better from it. It's a pretty

840
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,759
neat, it's pretty cathartic, you know,

841
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,759
it's a pretty neat circle of of life

842
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:21,759
right there. And so that was a real

843
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:24,319
treat learning that as a child through

844
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:26,558
eating the the benefits of our of our

845
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:28,398
labor to smoking and consuming and

846
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,240
having a medicine that is a benefit of

847
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:32,879
my own labor as well was it was a huge

848
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,319
treat throughout my life. Yeah, it's

849
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:39,039
it's no wonder that uh you know farming

850
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:40,639
popped up in multiple different cultures

851
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:45,038
around the world. It makes a lot of

852
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:47,679
sense. So uh going on to then did you uh

853
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:49,519
kind of pursue any path in horiculture

854
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,399
or botany or anything like that when you

855
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:55,599
went into college or um what was your

856
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:58,079
path there?

857
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:00,959
So in college I was you know I was one

858
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,879
of those lost kids frankly in in school

859
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,480
um most of my friends knew what they

860
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,640
wanted to be when they grew up knew

861
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,599
where they were heading. You know, I

862
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,600
liked gardening, loved it, but I wasn't

863
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:15,359
hyper passionate about anything in

864
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:17,678
particular. And so I I've been searching

865
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:21,119
most of my life for that thing to just

866
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,559
jump into that just was just a green

867
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:24,239
light and everything pointed me in that

868
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:26,398
direction. And frankly, nothing nothing

869
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,159
did that for me. I ended up just kind of

870
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:29,599
falling into a few places and then just

871
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,360
very much enjoying and feeling

872
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:34,558
incredibly lucky and blessed where I

873
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:36,398
fell. Um, and so in school, I was a

874
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:38,960
liberal arts major. I I was a very

875
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:41,359
rounded uh major. I I got a bachelor's

876
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,319
of arts in liberal arts and uh

877
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:45,678
specializing in philosophy and so you

878
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:48,480
know I will talk to you all day and

879
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,240
argue with you all day. Um but yeah, but

880
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,480
nothing specific about the horiculture

881
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,720
back in school. And uh and like I said,

882
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,319
when I I just kind of fit into it when I

883
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,240
came out to Colorado and then had that

884
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:01,038
friend visit the friend of the friend

885
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,880
and showed me this amazing bud that he

886
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:05,519
grew and that just started the started

887
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,880
it in my own mind of hey, if this guy

888
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,319
can do it, I think I could do it. You

889
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,399
know, it was nothing against the guy. He

890
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,839
was a great kid, but but I but I felt

891
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:13,759
like I could do it at least as good as

892
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:15,439
he did. And I'm glad, you know, that

893
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:17,519
introduction happened because without

894
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,600
that, I may have never tried to

895
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,599
cultivate. I may have never understood

896
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:24,240
how amazing this medicine even was in

897
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,599
the first place. Um, and so yes, even

898
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,679
though educationally I didn't get

899
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:30,558
anything directly from it, I I ended up

900
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,960
working and finding my my way through

901
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:34,639
uh, you know, my mid mid to late 20s and

902
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,319
just falling in love with the plant,

903
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,720
realizing how much it does for me

904
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:40,720
mentally and physically and then just no

905
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,038
matter where I'm at in life, finding a

906
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,679
place in my home to grow my own

907
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:47,519
medicine. And I've I've been lucky to

908
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,080
where I've only bought a very little

909
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,480
amount of the cannabis over the years in

910
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:54,639
my entire life. And I'm 53y old man

911
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,278
right now and I've only bought, you

912
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,320
know, a handful of bags of cannabis in

913
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:02,480
my whole life because of my ability to

914
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:04,000
produce for myself in Colorado. And one

915
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,399
more thing I want to say about Colorado

916
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,239
cuz I can't give Colorado enough props.

917
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:09,358
Um, in California, I have to say as well

918
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:12,319
for that, even though I didn't live

919
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:14,078
there, um, Colorado was a sanctuary for

920
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,599
pe for like-minded people like myself

921
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,800
when it comes to cannabis and cannabis

922
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,320
rights. um Colorado, even though people

923
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,839
would get caught and people would get in

924
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,919
trouble for cultivating in Colorado

925
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:26,639
because it was federally illegal and

926
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:29,719
state ille illegal statewide as well up

927
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:34,159
until uh you know the the early mid

928
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:35,598
2000s. Um it it it the the penalties

929
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,119
were much much less than most of the

930
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,960
other states and it was a known thing

931
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,559
and in even different jurisdictions like

932
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,240
Boulder County, I lived in Boulder

933
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:45,279
County, Colorado in in the city of

934
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,719
Boulder. Much less repercussions if and

935
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,320
when you you were to get caught with

936
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,239
such a thing. And so that was that was

937
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,079
taken to mind and considered as well.

938
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,398
And so I can't thank Colorado enough for

939
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,720
giving me the opportunity to take some

940
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:58,880
risks, but also know that I wouldn't get

941
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,480
uh you know, the the the repercussions

942
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,559
weren't nearly as bad as in many other

943
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,559
places. So I I just I can't thank

944
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:06,639
Colorado enough for giving me such a

945
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:08,078
safe haven. And so many people from

946
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:09,679
across the country seem to come to

947
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,440
Colorado to grow. You know, it was

948
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:13,519
California and Colorado seem to be the

949
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,960
big the big hubs. you know, of course

950
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:18,719
Washington and Oregon as well, but um I

951
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,639
can't give enough props to my my home

952
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,399
state of Colorado, man, for giving me

953
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:25,118
the opportunity.

954
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,480
Nice. Yeah, I I I mean, I feel like it

955
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,400
was uh Cal California first with 215,

956
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,679
but then Colorado went recreational

957
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,358
first, I believe, and um kind of blazed

958
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:37,000
the path there. And you know there were

959
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:39,920
a lot of issues with that early

960
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,440
legalization and there still are so many

961
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:46,400
issues with legalization in terms of the

962
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:50,960
um restraints still put on homegrow even

963
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:53,920
in certain cases or um you know how much

964
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,760
uh like how they regulate it. you know,

965
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,838
if it's a plant count or something like

966
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,680
that, that's so silly and arbitrary

967
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:01,519
because, you know, if it if you can only

968
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:05,039
grow four plants, then fine, give me

969
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:07,920
four 5x5 tents and uh I'll show you how

970
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:09,440
much wheat I can grow. And it it's just

971
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,440
silly things like that that don't

972
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,358
actually make sense. It just makes sense

973
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,880
in the mind of someone who's building

974
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:17,679
these different laws, who's never

975
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:21,280
actually grown a plant themsself. And so

976
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:25,199
I I do appreciate like certain uh states

977
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:29,119
that have a heavy um you know a heavy

978
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:32,159
number of active individuals towards

979
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,240
trying to uh adjust some of those laws

980
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:36,480
and stuff like Michigan I know is a big

981
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:39,598
one. California as well, I feel like

982
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:44,159
does kind of help push towards different

983
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:46,559
laws being either um relooked at or

984
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:50,879
reviewed just to make sure that they

985
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:52,960
aren't necessarily causing any sort of

986
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,400
uh issues with just like like I said

987
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,440
like Homegrow. Homegrow is one of the

988
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,680
big ones for me. But

989
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:01,358
um when when you were So when was the

990
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,838
first year that you started growing?

991
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:08,559
Remind me of that. Was it 94? Yes, it

992
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:11,679
was 1994. Yep. Okay. And um do you still

993
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:13,519
grow today? I I totally understand if

994
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:16,799
you don't feel comfortable talking about

995
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:20,639
it. Um but um maybe talk about one of

996
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:22,400
your more recent grows. Uh that that was

997
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:25,519
kind of using whatever you felt as

998
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,838
though was like your your most uh

999
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:29,599
advanced setup. I should say advanced

1000
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:33,519
only meaning like the timeline in which

1001
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:36,160
it was was grown in.

1002
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:38,159
Nice. Well, yes. Um, I recently moved to

1003
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:40,000
Costa Rica. So, right now I'm talking to

1004
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:42,960
you from Costa Rica. I live in a little

1005
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,358
town um right south of a town called

1006
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,079
Hakaco in central on the central Pacific

1007
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:50,559
coast. So, I can surf uh as much as I

1008
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:53,200
can and uh live a good life. I I'm I'm

1009
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,960
very very very lucky. And uh cannabis

1010
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:56,639
has some some to do with that as well

1011
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,280
through my journey um helping me get

1012
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:01,279
here. Um, so I'm not growing currently

1013
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,760
because in Costa Rica right now you can

1014
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,160
you can technically grow if you apply

1015
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,560
through the ministry of salude which is

1016
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,719
the health ministry and you apply and

1017
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:13,838
it's a pretty extensive process uh using

1018
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:15,598
a doctor um much more stringent than

1019
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:18,559
what we have back home in the US and in

1020
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,240
Colorado but you can technically grow up

1021
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:22,400
to six plants if you go through this

1022
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:24,159
process. Um but it's not a process that

1023
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,680
I want to deal with right now. I do have

1024
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:27,039
some local friends that can help me out

1025
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,799
with some medicine and then have been

1026
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,000
able to at this point and so it's not

1027
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,359
one of those things I just really want

1028
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,358
to jump through those hoops at this

1029
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:34,880
point just like I did back in the states

1030
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:36,880
though years ago I'm keeping an eye on

1031
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,039
it and um seeing where it goes and the

1032
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,640
easier it gets um and closer to

1033
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:42,079
recreational because they are heading in

1034
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:44,159
that direction as well which is

1035
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,839
beautiful and as soon as they do that

1036
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:48,319
I'll I'm sure I'll jump in with a little

1037
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:50,320
homegrow of myself is once it's 100%

1038
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,920
legal but right now they don't mess

1039
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,599
around with they right now they kind of

1040
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,480
lump it in with other drugs It's just

1041
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,000
very unfair. Um, you getting caught,

1042
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,519
that being said, you getting caught with

1043
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,679
a little bit of marijuana, even being a

1044
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:02,880
gringo like myself, an American, no big

1045
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:04,480
deal at all. They just don't want you

1046
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,160
selling, don't want you growing,

1047
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,440
providing, uh, you know, transporting,

1048
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:11,519
anything like that. Um, so the last grow

1049
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,079
I set up was a friend's grow in a

1050
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:16,000
basement in a in a very beautiful

1051
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:19,119
concrete unfinished basement, which is

1052
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,838
my favorite place to grow um, as far as

1053
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:26,240
uh, home grow. and um 9- foot ceilings,

1054
00:39:22,838 --> 00:39:28,400
unfinished. Um I had uh had him install

1055
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,239
uh a mini split, a three-tonon minit

1056
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,039
system, which is a very nice robust

1057
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:34,719
system producing a [ __ ] ton of cooling.

1058
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:38,000
And uh also had a commercial

1059
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:40,399
dehumidification system set up all on um

1060
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,960
stats so that uh humidity gets too high,

1061
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,320
the dehumidifier turns on. Um same thing

1062
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,400
with the temperature gets too high, the

1063
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,960
AC turns on, turns off when needed. So

1064
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,599
it was complete climate control. I had a

1065
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,079
uh tankbased CO2 system installed as

1066
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,680
well. I had minimum exhaust. I had a

1067
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,960
negative pressure installed so that at

1068
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:58,960
the front door of the house, you didn't

1069
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,280
smell any smell coming out, any weed

1070
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,720
smell. Even though it's technically

1071
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,720
legal with the plant count that they

1072
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:06,078
have going, um they still want to be

1073
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:07,598
incognito because of the neighborhood

1074
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,839
they live in, which is understandable.

1075
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:13,359
So I always usually like recommend

1076
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:14,960
between 300 and 600 CFM going out of the

1077
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:16,960
house through a filter at all times so

1078
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,320
that you have that negative pressure at

1079
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,960
the front door and at windows and

1080
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:23,359
throughout the house. And so climate

1081
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,800
control was completely dialed. It was a

1082
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:29,119
top drip uh rock wall slab system. Um I

1083
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,880
worked with cocoa for quite a while. I

1084
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:34,640
switched from back maybe about 10 years

1085
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:37,680
ago from Rockwell slab top trip to a

1086
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:41,838
cocoa system in a 10gon cocoa uh mixed

1087
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:44,960
with 7030 cocoa to perlite uh mix and I

1088
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:46,480
switched to the uh cocoa about 10 to 12

1089
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,159
years ago when the russet might

1090
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,760
infestation happened in Colorado and

1091
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:52,480
everybody who's grown in Colorado can

1092
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,480
remember the tragedy that was the russet

1093
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,559
mites coming and taking over Colorado

1094
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,920
for a couple of years. Worst part about

1095
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:59,759
it is no one really knew what it was.

1096
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,960
And so a lot of us were festering around

1097
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,040
just freaking out seeing these uh

1098
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,199
effects on our plants and not having any

1099
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:09,440
idea what it was. And only some elite

1100
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:10,799
people from California knew what it was

1101
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,960
cuz they had been dealing with it for

1102
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,480
quite a while. So all the interstate

1103
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,318
commerce, which was a great thing when

1104
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,400
it came to spreading love and spreading

1105
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:20,719
genetics, unfortunately also spread some

1106
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,200
really hardcore bad bad pathogens,

1107
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:25,358
including those russet mites, which to

1108
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:27,679
me to this day are the worst pathogen I

1109
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:29,920
have ever dealt with in this u in the

1110
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:31,759
cannabis world. Um I've been able to

1111
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,440
take care of them and I know how to

1112
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,760
essentially get rid of them now and to

1113
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,240
control them now. And I use sulfur

1114
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,200
mainly um sprayed sulfur as opposed to

1115
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:43,279
the sulfur vapor because the vapor I

1116
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,559
have killed uh plants too many times

1117
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,119
with it just getting a little too

1118
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:49,279
costic, a little too dense as far as the

1119
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:52,480
vapor. And the sprayable sulfur seems to

1120
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:55,200
be work very very good at about 1.5

1121
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,760
teaspoons per gallon of water used. And

1122
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,519
uh it works quite well uh for the russet

1123
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,119
mites and honestly for the you know

1124
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:03,599
potential fungus, mold, anything like

1125
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:06,318
that at the same time. uh kind of kills

1126
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:09,359
a few birds with one stone. So, but the

1127
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:11,119
russet mites were were a huge issue um

1128
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:12,559
back in the day. I think I just lost my

1129
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,880
train of thought where I was going with

1130
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:16,159
that with uh no worries at all. You

1131
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,640
know, I feel like that's such an

1132
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:20,799
important thing to bring up is the

1133
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:22,879
simplicity of using wedible sulfur to

1134
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,920
take care of russet mites because russet

1135
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,000
mites still are a huge problem and um

1136
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,920
I've had to deal with them a few times.

1137
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,760
Wetable sulfur always seems to be the

1138
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,519
best way to go about it. I always like

1139
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,480
to remind people though that if they're

1140
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:38,559
using oils or mineral oils or essential

1141
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,880
oils and any of their other sprays or

1142
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:42,480
IPM practices to make sure that you

1143
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,039
either give the plants a really really

1144
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,159
good wash with some sort of surfactant

1145
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:51,119
like um like even just dish soap or

1146
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:53,199
something like um capsill uh like an

1147
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:55,358
adjuvant where you can really get all of

1148
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:57,519
that extra oil residue off the plant

1149
00:42:55,358 --> 00:43:00,318
before you hit them with sulfur because

1150
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:02,639
you will melt your plants if you combine

1151
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:04,318
oils and sulfur is too close together.

1152
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:06,480
And it goes the opposite way, too. If

1153
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:08,639
you need to apply oils afterwards, make

1154
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,318
sure that you are rinsing the sulfur off

1155
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:12,719
of your plant if you just sprayed them

1156
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:15,920
for russet mites or other mites or

1157
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:17,279
especially molds or mildews work. Uh um

1158
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,000
you know, sulfur works really well for

1159
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,480
those as well. But I also agree, I do

1160
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,318
not like the like sulfur burners or

1161
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,559
anything like that that atomizes the

1162
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:29,679
sulfur. it it just does seem to cause

1163
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:31,599
some issues and it doesn't go away after

1164
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:33,679
like the rooms just end up starting to

1165
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:37,280
smell like sulfur after a while and that

1166
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:40,078
it doesn't go away. Um but you know I

1167
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,480
think we so you brought that point up by

1168
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,400
the way Nick about the the oils. Yeah,

1169
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,800
that that's a very very good point to

1170
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,358
bring up for people listening. Um sulfur

1171
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,519
is incredibly effective. However, with

1172
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:53,039
the oil it's like a toxic solution and

1173
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:55,519
and let me tell you another toxic

1174
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:58,239
solution. If you have humidity going, if

1175
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:01,119
you are running a humidifier, you never

1176
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:03,519
ever ever want to to run sulfur. Spray

1177
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:06,240
sulfur or use a sulfur burner because

1178
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:08,559
the sulfur will turn into an acid rain,

1179
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:11,679
literally an acid rain and melt your

1180
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:15,119
plants even worse than spraying. So, so,

1181
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:17,199
so mixing sulfur and oils is a horrible

1182
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,559
thing and mixing sulfur in a humidifier

1183
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:22,799
is also a horrible thing. And then

1184
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:24,480
thirdly, putting applying just like when

1185
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,400
you're applying anything to plants,

1186
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,880
whether it's a a good oil, beneficial

1187
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,800
oil, or it is sulfur itself, you want to

1188
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,119
spray when those lights are off because

1189
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,960
when you the the stomatas are closed,

1190
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,400
you you you can burn the [ __ ] out of

1191
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,000
your plants when the sulfur night. Now,

1192
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,358
you can spray even a half an hour before

1193
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,440
the lights turn on. As long as they're

1194
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:42,880
dry, as long as the plants are dry by

1195
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,639
the time the lights turn on. So, that's

1196
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,240
another thing I'd like to point out so

1197
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:48,480
people don't fry their plants as well.

1198
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:50,318
just uh pop on a little green light or

1199
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,760
something and spray the [ __ ] out of your

1200
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:53,199
plants in the while they're dark. Let

1201
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:57,119
them dry before those lights come on.

1202
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:58,559
Come on. Yes, absolutely. And um you

1203
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,880
know, so what we were talking about

1204
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:04,159
before was the last grow that you had

1205
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:06,000
set up and um I think we just got a

1206
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:07,759
little bit uh onto a russet might

1207
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,159
tangent because it's a good tangent to

1208
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,839
get onto. Um you know, it's one of those

1209
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:13,679
pests. You say it's the worst that

1210
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:15,279
you've ever dealt with and I agree. It

1211
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:18,440
is up there. It's probably my number

1212
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:21,839
two. My number one being rude aphids.

1213
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:23,920
Um, but russet mites are definitely root

1214
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:26,880
aphids.

1215
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,720
And I for anybody out there that is

1216
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,838
wondering if they're dealing with root

1217
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:33,439
aphids, uh, my best advice is to know

1218
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:36,000
the difference between winged root

1219
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:39,079
aphids and fungusnats is fungusnats

1220
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,440
wings lay flat on their back. Roote

1221
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:44,880
aphids stand up like the wings are

1222
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:47,200
preying on their back. So those are easy

1223
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,240
easy things to to look out for. So if

1224
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:49,759
you are dealing with something like

1225
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:52,078
that, good differentiator, Nick. That's

1226
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,760
that's a really good point. One one

1227
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:57,560
other thing I would point out, winged

1228
00:45:53,760 --> 00:46:00,480
root aphids fly into light.

1229
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:02,559
Fungusnats fly indiscriminately. And

1230
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,679
that to me, that was my easiest way. And

1231
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:04,880
and they're a little bigger, too. The

1232
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:06,239
winged root aphids are a little bigger.

1233
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,599
You can see their wing structure better,

1234
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:09,679
like you just said. That was a brilliant

1235
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,760
point. But if you just watch for a

1236
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:14,239
second, the wing root aphids will find

1237
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,760
their way and make their way and die.

1238
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:18,719
And that and that's another way you can

1239
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,720
tell you have them. You have dead bugs

1240
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:22,959
on the top of your top leaves of your

1241
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:24,799
plants. Why? Cuz the wingroot aphrons

1242
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,199
are searching out that light. They hit

1243
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,720
your light. Well, not an LED. Excuse me.

1244
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:31,439
Let me back up. Back when I was growing

1245
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:33,199
with a metal a high pressure sodium, the

1246
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,200
wingroot aphid would go up, hit the

1247
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:37,199
light, die, fall onto the top of the

1248
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:40,480
plant. And now on the top of the plant I

1249
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:42,159
have tens if not dozens of dead what are

1250
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,358
these bugs? They're wing root aphits

1251
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:44,879
because they're flying to the light.

1252
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:46,000
Fungus nats will never fly to the light.

1253
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,000
They're just flying all over the place

1254
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,358
just looking for a place to breed. So

1255
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,159
that was another way of being able to

1256
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:54,480
differentiate the two for sure. But yes,

1257
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:56,639
I hate those things man. Let me ask you,

1258
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,079
Nick, what what what was your were you

1259
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:00,159
know because clearly you need like a a

1260
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,839
drench to deal with wing grews because

1261
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:04,639
they they they're they're feeding off of

1262
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:07,799
your roots. Um what's the best way that

1263
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:11,159
you use to clear those things? Uh

1264
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:14,318
pythans and Bavaria

1265
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:17,279
Bosiana. And and now Botanagard actually

1266
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:19,759
has the product Batanagard Max which is

1267
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,400
Pythans and Bavaria Bosiana mixed

1268
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,640
together uh in an aquous solution. So,

1269
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,400
it's super easy to mix up in a spray

1270
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:28,159
applicator if you're going to do like a

1271
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,880
sprinch where you're actually using like

1272
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:32,639
a sprayer like you would for your uh

1273
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,119
folure applications, but you're just

1274
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:37,199
kind of hitting the top of the pots. And

1275
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:39,519
uh it's also why I suggest always using

1276
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:42,960
solid plastic pots because if you're

1277
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:45,199
using a fabric pot, root aphids are they

1278
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:50,480
are usually permeable enough where root

1279
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:53,358
aphids can enter and exit um the that uh

1280
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:58,240
that mesh bag or that that fabric pot.

1281
00:47:53,358 --> 00:48:00,799
Um but yeah, uh py pyth and and bavaria

1282
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:02,479
bossiana work for me. Very nice. You

1283
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,920
know what also I I want to throw in

1284
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,159
there when it comes to the root aphids

1285
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,800
thing or the um excuse me the uh russet

1286
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:12,159
mites thing. I had incredibly good

1287
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:14,318
results with beneficial insects as well.

1288
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:16,838
And some people don't like spraying

1289
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:20,000
anything on their plants and I had

1290
00:48:16,838 --> 00:48:23,199
incredible results with from Arbico

1291
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,800
Organics and there was another one

1292
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:26,399
that's like a little cheaper. They're

1293
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,160
online, you know, the top three hits on

1294
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,480
Google for beneficial insects though.

1295
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:34,799
Predatory mites. Predatory mites.

1296
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:37,960
Californicus, swerki, and Andersoni.

1297
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:41,599
Those are the three Latin names of the

1298
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:46,318
beneficial mites that kick ass on uh

1299
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:48,880
russet mites. Um curcumin mites, all the

1300
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:51,440
most evil mites that you can get, the

1301
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,920
beneficial mites were incredibly

1302
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,240
effective. And the the best way was a

1303
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,159
two two-part treatment. What I would do

1304
00:48:56,239 --> 00:49:00,078
is I would spray a little bit of water

1305
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:01,920
as a kind of a surfectant so that the

1306
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,200
the things that the the bugs that I

1307
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,559
would sprinkle on them would stick to

1308
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:06,159
the leaves that are. So I would spray

1309
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,559
with a little backpack spray or some pH

1310
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:10,399
balance water. Then the first thing I'd

1311
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,160
do is I would shake the ready to use

1312
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,480
bugs that were just like ready just

1313
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:16,960
chomping at the bit to eat. Shake those

1314
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,400
immediately on my garden. And then at

1315
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,838
the same time they have these little

1316
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,960
they're called sachets which are like

1317
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:25,679
these little packets of of bugs that

1318
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:28,960
have bugs of all stages inside of them.

1319
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:31,358
So they continue to breed inside the bag

1320
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,599
and to go out the little holes that they

1321
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:35,519
have in the little sachets and they'll

1322
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:37,039
go out on their own, search out the

1323
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:38,559
bugs, come back to their little nests

1324
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:40,719
inside the sachets and have a little

1325
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,559
environment for two, three, even four

1326
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:43,838
weeks. They'll stay alive. And so I

1327
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:45,359
would have the ready to use that would

1328
00:49:43,838 --> 00:49:47,279
knock them down immediately within the

1329
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:49,519
first day or two and I literally 24

1330
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,760
hours later see my plants look healthier

1331
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:53,838
24 hours later it was incredible. And

1332
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:56,000
then throughout the next week as those

1333
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:58,159
sachets are starting to do their thing

1334
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,920
have better and better and better

1335
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:03,598
benefits or or better uh

1336
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:05,358
uh better recovery of these plants that

1337
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,880
were damaged from the the the russet

1338
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:09,598
mites every single day from those

1339
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,640
sachets. So I really recommend it's a

1340
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,760
little money. you're going to drop a

1341
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:15,440
little money on these, but but 100%

1342
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:16,880
organic. Um, they don't hurt any

1343
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,318
anything else in your garden, and they

1344
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,160
just really go and attack what they need

1345
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:22,318
to attack, which is those russet mites.

1346
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:25,199
And I can't speak highly enough of those

1347
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:27,759
beneficial uh predator mites.

1348
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:30,639
Nice. Yeah, I I've used predator mites

1349
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,960
before for things like fungusnats. Um,

1350
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:34,799
but I I and we've used them as well for

1351
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,119
like two spot spider mites and and

1352
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:39,119
whatnot. Um, I've never used them for

1353
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,880
russet mites, but I'm glad to hear that

1354
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,039
they've worked for other people in that,

1355
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,039
especially for those people out there,

1356
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:47,838
giving them an option if they are trying

1357
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:49,920
to avoid spraying. Um, especially, you

1358
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:52,558
know, after you get past week, you know,

1359
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,240
three, maybe four at the latest. Uh, you

1360
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:57,040
you really don't want to be spraying too

1361
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:58,159
much at all anymore. Um, and and you

1362
00:50:57,039 --> 00:50:59,679
know, there's some things you just don't

1363
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:01,440
want to spray in flour at all. Like, you

1364
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:03,440
don't want to spray sulfur at all in

1365
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,880
flour. you're if you're in a commercial

1366
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,599
setting, you're going to pop for sulfur

1367
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,440
on your plants. So, it's uh it's

1368
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:12,880
important to know your limitations there

1369
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:16,960
for sure. Um Yeah. Have you ever tried

1370
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:18,880
nematodes for the fungus nats? Oh, yeah.

1371
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,519
Destroys them. I had the best results

1372
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,920
with the nematodes. Yep. Absolutely. We

1373
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:25,838
we've been using these new one from uh I

1374
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,318
think it's called like Sierra Naturals

1375
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:30,078
is the company that makes the uh the

1376
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:31,279
nematodes that we've been getting and

1377
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:33,519
they've been coming in on these little

1378
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,760
tiny sponges rather than in the cake

1379
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:37,679
form and they work great. You just pop

1380
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,599
them into your into your mixing tank

1381
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:41,440
with your airrating stone and your your

1382
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:43,440
circulating pump and you're off to the

1383
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,039
races. If you are using nematodes

1384
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:49,440
though, just remember to apply them

1385
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:52,318
through a um a diaphragm pump. Don't

1386
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:54,079
apply them through any sort of uh siphon

1387
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:55,838
pump or anything like that because the

1388
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,000
pressure that builds up in the system as

1389
00:51:55,838 --> 00:52:01,440
well as the like chopping action of the

1390
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,599
actual motor can cause the uh nematodes

1391
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,920
to be destroyed cuz they are little tiny

1392
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:08,480
living they look like little worms. Uh

1393
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,559
if if you need to have a reference look

1394
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,400
look back to that episode of Spongebob

1395
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,000
Squarepants that has the nematodes

1396
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,680
eating everything in the ocean. They

1397
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,599
look just like that but they're they're

1398
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:21,199
tiny. Um yeah. So, you know what I did,

1399
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:23,119
Nick, to get around that though because

1400
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:24,639
of the pump thing and and it seems like

1401
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:26,559
they're even more effective because they

1402
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:29,039
don't want to live underwater. They like

1403
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:30,800
they need a little bit of air. And so,

1404
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:32,719
so what I would do is I would mix them

1405
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,240
up in a 5gallon bucket like heavy

1406
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:35,519
concentration, you know, like 10 million

1407
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:37,439
or whatever the count was. It was a

1408
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:39,358
heavy. And I would just hand water the

1409
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,599
top of every one of my plants that had

1410
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:44,558
the nematode or excuse me, that had the

1411
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:46,318
fungusnat um infestation. And so, I just

1412
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,599
hand top that. And so, I would never

1413
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:49,759
even add them to my reservoir. or I

1414
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:51,440
would just add this mega high

1415
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,200
concentration of nematodeses to the top

1416
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,880
of every one of my plants. And you know,

1417
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:56,639
being in Colorado, my plant count was

1418
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,480
always, you know, in the tens as opposed

1419
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:00,159
to hundreds. So, it was it was feasible

1420
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,240
to do, you know, 20 plants, you know,

1421
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:04,399
top dress like that. And that was

1422
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:06,879
incredibly effective for sure. And you

1423
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:09,680
do only need to soak the top inch or two

1424
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:12,640
of any pot size because that's the the

1425
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:14,639
depth at which which um the neat or the

1426
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:16,400
fungusnat larvae are actually living.

1427
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:19,358
they're not going to be much deeper into

1428
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:21,838
the pot. Um, so I think those are all

1429
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:24,239
great tips for people that are battling

1430
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:25,599
a few different uh pests. You know, we

1431
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:27,519
don't we don't actually get into pest

1432
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:29,200
control too often here, but I feel like

1433
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:32,000
it is really important and so I'm really

1434
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:34,399
glad that you brought it up uh you know,

1435
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,599
just with the the Russet might threat of

1436
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:39,599
thought. I thought that was great.

1437
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:42,200
Um, can you talk a little bit about uh

1438
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:46,000
transitioning from being a home grower

1439
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:47,919
into your time spent in the retail space

1440
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,559
for different grow equipment and stuff?

1441
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,639
Absolutely. Um, you know, I did my my

1442
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:56,319
transition was kind of twofold. It was

1443
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:59,039
from the home grow underground cannabis

1444
00:53:56,318 --> 00:54:00,719
cultivation to the to number one

1445
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:03,440
commercial cultivation because I got

1446
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:05,598
into commercial cultivation. Um, I set

1447
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,599
up a grow in in a set in a part of

1448
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:09,440
Boulder. Um, it's called Gun Barrel.

1449
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:10,960
It's kind of a little it's it's still in

1450
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,200
Boulder City, but it's on the outskirts

1451
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,880
of Boulder, and it's where a little mini

1452
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:16,960
warehouse zone is. And so, this was one

1453
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:20,480
of the first places Boulder City allowed

1454
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:22,639
and zoned for back when the laws passed,

1455
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,440
zoned for commercial cultivation of

1456
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:26,879
cannabis. And in Gunboro, I was the was

1457
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,720
the first warehouse that opened up

1458
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,318
there, my little warehouse with a

1459
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:34,078
friend. And it was back in the day where

1460
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:36,318
you had a notebook of caregivers uh or I

1461
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:38,880
was a caregiver for a notebook of

1462
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:41,358
patients and of people that needed care

1463
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,200
and needed medicine and uh were able to

1464
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:44,799
legally buy it from me and I was able to

1465
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:46,799
legally sell it to them, but I had to

1466
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,720
have a notebook filled with their kind

1467
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,880
of license paperwork and stuff showing

1468
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:52,959
the state. And uh that was my first

1469
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:56,800
commercial grow there. And it was about

1470
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:59,440
a 50 light uh operation with uh like 18t

1471
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:01,760
high ceilings. Um, I brought in a

1472
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,200
10-tonon HVAC unit, which blew me away

1473
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,720
because, you know, my house at the time

1474
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:08,480
had a three-tonon. So, this was like,

1475
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:10,399
wow, this is so big and cool and um and

1476
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,000
it was just it was just so

1477
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,519
groundbreaking. You know, we didn't have

1478
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,679
electricians that were used to hooking

1479
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:17,679
up lights like this yet and running this

1480
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:19,199
much conduit and we didn't we didn't

1481
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:20,960
have plumbers that were, you know,

1482
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:23,199
willing to do the jobs needed for the

1483
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,880
water. And uh it was just really

1484
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:28,719
groundbreaking and it was hard finding

1485
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:32,720
subs and finding uh engineers honestly

1486
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:34,399
as well to figure out uh um BTUs of heat

1487
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:37,039
created from each light and depending on

1488
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,960
what light technology it was etc etc. So

1489
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:41,358
my first fora was into the growing

1490
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:43,679
commercial side of it. Um which which I

1491
00:55:41,358 --> 00:55:45,838
absolutely loved and I ended up working

1492
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:47,199
for uh myself like I said at the

1493
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:48,960
beginning and then a commercial

1494
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:50,318
dispensary called Sweet Leaf Compassion

1495
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,119
Center. And I was the head grower for

1496
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:54,880
that for a year until it was found out

1497
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,760
through uh the local jurisdiction that

1498
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:00,160
it was about 25 ft too close to a school

1499
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,440
and had to be shut down. Oh no. You

1500
00:56:00,159 --> 00:56:04,159
know, just some of those ridiculous

1501
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,599
laws. But so that that gave me a bad

1502
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:08,798
taste for the commercial side of the

1503
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:11,440
growing. So I got out of that um at the

1504
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:14,318
time and um a little actually before

1505
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:16,720
that though I got into the um into the

1506
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:19,039
side of retail hydroponics and opened a

1507
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:20,798
store with a friend in Asheville, North

1508
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:23,358
Carolina. And that was that was quite a

1509
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:27,400
while back. That was actually

1510
00:56:23,358 --> 00:56:31,039
um in 19 let's see that was right around

1511
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:32,798
19 99. Yeah. So so maybe about 5 years

1512
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:34,558
or so after I started growing I opened

1513
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:36,719
this little grow store in Asheville. And

1514
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:38,960
Asheville was kind of like a boulder of

1515
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:40,719
the East Coast. It was an epicenter

1516
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,039
where growers and like-minded people

1517
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:44,959
came to help each other out, to be a

1518
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:47,440
community, to know they're safe, know

1519
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:49,679
that the laws for getting caught

1520
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,039
wouldn't put you in jail for 20 years.

1521
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:52,558
You still get in trouble. It is North

1522
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:54,880
Carolina, but it's a different kind of

1523
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:56,559
feel in North Carolina being Asheville.

1524
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,640
So, my store was called Asheville

1525
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:02,960
Agricultural Systems, and it opened up

1526
00:56:58,639 --> 00:57:06,239
in 1999, right around 2000. And just

1527
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:08,880
last uh about two years ago, we sold it

1528
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:10,639
in in addition with uh four other stores

1529
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,318
that we had opened subsequently. So we

1530
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:15,039
had five stores in total throughout

1531
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:17,679
North Carolina and one in West one in

1532
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:19,440
Virginia as well in Charlottesville. And

1533
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:21,118
we sold those and made uh some good

1534
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,519
money and I was able to buy this house

1535
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:25,760
in Costa Rica with my proceeds from the

1536
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:28,719
sale of that. And so that was pretty

1537
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:31,119
awesome. um taking my you know getting

1538
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:32,639
into that and learning retail and and I

1539
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:34,480
have a little retail experience. My mom

1540
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:36,318
owned a little perfume store when I was

1541
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,000
young and on the main street in my town.

1542
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:40,239
So I learned how to do inventory and

1543
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,440
ordering and customer service and how to

1544
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:45,838
greet people and how to restock shelves

1545
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,920
when you know par levels got low etc.

1546
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:49,838
And so I took that little bit of that

1547
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,079
knowledge with my mama and uh took it

1548
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:53,838
into the hydro store in Asheville and

1549
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:56,000
were very successful with that store and

1550
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:58,239
ended up opening as I said four more

1551
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,400
with the help of my brother-in-law and

1552
00:57:58,239 --> 00:58:03,358
my sister who did an amazing amazing

1553
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:05,358
job, Ashley and Richard um and just kind

1554
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:06,400
of took it took it over cuz you know I I

1555
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:07,920
didn't live in North Carolina. I

1556
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,960
couldn't run the thing. And so they they

1557
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:12,960
basically helped uh launch it into the

1558
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,720
stratosphere and to a place where we

1559
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,639
could eventually sell it and uh all make

1560
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:18,719
good money. And they're both now retired

1561
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:21,838
from it as well from their hard work.

1562
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:25,279
And I'm uh semi-retired, but not exactly

1563
00:58:21,838 --> 00:58:27,199
retired. I uh I still run a uh a uh

1564
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,920
legal marijuana cannabis business in

1565
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:32,239
Denver called Luminescence Labs going by

1566
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:34,318
Denver Dabco, which is a cannabis

1567
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:36,959
extraction lab uh based out of

1568
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:40,239
Evergreen, Colorado right now. Very

1569
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,760
cool. Uh is that the kind of the the

1570
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:43,598
entire business is they just make

1571
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,599
concentrates at this point? Exactly. So

1572
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:48,079
that's my current cannabis business is

1573
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:50,000
uh Denver DAB and we we basically are a

1574
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:52,798
hydrocarbon extraction lab and we use

1575
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,318
butane and propane mainly butane at

1576
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:55,920
different concentrations depending on

1577
00:58:54,318 --> 00:58:58,480
what uh consistency we're trying to get

1578
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:01,559
at the end. But we do live resins, live

1579
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:04,639
batters, we do sugar wax, we do regular

1580
00:59:01,559 --> 00:59:06,319
wax. Um we've done cartridges in the

1581
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:07,759
past and we'll uh probably have some

1582
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:09,599
live resin cartridges in the future

1583
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:11,520
again. But um yeah, we're just a

1584
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:12,920
concentrate lab and we sell wholesale to

1585
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:16,400
dispensaries across the state of

1586
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:18,318
Colorado. And um and yeah, we uh love

1587
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,240
what we do and uh I'm it's kind of

1588
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:22,000
crazy. I I produce we produce

1589
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:24,078
concentrates all day long, but I still

1590
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,159
have to say flowers. flower is still my

1591
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:28,079
favorite personally even though I I love

1592
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:30,558
and give major props to concentrates and

1593
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:32,720
connoisseurs of such but uh my personal

1594
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,798
favorite still uh some very good flour

1595
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:36,959
and you know the whole tactile part of

1596
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:38,798
breaking it up and smelling it and

1597
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:41,760
experiencing the bud and the plant and

1598
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:44,559
the packing it into the bowl or loading

1599
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:47,440
a cone or twisting a joint. I just I

1600
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:50,720
very much still enjoy consuming cannabis

1601
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:52,880
on a regular basis for sure. Yeah, I I

1602
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:54,598
do as well. I um I prefer flour over

1603
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:58,280
concentrates. Although I do love

1604
00:59:54,599 --> 01:00:01,440
concentrates. Um but like uh you know I

1605
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:03,119
always it was really it was a a weird

1606
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,358
experience the first time I used a

1607
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:09,200
blowtorrch to heat up glass to smoke

1608
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:11,358
some some concentrates and uh and so now

1609
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:13,919
I just use like one of those puff codes

1610
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:16,318
that's like the electric uh dab rigs

1611
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:20,159
basically. Um, but other than that, I

1612
01:00:16,318 --> 01:00:21,920
just I enjoy vaporizing my flour because

1613
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:24,558
I smoked too many cigarettes when I was

1614
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:28,318
younger and smoking joints now just ends

1615
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:30,480
up making me a little bit wheezy. Um,

1616
01:00:28,318 --> 01:00:32,798
but yeah, flour all the way. Yes, I I

1617
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,159
very much enjoy it. Uh, I I do enjoy

1618
01:00:32,798 --> 01:00:36,000
concentrates from a pen like you're

1619
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:37,519
suggesting as well. It's it's very nice.

1620
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,559
Uh, especially, you know, when you're on

1621
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:42,079
a lift going skiing, snowboarding, you

1622
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:43,680
know, you're driving in the car, well,

1623
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:45,519
you know, sitting at a park in the car

1624
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:47,279
or something. It's just more handy to

1625
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:48,719
have an apparatus like that as opposed

1626
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,480
to dealing with the flower. So, there's

1627
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:53,838
a time and a place for for all of these

1628
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:55,960
methodologies. For sure. For sure. For

1629
01:00:53,838 --> 01:01:00,159
sure.

1630
01:00:55,960 --> 01:01:02,880
Um, let's see. So, so with uh it sounds

1631
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:04,798
like you were a fan of hydroponics uh

1632
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,519
throughout your entire growing career.

1633
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:09,599
Did you ever uh dabble into any sort of

1634
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:11,679
like living soil organics or anything

1635
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:14,079
like that? Okay. So, I Yeah, that's a

1636
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:16,159
good question. Um I have dabbled but I

1637
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:18,798
have to you know I have to admit failure

1638
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:21,519
when there's failure. So I was not able

1639
01:01:18,798 --> 01:01:24,400
to be a good I I tried to do the organic

1640
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:25,838
soil growing route. Now or living soil

1641
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:28,960
hadn't really caught on yet. This is

1642
01:01:25,838 --> 01:01:31,279
about 10 years ago and um clearly plenty

1643
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:33,199
of people were doing living soil. Um but

1644
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:36,319
in the cannabis world it hadn't really

1645
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:38,399
taken hold yet and uh there wasn't that

1646
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:39,838
much information about it. So I hadn't

1647
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,599
really been turned on to it. didn't

1648
01:01:39,838 --> 01:01:43,519
really know of the incredible benefits

1649
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:45,680
of the sustainability of it. It's

1650
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:48,519
incredible how sustainable it is. I know

1651
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:52,960
people currently that are using the same

1652
01:01:48,519 --> 01:01:54,159
pots 10, 15 cycles in just top dressing.

1653
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,159
It's incredible what they're able to do

1654
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:58,078
with this living soil. However, I was

1655
01:01:56,159 --> 01:01:59,199
not able to figure it out um at the

1656
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:01,359
time. And like I said, it was 10 years

1657
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:03,759
ago when I tried it. And I did more more

1658
01:02:01,358 --> 01:02:06,078
on the just standard organic soil route.

1659
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:09,040
And my harvests were decent, but they

1660
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:10,720
didn't touch the quality and the

1661
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:12,639
quantity cuz frankly, I was into the

1662
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:15,439
quantity as well back in the day. I was

1663
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:18,000
making some money and and so I wasn't

1664
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,358
able to really get the bang that I that

1665
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,039
other people that I knew were able to

1666
01:02:19,358 --> 01:02:23,598
do. And I gave it a few tries. I gave it

1667
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:26,079
four or five cycles worth. And I was

1668
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:27,838
happy with the the quality and such. I I

1669
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:29,680
was happy with the the cannabis I was

1670
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:31,599
consuming from it, but it just didn't

1671
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:33,679
make sense in the space I had. I could

1672
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:35,440
literally grow about twice as much with

1673
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:37,679
my hydro techniques that I had dialed

1674
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,599
over the years. And so that being the

1675
01:02:37,679 --> 01:02:42,159
case, I went back to hydro and stayed

1676
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:44,960
that way and have modified with organic

1677
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:46,399
top dressings, even with hydro and uh

1678
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,639
played around with a lot of different

1679
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:51,680
methodologies within hydro. the organic

1680
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:54,318
thing I I let go because of my inability

1681
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:56,000
to be a very good organic grower. So my

1682
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:58,480
specialty was in hydro and I just kind

1683
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,280
of locked in with that. And when I do I

1684
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,719
do uh enjoy organic bud here and there

1685
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,960
and I get it from a couple of friends

1686
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:08,239
that are masters at that living soil and

1687
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:10,000
so I do get to indulge as well for sure.

1688
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:12,558
you know, and it I think we are a little

1689
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,599
bit uh lucky nowadays to have all these

1690
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:18,640
different companies that have these um

1691
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:21,680
built, you know, uh amended soilless

1692
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:24,558
substrates that are geared exactly

1693
01:03:21,679 --> 01:03:26,639
towards a full cannabis cycle. You know,

1694
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:28,880
you you you use this many gallons of the

1695
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:31,118
soil, you water it, you never let it run

1696
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:33,200
off, and you take it all the way from a

1697
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:35,760
seedling to harvest in that soil and

1698
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:38,558
you're good to go. Um whereas trying to

1699
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:40,799
figure it out before you know like there

1700
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:43,760
were very few products available 10

1701
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:46,079
years ago like what maybe Fox Farm

1702
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:49,680
forest or something like that that you

1703
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:52,480
were able to try an organic grow in but

1704
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:54,960
even that it had different salts in it.

1705
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,798
It wasn't geared specifically towards

1706
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:59,679
cannabis even though there was a little

1707
01:03:56,798 --> 01:04:03,280
bit of like a Fox Farm is kind of a

1708
01:03:59,679 --> 01:04:04,639
cannabis brand. uh it I can understand

1709
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,798
how it would have been difficult and

1710
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:08,558
even for myself I've grown organically a

1711
01:04:06,798 --> 01:04:10,480
few times but I always come back to

1712
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:13,920
synthetic or not synthetic but

1713
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:16,559
salt-based fertilizers because it is uh

1714
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:19,200
you can you can change everything on a

1715
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:21,440
dime. You can adjust on the fly. You

1716
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:24,960
don't need to do any sort of soil

1717
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:27,119
testing analysis that you know you you

1718
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:29,760
might need like a degree in organic

1719
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:33,280
chemistry to truly understand break down

1720
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:36,280
and make uh a smart educated decision on

1721
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:39,200
what your next inputs are going to be.

1722
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:41,839
um and and inputs alone, you know,

1723
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:43,598
there's the standardization of certain

1724
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:46,558
salt-based nutrients, you know, like

1725
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:50,079
mono potassium phosphate, calcium

1726
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:51,839
nitrate, calcium chloride, uh all the

1727
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:54,318
different sulfates that you can use, you

1728
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:56,400
know, malibdum sulfate, uh manganese

1729
01:04:54,318 --> 01:04:59,759
sulfate, all these different things are

1730
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:02,880
so standardized, they're so they're so

1731
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:05,440
uniform that you can source them from

1732
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:07,599
different areas and they're predictable,

1733
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:10,079
right? Uh even if some of them have a

1734
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:12,480
higher quality than another uh with less

1735
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:15,039
impurities, less heavy metals, things

1736
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:17,199
like that. Um but that all usually is

1737
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:18,880
available through testing that that

1738
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:21,118
information is there. But you know,

1739
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:23,440
every batch of

1740
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:26,480
uh fish hydraulicate might be slightly

1741
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:28,960
different. Every batch of uh bat guano

1742
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:30,480
or seabird guano, depending on where it

1743
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:34,400
comes from, is going to be slightly

1744
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:36,240
different. So it um there there's a

1745
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:39,119
consistency with salts that I really

1746
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:41,199
like as well. Um indeed. When you were

1747
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:43,119
growing, did you think or did you see

1748
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:44,558
that any of your techniques were

1749
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:48,000
something that you didn't see other

1750
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:49,920
people using but that you felt were uh

1751
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,119
key to your success in the garden?

1752
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:56,079
That's a good question. Um sure. There,

1753
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:58,880
you know, some um one of the things I

1754
01:05:56,079 --> 01:06:00,480
use, you know those plant yo-yos? Have

1755
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,880
you ever seen those things that are on a

1756
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:05,920
spring? I probably got a few behind me.

1757
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:08,160
Those were out a long time before. Right

1758
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:11,039
on. So, those were out quite They're

1759
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:12,639
come The original ones come from Holland

1760
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:14,640
and they were brilliant. Um, when I

1761
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:17,358
first saw them like 30 years ago, I was

1762
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:18,798
like, "Wow, this is ingenious." And, you

1763
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:21,358
know, they were sold for tomatoes, but

1764
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:22,880
they weren't taunt enough to hold the

1765
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:24,078
tomatoes. So, we knew what they were

1766
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,440
really meant for. They're made for

1767
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:28,480
cannabis for sure and being from

1768
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:30,960
Holland. Um, but I never really saw

1769
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,760
these in many grows. I saw them at the

1770
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:35,358
grow store and I brought a few in and

1771
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,839
then started bringing hundreds of them

1772
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:40,798
in because they worked so very well. And

1773
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:42,920
so that is the one thing that out of all

1774
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:45,440
the grows I've had and set people up

1775
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:47,200
with it. My grows look a little

1776
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,880
different because instead of stakes and

1777
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:51,598
many people or trellis, those are the

1778
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:53,119
two main, you know, a trellis net or

1779
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:57,280
people staking their plants up and their

1780
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:58,880
coal is up. Um, this yo-yo system was a

1781
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:01,039
system that seemed to differentiate my

1782
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:04,720
grows from others. So, what I would do

1783
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:06,799
is I would take, let's say you had a 4x8

1784
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:09,038
tent and you've got the posts, the

1785
01:07:06,798 --> 01:07:13,280
vertical post of the 4x8 tent, you know,

1786
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:15,359
going up. I would take a 10 gauge wire

1787
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:17,119
um that was coated with rubber like a

1788
01:07:15,358 --> 01:07:19,598
wire you'd get on a spool at a hardware

1789
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:23,599
store and run that wire around the

1790
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:25,200
diameter perimeter of the of the tent.

1791
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:26,640
Okay. On the outside of the poles. So

1792
01:07:25,199 --> 01:07:29,598
it's like a perimeter of wire like a

1793
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:32,239
fence of wire wire fence. So I would do

1794
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:35,039
one at about two feet two two feet off

1795
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:37,439
the ground and then one at about 5t off

1796
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:39,520
the ground and then one right in the

1797
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,440
center under where the lights are like

1798
01:07:39,519 --> 01:07:44,559
right in the center. Okay. And so

1799
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:46,720
basically it is a grid a the perimeter

1800
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:49,200
of wire around the 4x8 would be where

1801
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:51,679
all of those yo-yos would be attached.

1802
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:54,000
And so the whole perimeter of the tent

1803
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:57,118
on the inside would have hundreds of

1804
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:00,239
these yo-yos just strung around up high

1805
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:01,920
and down below. And so as you know in

1806
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:05,519
cultivation

1807
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:09,440
um to maximize your harvest, every place

1808
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:11,280
in your tent that has light, you want to

1809
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,119
have green there. You want to have a

1810
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,480
leaf, a cola, part of the plant. You

1811
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:16,560
don't want any light hitting the floor

1812
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:18,719
essentially to have a maximized garden.

1813
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:20,798
So these yo-yos I was able to basically

1814
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:22,880
take from a early, you know, from early

1815
01:08:20,798 --> 01:08:26,798
on in my growing. I was able to

1816
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:29,199
absolutely maximize every square inch of

1817
01:08:26,798 --> 01:08:31,679
light that I had in a grow by taking

1818
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:34,559
these yo-yos and taking not cuz you know

1819
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:36,000
yo-yos and and and stakes and trellis

1820
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,600
are used for two reasons. They're used

1821
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,279
for support so the plants just don't

1822
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,640
drop down and fall to the floor. And

1823
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:42,480
they're also used for straight up

1824
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:44,880
manipulation. So, you're putting that

1825
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:47,198
cola or what have you exactly where you

1826
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:49,600
want it to be to maximize its light um

1827
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:51,599
or its ability to get light. And so, the

1828
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:54,319
yo-yos are the same thing. So, I'm able

1829
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:57,759
to like hook the hook around the cola

1830
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:59,520
and then look look at the the canopy and

1831
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:00,798
go, "Okay, that's a perfect spot. That's

1832
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,159
a spot where light was hitting the

1833
01:09:00,798 --> 01:09:04,000
floor. Now, it's the cola's right

1834
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:06,000
there." And then I would clip the yo-yo

1835
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
right there onto the wire and it's set.

1836
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,079
And it's on a spring. And so, as it

1837
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,759
grows, it doesn't have to be reattached.

1838
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:14,079
I don't have to weave it under a trellis

1839
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:15,838
again. I don't have to, you know, fix

1840
01:09:14,079 --> 01:09:17,838
something. One, it's kind of one and

1841
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:19,759
done. I hook it on and since it's on a

1842
01:09:17,838 --> 01:09:21,439
spring and it grows, it just keeps

1843
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:24,719
growing in that direction and it's set.

1844
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:27,519
So, that that right there is probably

1845
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:29,279
the way I maximize my my harvest

1846
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:32,400
throughout my career is because of that

1847
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:34,239
manipulation technique. Um, and another

1848
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:35,759
thing that's very important that we kind

1849
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:38,079
of talking about the legalization of it

1850
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:40,158
or the illegality of it back in the day

1851
01:09:38,079 --> 01:09:42,640
is is Colorado was one of those states

1852
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:44,879
that plant count mattered. It still

1853
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:46,640
matters in in in in many in many ways.

1854
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,359
You know, six plants you're able to grow

1855
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:52,079
as, you know, recreational user, etc.

1856
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:53,759
But count matters. And to what you were

1857
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:55,920
saying earlier, you could grow six

1858
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:58,640
massive plants and that technically

1859
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:01,480
that's totally legal. It's six plants.

1860
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:04,239
Um, and so I did that as just a person

1861
01:10:01,479 --> 01:10:06,559
that, you know, I'm not a big fan of

1862
01:10:04,238 --> 01:10:08,238
jail and getting into trouble. And so I

1863
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:11,039
never wanted to even test those waters.

1864
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:14,238
And so I always grew the fewest possible

1865
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:15,679
plants in a given space as possible. So

1866
01:10:14,238 --> 01:10:17,919
in, you know, some people would have

1867
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:21,679
like a sea of green and have like 50

1868
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:23,840
plants in a 4x8. In a 4x8, I would have

1869
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:26,480
no more than eight plants. No more than

1870
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:28,480
eight plants. And so it's very important

1871
01:10:26,479 --> 01:10:30,479
that through that yoing yo-yo technique

1872
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:32,718
or what have you that I maximize every

1873
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:34,718
square inch of production space because

1874
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:36,319
I only have eight plants to deal with.

1875
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:39,279
And so it's very important to maximize

1876
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:40,799
that. So CO2 is important. The yo-yos

1877
01:10:39,279 --> 01:10:42,880
and plant manipulation was very

1878
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:45,440
important. Clipping leaves every two

1879
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:47,920
weeks is very very very important. Um

1880
01:10:45,439 --> 01:10:50,079
keeping things clean um was very

1881
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:52,880
important. I was just very anal because

1882
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:55,600
every plant I had was so important to

1883
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:57,279
produce because I only had a select

1884
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,600
amount of plants trying to minimize my

1885
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:02,079
plant count throughout my career. For

1886
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:04,800
sure. When you say clipping leaves, do

1887
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:06,880
you mean like removing the extra fan

1888
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,719
leaves that are shading out flowering

1889
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:10,560
sites or are you actually going through

1890
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:12,960
and cutting off some of those extra

1891
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:15,080
sugar leaves or the leaves that are more

1892
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:18,840
uh close to the

1893
01:11:15,079 --> 01:11:23,359
flowers? I've seen both. Good question.

1894
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:25,440
Um, primarily primarily fans and mids

1895
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:27,439
and so I would I never clip sweet

1896
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:30,079
leaves. Um, to me those are too

1897
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:31,839
important. Um, and I don't want to shock

1898
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:33,119
the plant. I have shocked plants before.

1899
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,480
Different strains react differently to

1900
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:36,559
leaf clippings and you have to just know

1901
01:11:34,479 --> 01:11:38,959
that as a grower. Um, or just test it

1902
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:42,159
out yourself and figure it out. I grew

1903
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:44,079
uh, in my career AK-47 was the was the

1904
01:11:42,158 --> 01:11:46,639
strain that I grew and made most of my

1905
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:50,238
money and had most of my success from.

1906
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:52,320
And I had the best AK uh AK-47 feno that

1907
01:11:50,238 --> 01:11:54,079
I had ever seen. I was lucky enough. And

1908
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:56,880
I, you know, some of its skill, some of

1909
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:59,039
it luck. I had a lot of luck, Nick, that

1910
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,560
a getting that AK feno from Netherland,

1911
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:03,279
Colorado, which was a little grow town

1912
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:05,840
outside of Boulder, um changed the

1913
01:12:03,279 --> 01:12:08,639
course of my uh growing uh career. It

1914
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:11,440
totally set me up. And so different

1915
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:14,000
strains react differently to that leaf

1916
01:12:11,439 --> 01:12:15,439
pulling. Um and the AK didn't like it

1917
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,158
very much. So the most I could do with

1918
01:12:15,439 --> 01:12:20,799
the AK was just a moderate major fan

1919
01:12:18,158 --> 01:12:22,719
leaf only the giant fans whereas a lot

1920
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,880
of the strains today you can go in and

1921
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:26,640
like you look at the jungle boys you

1922
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:29,679
look at some of these guys these three

1923
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:31,440
per guys two per guys they they are

1924
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:33,520
stripping you know and it's part of

1925
01:12:31,439 --> 01:12:34,960
their protocol every two to 3 weeks they

1926
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,880
go in like when they kick into bloom

1927
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,880
they strip it completely two 3 weeks

1928
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:40,719
later they strip it completely two to

1929
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:43,920
three lers one more time and then it's

1930
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:45,119
done um I I have done some of that Um

1931
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:47,760
I'm just leerary because of my

1932
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:49,840
experience with my AK. But but

1933
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:52,159
absolutely um I don't mess with the

1934
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:54,400
sweet leaf, but stripping those at very

1935
01:12:52,158 --> 01:12:56,799
very least stripping the fans

1936
01:12:54,399 --> 01:12:58,559
significantly helps the end product. The

1937
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:01,039
tricom production, you know, that direct

1938
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:03,280
sunlight seems to produce more tricoms.

1939
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:04,960
Um and obviously bigger and better uh

1940
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:08,238
swollen colas as well when you got that

1941
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:10,960
direct light. For sure. Yeah, I I agree.

1942
01:13:08,238 --> 01:13:14,238
I you know I I use the uh leaf stripping

1943
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:16,719
and as well as like a a day 21 prune uh

1944
01:13:14,238 --> 01:13:19,198
at the facility that I manage and we are

1945
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:21,760
able to push numbers up really high. I

1946
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:24,079
think um one of our most recent harvests

1947
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:28,800
was my personal best and it should be

1948
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:30,399
just over 3 lb um per 4x4 area. So we

1949
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,880
were we were really pushing it as hard

1950
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:35,279
as we could and a leaf strip was

1951
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:37,279
definitely required you know not only

1952
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:39,840
just for the light access to all the

1953
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:43,000
flowers and the flowering sites but also

1954
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:45,119
for environmental maintenance and air

1955
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:48,039
circulation and all these things that

1956
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:50,198
really help promote ripening and bud

1957
01:13:48,039 --> 01:13:52,800
development.

1958
01:13:50,198 --> 01:13:55,678
Um, so I mean you've seen a lot of

1959
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:58,079
different aspects of the cultivation

1960
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:02,560
space, you know, from home grower to

1961
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:05,439
commercial grower to uh retail shop uh

1962
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:08,400
owner and not only just doing it in one

1963
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:10,639
space and in one community, but seeing

1964
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:12,639
uh the trends across multiple

1965
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:17,039
communities uh especially coming from

1966
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:19,280
that retail sort of um that viewpoint.

1967
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:21,920
And so, you know, with everything that

1968
01:14:19,279 --> 01:14:27,279
you have seen change in the industry

1969
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:30,800
over the past, gosh, 30 plus years, what

1970
01:14:27,279 --> 01:14:32,559
are um some of the things that you would

1971
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,480
that you think might be changing

1972
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:37,120
continuously? Like where do you see the

1973
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:38,238
market or the industry going? As well as

1974
01:14:37,119 --> 01:14:39,920
what are some of the things that you

1975
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:41,519
would like to see change within the

1976
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:44,039
industry?

1977
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:45,920
Interesting. Well, you know,

1978
01:14:44,039 --> 01:14:48,079
trends-wise, some of the things I'm

1979
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:51,920
seeing are just a continuing in

1980
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:53,920
furthering automation. Um, like I I I

1981
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:55,840
briefly mentioned before, the sensors

1982
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:57,840
that can pick up the humidity in a

1983
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:59,279
media, whether it's in your cocoa pot or

1984
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:01,840
in your rock wall, and be able to send

1985
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:03,198
you an alert on your phone, no matter

1986
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,480
where you are, and let you know that

1987
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:06,238
things are going to die soon because

1988
01:15:04,479 --> 01:15:07,839
they don't have enough water. That's

1989
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:09,599
just brilliant. And I, you know, I was

1990
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,800
screaming for that 20 years ago, but we

1991
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,880
just didn't have the technology back

1992
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:16,000
then to produce something like that. But

1993
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:17,520
I think that um, you know, the margins,

1994
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,119
the commercial market, which is really

1995
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:23,360
pushing most of this, is the commercial

1996
01:15:19,119 --> 01:15:25,359
market is is it's capitalism and

1997
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:27,279
capitalism means we, you know, the

1998
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:29,920
people who own the owners want more and

1999
01:15:27,279 --> 01:15:32,800
more and more. Um, and that's just the

2000
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:34,319
way capitalism is. And so, you know, a

2001
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,840
harvest can be a great harvest, but the

2002
01:15:34,319 --> 01:15:37,439
next harvest, the capitalist is going to

2003
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:39,520
want a little more. And that's just

2004
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:42,158
unfortunately the world we live in. And

2005
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,520
so, that being the case, we're we're in

2006
01:15:42,158 --> 01:15:44,960
this industry, we're striving for a

2007
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,640
little more harvest every time, whether

2008
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:49,600
it's so the technology is going to

2009
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:51,119
increase in advance, all in the hopes of

2010
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,600
getting better quality bud, better

2011
01:15:51,119 --> 01:15:56,079
quality medicine, but getting more of it

2012
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:58,400
per square foot, per watt, per per

2013
01:15:56,079 --> 01:16:00,640
dollar spent by the owners of the

2014
01:15:58,399 --> 01:16:03,198
businesses. And so these technologies

2015
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:05,679
from humidity sensing to environmental

2016
01:16:03,198 --> 01:16:07,119
controls that I said earlier that can be

2017
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:10,158
you know drawn up on your on your

2018
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:11,920
smartphone and you can turn a fan on off

2019
01:16:10,158 --> 01:16:14,000
uh manually. Of course there are going

2020
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:16,079
to be on automated settings to to to

2021
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,359
turn on and off themselves. But these I

2022
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:19,679
think these things that are helping

2023
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:22,079
people put less actual physical time

2024
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:24,480
into it and take that burden off of us

2025
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:25,920
and do it automatically I think are

2026
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:28,479
going to continue to be pushed forward

2027
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:30,480
in this industry. Um, so a lot more

2028
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:32,718
automation. I think honestly computers

2029
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:34,799
and robots frankly are going to continue

2030
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:37,840
to push as well and cut people out of

2031
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:39,119
the workforce unfortunately. Um, but you

2032
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:41,199
know whether it's harvesting, you know,

2033
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:43,519
I saw some apples being harvested by

2034
01:16:41,198 --> 01:16:44,879
drones the other day on online and it's

2035
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:47,199
only a matter of time before this is

2036
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:48,400
automated as well. as as anyone who's

2037
01:16:47,198 --> 01:16:51,678
worked in a commercial grow like

2038
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:54,319
yourself, Nick. Golly, dude, the the

2039
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:56,960
trimming. I mean, that's it's so

2040
01:16:54,319 --> 01:16:58,799
laborious, but we still don't have

2041
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,000
badass trimmers yet. You know, they're

2042
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:02,719
they're getting there and they're

2043
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,679
getting better, but um that kind of

2044
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:07,840
automation, I think, is going to save a

2045
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:09,679
ridiculous amount of money, increase

2046
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:12,800
margins significantly for the for these

2047
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:14,960
companies. And so I see automation

2048
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:17,679
because of in a capitalist society and

2049
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,960
in in us wanting more and more uh that

2050
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:20,800
that's where the demand is going to be

2051
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,239
as far as just you know maximizing every

2052
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,159
crop that much more and I think

2053
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:26,238
automation is the only way to do that.

2054
01:17:24,158 --> 01:17:29,119
So I see that as being a huge thing and

2055
01:17:26,238 --> 01:17:30,718
and and conversely it takes it takes

2056
01:17:29,119 --> 01:17:32,399
away a lot of what we love about the

2057
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:34,000
industry. You know we love the hands-on

2058
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:35,359
part of this. That's what got you I'm

2059
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,439
sure into it. That's what got me into

2060
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:39,599
it. It's the hands-on, the watching it

2061
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:41,119
every day and not just looking at my

2062
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,880
phone and looking at data or looking at

2063
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:45,359
a spreadsheet, but getting in there and

2064
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:47,199
being part of the garden and part of and

2065
01:17:45,359 --> 01:17:49,039
watching it grow every day. And so

2066
01:17:47,198 --> 01:17:50,799
that's that makes me a little sad is

2067
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:52,000
that with this amazing automation that

2068
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,480
we have, we're taking a little bit of

2069
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,238
the personal aspect out of it. Um, and

2070
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:58,158
and as you know, the best way to keep a

2071
01:17:56,238 --> 01:18:00,319
plant healthy is to look at it every

2072
01:17:58,158 --> 01:18:01,759
day. You know, like we said, smelling

2073
01:18:00,319 --> 01:18:03,039
it. You can smell if something's wrong.

2074
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:05,679
You can certainly see if something's

2075
01:18:03,039 --> 01:18:08,479
wrong. um you can see a bean popping out

2076
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:09,760
or a or a male flower popping out. Um

2077
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:10,959
you know because you're in there every

2078
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,560
day and you're looking at it. If you're

2079
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,560
if everything's automated, you're not

2080
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:15,440
looking as

2081
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:16,800
diligently, [ __ ] falls through the

2082
01:18:15,439 --> 01:18:18,158
cracks, man. You know that powdery

2083
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:20,400
mildew pops up and you don't see it

2084
01:18:18,158 --> 01:18:23,039
until it's 4 days too late and then

2085
01:18:20,399 --> 01:18:25,599
everything's got it. And so I, as much

2086
01:18:23,039 --> 01:18:28,238
as automation is badass, we still need

2087
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:31,280
good master growers and and helpers to

2088
01:18:28,238 --> 01:18:33,519
be in those grows every day, getting

2089
01:18:31,279 --> 01:18:35,439
down on their knees, clipping those

2090
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:37,280
lower leaves, looking at the stalks,

2091
01:18:35,439 --> 01:18:39,279
looking at the top of the rockal cubes

2092
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:42,880
for the for the winged root aphids,

2093
01:18:39,279 --> 01:18:44,960
looking for the the the fungus mats. Um,

2094
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:46,560
that that's how we find trouble. that's

2095
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:49,600
how we prevent trouble and that's how we

2096
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:51,760
modify and pivot to continually have

2097
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:54,400
good gardens is because of the hands-on

2098
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:55,760
aspect and being very involved. And so

2099
01:18:54,399 --> 01:18:58,879
that I'm a little afraid of the

2100
01:18:55,760 --> 01:19:00,640
automation side taking away of that. Um

2101
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:02,960
but it's it's it's tricky because it

2102
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:04,239
brings so much goodness to it, but we

2103
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:06,158
don't want too much of it because we

2104
01:19:04,238 --> 01:19:08,319
still need to be involved every day to

2105
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:10,399
avoid the other pitfalls. Yeah,

2106
01:19:08,319 --> 01:19:13,519
absolutely. It is definitely like two

2107
01:19:10,399 --> 01:19:15,279
sides of the same coin. And um you know

2108
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:18,960
we we use a lot of automation at the

2109
01:19:15,279 --> 01:19:21,519
facility that I work at, but we uh we

2110
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:24,800
always say that automation is not a

2111
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:26,880
replacement for observation. And so you

2112
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:29,600
really do need to make sure that you are

2113
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:31,679
getting into the grow and confirming

2114
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:34,560
with your own eyes what the data is

2115
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:37,119
telling you. Um don't let the data lead

2116
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:40,480
you, let it confirm what you're seeing.

2117
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:43,279
Um so that is a huge point. I think that

2118
01:19:40,479 --> 01:19:45,359
that is very important. Um you know kind

2119
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:48,000
of speaking along those same lines of

2120
01:19:45,359 --> 01:19:51,039
you know it's it's a huge pitfall to

2121
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:53,600
allow yourself to only look at the data

2122
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:55,679
and you know in some cases now to be

2123
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:58,560
able to keep up with the market trends

2124
01:19:55,679 --> 01:20:02,319
it's almost a similar pitfall to not use

2125
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:04,320
any data whatsoever. So uh you know in

2126
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:06,799
the same sort of line of thought of

2127
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:09,599
pitfalls in the industry what are some

2128
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:12,039
of the ones that you are seeing new and

2129
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:16,800
old growers face nowadays just different

2130
01:20:12,039 --> 01:20:19,600
pitfalls? Yeah, you know, um, a lot of

2131
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:21,840
the same old ones I'm seeing, um, you

2132
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:25,600
know, whether it's the bugs, you know,

2133
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:27,760
the the bugs, the disease, you know, the

2134
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:29,280
automation is helping these to thwart

2135
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:31,199
these things, but they're still there.

2136
01:20:29,279 --> 01:20:32,880
You know, there's still humidity issues

2137
01:20:31,198 --> 01:20:34,960
and and it's hard to keep that in check,

2138
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:37,199
especially in humid environments. Like I

2139
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:39,439
I I can't imagine growing in Costa Rica

2140
01:20:37,198 --> 01:20:41,519
like like the amount of equipment I

2141
01:20:39,439 --> 01:20:43,119
would want to install day one before

2142
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,800
even getting started. the hardcore

2143
01:20:43,119 --> 01:20:47,359
dehumidification that I never had to

2144
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:50,719
really deal with in Colorado. Um the air

2145
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:52,079
conditioning, um the, you know, the the

2146
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:53,439
scopes that I would look at because the

2147
01:20:52,079 --> 01:20:56,238
million kind of bugs that live down

2148
01:20:53,439 --> 01:20:58,399
here. And so, so, you know, it seems to

2149
01:20:56,238 --> 01:21:00,079
be a lot of the same pitfalls. It's just

2150
01:20:58,399 --> 01:21:02,559
we have different tools to work with

2151
01:21:00,079 --> 01:21:05,359
them now, thankfully. Um you know,

2152
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:08,000
spidermitites,

2153
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:09,839
uh russet mites, and winged root aphids

2154
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,840
are still three, in my opinion, biggest

2155
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:15,279
pitfalls in the bug side. and then

2156
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:18,319
powdery mildew and then uh betritis uh

2157
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:20,880
bud rot are the two big things on the on

2158
01:21:18,319 --> 01:21:22,319
the pathogen side. Um, and then some,

2159
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,239
you know, funk in the water. But we've

2160
01:21:22,319 --> 01:21:27,840
got cleanse now, you know, by Athena.

2161
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:29,359
And that that that that uh chemical that

2162
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:34,000
what is the name of that, Nick? I'm I'm

2163
01:21:29,359 --> 01:21:35,839
drawing a blank. Acid. It's uh it's HO.

2164
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,840
Exactly. Exactly. One hydrogen, one

2165
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:40,640
oxygen, one chlorine atom. And that

2166
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:42,880
seems to have revolutionized many people

2167
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:44,320
that I know's gardens right now because

2168
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,679
they just added because, you know, a lot

2169
01:21:44,319 --> 01:21:46,719
of people went to feed to waste because

2170
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:48,000
they couldn't deal with that

2171
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:49,520
recirculating water and just

2172
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,760
contaminating their whole garden cuz

2173
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:53,360
everything was fe was recirculating up

2174
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:54,719
until, you know, maybe 10 years ago and

2175
01:21:53,359 --> 01:21:56,238
then people started getting smart and

2176
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:58,399
doing the feed to waste to eliminate

2177
01:21:56,238 --> 01:22:02,238
that potential. Well, with the cleanse,

2178
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:04,079
with this hyperstatic acid, uh, you can

2179
01:22:02,238 --> 01:22:05,919
go for a month without changing a

2180
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:07,840
reservoir. I know people who have 30-day

2181
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:09,840
reservoirs that are as clean as ever.

2182
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:12,159
Their tubes don't get clogged as much.

2183
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:14,000
Um, and so there there's definitely some

2184
01:22:12,158 --> 01:22:15,439
products that I would have died for 20

2185
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,198
years ago that are coming out now that

2186
01:22:15,439 --> 01:22:18,879
are helping with these uh minor

2187
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:20,879
pitfalls, but it's just keeping things

2188
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:22,319
clean. You know, like you said earlier,

2189
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:24,400
clean, you know, cleaning up the bottom

2190
01:22:22,319 --> 01:22:26,399
leaves. It helps the airflow. It takes

2191
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:28,399
out humidity and tent humidity is an

2192
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:29,920
issue. It can get too high very quickly.

2193
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:31,359
you take out some leaves, do a minor

2194
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:33,119
leaf pool, even on the bottoms, your

2195
01:22:31,359 --> 01:22:34,880
humidity is going to jump up or excuse

2196
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:37,198
me, jump down 5 percentage points

2197
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:38,800
overnight. It's beautiful. So, keeping

2198
01:22:37,198 --> 01:22:41,279
the leaves off the bottom, don't give

2199
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:44,159
the the bugs a place to to fester, to

2200
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:46,158
grow. Um, be in your room every day,

2201
01:22:44,158 --> 01:22:47,599
every night. Look around. Your eyes are

2202
01:22:46,158 --> 01:22:50,079
your best friend. Your senses are your

2203
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,079
best friend, your nose, your ears. Um,

2204
01:22:50,079 --> 01:22:53,119
but

2205
01:22:51,079 --> 01:22:54,639
cleanliness really from day one,

2206
01:22:53,119 --> 01:22:56,319
cleanliness is your number one friend

2207
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:58,400
when it comes to a garden, even in a

2208
01:22:56,319 --> 01:23:01,439
organic soil garden. You know, just keep

2209
01:22:58,399 --> 01:23:04,479
it clean, keep, you know, just keep it

2210
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:06,559
running right. Um, take notes when you

2211
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:09,599
apply things, take notes of those days

2212
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:11,360
when you, you know, notes are so good to

2213
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:14,480
reference. I keep calendars on the wall.

2214
01:23:11,359 --> 01:23:16,319
I have calendars like with month after

2215
01:23:14,479 --> 01:23:17,599
month straight down so I can very easily

2216
01:23:16,319 --> 01:23:19,759
calculate things out whether it's

2217
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:21,840
cloning dates or harvest dates. I write

2218
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:24,159
notes. I, you know, I'm spraying sulfur

2219
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:26,560
this day. I know to follow up 3 days

2220
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:29,839
later with another hit. Um it's just I

2221
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:31,199
just data is good. I love data. And so

2222
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,719
you can't keep enough data. You can't

2223
01:23:31,198 --> 01:23:34,638
keep enough notes. And just keeping the

2224
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:37,920
cleanest garden to me is is the most

2225
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:39,039
important thing. Yeah, I agree. I you

2226
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:42,199
know I think that it's really

2227
01:23:39,039 --> 01:23:45,279
interesting that we are um almost

2228
01:23:42,198 --> 01:23:46,879
rediscovering certain things and that

2229
01:23:45,279 --> 01:23:49,279
they're being implemented into

2230
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:52,600
cultivation now. So like for in instance

2231
01:23:49,279 --> 01:23:56,079
with that hypocchlorous acid right it is

2232
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:57,760
uh you know it it it goes through just a

2233
01:23:56,079 --> 01:24:00,079
process of electrolysis where you're

2234
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:03,039
just adding something to plain water

2235
01:24:00,079 --> 01:24:06,238
like potassium chloride or sodium

2236
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:08,079
chloride and then you're just applying

2237
01:24:06,238 --> 01:24:09,919
electricity to that water and through

2238
01:24:08,079 --> 01:24:12,238
that electricity you're stripping apart

2239
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:16,399
the two different constituents and

2240
01:24:12,238 --> 01:24:20,519
recombining them into this now uh clean

2241
01:24:16,399 --> 01:24:23,279
non-toxic thick uh chlorine

2242
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:25,199
uh liquid basically that you can apply

2243
01:24:23,279 --> 01:24:26,880
to your plants and it's not sodium

2244
01:24:25,198 --> 01:24:28,559
hypocchlorite like what you would find

2245
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,560
in bleach where it's going to actually

2246
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:33,280
cause issues with the plant by adding

2247
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:36,080
these sodium atoms especially if you're

2248
01:24:33,279 --> 01:24:37,599
using uh potassium chloride as your base

2249
01:24:36,079 --> 01:24:40,719
and it's something that we had the

2250
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:42,800
ability to do for you know over a

2251
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:46,000
hundred years but we just never thought

2252
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:48,000
to apply it in this manner and so when

2253
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:50,399
you know I'm I really love the fact that

2254
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,560
you are an old school grower but that

2255
01:24:50,399 --> 01:24:54,799
you are excited about these new products

2256
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:56,960
because you see the usefulness in their

2257
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:58,960
application where I I do feel as though

2258
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:01,039
there are a lot of older growers who

2259
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:03,520
tend to be stuck in their ways and

2260
01:25:01,039 --> 01:25:05,439
sometimes that you know there if it if

2261
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:08,239
it's not broke don't fix it and I get

2262
01:25:05,439 --> 01:25:10,399
that but also always being open to these

2263
01:25:08,238 --> 01:25:13,198
new ideas new concepts and new

2264
01:25:10,399 --> 01:25:16,559
methodologies I feel like is it's how we

2265
01:25:13,198 --> 01:25:20,000
as humans continue to learn and grow and

2266
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:22,960
and better ourselves. So, I really like

2267
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,399
that you brought that up as Exactly. I I

2268
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:26,000
really like that you brought that up as

2269
01:25:24,399 --> 01:25:28,158
something that you were excited about

2270
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:31,198
seeing it come into use and seeing the

2271
01:25:28,158 --> 01:25:32,839
efficacy of it. It's a perfect example

2272
01:25:31,198 --> 01:25:35,359
of that.

2273
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:37,679
Um, with all of this information that

2274
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:39,439
you have as well, all this knowledge,

2275
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:42,800
what would be some advice that you would

2276
01:25:39,439 --> 01:25:45,439
give to new growers? Well, new growers

2277
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:50,159
have have so many wonderful resources.

2278
01:25:45,439 --> 01:25:54,638
Um, YouTube YouTube is so awesome. Um,

2279
01:25:50,158 --> 01:25:56,319
just just dive in. Give it a try. Um,

2280
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:58,239
it's so safe now. You don't have to

2281
01:25:56,319 --> 01:25:59,439
worry about the legality of it. I mean,

2282
01:25:58,238 --> 01:26:00,959
depending on what state you're in, I

2283
01:25:59,439 --> 01:26:02,960
think there are what, 15 states still

2284
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,399
that have draconian laws, but but it's

2285
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:06,319
getting there. Every year, we're pushing

2286
01:26:04,399 --> 01:26:08,238
closer to total legalization in the

2287
01:26:06,319 --> 01:26:10,880
whole country. So, there's just so many

2288
01:26:08,238 --> 01:26:12,198
less worries. I'd say absolutely go for

2289
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:15,359
it.

2290
01:26:12,198 --> 01:26:17,919
Um, I I would definitely use YouTube for

2291
01:26:15,359 --> 01:26:19,920
for for resources. There are just so

2292
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:21,840
many videos, you know, from guys like me

2293
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:23,679
that just have just love to help and

2294
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:25,360
share information. There's there used to

2295
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:27,039
be a lot of stuck up growers out there.

2296
01:26:25,359 --> 01:26:29,359
There really were a lot of jerks that

2297
01:26:27,039 --> 01:26:30,560
that didn't want to spread the love and

2298
01:26:29,359 --> 01:26:33,399
they were holding on to their little

2299
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:36,080
secret. And the one thing good

2300
01:26:33,399 --> 01:26:38,079
about things going on in society now and

2301
01:26:36,079 --> 01:26:39,840
this cannabis movement and being so out

2302
01:26:38,079 --> 01:26:42,800
there is it's very open source now. And

2303
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:44,400
I love that. I I want I don't want to

2304
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:47,119
hold on to my I want to spread the love

2305
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:48,960
and teach everyone that that needs or

2306
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:50,319
wants to know it what I know and then

2307
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:52,880
they can come back and teach me

2308
01:26:50,319 --> 01:26:54,960
something because I I I am I am only so

2309
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:56,400
smart as I know how much I don't know.

2310
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,158
Okay, I know I know a lot about

2311
01:26:56,399 --> 01:27:00,079
horiculture and about cannabis in

2312
01:26:58,158 --> 01:27:01,679
general, but I know there's a [ __ ] ton I

2313
01:27:00,079 --> 01:27:04,238
don't know and I want to know more. And

2314
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:06,800
so I have am open-minded enough to know

2315
01:27:04,238 --> 01:27:09,198
that there are not only new products

2316
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:10,719
that can give me uh better results than

2317
01:27:09,198 --> 01:27:12,399
I've had before if I have an open mind

2318
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:14,560
to try them, but there's also people

2319
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:16,638
that maybe have been growing for only a

2320
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:18,080
few years, but have had a different path

2321
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:19,760
that can show me something that I

2322
01:27:18,079 --> 01:27:21,359
haven't experienced before. And so I

2323
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:23,520
have a very open mind and I just want to

2324
01:27:21,359 --> 01:27:26,719
produce the best, tastiest, most

2325
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:29,199
effective cannabis I can produce. Um and

2326
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:30,480
and I know I'm not the best at it. No

2327
01:27:29,198 --> 01:27:32,079
one is the best at it. there's always

2328
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:34,238
someone that knows more and so I have a

2329
01:27:32,079 --> 01:27:36,238
very open mind about that and so I think

2330
01:27:34,238 --> 01:27:38,000
that a beginning grower has so a

2331
01:27:36,238 --> 01:27:40,238
beginner grower has so many wonderful

2332
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:42,158
resources but just to go ahead and just

2333
01:27:40,238 --> 01:27:45,119
do it don't put it off just give it a

2334
01:27:42,158 --> 01:27:47,198
try even one little plant um if you have

2335
01:27:45,119 --> 01:27:48,960
a friend with cutings I would suggest

2336
01:27:47,198 --> 01:27:51,919
maybe starting there cuz it's just so

2337
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:53,679
easy to know you have a genetic and for

2338
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:55,440
for those that don't know you know

2339
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:58,158
clones are a genetic duplicate of the

2340
01:27:55,439 --> 01:27:59,678
host plant so if the person is having

2341
01:27:58,158 --> 01:28:01,198
good results with this one plant if you

2342
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:02,880
take a clone from them or they give you

2343
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:04,238
a rooted clone, preferably a rooted

2344
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:07,119
clone you would get and put it in your

2345
01:28:04,238 --> 01:28:09,678
system, then the chances of success are

2346
01:28:07,119 --> 01:28:11,198
astronomically high. Um, as opposed to

2347
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:12,719
starting with a seed and you have other

2348
01:28:11,198 --> 01:28:14,319
things, you know, sexing the seed and

2349
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:16,960
even though it's probably a female, that

2350
01:28:14,319 --> 01:28:18,479
still could be a male and then yada yada

2351
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:20,000
is the right fenos and writing the

2352
01:28:18,479 --> 01:28:21,599
different phenos and keeping a mom of

2353
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,960
all those phenos in case which one is

2354
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,719
the best. And just don't even deal with

2355
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:26,000
that. Get a good cutting from a friend.

2356
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:27,760
And if you're in a state that it's

2357
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,119
legal, go to a store and even buy a

2358
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:30,800
cutting if you need to. if you don't

2359
01:28:29,119 --> 01:28:33,119
have a friend that has one and start

2360
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:35,199
that way and start with a little a

2361
01:28:33,119 --> 01:28:38,158
little system whether it's, you know,

2362
01:28:35,198 --> 01:28:40,479
soil, cocoa or hydroponic. All three are

2363
01:28:38,158 --> 01:28:42,399
great to start. Um, if you really want

2364
01:28:40,479 --> 01:28:44,799
it easiest, pop it in a thing of ocean

2365
01:28:42,399 --> 01:28:46,638
forest, fox farm soil, um, and just

2366
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,000
watch it grow and just give it water.

2367
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:49,199
You don't need to do anything else and

2368
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,039
just watch it. That could be your first

2369
01:28:49,198 --> 01:28:52,638
fora into it because it really requires

2370
01:28:51,039 --> 01:28:55,279
nothing but water and a little sunlight

2371
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:56,800
in your window sill. Um, but you know,

2372
01:28:55,279 --> 01:28:58,639
there's so many ways to take it and

2373
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:00,639
advance it from there. Just like I said,

2374
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:02,560
the the YouTube videos and the resources

2375
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:04,239
out there are

2376
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:05,840
I'm envious of those resources

2377
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:08,079
considering what I had when I started.

2378
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:09,840
So, I say just reach out there and and

2379
01:29:08,079 --> 01:29:13,359
but don't don't put it off. Dive in.

2380
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:15,520
It's it's an amazing amazing venture. I

2381
01:29:13,359 --> 01:29:18,238
I agree wholeheartedly with that. Don't

2382
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:20,159
don't put it off anymore. Just if you if

2383
01:29:18,238 --> 01:29:22,559
you have seeds, get that seed wet. If

2384
01:29:20,158 --> 01:29:24,399
you have a ability to get a clone, I

2385
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:26,080
definitely agree. I suggest clones all

2386
01:29:24,399 --> 01:29:28,319
the way for a firsttime grower. They

2387
01:29:26,079 --> 01:29:31,920
make your life really easy right off the

2388
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:33,759
bat. Um, well, Drew, that was this was

2389
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:35,359
an amazing conversation and I think that

2390
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:37,679
about wraps it up for some of the main

2391
01:29:35,359 --> 01:29:40,079
questions there, but I do always like to

2392
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:41,760
ask a couple little wrap-up questions

2393
01:29:40,079 --> 01:29:43,840
just to kind of round out the whole

2394
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:46,079
show. Sure, man. And, um, you've smoked

2395
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:48,560
for a long time, so you probably have

2396
01:29:46,079 --> 01:29:52,319
experienced a lot of different strains

2397
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:54,080
and cultivars. So, uh, since you are a

2398
01:29:52,319 --> 01:29:55,840
grower with this much experience, I'm

2399
01:29:54,079 --> 01:29:59,039
going to break this question up into two

2400
01:29:55,840 --> 01:30:01,199
parts. What was your favorite strain to

2401
01:29:59,039 --> 01:30:04,079
grow of all time? I I feel like I might

2402
01:30:01,198 --> 01:30:05,919
have uh a little inkling of of an idea

2403
01:30:04,079 --> 01:30:08,719
of what you might say considering what

2404
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:11,119
you said earlier about the AK-47 being

2405
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:13,679
sort of your bread and butter, but uh if

2406
01:30:11,119 --> 01:30:15,760
that's not it, I I am all for hearing

2407
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:19,279
it. Um, and then what was your favorite

2408
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:22,039
to smoke? Okay, very good questions. Um,

2409
01:30:19,279 --> 01:30:24,319
okay. Yes, you were right. The

2410
01:30:22,039 --> 01:30:31,158
AK-47 was so special. And let me just

2411
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:34,719
say why. Um, for a grower it was, um,

2412
01:30:31,158 --> 01:30:36,319
giant armsized colas and as fat as my

2413
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:39,359
forearm. And I'm a skinny dude, but I,

2414
01:30:36,319 --> 01:30:41,439
you know, still that's a huge cola. Um,

2415
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:43,759
and this is back in the day where people

2416
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:45,759
were very much into showing off the size

2417
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:47,520
of their colas. And so having a cola

2418
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:49,039
that big was a cool thing. Nowadays, no

2419
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:50,480
was like, oh, all that stick weight and

2420
01:30:49,039 --> 01:30:52,719
stem weight. Nobody wants a cola that

2421
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:56,638
big now. But back in the day, you know,

2422
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:58,639
10, 20, even 30 years ago, that was like

2423
01:30:56,639 --> 01:31:00,639
people like were like when they saw a

2424
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:02,079
cola like that. And it wasn't me. I I

2425
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:04,719
have to give credit where credit's due.

2426
01:31:02,079 --> 01:31:06,559
It was a strain. I I was blessed with

2427
01:31:04,719 --> 01:31:08,800
the best one of the best genetics still

2428
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:11,840
to this day I've ever gotten. But the

2429
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:14,400
smell of that AK nick was what really

2430
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:16,639
set it apart. It was one of those buds

2431
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:18,079
that when you were at a party or at a

2432
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:20,199
get together and you were in the corner

2433
01:31:18,079 --> 01:31:23,119
of the room and you whipped out your AK

2434
01:31:20,198 --> 01:31:25,839
nug, everybody did this and looked at

2435
01:31:23,119 --> 01:31:28,800
your corner like within seconds. It was

2436
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:31,199
known. It was one of a kind. No other

2437
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:34,159
plant smelled like it. Yes, Chronic

2438
01:31:31,198 --> 01:31:36,238
smelled like skunk, but AK had its own

2439
01:31:34,158 --> 01:31:37,839
such a unique smell that everybody knew

2440
01:31:36,238 --> 01:31:40,799
it and everybody wanted it cuz it was

2441
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:43,039
the the nastiest, gassiest with a little

2442
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:46,320
bit of fruit as well. Everybody loved

2443
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:48,560
the AK. And so it it was it was props

2444
01:31:46,319 --> 01:31:50,319
being able to have that and and uh

2445
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:52,400
getting that kind of recognition. And so

2446
01:31:50,319 --> 01:31:53,639
it was very weighty. I was growing back

2447
01:31:52,399 --> 01:31:56,799
in the day off

2448
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:59,520
of 1000 watt lights. I was growing 2 lb

2449
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:02,159
plus 2 1/2 lb of light all day long.

2450
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:05,600
This is 20 years ago. Yeah. All day long

2451
01:32:02,158 --> 01:32:09,359
on that. Um, it cloned in 7 days, 8

2452
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:13,760
days. Wow. Both in clone machines and in

2453
01:32:09,359 --> 01:32:17,279
1in rockwool with domes. Um, very uh uh

2454
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:19,039
um mold resistant. It was bug resistant.

2455
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:20,639
It was just it fired on all cylinders.

2456
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:22,479
What can I say? And then finally, the

2457
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:24,400
smoke of it was delightful. It was a

2458
01:32:22,479 --> 01:32:26,718
high It was a true hybrid. Mine I

2459
01:32:24,399 --> 01:32:30,000
guessed at around 50/50 based on my

2460
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:32,639
effects or the effects on me. Um I could

2461
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:35,679
sleep on it. It was good pain reliever.

2462
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:39,520
Um it was incredibly tasty and so it was

2463
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:41,199
just the best allaround for me. Um now

2464
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:42,960
since then, you know, with all of these

2465
01:32:41,198 --> 01:32:44,479
boutique bougie strains coming out,

2466
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,319
especially in Colorado, and I've got

2467
01:32:44,479 --> 01:32:49,279
some, you know, friends that that work

2468
01:32:46,319 --> 01:32:52,319
at Clone, which have amazing genetics

2469
01:32:49,279 --> 01:32:54,399
over at Clone Colorado. Um also at Free

2470
01:32:52,319 --> 01:32:56,960
World Genetics. Uh Sam and Austin who

2471
01:32:54,399 --> 01:32:59,839
run that are two amazing savants.

2472
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:02,719
They're badass at what they do. Um love

2473
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:04,800
their genetics as well. Um one of my

2474
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:07,198
favorites was called Orange Cookie Chem

2475
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:09,400
which was a free world genetic that was

2476
01:33:07,198 --> 01:33:12,238
absolutely delightful in white with

2477
01:33:09,399 --> 01:33:15,039
tricoms. Super tasty with that orangey

2478
01:33:12,238 --> 01:33:17,039
tangy kind of back tone. Absolutely

2479
01:33:15,039 --> 01:33:18,960
delicious. Medium yielder. So this is

2480
01:33:17,039 --> 01:33:22,439
strictly for flavor and effect. I

2481
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:26,399
absolutely love that strain. And

2482
01:33:22,439 --> 01:33:28,158
um and let's see. I I think right now I

2483
01:33:26,399 --> 01:33:30,638
would have to say this this strain

2484
01:33:28,158 --> 01:33:33,359
called Fremac, which is actually another

2485
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:36,400
one of the free world genetic strains.

2486
01:33:33,359 --> 01:33:39,359
Um that was it was kind of fired on all

2487
01:33:36,399 --> 01:33:42,559
cylinders, but it was very very stony,

2488
01:33:39,359 --> 01:33:43,679
big buds, dense buds, got a little rot

2489
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:44,960
here and there if you didn't really

2490
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:47,840
watch your humidity. You want to keep it

2491
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:49,840
under 50 if you can. Um but just fired

2492
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:51,679
on all cylinders. Easy. two, you know,

2493
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:54,800
two pounds per light. If you were under

2494
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:56,639
a thouie, um, or if you're with LED, you

2495
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:58,560
know, you could get a pound off of a

2496
01:33:56,639 --> 01:34:02,319
600, you know, a pound and a half off a

2497
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:06,159
600 watt, uh, maybe even 2 lb off a 630

2498
01:34:02,319 --> 01:34:08,399
W 4x4 LED light. Um, so an incredible

2499
01:34:06,158 --> 01:34:10,319
plant, but very, very stony, a little on

2500
01:34:08,399 --> 01:34:11,679
the indica side. I prefer a little on

2501
01:34:10,319 --> 01:34:13,679
the indica side because I'm looking for

2502
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:16,079
a lot of pain relief. I have a a chronic

2503
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:17,600
back, low back pain, and I've had

2504
01:34:16,079 --> 01:34:19,760
indicas usually help me a little more on

2505
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:21,840
the back. So, I'd say the Freemac and

2506
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:23,600
the AK were my two favorites. Um,

2507
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:26,400
overall, I do like the diesels as well.

2508
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:29,840
New York City and some Sour D. I'm still

2509
01:34:26,399 --> 01:34:31,599
a fan of those. Um, as well, but I love

2510
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:33,279
trying new Bud. Someone has another

2511
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:35,120
strain, I'd love to try it, especially

2512
01:34:33,279 --> 01:34:37,439
when I'm sober because I like to give a

2513
01:34:35,119 --> 01:34:40,000
a very good opinion on, you know, the

2514
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:41,919
the taste, how it tickles my throat, how

2515
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,279
it tickles my nose with the tarpine

2516
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:45,279
effect, and then of course the the

2517
01:34:43,279 --> 01:34:48,639
effect 10 or 15 minutes later. I'd love

2518
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:50,639
to check it out for sure. Is the is the

2519
01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:53,359
free mac sort of their version of the

2520
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:55,679
the miracle alien cookies? Yes. Yes,

2521
01:34:53,359 --> 01:34:58,000
it's I believe it's the miracle alien

2522
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:59,719
cookies mixed with their free world chem

2523
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:03,359
I believe. Oh,

2524
01:34:59,719 --> 01:35:05,520
cool. Really solid base chem as well.

2525
01:35:03,359 --> 01:35:07,920
Yeah, that sounds awesome. And the and

2526
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:10,080
the colas were very different. The much

2527
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:12,399
bigger colas because as you know the uh

2528
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:15,039
miracle alien cookies has very small

2529
01:35:12,399 --> 01:35:17,279
little nectar buds but they're small.

2530
01:35:15,039 --> 01:35:19,359
Um, but the free mac is is like three,

2531
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:21,679
four, five times the size of colas than

2532
01:35:19,359 --> 01:35:24,399
the the Miracle alien cookies.

2533
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:26,158
Delicious. Nice. Everything those guys

2534
01:35:24,399 --> 01:35:27,839
do, honestly, Nick, is great. If anybody

2535
01:35:26,158 --> 01:35:30,638
has a chance to hook up with Free World

2536
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:33,679
Genetics, I highly recommend it. For

2537
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:35,359
sure. Well, um, if, uh, if you know them

2538
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:36,719
personally and you want to help me get

2539
01:35:35,359 --> 01:35:38,799
them on the show, I'd love to have them

2540
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:41,198
and hear more about their story, too.

2541
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:44,960
Um, dude, absolutely. I I guarantee it.

2542
01:35:41,198 --> 01:35:47,119
Yeah, we'll do it. Cool. Well, um I mean

2543
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:49,279
the next question uh may have already

2544
01:35:47,119 --> 01:35:51,760
been answered, but uh feel free to just

2545
01:35:49,279 --> 01:35:54,880
run with it. Who is your favorite

2546
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:57,679
breeder of all time? Man, you know, old

2547
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:59,679
school DJ Short. Um I hate to keep

2548
01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:01,679
coming back to my boys, man. But Sam and

2549
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:03,279
Austin, Free World Genetics are my

2550
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:05,119
favorite. Um for sure. They've been

2551
01:36:03,279 --> 01:36:07,198
taking care of me for like 5 years, six

2552
01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:09,439
years now. Um and they're just really

2553
01:36:07,198 --> 01:36:11,559
cutting edge. Um they work with you

2554
01:36:09,439 --> 01:36:14,000
personally.

2555
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:15,440
Um, I just really like their personal

2556
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,960
touch to it. Like I, like I say, I'm

2557
01:36:15,439 --> 01:36:19,119
friends with both of them and so it's

2558
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:21,760
not like on big some corporate big

2559
01:36:19,119 --> 01:36:23,439
corporate um thing, you know, like some

2560
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,800
online company. I can really talk to

2561
01:36:23,439 --> 01:36:26,158
them on a personal level and tell them

2562
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:27,360
what I'm looking for and they will sit

2563
01:36:26,158 --> 01:36:28,399
me down and say, "Hold on, let me put

2564
01:36:27,359 --> 01:36:30,319
some thought into that. Drew, let me

2565
01:36:28,399 --> 01:36:32,238
call you back in 30 minutes. Let me call

2566
01:36:30,319 --> 01:36:34,079
Austin and let you know see what he has

2567
01:36:32,238 --> 01:36:36,238
to say about it." So, honestly, I think

2568
01:36:34,079 --> 01:36:37,760
it's free world. Um, you know, I like

2569
01:36:36,238 --> 01:36:40,158
some of the old school. Like I say, DJ

2570
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:42,239
Short did some amazing amazing things

2571
01:36:40,158 --> 01:36:44,399
for for a long time and was really an

2572
01:36:42,238 --> 01:36:45,839
innovator in the industry and so but I'd

2573
01:36:44,399 --> 01:36:47,839
like to say Sam and Austin with Free

2574
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:50,560
World are my favorite guys just because

2575
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:52,239
of what they're doing currently. Nice.

2576
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:54,480
Yeah, we actually we did a show with DJ

2577
01:36:52,238 --> 01:36:57,519
Short and it was a great episode talking

2578
01:36:54,479 --> 01:36:59,519
about his blueberry and his flow and uh

2579
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:01,480
um yeah, it would be great to get more

2580
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:04,880
breeders on here to talk about their

2581
01:37:01,479 --> 01:37:07,678
strength. Uh yeah, so um I need to watch

2582
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:09,199
that episode. Nick, you should. It was a

2583
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:11,920
really good one. That was with our our

2584
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:13,919
co-host, uh, Gabby Bronstein. He's, uh,

2585
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:16,079
also known as Gabby Staten Island. He's

2586
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:18,639
the guy that brought the, uh, the Sour

2587
01:37:16,079 --> 01:37:22,238
Diesel out from the the East Coast to

2588
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:25,920
the West Coast. And, uh, it was a really

2589
01:37:22,238 --> 01:37:28,879
fun episode. Sick. And so, let's see,

2590
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:31,760
last question then, just to wrap it up.

2591
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:33,400
What is your most memorable cannabis

2592
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:35,930
related experience?

2593
01:37:33,399 --> 01:37:39,478
Hm. Cambers related

2594
01:37:35,930 --> 01:37:39,479
[Music]

2595
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:46,479
experience. You know, probably my first

2596
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:49,760
time to Red Rocks Amphitheater and going

2597
01:37:46,479 --> 01:37:53,839
to see a show. Um, I think it was Blues

2598
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:55,840
Traveler back maybe 20 years ago. They

2599
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:57,760
used to come to Red Rocks every 4th of

2600
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:59,279
July. And I don't know if everybody

2601
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:01,520
knows what Red Rocks is, but it's like

2602
01:37:59,279 --> 01:38:03,118
the most badass amphitheater in the

2603
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:06,320
world maybe, but in the country for

2604
01:38:03,118 --> 01:38:08,559
sure. It's set between these two massive

2605
01:38:06,319 --> 01:38:11,039
red sandstone rocks shooting out of the

2606
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:12,800
earth overlooking the city of Denver

2607
01:38:11,039 --> 01:38:15,920
with this mountain range in front of it

2608
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:19,039
as well. Um, and you're rocking with

2609
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:22,000
like 8,000 like-minded amazing people.

2610
01:38:19,039 --> 01:38:26,479
And the the moon July 4th every year

2611
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:28,319
rises out of the horizon. And you know

2612
01:38:26,479 --> 01:38:30,959
the moon when it's coming up is always

2613
01:38:28,319 --> 01:38:32,799
bigger looking. It's insane. And you see

2614
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:35,118
this glow and everybody in the stand

2615
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:36,800
start to kind of scream while they're

2616
01:38:35,118 --> 01:38:38,238
watching the glow before the movie even

2617
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:40,079
comes up. And I got goosebumps even

2618
01:38:38,238 --> 01:38:41,919
talking about this right now. And we've

2619
01:38:40,079 --> 01:38:44,158
got some, you know, killer flower. I'm

2620
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:46,399
sure it was AK back in the day. It was

2621
01:38:44,158 --> 01:38:47,759
20 years ago. I had a fat bowl of AK if

2622
01:38:46,399 --> 01:38:49,118
not a few joints going around and

2623
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:51,199
spreading the love with everybody around

2624
01:38:49,118 --> 01:38:54,319
us. And everybody's starting to scream

2625
01:38:51,198 --> 01:38:57,599
as this the moon is rising and it's full

2626
01:38:54,319 --> 01:38:59,439
and uh and the music's playing and Blues

2627
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:00,719
Traveler was just popping back then too.

2628
01:38:59,439 --> 01:39:02,479
They're at the top, you know, everybody

2629
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:04,000
was grooving to them and it was just and

2630
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:06,000
everybody's like hugging everybody and

2631
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,279
passing around joints and like I say, I

2632
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,118
got goosebumps right now thinking about

2633
01:39:07,279 --> 01:39:12,319
it. But that was quite possibly the best

2634
01:39:09,118 --> 01:39:14,880
cannabis related experience sharing the

2635
01:39:12,319 --> 01:39:17,759
cannabis with that I grew with people

2636
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:19,118
around me, complimenting me, you know,

2637
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:20,639
always a little pat on the back. You

2638
01:39:19,118 --> 01:39:22,319
know, I don't like to be too egoistic

2639
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:24,639
about this, but it it was it was

2640
01:39:22,319 --> 01:39:26,799
beautiful and the sharing and everybody

2641
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:30,000
hugging and the moon rising and the

2642
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:31,679
music and the red rocks and me being

2643
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,319
like my first few years living in

2644
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:36,960
Colorado after moving from Florida. It

2645
01:39:34,319 --> 01:39:39,039
was a moment of zen and cannabis only

2646
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:40,399
helped that become that. You know,

2647
01:39:39,039 --> 01:39:42,560
without the cannabis, it would have been

2648
01:39:40,399 --> 01:39:44,960
good, but it was just it brought

2649
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:47,760
everything together. Amazing. That

2650
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:49,118
sounds like an epic experience. Um, I'm

2651
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:52,320
sure a lot of people have similar

2652
01:39:49,118 --> 01:39:54,158
experiences, whether it be with music or

2653
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:55,840
um, some sort of event or gathering

2654
01:39:54,158 --> 01:39:58,559
where they're passing around some flower

2655
01:39:55,840 --> 01:40:00,880
that they've grown and the the vibe is

2656
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:02,480
already nice and high and and positive

2657
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:04,639
and uplifting and then you're just

2658
01:40:02,479 --> 01:40:06,718
sharing that extra experience. You know,

2659
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:08,960
I don't it is a little bit egotistic,

2660
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:10,719
but it's always so great to get a pat on

2661
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:12,639
your back for the flower that you that

2662
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:16,198
you grew that everyone else is enjoying.

2663
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:19,400
It's a really great experience. So, I

2664
01:40:16,198 --> 01:40:22,319
wholeheartedly can understand how that

2665
01:40:19,399 --> 01:40:24,638
feels. Um, well, man, Drew, this has

2666
01:40:22,319 --> 01:40:26,238
been a great conversation. Thank you so

2667
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:28,000
much for joining me today. I'm going to

2668
01:40:26,238 --> 01:40:30,399
have to reach out to Jared and thank him

2669
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:33,118
for pointing you in my direction or me

2670
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:34,719
in your direction. Um, I think that, you

2671
01:40:33,118 --> 01:40:37,198
know, we've touched on some really great

2672
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:40,158
subjects today, just like general grow

2673
01:40:37,198 --> 01:40:42,399
knowledge, IPM knowledge, your

2674
01:40:40,158 --> 01:40:46,158
experience and your journey through this

2675
01:40:42,399 --> 01:40:49,039
this uh this world uh as a as a cannabis

2676
01:40:46,158 --> 01:40:51,439
person, right? Uh it it's a fun this was

2677
01:40:49,039 --> 01:40:54,719
a really fun conversation. So, thank you

2678
01:40:51,439 --> 01:40:56,879
so much. Um, I I really always like to

2679
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:58,520
end these episodes by reminding people

2680
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:00,719
that the reason why we have these

2681
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:02,400
conversations is because it's so

2682
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:05,359
important to get this information out

2683
01:41:02,399 --> 01:41:07,920
there to people. Uh, just to have a real

2684
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:10,319
conversation, to talk about cannabis and

2685
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:12,719
how we all experience it as both growers

2686
01:41:10,319 --> 01:41:15,439
and consumers. And getting that

2687
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:17,359
information out there to people is the

2688
01:41:15,439 --> 01:41:19,439
way we grow. And that's uh, you know,

2689
01:41:17,359 --> 01:41:21,118
for the names sake of the podcast. So

2690
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:22,638
again, thank you so much for joining me

2691
01:41:21,118 --> 01:41:24,319
here today. I really appreciate your

2692
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:25,440
time and your knowledge. Nick, it was a

2693
01:41:24,319 --> 01:41:27,519
pleasure. I love the name of your

2694
01:41:25,439 --> 01:41:29,359
podcast. I think it's beautiful. Um it's

2695
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:31,440
it's touching. It means a lot. And that

2696
01:41:29,359 --> 01:41:34,479
is how how we progress and move forward

2697
01:41:31,439 --> 01:41:35,839
