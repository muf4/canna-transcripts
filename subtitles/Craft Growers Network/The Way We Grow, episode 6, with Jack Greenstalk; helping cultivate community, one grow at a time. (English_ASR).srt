00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:18,278
guest is Jack or at Jack Greenock on

4
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:20,879
Instagram he is an author a hom grower a

5
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:23,839
breeder um he's also the host of the

6
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:26,879
growing with my fellow Growers podcast

7
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:29,800
um I am your host Nick wolf or mrwolf

8
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,358
grows on Instagram in Reddit and so Jack

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,000
how have you been lately it's it's been

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,719
kind of a while since we actually talked

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,759
in the DMS thoroughly it seems like

12
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:39,439
we've both been pretty busy in our in

13
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,280
our own world so like what's new with

14
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:45,159
you what's new in your grow World well

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,520
next up is uh Spartan gron project V

16
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:50,398
it's a Vortex F2 project that he made

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,199
from subcool's original Vortex f1s he

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,120
took two males and two females and he

19
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:57,920
kind of quote unquote open pollinated he

20
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:01,159
had a five pack and those were I think

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,120
the four that popped and so I got the F2

22
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:04,198
which he's calling project V and a lot

23
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,438
of people have been having a lot of

24
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:09,560
success with that I actually popped a

25
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:11,839
few of them in a batch of a bunch of

26
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,879
different genetics and then with travel

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,520
and stuff ended up having to not go

28
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:18,039
through with that grow but they were the

29
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:21,039
strongest in veg so my next run is going

30
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,840
to be purely just the project V and that

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,680
alone so I'm going to the regular seed

32
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,799
so hunt through some males and females

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,520
pick out the best females and grow those

34
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:34,600
out flower them out and see other go

35
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:36,719
nice Yeah we actually um just had

36
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:39,118
Spartan on a couple episodes Ago by the

37
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,679
time that years are yours is out he his

38
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:44,239
will have been out for like two weeks or

39
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,320
so um and uh we talked about his project

40
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:49,478
V and uh all the the effort that he's

41
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:52,559
put into that to to try and preserve

42
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:55,200
some of subcool's genetics because well

43
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,560
they're not being made anymore so um

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,359
having people like him do open

45
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,439
pollinations and stuff is so vital for

46
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:04,078
the community to be able to see some of

47
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:07,038
this work that's going to eventually go

48
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:09,758
away um but that's awesome to hear that

49
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,520
you're popping some of his uh uh project

50
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:15,679
v um it it sounds like from what he was

51
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,319
describing it that it has like a a

52
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,120
really like uh citrusy side and then a

53
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:25,199
really kind of nasty funky side to the

54
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,080
um to the different turpine profiles and

55
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,959
since it sounds like subcool mango and

56
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,959
baby diaper are some of the description

57
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,598
that's what he said like rotten mango

58
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:36,680
yeah I mean honestly that sounds really

59
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:38,039
good um I like mango I'm not sure so

60
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,360
much about the baby diaper but if it's

61
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:43,158
strong like some of the stronger stuff

62
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,400
out there chems and um even some of the

63
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:48,199
like skunks are ogs Afghans they might

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,840
not taste the best but they get you a

65
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:52,799
really strong high and so if you're

66
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,598
looking for the effect sometimes you

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,599
know a spoonful of sugar will make the

68
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:58,679
medicine go down you can take a nice

69
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:00,318
tasty dab or something after or eat

70
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,640
something tasty or drink something tasty

71
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:05,479
but uh sometimes the medicine I I look

72
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,919
at it first as a medical user and even

73
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:10,039
if somebody doesn't die in the case of

74
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:14,119
like the breeding work that I started

75
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:16,759
off with was vegan DOA or Dojo DNA he

76
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,879
every year never kept clones for 10

77
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:20,318
years so he would take his that's crazy

78
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:21,560
he'd get clones from like his buddies

79
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:23,079
like he got like a thin mint but then he

80
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,959
crossed it to some stuff that he Po from

81
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,280
seed and had kept over the years and

82
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,360
then each year cuz he was a sungrown

83
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,598
outdoor it was one season

84
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,400
just one no he had green houses but he

85
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:37,039
didn't dep and so it just be one thing

86
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,158
per season he always crossed his best

87
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,359
stuff together so you could look back at

88
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:43,158
like the crosses and you're like oh this

89
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,879
has all of that in it plus one other

90
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:46,798
thing and then this has all of that plus

91
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:50,518
one other thing and he never would take

92
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,719
it to like F2 or F3 so I was like just

93
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,640
to have more seeds of one of his uh

94
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,039
projects the buet punch I took it to F2

95
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:58,598
yeah ended up finding a bunch of really

96
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,078
cool stuff in there it's kind of a

97
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:02,959
grapey gassy there's some watermelon

98
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,159
subtle fenos in there if you hunt them

99
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,560
out T was actually the first one who

100
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:09,560
found the watermelon in the f2s but um

101
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,640
it's his stuff was always really good he

102
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,039
hooked me up with some other stuff

103
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:16,079
called spiked punch that I grew and I've

104
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:19,680
told the story but I got 13 males and

105
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,120
two females so like thank goodness I did

106
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,439
Sex testing uh yeah shout out to Farmer

107
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,800
Freeman that's my preferred sex testing

108
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:30,680
person but um I did Sex testing and that

109
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,720
run I also had funny enough from subcool

110
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,840
Chernobyl so I had two of the spiked

111
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,479
punch and one Chernobyl and the

112
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,638
Chernobyl was really really fire I love

113
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:42,360
that I wish I would have kept cuts of

114
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:43,918
all three of those but uh life goes on

115
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,560
and you either either still have se you

116
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,159
all have those stories yeah I think um

117
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,560
that being said there's so many seeds

118
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,600
getting back to like Spartan and what

119
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,918
I'm popping next after the project fees

120
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,919
I was thinking about doing some Brandon

121
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,359
Rus gear because his stuff's really fire

122
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:58,560
but I gotten it recently and I've got

123
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,199
some stuff that's from years ago and I

124
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,199
was just talking about how some of the

125
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,680
best stuff I've ever gotten is from the

126
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,600
community and usually that's cuz it's

127
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,959
fresh it's like made this year maybe a

128
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,720
few months ago maybe six three however

129
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:12,399
brand new you know as soon as it's dry

130
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,560
and packaged but I found vigorousness

131
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:17,879
and germination rates tend to be much

132
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,280
higher un fresher newer seed so I like

133
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,879
to at least do one seed run every year

134
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:25,359
myself like making more seed of

135
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:27,519
something that I enjoy and like sour 76

136
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,759
is one that I've had for a handful of

137
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,959
years and it's not getting any younger

138
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,600
so it's uh one of my great white buffalo

139
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:37,519
strains like one that I feel like got

140
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,360
away and um so I'm going to be growing

141
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,680
those out and f twoing that to look

142
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,038
through what is sour 76 I actually

143
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,199
haven't heard of that it was an

144
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:48,279
unreleased genetic from humbl seed

145
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:54,759
organization it was a tester and um it

146
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:57,119
was a c sour o so it was like a Calio

147
00:05:54,759 --> 00:06:00,520
Sour Diesel cross

148
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,360
to Afghan 76 they call it Island Afghani

149
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:06,719
somebody got some seed sourced from 1976

150
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,199
in Afghanistan up in the mountain areas

151
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,440
cuz people he Afghani and they think or

152
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,919
Afghan and they think that's one strain

153
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:17,079
like it's a broad Lea no short squat no

154
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:18,758
there's like 11 16 I don't know how many

155
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:22,879
different regions in Afghanistan that

156
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:26,240
have long histories of cannabis bulk um

157
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:29,319
you know there's a bunch uh but there's

158
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,960
a great page Baba like is one of them

159
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:33,319
but a few Afghan selection I think is uh

160
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:35,959
probably the best place that has a

161
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:38,280
breakdown of a bunch of different uh

162
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:39,918
phenotypes and things like that for the

163
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:41,638
different Afghani regions but yeah I

164
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:44,879
just no I'm I'm done with my S but

165
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:47,160
they're not all just one train yeah um

166
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:50,199
like in the early 2000s I had ear always

167
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,880
heard of um people describing that there

168
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:53,560
were like three main varietals of

169
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:55,159
cannabis and I I don't even hear that

170
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,000
much anymore where people would describe

171
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,439
Indica sativa and afghanica and um I

172
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,519
feel like it is

173
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:05,120
like I I do feel as though like sativa

174
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:06,439
and Inda are a little bit misleading

175
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,038
because like sativa just means

176
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:10,800
cultivated Inda just means of India and

177
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:13,959
then of course like afghanica would just

178
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,319
mean of Afghanistan and to say you know

179
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:17,719
that there's only one sativa or one

180
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:19,160
Indica everyone would know that that's

181
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,120
you know not what they're talking about

182
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,360
so it seems um almost counterintuitive

183
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,240
for people to think that uh if somebody

184
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:30,120
says I have an Afghan strain that it's

185
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,840
just one thing um so yeah that

186
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,360
I go back and for the Paradigm of Indica

187
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:38,318
sativa because I understand like sativa

188
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,960
or sa ofam uh if people haven't seen

189
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:44,080
that sat satam or s a t i Vu M I might

190
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:45,719
be mispronouncing it but it's uh another

191
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,000
one of the ways that it's spelled it's

192
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,159
just the Latin uh way of saying like

193
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,879
you're saying cultivated and IND indicia

194
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:56,158
of India and afghanica um

195
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,560
so there I've even seen like people that

196
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:00,399
are like talking about like America

197
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,560
American like Str or whatever like

198
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,198
they're they've started sub because we

199
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,319
have got such a rich history now at this

200
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:09,680
point of cannabis breing in the US that

201
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,680
they subdivided it to that but some I

202
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,680
just pulled up the Afghan selection and

203
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,720
they have I'm probably going to

204
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:19,199
mispronounce these but uh Chim tall is

205
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,319
the bulk region baharak uh bakan which

206
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,598
is the Hindu Kush because they have the

207
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,879
Hindu Kush mountain range that goes

208
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:26,158
through Afghanistan if a few of those

209
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,280
other countries Chim tall which is Hash

210
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:30,719
State

211
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:33,799
daima um Kos

212
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,680
and col these are all different regions

213
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:40,120
of Afghanistan

214
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:42,799
Kos kushkak mesar the mazari Sharif is

215
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,839
pretty famous historically yeah um

216
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:49,719
pisher is another Hindu Kush

217
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:54,839
quar south or maybe kahar South and

218
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:57,200
rustam Kush and we've got schar and

219
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,519
sheon so sorry for my brutal

220
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,278
mispronunciations I've never been to

221
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:02,000
Afghanistan I had

222
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:03,240
was offered one opportunity my dad's

223
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
like oh do you want to go to Afghanistan

224
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,440
for this volleyball tournament I was

225
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,720
like yeah I want to go and he's like no

226
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,760
no you're not going it's not safe it's

227
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,560
kind of during the time where um like

228
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,439
now things are not the friendliest

229
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:17,199
unfortunately between the US and

230
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,880
Afghanistan relations so um you bring up

231
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,800
such a great point that there's so many

232
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:24,559
different varieties uh even in within

233
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:27,919
one country that uh it almost feels as

234
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:30,958
though as United States consumers we

235
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:32,479
sort of exotify it to try and make it

236
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,879
seem as though there's something more

237
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,879
special to it where it's just another

238
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,159
region of cannabis growing kind of like

239
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:41,838
we don't we don't overly hype grapes

240
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,360
grown in different regions of the world

241
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,040
now we like look at the wine and the

242
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,519
final product and say this is really

243
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,799
nice and I feel like with cannabis we're

244
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:54,078
we're looking at it and trying to

245
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:57,879
exotify these different cultures that it

246
00:09:54,078 --> 00:10:00,759
it's a little uh UNC almost it feels

247
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:01,919
like to effect where it where it is

248
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:04,559
deserved cuz like if you look at like

249
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,519
Morocco Afghanistan India these places

250
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,479
have been and not to say that we haven't

251
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:10,519
in the US there's Native American tribes

252
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,240
I've mentioned the Hope mound builders

253
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:15,360
in the US there's cannabis THC resin in

254
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,000
their clay pipes so they were not only

255
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,240
growing it and cultivating it they're

256
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,958
smoking it in pipes just like stuff

257
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,839
you'd see today like little glass spoon

258
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:27,399
uh spoon piece or thing like that but

259
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:30,000
it's all over it's it's in Asia Africa

260
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:31,720
literally everywhere throughout the yeah

261
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,759
you know but like you're saying I think

262
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:38,959
sometimes we maybe get this even the

263
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:41,360
idea the term exotic or Zaza you know

264
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:44,719
call exotic got short Z and then zah

265
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,680
became Zaza but silly terminology aside

266
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,000
maybe we're just getting older or

267
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:50,799
whatever but the um reality is like

268
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,039
Afghani hash was popular for a reason

269
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,559
they made a lot of hash and it was

270
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:55,958
really good and it got exported same

271
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,359
with Morocco Moroccan hash is really

272
00:10:55,958 --> 00:11:00,518
good uh the rift mountains are known and

273
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,278
like just like humble is in the Emerald

274
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:05,560
Triangle Menino um that whole area vegan

275
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,799
doas from up a little bit further north

276
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:09,518
uh I should say DOA DNA is his actual

277
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:11,838
like breeder account cu the vegan do is

278
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,799
more of his personal page but Doo DNA my

279
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,040
buddy Dan the guy that I work with uh in

280
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:18,000
making seeds he's up from delort

281
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:19,240
California Crescent City area he had a

282
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,399
train called Crescent City Kush it was

283
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,519
really fire his thing was um in the

284
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:27,639
early 2000s gas was just not available

285
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:29,759
you couldn't really get a good like

286
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:33,560
clone of like OG for cheap

287
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:35,240
or easily without paying 5 10 15 $20,000

288
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:37,559
or something crazy for like a cut or

289
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,039
like a flat of cuts and people held that

290
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:42,319
[ __ ] really tightly so when a little bit

291
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:43,679
of it got out there he was able to start

292
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,680
Crossing that into some of his stuff and

293
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,000
then made the gas available to like any

294
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:50,559
of his patients friends family whoever

295
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,159
wanted it and so um I try to you know

296
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,879
keep in that vein and make the stuff

297
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:57,360
available and I've given out plenty of

298
00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:00,838
free seats the whole F2 you know I never

299
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:04,519
sold f2s I just s out as testers and had

300
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:06,800
for sure over 100 people grown so got a

301
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,919
lot of feedback interpretations on what

302
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:10,799
the different environments would produce

303
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:12,599
uh what different nutrient regimes will

304
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,759
produce what types of

305
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,680
stressors uh can and won't cause

306
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:20,559
problems so um seeing indoor outdoor

307
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:22,039
Greenhouse was really cool and all the

308
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,119
different concentrates people make with

309
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:28,078
it outside of the wheel things that I

310
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,959
normally would for sure I um you know

311
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,239
after hearing you talk for years about

312
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,518
the different breeding projects that

313
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,198
you've done and how you've been able to

314
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,600
get these seeds out to the community and

315
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:38,039
see all these different phenotypic

316
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,839
Expressions based on the different

317
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:42,159
environmental factors of each different

318
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,800
grow and each different uh Personal

319
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,399
Touch that every cultivator has it's

320
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,479
really cool you can really build like a

321
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,039
vast library of knowledge that you can

322
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,639
then boil down and distill into

323
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:55,039
something very useful for when you're

324
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:59,240
sending out uh seeds to people in terms

325
00:12:55,039 --> 00:13:01,519
of what to expect and and how to um uh

326
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,360
kind of uh give give the best

327
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,000
information available uh for newer grow

328
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,039
newer Growers as well um and you know I

329
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,240
thought it was really a great point that

330
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:14,519
you brought up that like all of the all

331
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,079
of these different regions that we do

332
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:20,240
sort of try to exemplify into this

333
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:23,399
exotic uh terminology where a lot of it

334
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,120
is just like a a cultural tradition of

335
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,839
the area that has been something passed

336
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,959
from generation to generation and

337
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:35,279
usually when we uh encounter it we're

338
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:37,799
enjoying uh sort of this

339
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:41,480
um like the product of these different

340
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:44,519
cultures that have been developed over

341
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:47,800
um in some cases hundreds if not close

342
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:49,639
to a thousand or more years um you know

343
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:50,679
for sure I mean with the families in

344
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:52,198
like those regions we were talking about

345
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:53,719
it's definitely hundreds like they know

346
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:55,000
their great grandpa was doing it who

347
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,040
taught their grandpa who taught their

348
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,639
dad and their dad taught them and in a

349
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:01,078
lot of the cases they haven't changed

350
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,079
like their still using you know the same

351
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:05,159
coat manure or whatever it is to

352
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:06,958
fertilize with some of them are using

353
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:09,679
modern stuff from pesticides to

354
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:12,719
fertilizers which I do think uh changes

355
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:15,278
flavors and things like that and uh but

356
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,920
a lot of them have if you like see any

357
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:20,679
of the 24 regions that we went through

358
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:23,519
and listed from the Afghan uh selection

359
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:25,679
or Afghan selection or even like looking

360
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,198
at like India India is all not just one

361
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,000
strain like um I finally learned the

362
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:31,919
pronunciation after one of my listeners

363
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,759
on our podcast corrected me I was

364
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:39,120
calling it carala but it's k e r a l a

365
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:40,800
and it's carala carala somebody from

366
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,000
carala India messaged me and said hey

367
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:43,639
it's actually pronounced carala and I

368
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,480
looked into it and turn out they right

369
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:49,039
so we have listeners in Kerala India but

370
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,440
Kyle breeder the reason that we know

371
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,198
this is because Kyle was growing uh

372
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,560
seeds from carala and maybe he got them

373
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:55,039
from that listener I don't know that was

374
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,838
maybe something separate from my

375
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:59,919
interaction but he grew this and it was

376
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,839
like a crazy long plan I think it was

377
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,679
like 10 ft tall like he grit on the side

378
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,160
and like it went like around a 4x4 and

379
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,278
like up the walls and just it was just

380
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:10,078
like the most bananas thing it was like

381
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:12,360
super tall and linky and just never kept

382
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:15,159
turning the pot over to make sure like

383
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:18,000
drill a hole in the side theight

384
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:19,480
water that's crazy I mean I've heard

385
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,078
yeah plenty of stories like that where

386
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:25,800
you just get a uh something that's uh

387
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:27,919
not you're not used to Growing because

388
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:30,758
it just is um it's used to a different

389
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:32,599
environment based on the years of its uh

390
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:34,519
sort of bottlenecking and genetic

391
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,440
selection whether it be through like

392
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:40,198
local Horticultural practices that have

393
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,360
kind of uh curated this land race

394
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:45,439
species um or if it's even like a wild

395
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,240
population that has no human interaction

396
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,639
with it I feel like it you can just get

397
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,600
these crazy Expressions that if you put

398
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,560
it into a controlled environment setting

399
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,480
you're going to I mean it's it's just

400
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,518
like a new learning experience every

401
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,240
single time time right they can get like

402
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:06,959
30t tall in the wild with no help out

403
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,318
there and so crazy to uh give it

404
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:12,479
nutrients and and lighting and try and

405
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:13,958
contain it into a confined space is like

406
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,039
I I don't think he realized the fire he

407
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:18,758
was fighting and um I think a lot of

408
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,559
people say I want land race I want land

409
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:22,159
race because like you said there has

410
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:25,399
been a bottle necking of genetics

411
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,480
especially in like certain pools but

412
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,120
there are people out there that are

413
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,120
still traveling the world and hand

414
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,759
collecting the stuff and some some of

415
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,198
it's maybe tainted quote unquote because

416
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,039
people have traveled and given them

417
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:36,439
modern genetics and it's interlaced into

418
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,838
the pool so it's harder and harder to

419
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,560
find the truer land races but they still

420
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:42,519
are out there and eventually everything

421
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:43,758
reverts back to what is in the Natural

422
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:45,600
Area they only have so many other seats

423
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,079
and even if they Brad something into it

424
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,639
a lot of them don't necessarily love the

425
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:51,159
new stuff as much as they think they

426
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:52,639
might when they get it from some person

427
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:53,719
they see photos and smell it and smoke

428
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,959
it one time and they get a little strain

429
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,120
tolerant after they grow it themselves

430
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,758
and they're like this isn't actually as

431
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,318
good as the stuff we've grown here for

432
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,199
hundreds of years we just going to go

433
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,399
back to stuff we've been grown for

434
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:03,078
hundreds of years and we've got our

435
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:07,400
grandma's stash of it over here you know

436
00:17:03,078 --> 00:17:08,759
and yeah I think there is a sort of Rose

437
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,759
Colored Glasses of thinking the old

438
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:12,640
stuff is always better but then

439
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:14,240
remembering that there's a reason that

440
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,319
people like DJ schw went through the

441
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,519
process of taking like his best land

442
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:20,000
races that he grew struggled to find

443
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:22,879
like any good ones in the bag seeds that

444
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,599
were being imported and then from the

445
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,400
fire that he found in there would make

446
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,359
it more manageable by Crossing it into

447
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,160
one another and then ultimately started

448
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:32,359
finding stuff like blueberry and flow

449
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,279
and kind of cool unique Expressions that

450
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:36,439
he could like you were standing with the

451
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:37,558
Velvet punch um him growing it out and

452
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,798
having sobody different people grow it

453
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:41,839
out or growing it out a larger scale you

454
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:43,798
get this feedback that shows you a lot

455
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:44,678
about the plant and how it expresses

456
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:46,879
especially when you're making your own

457
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:48,679
seeds and you're not worried like oh

458
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,120
should I pop 1 two 3 five and he's like

459
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:52,400
popping hundreds or thousands and things

460
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:55,279
like that at that scale you get to learn

461
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,600
a lot fast and you can see things that

462
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,599
maybe you would have never seen just you

463
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:00,399
would have ultimately just by the

464
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:01,798
numbers if you pop 10 at a time over and

465
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,720
over and over and over eventually you're

466
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:04,798
going to get to the hundreds and

467
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,279
thousands and you'll see those rare

468
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:09,558
things that maybe are one in 100 or more

469
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:11,399
but I think often there's stuff that's

470
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:13,918
like one in 16 and people only pop like

471
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,919
two or three and um if you just pop a

472
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,159
big enough that's what I learned when I

473
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:21,440
started making the Velvet punch 2 I had

474
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:22,840
a 1 in6 phenotype um that's a physical

475
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,960
morphological thing that I called the

476
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:29,199
Sawtooth you know had like a double

477
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,880
zigzag on the leaf those are so cool I

478
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,640
didn't realize it was exactly like 1 and

479
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,320
16 for a while but then like I

480
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,919
remembered back to my old science

481
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:40,000
learning and the little charts um little

482
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:42,000
punet squares punet squares yeah and I

483
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,240
was like oh wait that kind of makes I

484
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,919
thought it was one and 15 cuz I usually

485
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:49,120
popped 15 of a thing just for whatever

486
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,000
reason you know and um I think it was

487
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,599
because I had 15 cups to be honest with

488
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,519
you for sure and uh 15 cups like fit

489
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,359
into my little tray so I was like that's

490
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:58,558
how many seeds I can reasonably pop in

491
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:59,439
this little tiny veg space that I'm

492
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:02,200
using

493
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,279
and so um 15 was what ended up working

494
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,600
out for me or maybe I did 16 initially

495
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:07,879
and like one of them broke or got lost

496
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:11,079
or whatever and haven't been replac but

497
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,600
whatever the reason is um with larger

498
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:17,240
numbers I sent out 100 people at least

499
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:19,519
10 seeds usually you know 10 or more and

500
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,279
of that 100 people or it was over 100

501
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:24,519
people I sent seeds probably like 150

502
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:27,720
and like 100 grew them you know so and

503
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:29,798
of that 100 they grew like between some

504
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,319
grew all 10 some grew five some grew

505
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:34,400
three but like that puts up into the

506
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:35,720
thousands of seeds that were grown mhm

507
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,038
and I could just go through and kind of

508
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,558
map how many people got this expression

509
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:45,119
and it was like almost exactly 1 in 16

510
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:48,038
like within like 1% so wow it was pretty

511
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,279
fascinating honestly science is a

512
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:51,759
something that should be appreciated

513
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:55,240
real science that's done with rigor that

514
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:57,279
has testing and replicates um cuz

515
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,798
there's a lot of criticism and cynicism

516
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,480
for a good reason a lot of science does

517
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,079
replicate the gold standard of what

518
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,200
makes science good has no longer become

519
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:07,119
the gold standard it's like a wishful

520
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,558
thinking almost for some but um from the

521
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:11,239
world of and I'm from like a science

522
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:13,678
that's not necessarily even looked at as

523
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,558
like a hard science but I still consider

524
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,320
we need those gold standards we need to

525
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:19,918
have you're talking about psychology

526
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:21,918
right yeah yeah I mean even with that

527
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,919
it's almost more important because of

528
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:29,880
how um subjective all of the different

529
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:32,360
uh um approaches are and you have

530
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,559
with everything and you have to try and

531
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:37,879
uh account for every single variable so

532
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:39,839
that you can make it uh uh reproducible

533
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,480
um yeah it's it's it's one of the

534
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:45,480
reasons why like whenever I would um

535
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,279
make seeds and and test out my seeds

536
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,599
that I've made I would always hunt a

537
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:52,319
full pack because um that's I I try to

538
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:56,439
think like that's a representation of

539
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:58,158
what a customer would get um and if I

540
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,038
can't find something in a pack then I

541
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,559
didn't do do my job and if there's

542
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:04,640
problems within that pack then I didn't

543
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:06,240
do my job and I shouldn't be releasing

544
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,080
it and so like I've only ever released

545
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,200
like a couple packs of seeds because I

546
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:12,519
was I was never satisfied personally

547
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,278
after growing out plenty of other seeds

548
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:16,599
from other reputable breeders and

549
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:18,440
especially um in the cultivation space

550
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:21,959
that I'm in having access to all these

551
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:25,278
different um kind of elite Cuts or or

552
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,640
different genetics that are um the ones

553
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:30,159
that are desired within the market and a

554
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,720
lot of those are very stable and and

555
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,159
they you can push extremely high

556
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,400
electrical conductivity in your

557
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:40,200
irrigation and crazy dryb backs and

558
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:43,640
extremely high uh ppfd and extremely

559
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,000
high CO2 and uh Heats and colds and all

560
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,278
these different aspects of a grow that

561
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,038
in some cases if your genetics are just

562
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:53,278
a little bit finicky and they might want

563
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:54,558
to um throw an intersex trait here and

564
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:57,519
there if they if they run into a

565
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:59,000
stressor event um yeah you you just

566
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:00,759
can't really have that in a commercial

567
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,038
space and I was always kind of in my

568
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:04,240
breeding efforts thinking oh this will

569
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:05,960
like I would love to see this in a

570
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,319
commercial setting I would love to see

571
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,079
it get out to more than just one or two

572
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:12,278
Growers um you know and have it

573
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:14,119
available because I always personally

574
00:22:12,278 --> 00:22:16,880
have considered cannabis like a medicine

575
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:20,319
and back in the 215 days when I was in

576
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,360
California um having access to like some

577
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,519
really nice strains and stuff and from

578
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:26,599
people that were really carrying like it

579
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:29,158
makes me think of like mad farmer up in

580
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:30,959
Humbolt and his lavender and stuff and

581
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:33,278
whenever you'd see that at a dispensary

582
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,960
in the Bay Area or something it was like

583
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:36,839
oh my God I need to get that it's going

584
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,519
to put me to sleep it's going to cure my

585
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:40,839
headaches it's going to make me hungry

586
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:43,599
it's going to do all these things that I

587
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:46,759
needed to do um and the consistency

588
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:48,719
behind it was so key due to just the

589
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:51,960
years and years and years of effort put

590
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,558
into something like that um it is a

591
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,200
major effort it's a labor of love really

592
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:57,079
is I kept the cherry pie for many years

593
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,120
because it was the one thing that was

594
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:01,879
helping me sleep and then when I found

595
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:06,798
that high CBN RSO was equally if not

596
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:08,880
more effective um that made me not so

597
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:10,960
diligent about holding that cut so

598
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,840
tightly and I gave it back to the person

599
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,759
who gave it to me thinking that they

600
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:16,639
would be able to keep it alive and they

601
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:18,480
ended up not keeping it alive for very

602
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,440
long so the Cherry Pie that I was

603
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,880
running for so long and love so much is

604
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,679
no longer um so a good reminder I guess

605
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,600
to if you really do love stuff to keep

606
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:28,880
it around there's like a couple that got

607
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:31,839
away from me and um some that's funny

608
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,960
that you were talking about is the idea

609
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:34,158
of kind of like and you didn't say it

610
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,558
this way but I think some people think

611
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,840
that there's like bulletproof genetics

612
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:39,278
or like Rock Solid stable and some stuff

613
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:41,599
is clearly more stable than others for

614
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:44,599
sure like anything with cookies in it is

615
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:46,399
going to be or chams or ogs stuff that

616
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:47,839
comes like be gets like right so if it

617
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,640
comes from her literally everything on

618
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:52,480
the market there's Herms in it right but

619
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,559
that being said you see stuff like

620
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,159
jealousy or whatever is run pretty hard

621
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,480
in the markets and wedding cakes and

622
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,880
things like that they're run and people

623
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,159
figure out in their system how to do it

624
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,960
and it feels Rock Solid and stable

625
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:06,080
because you'll see people run it for

626
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,360
years and years and years and not have

627
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:11,359
problems in their system indoors in a

628
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,079
hydroponic system under a certain type

629
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:17,000
of lighting in a certain type of

630
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:18,839
environment and then they get uh Canada

631
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,159
legalizes and then they get all these

632
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:23,199
Greenhouse Grows Right massive ass

633
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:25,320
unlimited square footage and they take

634
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,480
all these same cuts that are bulletproof

635
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:28,879
and they put them into those green

636
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,360
houses and they start herming they start

637
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,159
not yielding like they they don't even

638
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:34,398
look the same they don't smell the same

639
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,360
they are susceptible to molds and Mild

640
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:38,719
that maybe they didn't even know were

641
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:42,398
problems until they took it outdoors and

642
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,880
so sometimes there's what we think to be

643
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:47,119
a stable a rock solid genetic that gets

644
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,120
exposed when you put it in the hands of

645
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,719
hundreds or thousands or different of

646
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:53,479
environments I personally think

647
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,200
absolutely you can make any any cannabis

648
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,360
strain no matter how bulletproof Herm

649
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:02,480
one person I've heard vehemently defend

650
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:06,079
their strain is uh Rick from uh Mr soul

651
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:09,000
c99 of Brothers Grim he says L

652
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:10,480
Cinderella 99 will not Herm and subcool

653
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,880
notoriously said he would never release

654
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,440
stuff if it had Herm stuff in the DNA

655
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,240
but I could tell you if you go look

656
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,240
around on the forums enough under both

657
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,880
of those people you'll find Herms under

658
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,200
both of them and I think a lot of it

659
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,399
does come down to Growers have to be a

660
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,640
little bit accountable of what their

661
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:27,239
environment if you're growing outdoor

662
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,520
obviously you don't have as much control

663
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,480
but you have to like realize that there

664
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:32,000
are factors that can make a plant go

665
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,519
intersect I think outdoor is actually

666
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,398
more rare I think greenhouse and indoor

667
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:37,759
is where you're going to see the most

668
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:39,079
terms and for sure that's when we have

669
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:40,960
the most control and when we have the

670
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:43,359
most control we're most likely to

671
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,278
underestimate certain factors little

672
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:49,519
things light leaks um ambient lights

673
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:51,079
like uh red light or green light or even

674
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:53,038
a green headlamp people think that you

675
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:55,720
can wear a green headlamp in flower into

676
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:58,519
your flower room no you can't I'm sorry

677
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,839
I'm here to tell you don't do it no so

678
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:01,440
I'm going to push back on that just a

679
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:03,199
little bit just from my own personal

680
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,960
experience cuz we run green lights in

681
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,120
all of our rooms uh whenever we're

682
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,960
applying sprays or anything like that

683
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:12,158
and we don't have any any um interex uh

684
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,079
issues or anything that uh throws uh

685
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,200
late flower nanners or any po

686
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:20,158
pollination uh events um and I'll just

687
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,759
ask a followup question on that cuz um

688
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,760
to be specific like I know people that

689
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:26,000
have green lights in the room and

690
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:27,398
they're like older like CFL Wes or

691
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,558
softer lights they're hung up in a

692
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:29,839
certain way that they're not like

693
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:32,558
blasting the plant with these green

694
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:35,199
lights it's sort of a but do you have

695
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:36,359
like a modern LED green headlamp like

696
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:41,640
something that's uh you're wearing on

697
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:43,918
your head we we use um LED t5s um green

698
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,759
t5s that are at at an array across the

699
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,679
ceiling basically to provide light for

700
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:51,158
for movement through the through the

701
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:53,759
room in the dark um so what I would

702
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:56,120
avoid is the specifically these head

703
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:58,759
mounted lamps the old like a really old

704
00:26:56,119 --> 00:27:01,278
one if it's like so soft that you can

705
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:05,879
barely even see that might be okay but

706
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:07,919
like I I got a newer one LEDs now I mean

707
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,240
your phone and I granted I used to do

708
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,240
this and I never had intersect but like

709
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,640
look at how much that's blowing out my

710
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,480
camera yeah I mean I usually go in there

711
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,320
with my my camera my phone on as well

712
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,240
it's it's blowing it up so much it's

713
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:25,158
like uh removing you from the uh the

714
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,759
rendering I got washed out of a frame

715
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:28,760
there and that's just like one single

716
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:32,919
Sam

717
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:35,119
LM 301 on the back of a galaxy whatever

718
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:38,919
yeah and a lot of these headlamps have

719
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:40,839
more than that and um even like another

720
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:43,519
single source of light I have right here

721
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:45,278
it's another single uh chip that one

722
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:48,960
completely wases me out it's just a

723
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:51,720
little flashlight that's uh handheld can

724
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,640
fit you know it's a little bit thick but

725
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,600
takes a doublea AAA or cr123 and

726
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,360
something like that would definitely

727
00:27:56,599 --> 00:28:02,319
definitely make your plants break their

728
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:05,000
uh Scotto period and for sure that dark

729
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:07,720
cycle I think bug's research has been

730
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,558
showing that something like

731
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:13,440
z.0 like like less than one par is able

732
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:14,480
to be detected by the plants and not to

733
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,200
say that's one to her the plant

734
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,120
necessarily but they're noticing those

735
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:22,840
changes and Pitch Black is ideal for

736
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:25,759
sure and um absolutely the one thing the

737
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:26,759
exception is with fure spray is cuz like

738
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:28,240
certain stuff you don't want to spray

739
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:29,919
under intense light so if you're GR R

740
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,679
lights are intense which they should be

741
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,480
you don't want to burn your plants and

742
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,159
so if you're not like in a place where

743
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,839
outdoor you can kind of do it early

744
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:41,120
morning or late evening and get away

745
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:42,398
with it but middle of the day you're

746
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,558
going to fry your plant just like you

747
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:45,879
would if you did it under your grow

748
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:48,879
light and so there are those

749
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:51,159
considerations and a lot of plants maybe

750
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,120
they've been exposed to green light over

751
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:55,919
the years and I don't know why that

752
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:58,599
green would be less because if you look

753
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,080
at a spectral graph of the par chart

754
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:02,599
Green is right smack daab in the [ __ ]

755
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:05,199
middle it's not like green doesn't

756
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:07,038
photosynthesize like it I I get that it

757
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,480
reflects some green cuz that's what our

758
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:11,038
eyes see and that means that essentially

759
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,919
that's going to be the least taken up

760
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:14,679
color but there's been studies that show

761
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:16,519
like green penetrates deeper and things

762
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:19,440
like that so it

763
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:22,399
has I think I personally believe that it

764
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,960
has a usage in the growth process and so

765
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:26,398
that makes me a little bit concerned in

766
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,120
terms of and this is just to new Growers

767
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,518
out there trying to eliminate as many

768
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:31,000
possible things not to say like there

769
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,599
are aren't bulletproof strains that

770
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,759
can't get away with it cuz I know people

771
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:37,240
that have had light leaks in their tent

772
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:38,599
with a a grow light in the next tent cuz

773
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,720
they like leave one flap open and

774
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:42,319
normally they'd have a situation where

775
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,798
that when the lights come on they Clos

776
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:45,000
the one and but they went out of town

777
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:46,599
and then the person didn't take care of

778
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,880
the situation type thing and like half

779
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:51,240
the strains in the room hered but then

780
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,799
half of them didn't so it shows that

781
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,000
some stuff is more bulletproof than

782
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:57,319
others in terms of light leaks during

783
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,319
the dark period but in terms of trying

784
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:03,599
to whenever I see a intersect trait I I

785
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:06,439
haven't actually in micro which I'm

786
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:09,519
fortunate because I try to to the most

787
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:12,320
of my ability eliminate any possible

788
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:16,359
cause overwatering underwatering root

789
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:18,599
binding um high heat really low humidity

790
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:21,599
really high humidity um interrupting the

791
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:23,558
dark cycle consistently during flower

792
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:26,359
and just too much stress like if you

793
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:28,119
break the plant like apart completely

794
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:30,000
like not just like supercropping like

795
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:31,278
some people really or like a windstorm

796
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,798
and things like that might come that

797
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:36,759
might be a time you could see herming

798
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:38,519
Outdoors but uh generally if you avoid

799
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:41,079
quote unquote the common stressors the

800
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:42,960
things that will make a plant Herm which

801
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:45,000
sometimes new Growers don't even know to

802
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,159
avoid some of these pitfalls right they

803
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,278
their plant gets root bound because they

804
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,320
just kept it in that pot and didn't

805
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,720
realize because they watch a bunch of

806
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:51,079
Instagram posts where people pull their

807
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,919
thing out and it's just Roots wrapped

808
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:53,678
all the way around and they're like that

809
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,120
looks cool like I want my PL to do that

810
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,038
so they wait until that happens to

811
00:30:55,119 --> 00:31:00,479
transplant and maybe they're male

812
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:02,119
pollinates in in a veg that's another

813
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,000
thing people want to talk about male

814
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:06,398
plants can start throwing pollen while

815
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,359
they're basically seedlinks a few in

816
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:10,359
tall if you keep them you get the the

817
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:12,439
bra at the inner nodes pollinated that

818
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:14,000
way I've seen that I've seen yeah people

819
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,360
are like my plants already seed I'm not

820
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,599
even in

821
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:20,599
flour it happens seeds off of there good

822
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:22,319
to go the funny thing is if you put it

823
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:24,119
into flour like it won't the rest of the

824
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,960
plant won't be seated unless it

825
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:28,199
continues to receive pollen but um I

826
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,440
know some people that actually they use

827
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,519
that as like a strategy they vge their

828
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,120
stuff super long until it shows sex

829
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,038
they'll pollinate it to get like 5 six

830
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:36,558
10 however many seeds and then they'll

831
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:38,278
bring it into flour and they kind of get

832
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,158
a little bit of both I personally don't

833
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:41,839
think seated bud is as bad as people

834
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,120
make it out to be we all remember it

835
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:44,678
being bad because it was like Mexican

836
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:46,199
brick weed that was imported and garbage

837
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:48,399
and lost El stirping and was probably

838
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,278
sprayed with who knows what and grown

839
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:53,038
with not the best methodologies and uh

840
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:56,038
you know it's not the same as hom grown

841
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:58,038
if you grow your own seed it even like

842
00:31:56,038 --> 00:32:00,038
indoor outdoor Greenhouse doesn't matter

843
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:02,359
um it's going to be it's an

844
00:32:00,038 --> 00:32:05,000
inconvenience to break up the buds it's

845
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:06,359
great for dry sift though I mean you got

846
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,798
to break all the you got to shuck all

847
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:09,638
those seeds anyway so if you're just

848
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:11,918
making dry sift out of that and your

849
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:13,519
little trim bin or whatever you got sit

850
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,080
there with a couple of shows on and you

851
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,480
won't even know that it's that you're

852
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:19,839
doing anything and then after a while

853
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:22,880
you got grams and grams of uh of ke

854
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:25,319
either to press just top your bowls and

855
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,039
yeah beautiful golden ke and it it

856
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:28,398
smokes great you can even like press if

857
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:30,079
you get clean it up with static deck

858
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:32,879
that stuff is like dabbable you can

859
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:34,278
press out the flags but um I've I've

860
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,519
seen like

861
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:39,919
um uh some people talk about how like

862
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,679
they'll get different tarpine profiles

863
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:46,080
on the seed plant versus the unseated

864
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:48,159
plant just you know the plants yeah it's

865
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:50,720
immune response or whatever to protect

866
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,240
itself even more and I I always find

867
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,319
that super fascinating like one thing I

868
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,960
always notice is if it's a citrusy

869
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:59,319
leaning mom then it just gets really

870
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,600
really pungent when when it's uh when

871
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:03,558
it's seated and I'm like well there you

872
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:05,519
go you got great hash makings there

873
00:33:03,558 --> 00:33:07,278
right right away I almost wondered that

874
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:11,399
with the Velvet punch that's what made

875
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:14,119
me grow out multiple runs a stress test

876
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:15,759
and then like non-seed runs where I just

877
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:18,678
grew it for

878
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:20,000
flour because I wanted to make sure uh

879
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:21,399
I'd have accurate descriptions of what

880
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,679
people are going to get when they're

881
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:26,079
going to grow it out themselves because

882
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:28,278
most people aren't making seed and I was

883
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:30,319
actually so blown away by the seed run

884
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:32,398
that like some of the elements in there

885
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:35,359
um I wanted to ensure that they were

886
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:37,119
still within the phenotypes in f2s and

887
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:41,038
f3s and sure enough those were what I

888
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:43,278
was selecting for um but and it was

889
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:45,480
there to start like to give credit like

890
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:46,679
the mother of that is a purple punch

891
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,480
which a lot of people say purple punch

892
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:51,000
list blah blah blah grow it yourself and

893
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,480
take it to n or 10 weeks and it it's

894
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,079
definitely got a strong high if you take

895
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,360
it 10 weeks most people aren't willing

896
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:58,558
to take a plant 70 days um and I'm not

897
00:33:56,359 --> 00:34:01,000
saying that you have to 63 I think is

898
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:02,398
solid but 70 I think a lot of strains

899
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,278
are just better it's like cherry pie was

900
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:07,278
another one if you take it um the guy

901
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:08,960
who gave it to me also named Jack he was

902
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,960
uh you know I'm not going to say where

903
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,440
he's from actually he was polish so I'll

904
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,240
[ __ ] say I don't give a [ __ ] polish

905
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:17,159
Jack uh for the story sake he gave me

906
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:19,598
the Cherry Pie initially and um he's

907
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:22,800
like it's good at 9 weeks but it's

908
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,480
really good at 10 weeks so sure enough

909
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,960
first time I grew it I took it 10 weeks

910
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,358
and godamn if he wasn't right it was

911
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,800
[ __ ] fire I actually never ended up

912
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:30,239
growing it N9 weeks because it was so

913
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,440
good at the 10 that I was just like I'm

914
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,439
always going to take it a 10 so I think

915
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,440
sometimes it's worth the extra sometimes

916
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,519
you don't have the you know Le and the

917
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,079
other thing is there's personal

918
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:43,398
preference I think um velvet punch if

919
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:46,639
you take it at 10 weeks it's going to be

920
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:48,799
Daner and gassier then if you take it at

921
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,358
8 weeks or nine weeks it's going to be

922
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,240
fruer you won't get as stoned but it'll

923
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:56,559
taste better and it might even look a

924
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:58,118
little bit um it depends on like what

925
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:59,679
your grow is like sometimes people in

926
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:02,000
the later stages of flower their plants

927
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:04,199
start to look a little bit rough um

928
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,239
they're fading them out with nutrient

929
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:08,199
and that can lead to necrosis and other

930
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:11,319
things that are unintended that aren't

931
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:13,399
just the actual fall fade um it's more

932
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,800
of a you know they're they're flushing

933
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,559
it and it doesn't have access to

934
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,680
nutrients and it's it's starving so some

935
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:22,719
people starve the plant and I actually

936
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:23,559
personally do think starving it is a

937
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:25,519
there's going to be a benefit in the

938
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:26,639
Smoke it'll smoke smoother in my opinion

939
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:29,679
I know a lot of people argue that the

940
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:31,358
flush doesn't work and yada yada and the

941
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:33,319
um fade will happen without a flush and

942
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:35,559
like a organic soil whatever it's going

943
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,519
to happen um I'm blanking on the name

944
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:39,880
right now so I got a little stoned off

945
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:41,599
my Bon sence sence there we go that's

946
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,559
the term yeah where you start to see the

947
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,599
antoin and uh carotenoids start to show

948
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:48,960
you get those purples and reds and pinks

949
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:51,760
and even the yellows and things like

950
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,318
that um can be part of the inessence

951
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,720
process so every strain is a little

952
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:57,880
different I had like a rosta flag one

953
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:59,959
one time it was like I had like you know

954
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,760
the red yellow and green just as it was

955
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:06,000
fading it was uh interesting just to see

956
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:09,599
like the different but um I will say

957
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,358
that purples can go into black but a lot

958
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,400
of people don't realize uh greens can go

959
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:15,318
to Black some of the talking about

960
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,358
Afghan earlier some of that stuff will

961
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:19,519
get black but it never goes purple it's

962
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:21,880
just green green green and then it like

963
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:24,599
that like vibrant purple it it just yeah

964
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:27,760
goes straight to almost like Lack of

965
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:30,240
Color um yeah I've definitely seen that

966
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,680
as well especially Outdoors um when you

967
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:35,559
get those like uh late October harvests

968
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:37,078
uh early September harvests you can

969
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:40,239
really start to see those colors come

970
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:41,680
out depending on where you are in the um

971
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:44,479
in the world if you're a little bit

972
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:46,559
higher up on the latitude then yeah I've

973
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,358
seen it happen pretty quickly um like

974
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:51,838
within a week almost it goes from green

975
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:53,199
to completely black um you know and so

976
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:54,400
I'm going to steer the conversation a

977
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:55,598
little bit back to a few of these

978
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,240
questions that I have cuz we've just

979
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:00,119
been riffing here and I love it and it's

980
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:01,759
been great flow so far um but I I do

981
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:04,160
want to find out what was your first

982
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,680
experience growing and it doesn't even

983
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:09,480
have to be with cannabis like what is

984
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:12,000
your first memory of uh growing a plant

985
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,599
and uh starting your journey as a as a

986
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,800
grower

987
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,519
overall my first one is going to be kind

988
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,119
of comical because uh I wasn't the

989
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:20,639
grower and that was the case with the

990
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,640
first several Growers right cuz I was a

991
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:26,159
kid um and this wasn't cannabis it was

992
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:29,400
uh Tomatoes my nextdoor neighbor uh

993
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:31,920
venzo he was a cool dude but they grew

994
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,838
their own tomatoes for their pasta sauce

995
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,280
and uh his wife would hom make pasta

996
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:38,599
sauce and pasta and things like that

997
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:41,160
when I was a kid he gave me a BB gun to

998
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:43,119
sit on the back porch and they had a

999
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:46,519
little fence around their tomato garden

1000
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,720
and he hung a soda can or pop can that's

1001
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:50,239
what we would call it in the midwest at

1002
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:53,519
the time um just like a little aluminum

1003
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:54,799
can on the top of a stick and squirrels

1004
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:55,960
were a big problem in our area the

1005
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,560
squirrels would come and eat his

1006
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,599
tomatoes and he didn't want to eat the

1007
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,159
squirrel cuz it's not necessarily some

1008
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:03,720
people like it he didn't like it

1009
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:05,598
necessarily but I'm not saying it's bad

1010
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:07,879
eating or good eating but neither here

1011
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,760
that were there this was my first lesson

1012
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,280
in IPM we integrated Petman so I'm going

1013
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,960
to go way back to the start hire a

1014
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:17,319
5-year-old hire a young boy with a BB

1015
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,000
gun who's highly motivated to go out

1016
00:38:17,318 --> 00:38:21,039
there and he said I'll give you a nickel

1017
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,440
for every you know this this wasn't like

1018
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:23,920
that long ago so nickel wasn't much but

1019
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,039
I was just young and dumbb and having

1020
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,079
fun more with the B gun I didn't care

1021
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:29,358
about the Nickels you know but uh

1022
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:32,359
squirrel would come up and try to eat

1023
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:34,159
his uh tomatoes and I'd shoot that can

1024
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:34,960
and make a loud ping and the squirrel

1025
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:37,358
would

1026
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,800
[ __ ] go crazy and jump off the fence

1027
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:42,039
or jump to the next tree and just run

1028
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:44,000
away and so that was my first experience

1029
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:46,639
with growing as far as I can actually

1030
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,119
remember um my parents and family were

1031
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:52,440
not gardeners we had like a tree in my

1032
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,800
front yard just like random [ __ ] um but

1033
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,480
other than maybe like some berries that

1034
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,640
were on a city Planet Tree on the

1035
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,119
sidewalk like nothing actually grew in

1036
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:01,559
where I was at we were into sports and

1037
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:04,280
didn't necessarily have the time that

1038
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:05,799
was dedicated to the garden and so for

1039
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,480
me the first thing that I actually

1040
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,280
participated in the growth of was

1041
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,318
Cannabis and that was when I was a

1042
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,880
teenager started smoking in Middle

1043
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:16,279
School my Brother started dealing he was

1044
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:18,039
a couple years older than me and uh

1045
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,599
eventually I figured out where it was

1046
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:21,358
coming from through the chain I just

1047
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,079
went up the source and uh there was

1048
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:26,039
actually a couple local grows just like

1049
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:28,680
happens now um in random neighborhoods

1050
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:31,679
they'd have people with grow setups and

1051
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:33,919
uh I ended up kind of asking like can I

1052
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:35,480
help like in some way just to like get a

1053
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,358
joint to here and there like I didn't

1054
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,318
even want payment I just wanted to smoke

1055
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:40,759
cuz I was smoking so much of my

1056
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:43,039
brother's stuff and uh I was like I just

1057
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,440
want to not have to pester him for

1058
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:47,920
something he's selling and making money

1059
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:50,679
off of so I ended up thankfully it was a

1060
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,800
friend through football um so I don't

1061
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:57,039
think I would have ever gotten into the

1062
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,519
grow situation because there was at the

1063
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:00,599
time cannabis was selling for like six

1064
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:05,159
or 77,000 a pound we're talking early

1065
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:06,760
2000s and in the Cleveland area so yeah

1066
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:09,838
it was yeah definitely I forgot that

1067
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:12,040
you're from Ohio uh yeah it was born and

1068
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:14,838
raised definitely was pricey pricey

1069
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:16,759
stuff there at that time so considering

1070
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:18,358
that the crew that I was working with

1071
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,680
all they cared about was getting six a

1072
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:26,119
pound and two a light we had 600 watt

1073
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:28,799
lights they're HPS we ran a reverse dwc

1074
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:32,000
system it was a DIY System Home Depot

1075
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,960
buckets with uh reverse or recirculating

1076
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,679
it was like uh recirculating yeah but

1077
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,318
like they they would go from like one to

1078
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:40,118
the next to the next to the next uh

1079
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:41,838
already done recirculating whatever but

1080
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:44,720
this and like I said I was just a water

1081
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:47,039
boy at the time and uh basically my job

1082
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:49,439
was to sweep up the leaves that were

1083
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:51,759
pruned off and then to take the little

1084
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,240
blue lab trench in stick it in to the

1085
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,880
buckets and make sure that they were all

1086
00:40:53,239 --> 00:41:00,358
the right EC and uh pH so I go through

1087
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,760
to verify that the reservoir was

1088
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:04,440
matching up to each plant and make sure

1089
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,800
that the reservoirs had water because

1090
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,358
sometimes they're with DIY systems weird

1091
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,318
[ __ ] would happen like it would leak or

1092
00:41:08,358 --> 00:41:11,159
crack or whatever so you'd have to

1093
00:41:09,318 --> 00:41:14,239
replace a bucket here and there or you

1094
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:15,799
know uh figure it out what was making oh

1095
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:17,199
there's a tube that's clogged you know

1096
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,318
and figure out why is it clogged how do

1097
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:20,679
we get it unclogged but in that process

1098
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:23,880
sort of just being around the plants

1099
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:25,000
learning like uh oh well the EC is low

1100
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,480
and they start to look like this or the

1101
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
EC's high and they start to look like

1102
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,519
this as here constantly so even though I

1103
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,400
was just a water boy I got a lot of

1104
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:34,599
experience in just seeing what a healthy

1105
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:38,559
plant's supposed to look like and you

1106
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:40,440
know how to kind of be around a grow uh

1107
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:42,880
unfortunately you know bad things

1108
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:45,318
happened there and uh the person who ran

1109
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,240
the operation got taken out by

1110
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:48,920
competition and I won't get too much

1111
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:50,399
into the details but there was like

1112
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,599
crime scene tape when I showed up one

1113
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,920
day and just uh unfortunately was never

1114
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:59,160
able to go back to that operation and a

1115
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:01,400
couple years later I was able to go to

1116
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:03,519
California for college and when I was in

1117
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,639
California I met well my freshman

1118
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:06,639
roommate actually I was randomly

1119
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:11,000
assigned to live with he started growing

1120
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:12,799
weed in the window sill of our dorm and

1121
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,639
uh he just had a literally he was

1122
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,800
selling weed and it's funny because like

1123
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:18,078
there's a history of this in my family

1124
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,039
apparently cuz my mom when she was in

1125
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,480
college her roommate she told me this

1126
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:22,599
like long before like one of the reasons

1127
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,440
she's like oh I I don't smoke weed it

1128
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:25,838
makes me paranoid my roommate in college

1129
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,920
grew it on my window sale blah blah blah

1130
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:30,279
and I was like that seemed like such a

1131
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,079
you know hokey hook story and then sure

1132
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,760
enough got college and uh you know same

1133
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:36,280
thing happened to me but I didn't mind

1134
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,000
we I loved cannabis at that time I've

1135
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,760
been smoking since I was you know young

1136
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,400
teen and played football had lots of

1137
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,200
injuries and didn't didn't even realize

1138
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,039
I was self-medicating for head injuries

1139
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:47,480
and bodily injuries and things like that

1140
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:49,599
even psychological stuff but getting

1141
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:52,960
back to the grow side of things um when

1142
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:55,318
I moved out here my roommate who grew he

1143
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,800
he sold and he had found a seed in one

1144
00:42:55,318 --> 00:42:58,440
of the better bags he's like well this

1145
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,519
[ __ ] was fire so I want to try and grow

1146
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:04,240
this out and so he got a Starbucks paper

1147
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:06,920
cup and filled it with soil from our

1148
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:08,399
little flower beds in the dormatory and

1149
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,119
put it in there watered it sure enough

1150
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,880
it germinated and it was like the last

1151
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:13,880
month we were living there so it stayed

1152
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,880
in that cup for less than a month we

1153
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:18,680
moved out to a little apartment and we

1154
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,160
were the very last one thankfully and uh

1155
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,358
maybe we even chose it because of this

1156
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:23,279
but it was like all the way at the end

1157
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:25,078
of the parking row and like we were the

1158
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,519
last two spots so nobody else would

1159
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:27,760
really even get too close to where we

1160
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:28,880
were at and and then it went around

1161
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,000
there was like a fenced in area and a

1162
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,280
little grass patch and so we just had

1163
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,239
like a nice sunny grassy patch there

1164
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,640
that was kind of private and so he just

1165
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:39,279
threw it in a pot got some soil and this

1166
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:41,000
thing ended up grown like 6 and 1 half 7

1167
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,400
ft didn't know what it was we called it

1168
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,239
sweet skunk cuz it was sweet and skunky

1169
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,318
and uh man it was it kind of got us off

1170
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:51,239
on Off to the Races looked into the

1171
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:54,199
medical U licensing got our medical

1172
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:57,199
cards and one of his friends cuz he was

1173
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:59,719
from this area I'm not um his dad had

1174
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:01,799
property and so we set up a grow at his

1175
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:02,799
property and we dug like trenches next

1176
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,680
to the fence because we're like these

1177
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,839
things are going to get tall man they're

1178
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:06,118
going to be as tall as your fence or

1179
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:08,000
higher cuz we're going to do it right

1180
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:09,599
and we did we set him up and killed it

1181
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,760
there and ended up finding even more

1182
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:14,559
local spot and got into doing to be

1183
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,559
honest while we were doing this my buddy

1184
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:17,640
who was selling was more into it than me

1185
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:19,319
so he was learning all the stuff I was

1186
00:44:17,639 --> 00:44:22,159
just like along for the ride you know

1187
00:44:19,318 --> 00:44:25,480
labor sure and um he got into like

1188
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:26,719
Organics and Korean natural farming and

1189
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,400
things like that so I was learning about

1190
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:30,000
like m your CHS techniques and things

1191
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,639
like that and so I got into Organics

1192
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,079
Organics is cool like [ __ ] it tastes

1193
00:44:31,639 --> 00:44:36,159
good easy to do in terms of uh once you

1194
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,000
get it set up and rolling uh it seems

1195
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:39,759
simple basically water only at a certain

1196
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,559
point and you can have certain inputs

1197
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,520
here and there to you know supplement so

1198
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:48,640
he got me into that side of things but

1199
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:51,599
um we went through college graduated and

1200
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:53,440
unfortunately like we had a home Breakin

1201
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,519
and so a couple of my roommates and and

1202
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,639
myself admittedly like got SC like some

1203
00:44:55,519 --> 00:45:00,559
guy broke into our house with a gun and

1204
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:03,279
uh so thankfully we all survived um

1205
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:05,519
pulled a fake gun on that my roommate

1206
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,640
had a BB gun and uh thankfully it was

1207
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:09,519
like painted black and Y get the [ __ ]

1208
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:11,239
out of my house type thing and the dude

1209
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:13,318
did but we didn't realize like he jumped

1210
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:14,639
out the window that he came in and so we

1211
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:16,838
thought he was still in the house they

1212
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:18,199
like come to my door and I'm like locked

1213
00:45:16,838 --> 00:45:20,039
in my room whatever I was actually

1214
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:21,439
studying and they're like somebody's in

1215
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:23,159
the house with a gun like call 911 we

1216
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,000
can't find our phone it's like is all

1217
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:26,759
right I'm [ __ ] call 911 they hand me

1218
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,079
this fake gun and I'm like pretending

1219
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,040
I'm the phone with 911 like I have a gun

1220
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:31,559
if somebody comes up these stairs I'm

1221
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:33,358
going to shoot him so like if the

1222
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:34,599
person's in the house that they're

1223
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:37,119
hopefully not incentivized to come up

1224
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:39,519
the stairs and uh it was all Bluff but

1225
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,280
definitely I won't get into the gun side

1226
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:43,440
of things but learned from that

1227
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,280
situation to not have fake guns to be

1228
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,960
prepared for uh home invasions and I'll

1229
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:51,000
leave it at that but uh never be caught

1230
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,838
with my pants down like that ever again

1231
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,880
literally I was Stark ass naked I was

1232
00:45:52,838 --> 00:45:57,039
going to bed at the time I slept naked

1233
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,000
and my roommate's girlfriend was one

1234
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:00,519
pounded on the door and like and it was

1235
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,358
such a weird night like the cops came

1236
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:03,679
over I think our house got cased because

1237
00:46:02,358 --> 00:46:05,440
like the cops came over like 2 hours

1238
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:06,719
before it happened and said that they

1239
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,079
were looking for a missing person and

1240
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:10,799
like there was no missing person at the

1241
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,039
house it was like a madeup person so I

1242
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,079
think the person who broke into our

1243
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:15,639
house made it look like we were like the

1244
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,039
boy who cried wolf kind of thing cuz

1245
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:18,279
they the cops were just out there we

1246
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:19,920
don't want to come back out there but it

1247
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,880
was like for an armed robbery so they

1248
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,240
end up coming like 15 minutes later

1249
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,920
nobody was there but thank to their

1250
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:28,358
credit uh s or whoever it was uh they

1251
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,680
cleared the area and and no one was in

1252
00:46:28,358 --> 00:46:32,159
the house and no one was outside the

1253
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:33,799
house so and a few weeks later that

1254
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:35,318
person got busted breaking into somebody

1255
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:38,000
else's house who held him up with a

1256
00:46:35,318 --> 00:46:40,119
shotgun and wait till the cops got there

1257
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,318
so damn yeah doing the same [ __ ] they

1258
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:45,680
got arrested

1259
00:46:41,318 --> 00:46:47,880
so but that ultimately it leads back to

1260
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:49,078
the grow I'm [ __ ] feel a little but

1261
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,880
like somebody doing the weave over here

1262
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:53,519
but

1263
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,680
the ultimate point of that story was the

1264
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,519
guy that I was growing with outdoor um

1265
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:59,358
my other two roommates to turn their

1266
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:00,838
back they weren't weak guys and they're

1267
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,920
like we can't live with this guy it's

1268
00:47:00,838 --> 00:47:04,480
too dangerous blah BL blah blah and I

1269
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,358
was like okay I just graduated I got my

1270
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:10,119
first professional job in uh you know

1271
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:11,400
the space that I'm working in I you know

1272
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:14,000
provide services to special needs

1273
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,680
individuals autism through py and I was

1274
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,079
like okay well I just graduated college

1275
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:18,919
maybe I can move out of my college house

1276
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:20,960
like move into like they're like we're

1277
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:22,280
going to go tour this apartment complex

1278
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,720
and it was more professional blah blah

1279
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,000
but I go and tour it and it was only

1280
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:27,000
like a three-person place and like there

1281
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,358
wasn't a spot for this fourth guy and

1282
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,119
and um I just thought oh I'm going to

1283
00:47:30,358 --> 00:47:33,358
tour the place and then when I got there

1284
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:34,358
they're like this is the last one we've

1285
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:35,480
got like three more people touring if

1286
00:47:34,358 --> 00:47:37,719
you don't sign right now like you're not

1287
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:39,519
going to get a spot and where we're at

1288
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:42,759
admittedly it's hard to find places to

1289
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:44,599
live that are decent and um so I made

1290
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:49,119
the mistake of kind of getting pressure

1291
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:51,880
tactic into signing my lease and

1292
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,960
unfortunately didn't realize I kind of

1293
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:57,358
signed the death note of that

1294
00:47:53,960 --> 00:48:00,720
relationship with a guy that I really am

1295
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:03,400
sad that I'm not still connected with so

1296
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:04,919
it's my homie Zach zigzac I don't know

1297
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,480

touch just because so busy with work and

1324

life and things like that it's just how

1325

taken care of you know so I've always

1328
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:12,199
heard growing up means growing apart in

1329
00:49:08,358 --> 00:49:15,039
a lot of ways um you know it's just you

1330
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:17,679
move or you you change your your

1331
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:20,079
schedules and you know what was a a 420

1332
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:22,318
hangout sesh before becomes like hey man

1333
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:24,280
I might have 30 minutes at 9:30 at night

1334
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:26,119
and everyone's like I'm going to be

1335
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:29,400
tucked in a bed I'm up at 4:00 a.m. for

1336
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:31,440
work so I know man I learned that young

1337
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:34,680
thankfully cuz like my one buddy he

1338
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,200
moved to uh just one town over and like

1339
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:38,719
we had just gotten our licenses like we

1340
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:40,919
loved to drive 15-minute Drive was

1341
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:41,959
nothing and like I was in Ohio and I was

1342
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,400
like we're going to hang out all the

1343
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,679
time and like he got new friends like

1344
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,960
they they' hang out with the new friends

1345
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:49,879
and like this was my best friend from

1346
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:53,440
like you know kindergarten through

1347
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:56,160
however long and um it's and we were

1348
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:58,760
still friendly you know from afar but

1349
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:01,000
it's just like the effort it takes to

1350
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,720
even my like my family like my dad when

1351
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,239
he moved an hour south for work and

1352
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:08,159
stuff like that like we'd only see his

1353
00:50:05,239 --> 00:50:11,639
family on holidays like Thanksgiving and

1354
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:13,318
Christmas type thing and it's just um I

1355
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:17,480
moved obviously far away from my family

1356
00:50:13,318 --> 00:50:19,000
I 5 hour flight at the minimum and um

1357
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,440
it's funny cuz like I could see him just

1358
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,719
as much as I would if I moved 1 hour

1359
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,880
south in Ohio you know so it's it's

1360
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:28,239
really uh we get busy and that's one of

1361
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:32,599
the things that makes growing so

1362
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:33,838
difficult but the I guess ultimate point

1363
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:35,079
of what I wanted to focus the most on

1364
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:37,358
the show which is what I haven't even

1365
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:39,440
gotten to yet which is uh the girls that

1366
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:41,480
I'm most proud of I guess are the ones

1367
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,639
that I did myself and a lot of people

1368
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:45,440
yeah let's [ __ ] on them let's go that

1369
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:47,199
homeow cuz like so far you've been

1370
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,400
talking kind of about how you've like

1371
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:52,358
were introduced to seeing cannabis

1372
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:54,240
growing and um you know your your very

1373
00:50:52,358 --> 00:50:57,039
first introduction into being the water

1374
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:59,479
boy and the leaf boy and and going

1375
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:01,838
through and kind of just uh kind of

1376
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,639
being the Gopher of just of getting

1377
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:06,078
getting what needs to be got done

1378
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:08,679
without being given sort of the formal

1379
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:10,798
education of what uh or why you do

1380
00:51:08,679 --> 00:51:14,519
certain things so when did you start to

1381
00:51:10,798 --> 00:51:17,599
dive into um like either as a homeg

1382
00:51:14,519 --> 00:51:21,079
grower uh like kind of being more intent

1383
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:27,079
on uh your processes or uh did you end

1384
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:29,318
up finding more of a um commercial or uh

1385
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:31,400
or another like working with people that

1386
00:51:29,318 --> 00:51:34,880
were producing for the medical or wreck

1387
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:36,160
market so when I like I had like I said

1388
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,838
I had the falling out so going from

1389
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:41,318
there I guess later on I personally

1390
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:43,039
moved away for grad school to Florida

1391
00:51:41,318 --> 00:51:44,358
and then I moved back here so kind of

1392
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:46,838
even lost more touch with a lot of

1393
00:51:44,358 --> 00:51:48,480
people um and when I moved back here

1394
00:51:46,838 --> 00:51:49,639
there happened to be a Hydra store right

1395
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,760
down my street and I was working at a

1396
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:52,440
delivery service for a little while I

1397
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,000
saw the guy at the delivery service

1398
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,679
growing in his own like in his closet

1399
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,798
just like or like on a balcony like a

1400
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:58,440
couple plants here and there just from

1401
00:51:56,798 --> 00:52:01,400
seeds that he got from uh bags that we

1402
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:03,838
were selling and he was doing it organic

1403
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,240
but um he didn't really he was doing

1404
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:07,519
some of the techniques my other bu had

1405
00:52:05,239 --> 00:52:09,399
done before KF type stuff but he wasn't

1406
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:11,079
having as much success just red little

1407
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:13,240
plants and it was good smoke but it was

1408
00:52:11,079 --> 00:52:16,119
like you know 1ot tall plant by one foot

1409
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:17,279
wide type thing and um nothing as quite

1410
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:18,920
as impressive as what I was used to

1411
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,839
seeing in High Times growing up and all

1412
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:23,039
that stuff so I wanted to like figure

1413
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:24,599
out a system that I could grow like a

1414
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:26,960
pretty good looking healthy plant in a

1415
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:28,119
small space and I found like these space

1416
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,599
bucket type things where you could do

1417
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:31,200
like Home Depot buckets or like totes

1418
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:36,240
like stacked up like do lighting all

1419
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:38,960
around it but my wife uh graciously

1420
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:40,959
offered one of the closets in our very

1421
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,960
small space we don't have a whole bunch

1422
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:45,039
of square footage 400 square feet out

1423
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,280
here we're very very very close to the

1424
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:49,119
ocean so like don't feel sorry for me

1425
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:53,079
living in a tiny house I'm very happy

1426
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:55,760
iose chose this lifestyle so SoCal near

1427
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:58,640
the ocean 400 squ ft is not that bad I

1428
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:01,000
was I was 400 square ft in Portland

1429
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:02,598
Oregon for a little while and um you

1430
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,119
know in the dead of winter that just

1431
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:07,280
gets to

1432
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:08,798
be I'm bundled up here so you know I

1433
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,040
totally I can I can relate cuz being

1434
00:53:08,798 --> 00:53:14,119
from Ohio cold is cold and uh it's not

1435
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:16,159
fun being cold and she sacrificed this

1436
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:18,318
one closet cuz like it was kind of a you

1437
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:21,279
know borderline of being necessary for

1438
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:23,119
her it was lightly being used and I told

1439
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,280
her about my experience growing with

1440
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:26,920
like my buddies and stuff like that and

1441
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,960
medical licenses are like a diamond

1442
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:31,079
dozen out here you can really easily get

1443
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,760
your in the 215 days you you know just

1444
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:35,240
grow and so I was like well I'll go talk

1445
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,960
to the doctor again get my license

1446
00:53:35,239 --> 00:53:39,279
updated I did got my license and I was

1447
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,480
like all right let's Get Growing got a

1448
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,519
tent that literally fit the exact

1449
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:45,760
dimensions of the closet like it is I

1450
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:46,960
had to take out the inner moldings of

1451
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,720
the closet like there's like a crown

1452
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:52,039
molding on the door panel that shuts

1453
00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:53,838
into it and I had to like pull those off

1454
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:55,358
so that like the frames could fit and

1455
00:53:53,838 --> 00:53:57,880
even then like the top frame didn't

1456
00:53:55,358 --> 00:54:00,480
quite fit so I built a wooden structure

1457
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:02,960
and uh is it like a one of those

1458
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:06,000
dimensions that's not an actual foot by

1459
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:08,760
foot Dimension it's like 20 in by 18 in

1460
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,599
or something weird like that it's 3T by

1461
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,960
1 and 1/2 ft yeah it's like the weirdest

1462
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:14,880
it's not exactly 1 and half it's like

1463
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:18,559
one and like it's definitely a is it

1464
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:21,559
exactly 36 in across or is it like 32 or

1465
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,920
something it's 36 wide I think okay and

1466
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:25,440
then it's

1467
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:28,159
um it's like just over one and a half so

1468
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:30,079
12 okay I could look up the thing on my

1469
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:31,960
Amazon purchase from wherever no it's

1470
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:34,559
fine I I feel like there's a standard

1471
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:37,199
closet size for like small closets like

1472
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:38,798
that because I got a tent from a buddy

1473
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:41,358
when I was first getting into this and I

1474
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:43,119
was like this is the weirdest dimensions

1475
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:47,078
for a tent when everything else that you

1476
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:51,119
see online is like within like you know

1477
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:54,160
TW like multiples of 12 Ines on on

1478
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:56,440
either you know depth width height all

1479
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:59,318
these different things um and I was just

1480
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:04,159
like why would anybody want a tent this

1481
00:54:59,318 --> 00:55:07,440
size and then I I moved and I I saw in a

1482
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:09,960
in like one of my moves that this frame

1483
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,358
fit perfectly into a closet and I was

1484
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:14,079
like what is what is going on how did

1485
00:55:12,358 --> 00:55:16,400
they even figure this out so there yeah

1486
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:20,599
there must be a standard closet size I

1487
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:22,920
love it man it's a 36 by 20 in x 62 in

1488
00:55:20,599 --> 00:55:24,920
so it's like 5 ft tall 3 ft wide and

1489
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,960
like 2 and 1/2 ft deep it's like if you

1490
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:28,798
reached your arm into like a a coat

1491
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,838
closet it it's going to like hit the

1492
00:55:28,798 --> 00:55:32,318
back you know like your arm is probably

1493
00:55:30,838 --> 00:55:34,199
going to be longer than the tent so it's

1494
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:35,880
nice cuz I can reach all the way across

1495
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:37,439
and get to the back of the plants and

1496
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,960
it's enough space like I've had as many

1497
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,559
as six plants in there I work out with

1498
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:44,960
uh two in there now in an earth box but

1499
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:46,319
I was when I got started doing Coco

1500
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,639
because there was a Hydra store I could

1501
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:48,838
hit it with a base like if I threw a

1502
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:52,719
baseball from my house I could hit it it

1503
00:55:48,838 --> 00:55:54,440
was so close and um so I ended up going

1504
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:56,078
in there and just getting some basic

1505
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,720
stuff to get set up and what they were

1506
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:59,318
put at the time and like many hydro

1507
00:55:57,719 --> 00:56:02,399
stores and many places rightfully do I

1508
00:55:59,318 --> 00:56:04,480
think Coco Co is a good media and it's

1509
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,240
simple enough to get

1510
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,559
started I met some of the guys who

1511
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:10,279
worked there and one of them's like a

1512
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:11,280
real old OG and uh he kind of took me

1513
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,559
under his wing a little bit and I was

1514
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,480
just like what do you use like how do

1515
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:16,760
you do it and I kind of got all the same

1516
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,119
stuff that he did and just kind of do

1517
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,440
exactly what he did to try and have

1518
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:21,838
success I bought way too much light for

1519
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,440
my space it was a 3X3 light I got had a

1520
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:26,519
3X 1 and a half right so I was over lit

1521
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:29,240
to start with a a ceramic metal highight

1522
00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:32,599
315 C I had like a little super sprouter

1523
00:56:29,239 --> 00:56:34,519
bulb and a you know a dome or whatever

1524
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:35,640
so I germinate with that get him going

1525
00:56:34,519 --> 00:56:37,440
for a little bit and then I'd put them

1526
00:56:35,639 --> 00:56:39,440
under the CM and push it all the way to

1527
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,838
the top of the tent and then gradually

1528
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,000
they'd grow up towards it and like lower

1529
00:56:40,838 --> 00:56:46,480
it down fairly quickly switched to an

1530
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,480
LED that was appropriately spaced uh or

1531
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,519
sized for my space there was a local

1532
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,240
company called Timber grow lights

1533
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:54,519
they're now called High Grove LEDs um

1534
00:56:53,239 --> 00:56:55,759
they don't make a LED that's small

1535
00:56:54,519 --> 00:56:57,920
enough for my space anymore but they now

1536
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,119
do like bar LEDs and stuff like that but

1537
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,519
I can't speak to the quality of those I

1538
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:02,039
will say that the cob style that I got

1539
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:04,318
from them is still running strong like

1540
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:05,760
years later so it's how many years do

1541
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:07,920
you think you've been running it it's

1542
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:10,559
like I think five or six years now I

1543
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:13,159
think I got it in 2019 and dude it still

1544
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:15,280
pulls two grams a watt so like that's

1545
00:57:13,159 --> 00:57:16,639
great for new Growers to know I mean cuz

1546
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,079
cobs are one of those things also that

1547
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:21,199
run pretty hot and you can see that uh

1548
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:23,798
some people have failures on those but

1549
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:26,960
if it's built well and it's running for

1550
00:57:23,798 --> 00:57:28,880
Years it'll run another 10 dude the the

1551
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,480
um it's like aircraft aluminum but the

1552
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,039
the heat sinks are like it looks like

1553
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,719
giant hedgehogs off the back like

1554
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:37,039
they're these thick metal rods coming up

1555
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:39,078
and my exhaust fan is right next to

1556
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:42,520
where the light is hung so a lot of that

1557
00:57:39,079 --> 00:57:44,160
heat from the driver from the uh cobs it

1558
00:57:42,519 --> 00:57:47,199
just drifts right from the top of the

1559
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:48,639
light out of the tent where with the

1560
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:50,919
ceramic metal H the way that it was

1561
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:53,318
cased that metal casing and then that

1562
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:55,920
light it was a reflector right it throw

1563
00:57:53,318 --> 00:57:57,480
throws all that light but also heat down

1564
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,318
so it would throw it down onto the

1565
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:01,599
plants and then get pushed up and then

1566
00:57:59,318 --> 00:58:02,599
cycled out where the he you can barely

1567
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,039
even feel it when you put your hand

1568
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:07,280
under the LEDs even a cob that's pretty

1569
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:08,520
intense a few inches away if you went by

1570
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,839
that metric you'd burn the crap out of

1571
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:12,239
your plants cuz there's way too much

1572
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:16,838
light getting to where it feels hot and

1573
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:20,719
so I found a migro has a little uh video

1574
00:58:16,838 --> 00:58:22,960
where he found this doggo uh apps is

1575
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:24,598
what it's called a lux light meter and

1576
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,318
he did a side-by-side comparison with

1577
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:27,680
like a $300 light meter and then and he

1578
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:29,199
did a graph like all right so you

1579
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:31,519
basically just do like times 10 and it

1580
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:32,838
gives you your exact par from the Lux or

1581
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:35,559
whatever or divide by 10 or whatever it

1582
00:58:32,838 --> 00:58:36,679
is and um so I never ended up buying a

1583
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:39,280
light meter and I've used that and it's

1584
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:41,358
worked fantastically in terms of knowing

1585
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,960
how much light I'm giving to the plants

1586
00:58:41,358 --> 00:58:46,400
and uh so that's kind of where I'm at in

1587
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:49,358
terms of like gear and growing but I

1588
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,798
started like I mentioned in Coco and um

1589
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:52,159
that kind of OG took me under his wing

1590
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:54,838
and I learned a lot I started in like

1591
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:56,519
three gallon pots and uh I vegged two

1592
00:58:54,838 --> 00:58:58,279
blue dreams for way too long they showed

1593
00:58:56,519 --> 00:59:01,559
sex because that's how we used to do it

1594
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:03,240
when I was growing Afghani under HPS and

1595
00:59:01,559 --> 00:59:04,720
like I just was I reverted back to like

1596
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:06,118
what did I do when I was indoor it's

1597
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:08,558
like okay we vegged them as big as they

1598
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:10,480
could get right they started showing sex

1599
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:12,640
and they were clones right CU that was a

1600
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:15,159
different system I was averting sort of

1601
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:17,759
my old ways set me up for not success in

1602
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:19,759
a little bit of a metric because with

1603
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,400
the HPS you could grow clones they show

1604
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,520
pistols relatively quick they're they're

1605
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,119
old clones they've been around for a

1606
00:59:22,519 --> 00:59:26,358
long time they're sexually mature yeah

1607
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:27,960
they'll show pistols and veg almost

1608
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:29,400
always uh especially the one that we

1609
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:31,119
were running this afghan that was so old

1610
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:33,519
and tired we've been running for years

1611
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:35,440
but um it was an AK-47 they called it

1612
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:36,838
but it wasn't the AK-47 from Syria seeds

1613
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,480
it was an Afghan Kush that flowered in

1614
00:59:36,838 --> 00:59:42,318
47 days from like Afghanistan like the

1615
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:44,119
Kush mountains but um and it had like

1616
00:59:42,318 --> 00:59:46,639
little baseball bat colas and it was

1617
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:48,920
just like a super narcotic eye but um

1618
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:50,318
going back to like my girl I was like I

1619
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:51,599
loved blue dreams I was like well if I'm

1620
00:59:50,318 --> 00:59:53,159
going to start my own home grow might as

1621
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:54,838
well give myself my favorite strain like

1622
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:57,038
one of my favorite strains blue dream

1623
00:59:54,838 --> 00:59:59,318
and so I got some blue dream and uh it

1624
00:59:57,039 --> 01:00:01,280
was seeds but the seeds were from Humble

1625
00:59:59,318 --> 01:00:02,480
seed organization and admittedly they

1626
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:06,760
are honest about what it was it was a

1627
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:10,079
feminized Cross of DJ shorts blueberry

1628
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:12,440
to Shanti Baba from Mr Nice Seed

1629
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:14,880
company's Super Silver Haze and for

1630
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:17,318
those who don't know Blue Dream is a

1631
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,640
Santa Cruz Haze cross to DJ Schwarz

1632
01:00:17,318 --> 01:00:22,038
blueberry Santa Cruz Haze is pretty

1633
01:00:19,639 --> 01:00:23,318
similar to Super Silver Haz and there's

1634
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:26,200
even some that speculate it might just

1635
01:00:23,318 --> 01:00:27,558
be a super silver um I can't verify I do

1636
01:00:26,199 --> 01:00:30,519
think Santa Cruz Haze might be its own

1637
01:00:27,559 --> 01:00:32,480
thing I do think the Blue Dream cut the

1638
01:00:30,519 --> 01:00:34,199
Santa Cruz Blue Dream cut is like

1639
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,880
special and it is my favorite one of my

1640
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:38,598
favorites if not my favorite like that's

1641
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:40,838
what people made their fortunes off of

1642
01:00:38,599 --> 01:00:42,640
oh yeah it was a yeah I mean 10 12

1643
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:45,519
pounder Outdoors for a lot of people so

1644
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:46,759
it was a huge yielder um it was kind of

1645
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:48,000
like purple punch because like once

1646
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:50,319
something gets super popular it also

1647
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,679
becomes super unpopular because a lot of

1648
01:00:50,318 --> 01:00:53,318
people get their hands on it or say that

1649
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:56,239
they have their hands on it they grow it

1650
01:00:53,318 --> 01:00:57,159
out grow up poorly and harvest it early

1651
01:00:56,239 --> 01:00:58,598
and then sell it to the market and

1652
01:00:57,159 --> 01:00:59,519
people are like oh Blue Dream sucks I

1653
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:00,680
can't even get high out and it doesn't

1654
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:02,440
even taste good it's like well you you

1655
01:01:00,679 --> 01:01:03,960
got it from the guy who was doing it for

1656
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:06,240
cash not the guy who did it because he

1657
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,720
loved it and because he wants the dankus

1658
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:11,439
weed and happens to make some money on

1659
01:01:07,719 --> 01:01:14,279
it um but that point aside getting back

1660
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:17,000
to the grow the blue dream that I vegged

1661
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:19,400
I think 60 days in Coco got them in like

1662
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:23,719
three gallon pots by the flower and uh

1663
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:25,680
like I said I'm in a 5ot tall tent so uh

1664
01:01:23,719 --> 01:01:27,759
those things I put like Tris netting up

1665
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:30,078
thank y because it bursted through that

1666
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,920
first the first trtic didn't do anything

1667
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:33,920
second trtic didn't do anything third I

1668
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,880
set up a third layer and I like cut out

1669
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,559
the first layer set up a fourth layer

1670
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:39,519
and like I just kept trellising it and

1671
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:41,039
kept bending it over because the plant

1672
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:43,880
just got so out of control it filled

1673
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:45,760
every square inch it was a crazy harvest

1674
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:47,798
the bud didn't look great at all it

1675
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,400
tasted amazing so like I made a ton of

1676
01:01:47,798 --> 01:01:52,480
hash I still have hash from that [ __ ]

1677
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:54,720
run in my freezer oh my God yeah this is

1678
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:57,159
7-year-old Blue Dream hash and it I like

1679
01:01:54,719 --> 01:01:59,759
it cuz I have arthritis my hands shake

1680
01:01:57,159 --> 01:02:02,038
and if I smoke two or three hits of that

1681
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,799
specific Blue Dream my hands just go

1682
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:08,000
Stone Cold still so if I ever need to do

1683
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:10,358
fine work like for whatever reason with

1684
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,119
my hands then I'll pull some of that out

1685
01:02:10,358 --> 01:02:14,000
of the freezer and take a couple hits

1686
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:15,440
and I realized if I take less than two

1687
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,318
or three it doesn't work and if I take

1688
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:20,000
more than two or three I start to shake

1689
01:02:17,318 --> 01:02:21,519
even more again so it's kind of a weird

1690
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,079
just H getting into the medical set of

1691
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:25,318
things realize people there is a a

1692
01:02:23,079 --> 01:02:26,798
magical dose out there that can be the

1693
01:02:25,318 --> 01:02:28,480
ideal dose sometimes it's too much and

1694
01:02:26,798 --> 01:02:30,679
sometimes it's too little so experiment

1695
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,559
I mean when it when it comes to shaking

1696
01:02:30,679 --> 01:02:35,199
specifically my father has essential

1697
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:38,359
tremor which is um it's like similar to

1698
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:41,679
Parkinson's but it's not lethal

1699
01:02:38,358 --> 01:02:43,358
um it but it does cause like a shaking

1700
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:46,318
of like everything like his face will

1701
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:47,920
shake his hands and arms will shake and

1702
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:50,639
um some of the relief that he found

1703
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:52,680
early on was using cannabis and it would

1704
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:54,759
lower all of his shaking syndromes down

1705
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:56,159
to a manageable amount you know like

1706
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:57,640
where sometimes in the morning he would

1707
01:02:56,159 --> 01:02:59,000
pick up his coffee and like he'd get it

1708
01:02:57,639 --> 01:03:01,199
to here and then all of a sudden like

1709
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,480
the coffee is everywhere whereas if he

1710
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:04,838
had a little smoke in the morning he

1711
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:06,760
could have his coffee kind of sit there

1712
01:03:04,838 --> 01:03:08,599
he'd be a little bit more relaxed and it

1713
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,960
was really amazing to see the difference

1714
01:03:08,599 --> 01:03:12,599
between with and without cannabis in a

1715
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:16,318
lot of cases especially when it comes to

1716
01:03:12,599 --> 01:03:19,079
something that is like a nerve related

1717
01:03:16,318 --> 01:03:21,838
um you know disorder of some kind or

1718
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:23,318
just some some in general mine mine came

1719
01:03:21,838 --> 01:03:24,880
from arthritis I thought I had

1720
01:03:23,318 --> 01:03:26,400
Parkinson's I thought I had early onset

1721
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,920
Parkinson's because when I moved to

1722
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,480
Florida and didn't have access to the

1723
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:33,639
same quality of I moved to California

1724
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:36,159
and had a better access

1725
01:03:33,639 --> 01:03:38,679
to Medicinal cannabis selection that

1726
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:40,118
I've ever had my entire life prior and

1727
01:03:38,679 --> 01:03:41,759
didn't realize I had arthritis in both

1728
01:03:40,119 --> 01:03:43,880
hands from basketball and football I

1729
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,640
broke every finger and I'd also used to

1730
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:47,760
Punch walls in Anger with you know

1731
01:03:45,639 --> 01:03:50,278
Brothers growing up the youngest of

1732
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:52,839
three getting beat up on like take your

1733
01:03:50,278 --> 01:03:55,798
frustrations I my hands are beat to [ __ ]

1734
01:03:52,838 --> 01:03:57,719
so they Shake cuz I have osteoarthritis

1735
01:03:55,798 --> 01:04:00,838
I found later in life but I was

1736
01:03:57,719 --> 01:04:03,118
undiagnosed until like my late 20s and

1737
01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:04,558
when I tried the arthritis stuff it just

1738
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:07,039
none of it worked well and it made me

1739
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:08,760
feel sick so when I realized oh certain

1740
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:11,119
cannabis like really helps forarm cut

1741
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:13,240
girl cout cookie smoking that stuff

1742
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:15,720
takes my pain away it doesn't reduce the

1743
01:04:13,239 --> 01:04:17,399
shaking as much it reduces inflammation

1744
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:20,598
and it just helps my it's like one of

1745
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:23,680
the best strains for my particular

1746
01:04:20,599 --> 01:04:25,440
osteoarthritis and um I think that yeah

1747
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:27,639
just always love highlighting the

1748
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,960
medical I side because whether

1749
01:04:27,639 --> 01:04:33,118
thankfully it turned out I didn't have

1750
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:34,920
Parkinson I just wasn't um I I think

1751
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:37,318
that the endoc canabo system is so

1752
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:39,599
integrally connected to the human

1753
01:04:37,318 --> 01:04:41,038
experience at least for me I have a lot

1754
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:43,519
of head injuries and a lot of hand

1755
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:45,480
injuries in the past so I think that it

1756
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:47,920
really helped me even like people think

1757
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:49,559
that it hurts your memory when I stopped

1758
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,519
using it or had worse access to it in

1759
01:04:49,559 --> 01:04:54,400
Florida my memory was worse than it had

1760
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:55,400
been in the last 10 years so so

1761
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,119
fascinating I couldn't remember where I

1762
01:04:55,400 --> 01:05:00,240
parked my car I couldn't remember stuff

1763
01:04:58,119 --> 01:05:01,960
that I studied hours for on a test and

1764
01:05:00,239 --> 01:05:04,759
it was like yeah there's some stress and

1765
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:07,400
other factors and things like that but I

1766
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:09,480
had stress and other factors during my

1767
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:12,880
undergrad as well and I was able to pull

1768
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:15,960
it off because I had access to Medicinal

1769
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:19,680
cannabis that made my particular system

1770
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:21,119
function and so I loved like like I said

1771
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:22,199
going back to that blue dream I love

1772
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:25,039
that strain so much it was the first one

1773
01:05:22,199 --> 01:05:27,118
I had to grow and I loved it even though

1774
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:29,039
people online and oh this looks like

1775
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:30,720
[ __ ] you should kill it and you don't

1776
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:32,039
know what the [ __ ] you're doing I'm like

1777
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:33,078
I've been around can of gr for a long

1778
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:34,760
time like I kind of do know what I'm

1779
01:05:33,079 --> 01:05:36,039
doing but I just I messed up and I'm

1780
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:39,039
going to see it through I'm going to

1781
01:05:36,039 --> 01:05:40,000
learn from these mistakes cuz uh my

1782
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:41,079
brother and I were just talking about

1783
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,239
this

1784
01:05:41,079 --> 01:05:48,359
but there's you could read a dozen books

1785
01:05:45,239 --> 01:05:50,519
about how to make a table you know if

1786
01:05:48,358 --> 01:05:52,519
you want to build a table constructed by

1787
01:05:50,519 --> 01:05:53,920
your hand you could write a dozen books

1788
01:05:52,519 --> 01:05:55,920
and you're going to pick up tips tricks

1789
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:58,119
helpful tools that will will make

1790
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:59,920
building a table easier but the first

1791
01:05:58,119 --> 01:06:01,400
time you build that table you're going

1792
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,798
to find out there's a tool that you

1793
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:07,000
don't have and you're going to find out

1794
01:06:03,798 --> 01:06:10,038
oh man I even though it said measure

1795
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:12,519
twice cut once I read that but I didn't

1796
01:06:10,039 --> 01:06:16,200
feel the experience of not doing it so

1797
01:06:12,519 --> 01:06:18,759
when you just said okay it's 24 in and

1798
01:06:16,199 --> 01:06:20,919
you cut four 24 in legs and you didn't

1799
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:23,760
measure twice and cut once you know like

1800
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:26,480
you just cut once and measured once well

1801
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:28,720
one of those 24in legs is actually 24.25

1802
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,798
in and now you've got a wobbly ass table

1803
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:32,798
so you just learned something from that

1804
01:06:29,798 --> 01:06:34,719
experience and until you actually do it

1805
01:06:32,798 --> 01:06:37,159
anything any hobby your experience in

1806
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:40,000
life the experience is going to teach

1807
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:43,558
you as much as any podcast will as any

1808
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,199
book will or any YouTube video will and

1809
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:47,400
that's just the unfortunate reality is

1810
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:49,118
like I had experience but it was

1811
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:51,440
different when I grew indoor It was a

1812
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:53,960
commercial [ __ ] house that got

1813
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:56,240
renovated specifically to grow cannabis

1814
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:58,838
and they are making what I realized this

1815
01:06:56,239 --> 01:07:00,479
millions of dollars a year I was getting

1816
01:06:58,838 --> 01:07:03,119
[ __ ] basically paid nothing or trim

1817
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:05,119
like gas money oh man just looking back

1818
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:07,519
just like I can't even believe how much

1819
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:08,640
money they I I knew what it was selling

1820
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:10,480
for and I knew how many pounds we were

1821
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:13,318
breaking down I just never actually did

1822
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:15,159
the math on like sure you know five six

1823
01:07:13,318 --> 01:07:17,079
crops a year at this many pounds like

1824
01:07:15,159 --> 01:07:20,639
wow wow they were making a lot of

1825
01:07:17,079 --> 01:07:22,240
[ __ ] money but uh yeah it's uh I

1826
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:23,318
never was in it that was the thing I was

1827
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:25,639
always in it for the passion I always

1828
01:07:23,318 --> 01:07:28,960
just loved smoking cannabis I loved good

1829
01:07:25,639 --> 01:07:30,519
cannabis and whether it was my you know

1830
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,519
one of my girlfriends I dated in Middle

1831
01:07:30,519 --> 01:07:35,119
School her older brother would drive to

1832
01:07:32,519 --> 01:07:37,400
California in a bus or van and he'd get

1833
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:39,079
10 pounds at a time and we would always

1834
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:40,639
pick up from him right when he got back

1835
01:07:39,079 --> 01:07:42,519
because it was actually from California

1836
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:45,519
and like we knew the guy who did it and

1837
01:07:42,519 --> 01:07:47,239
like yeah it was almost like I I was

1838
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:48,400
just on the end because I dated that

1839
01:07:47,239 --> 01:07:49,639
girl and I didn't date her because of

1840
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,920
that I just happened to find that out

1841
01:07:49,639 --> 01:07:53,239
after the fact and it was like an

1842
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:54,639
awesome benefactor to like get access to

1843
01:07:53,239 --> 01:07:56,078
some of this [ __ ] that was better than

1844
01:07:54,639 --> 01:07:58,920
what we had around stuff that came in

1845
01:07:56,079 --> 01:08:01,160
from Michigan just being exposed to good

1846
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:03,240
like even if I only had 20 bucks I'd

1847
01:08:01,159 --> 01:08:07,199
rather get like a gram of good stuff

1848
01:08:03,239 --> 01:08:09,199
than like a quarter of uh you know Brown

1849
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:11,078
pack Mexican which was like the option

1850
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:13,159
for me at the time my buddy's like I got

1851
01:08:11,079 --> 01:08:15,240
a quarter for a quarter I was like what

1852
01:08:13,159 --> 01:08:17,318
does that mean quarter ounce for $25 I

1853
01:08:15,239 --> 01:08:18,358
was like I don't know if I want that I

1854
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:20,440
know I don't want that actually showed

1855
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:22,319
it to me I was like no I don't but you

1856
01:08:20,439 --> 01:08:24,000
can make this into five six blunts I was

1857
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:27,520
like I'm not smoking blunts I'm smoking

1858
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,960
bong balls you know and so it's a a

1859
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,120
difference in in a thought process there

1860
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,920
I guess and some people do just enjoy

1861
01:08:30,119 --> 01:08:33,198
the smoking process want to Smoke Joint

1862
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,798
after joint blunt after blunt and like

1863
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:37,678
there's a place I think for lower

1864
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:38,880
potency cannabis maybe but um I think

1865
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:41,520
that's like the Bud Lights right and

1866
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:43,759
then there's the craft beers yeah

1867
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:46,799
absolutely I I agree with that

1868
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:49,798
wholeheartedly um it it does seem like

1869
01:08:46,798 --> 01:08:52,119
uh for for it it and I think it depends

1870
01:08:49,798 --> 01:08:54,278
on like where you are mentally like with

1871
01:08:52,119 --> 01:08:55,439
what you're trying to um accomplish with

1872
01:08:54,279 --> 01:08:57,120
your smoking whether it be something

1873
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:59,318
something that's like a social thing

1874
01:08:57,119 --> 01:09:01,119
where you are sharing amongst people but

1875
01:08:59,319 --> 01:09:04,239
you then kind of want to either keep a

1876
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:06,719
little bit of a more uh Lucid mindset

1877
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:10,519
about you so that you can converse and

1878
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:12,158
talk and uh you know be social um

1879
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:14,440
whereas like cuz sometimes if I smoke

1880
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:16,198
something that's heavy I am not wanting

1881
01:09:14,439 --> 01:09:19,399
to be social I kind of want to just go

1882
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:21,039
curl up in a corner uh or go like play

1883
01:09:19,399 --> 01:09:23,599
some video games or something because

1884
01:09:21,039 --> 01:09:27,238
it's just like I just need to check out

1885
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:30,880
right now and um like enjoy my own mind

1886
01:09:27,238 --> 01:09:32,158
mental set um so I yeah it's like a

1887
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,838
almost like a time and place for

1888
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:36,000
everything and

1889
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:38,119
cannabis you know even as you had said

1890
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:41,798
earlier in the podcast there's so many

1891
01:09:38,119 --> 01:09:45,599
different available varieties now that

1892
01:09:41,798 --> 01:09:47,960
all have extremely unique effects and

1893
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:50,039
because everybody's endoc canabo system

1894
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:52,520
is going to be unique to them as well

1895
01:09:50,039 --> 01:09:54,960
and um you know the mindset going into

1896
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:57,480
smoking I feel has a heavy effect on the

1897
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:59,480
results that you have like it's almost

1898
01:09:57,479 --> 01:10:01,079
like every single smoking experience is

1899
01:09:59,479 --> 01:10:03,119
going to be different for every person

1900
01:10:01,079 --> 01:10:06,000
with every strain that they smoke and

1901
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:07,880
like you said with form cut cookies

1902
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:12,600
finding something that works really well

1903
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:15,840
for a specific uh remedy uh pain relief

1904
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:17,480
mental relief um arthritis you know all

1905
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:19,960
these different like you know getting to

1906
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:21,479
have a a more freedom of movement with

1907
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:23,840
different parts of your body even like

1908
01:10:21,479 --> 01:10:25,319
you said though set and setting just

1909
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,640
like yeah set and setting they can

1910
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:28,479
consider that and all these other from

1911
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,640
mushrooms to acid and things like that

1912
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:32,879
they'll always talk about set and

1913
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:34,440
setting because with a more power quote

1914
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:37,960
unquote more powerful substance some

1915
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:39,559
people think um they'll have maybe a

1916
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:42,158
higher respect for it but I think

1917
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:44,280
cannabis is a substance that alters your

1918
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:46,479
mind a bit um I've seen it categorized

1919
01:10:44,279 --> 01:10:49,319
as a mild hallucinogen I've seen it

1920
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:51,439
categorized as a stimulant uh I don't

1921
01:10:49,319 --> 01:10:52,759
think it's actually a depressant but it

1922
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:54,759
does make people relax I don't know if

1923
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:56,520
it's been documented to actually drop

1924
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:58,760
your heart rate cuz it typically I think

1925
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:01,320
it's more of a techy card

1926
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:04,440
or yeah most people's heart rate gets

1927
01:11:01,319 --> 01:11:06,639
increase so even if you feel tired or

1928
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:09,719
like pass out like your heart rate is

1929
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:12,360
probably slightly increased so um it's

1930
01:11:09,719 --> 01:11:14,399
anes caffeine that I feel like set and

1931
01:11:12,359 --> 01:11:16,679
setting on caffeine is even important

1932
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:19,119
like um and intention like you said like

1933
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:21,920
what you want out of it like I drank a

1934
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:25,039
espresso at dinner one night and I'm not

1935
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:26,800
a caffeine person but um I got away with

1936
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:28,479
like a single shot of espresso knowing

1937
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:30,920
like I'm going to just this is I was

1938
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:33,000
tired I would be crabby and like not as

1939
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:35,039
uh enjoyable of a conversation with like

1940
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,960
my friends that I hadn't seen in a while

1941
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:38,600
and my wife so I'm like I want to be

1942
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:41,039
able to be like alert and Lucid during

1943
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:43,079
this conversation so had the espresso

1944
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:44,519
was able to enjoy my dinner drive home

1945
01:11:43,079 --> 01:11:47,279
and by the time like all that was said

1946
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:48,600
and done I had burnt off whatever energy

1947
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:51,279
it had given me you know and like I was

1948
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:54,000
able to sleep just fine where um

1949
01:11:51,279 --> 01:11:55,840
sometimes like if I'm like oh I need to

1950
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,000
get a project like when I was in college

1951
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:00,480
take a 5our energy or drink a Red Bull

1952
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,679
or energy drink or something and I'd get

1953
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:04,359
the paper done but then I'd be up all

1954
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:05,920
night and it's like my intention was to

1955
01:12:04,359 --> 01:12:07,319
get something done I didn't have like

1956
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,560
the kind of followup of like am I going

1957
01:12:07,319 --> 01:12:09,840
to be able to sleep tonight after this

1958
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:12,920
because I was like I just all I cared

1959
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:15,679
about was a deadline and so having more

1960
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:19,840
thoughtfulness to it mindfulness in the

1961
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:22,279
use is uh important because I think uh a

1962
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:24,800
lot of people and myself as well like

1963
01:12:22,279 --> 01:12:27,880
can take for granted this is a a

1964
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,960
powerful tool you know it's um the stuff

1965
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:30,960
that I'll use like daily just in the

1966
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:33,399
morning to like limit pain and to help

1967
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:36,399
me relax and things like that

1968
01:12:33,399 --> 01:12:38,479
um there's certain things that will be

1969
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:39,879
too strong and like I Could lack like

1970
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:41,839
you're saying like if I wanted to go to

1971
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:43,719
a social setting not be able to converse

1972
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:45,760
as well and like I know a lot of people

1973
01:12:43,719 --> 01:12:47,520
even like within a circle like we'll all

1974
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,960
be talking passing around the joint and

1975
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:50,760
like certain people get to a certain

1976
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,198
spot and they're high where they just

1977
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,600
clam up they don't say anything they're

1978
01:12:52,198 --> 01:12:55,678
like silent you know and like I don't

1979
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:56,880
think it's they're not trying to it's

1980
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:58,560
just like there's so much going on in

1981
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:00,400
their own head whether they're like

1982
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:02,159
paranoid about not saying something to

1983
01:13:00,399 --> 01:13:03,839
you know embarrass thems or whether

1984
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:05,079
they're just thinking about other stuff

1985
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,520
that's not even happening there in the

1986
01:13:05,079 --> 01:13:08,479
moment or they're just analyzing you

1987
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:10,400
know sitting chilling and enjoying like

1988
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:11,839
I'm a BL mouth sometimes I'll chitchat

1989
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:14,079
but there's times where certain strains

1990
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:16,840
will shut me up I'm just like yeah very

1991
01:13:14,079 --> 01:13:18,679
contemplative and almost meditating like

1992
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:21,119
within there's more than just closing

1993
01:13:18,679 --> 01:13:23,440
our eyes and um crossing our fingers and

1994
01:13:21,119 --> 01:13:24,880
our feet and uh a lot of people think

1995
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:26,799
meditation is just one thing there's so

1996
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,639
many different types there's movement

1997
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,159
meditations and things like that so I

1998
01:13:28,639 --> 01:13:31,840
think using cannabis even like the

1999
01:13:30,158 --> 01:13:33,279
breathing that's why I think a lot of

2000
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:35,319
people enjoy the bong like deep breaths

2001
01:13:33,279 --> 01:13:36,880
in deep breaths out I think that's a

2002
01:13:35,319 --> 01:13:40,759
almost a meditation in

2003
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:42,199
itself absolutely I um yeah I agree

2004
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:44,480
wholeheartedly with everything that you

2005
01:13:42,198 --> 01:13:46,599
said that's that's a great way to put it

2006
01:13:44,479 --> 01:13:49,399
um so uh you know back back to the

2007
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:51,760
growing though so you were growing these

2008
01:13:49,399 --> 01:13:55,638
giant blue dreams that completely

2009
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:57,360
outgrew your space uh and um

2010
01:13:55,639 --> 01:14:00,520
you know by no fault of your own you

2011
01:13:57,359 --> 01:14:02,158
wanted to grow your favorite strain and

2012
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:05,280
uh and and just do that at home so you

2013
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:06,920
had access to the medicine and if i' if

2014
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:09,238
I'm correct me if I'm wrong but I

2015
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:11,119
believe I heard uh from you in other

2016
01:14:09,238 --> 01:14:15,079
shows that the nutrients you were using

2017
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:16,719
were like heavy 16 at the time um and so

2018
01:14:15,079 --> 01:14:19,719
you know like mixing up all those

2019
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:24,079
different uh bottles together uh as a

2020
01:14:19,719 --> 01:14:25,800
liquid form um like what what got you to

2021
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:28,279
like how how did you like the results of

2022
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:30,880
that um kind of what was your mindset

2023
01:14:28,279 --> 01:14:34,639
around it and then when did you

2024
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:38,679
transition from that into a more

2025
01:14:34,639 --> 01:14:41,600
um uh amended soiless uh

2026
01:14:38,679 --> 01:14:43,119
media so I was using heavy 16 and

2027
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:45,199
initially from the start I think I just

2028
01:14:43,119 --> 01:14:47,760
used like the ab cuz uh I was a cheap

2029
01:14:45,198 --> 01:14:49,759
home grower I got the tent got the light

2030
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:51,000
slowly built out like got a fan and then

2031
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:53,400
realized I needed two then three then

2032
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,920
four then however many and um built out

2033
01:14:53,399 --> 01:14:57,079
of edge space eventually and um um I

2034
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,520
kind of did one thing at a time and it

2035
01:14:57,079 --> 01:15:00,039
was like I had the ab and then like I

2036
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:02,159
was like oh what's the next talking to

2037
01:15:00,039 --> 01:15:03,158
my and granted he worked for the hydro

2038
01:15:02,158 --> 01:15:05,158
stop and he was probably getting a

2039
01:15:03,158 --> 01:15:06,359
little cut on these sailes but I I'd go

2040
01:15:05,158 --> 01:15:08,079
over to his place and like check out his

2041
01:15:06,359 --> 01:15:09,639
grow and he had all these bottles at his

2042
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:11,198
place like what does this one do on it

2043
01:15:09,639 --> 01:15:14,359
smell it like a lot of their stuff is

2044
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:16,678
like unlicensed organic like they're the

2045
01:15:14,359 --> 01:15:18,238
ab is like a regular hydro line but like

2046
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:19,760
all of the side additives are like

2047
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:21,399
organic kind of inputs like you could

2048
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,880
really smell it with like the I think it

2049
01:15:21,399 --> 01:15:25,279
was like the prime or the fire one of

2050
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:27,319
them was really humiy kind of a but all

2051
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:30,439
the additives I always felt like were

2052
01:15:27,319 --> 01:15:31,679
worth it because um I noticed when I

2053
01:15:30,439 --> 01:15:33,198
would run out of a bottle or whatever

2054
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:34,679
didn't use it like the plants didn't

2055
01:15:33,198 --> 01:15:37,479
smell or taste as good or didn't grow as

2056
01:15:34,679 --> 01:15:39,359
well and um so I'd always kind of cough

2057
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:41,198
up it was a little expensive admittedly

2058
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:43,359
it was like a premier line but I do

2059
01:15:41,198 --> 01:15:44,919
think they did a good job and um I still

2060
01:15:43,359 --> 01:15:46,479
actually have cocoa and the whole

2061
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:47,960
nutrient line so if I ever wanted to

2062
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:51,279
like for whatever reason do a side by

2063
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:53,319
side I could and um the very next grow I

2064
01:15:51,279 --> 01:15:55,039
actually found more success by instead

2065
01:15:53,319 --> 01:15:57,519
of going in three gallon pots to finish

2066
01:15:55,039 --> 01:15:58,639
I did a bunch of uh one gallon pots

2067
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,320
that's actually when I had the Great

2068
01:15:58,639 --> 01:16:01,960
White Buffalo grow when I grew the sour

2069
01:16:00,319 --> 01:16:04,920
76 and I also grew a tester called

2070
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:08,800
Platinum Yeti um it was like a platinum

2071
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:10,639
headband cross but um it like F3 which

2072
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:13,279
also got me into like oh what's this

2073
01:16:10,639 --> 01:16:15,920
whole F2 F3 kind of generational thing

2074
01:16:13,279 --> 01:16:19,279
all about and um that grow went really

2075
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:21,800
well I had five plants three sour 76s

2076
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:23,519
and two Platinum Yeti when I just had

2077
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:25,159
two plants in the same space and I got a

2078
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:27,800
shot at my buddy Dave from Ohio C Crazy

2079
01:16:25,158 --> 01:16:30,119
Dave and um he was like why don't you do

2080
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:32,520
like a sea of green and I actually

2081
01:16:30,119 --> 01:16:34,439
hadn't necessarily seen that in my

2082
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:36,159
experience at this point I wasn't like

2083
01:16:34,439 --> 01:16:38,359
cruising forums and [ __ ] regularly like

2084
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:39,879
I didn't even realize because where I

2085
01:16:38,359 --> 01:16:41,359
was at in Ohio it was so secretive like

2086
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:42,760
don't tell anybody you're doing this

2087
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:46,880
don't talk about it blah blah blah don't

2088
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:48,199
take photos um so finding out that there

2089
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,719
was like a space online where like

2090
01:16:48,198 --> 01:16:51,559
people are just like posting their grows

2091
01:16:49,719 --> 01:16:53,760
asking for advice giving advice getting

2092
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:55,080
advice was kind of new to me and I I

2093
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,719
looked up Steve Green cuz I didn't know

2094
01:16:55,079 --> 01:16:59,920
it was he kind of had more of a s green

2095
01:16:57,719 --> 01:17:01,158
setup but it wasn't quite like tiny tiny

2096
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:03,239
pots like he was doing a bunch of

2097
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:04,638
smaller plants I was like damn dude

2098
01:17:03,238 --> 01:17:06,718
you're like having a ton of success like

2099
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:08,679
I'm going to try that style so I did it

2100
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:10,359
worked and um they're all between like

2101
01:17:08,679 --> 01:17:11,719
one and 2 feet tall and got between like

2102
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:13,279
1 and 2 ounces or whatever so it wasn't

2103
01:17:11,719 --> 01:17:14,679
like a crazy huge Harvest I kind of went

2104
01:17:13,279 --> 01:17:16,759
like heavy on like a schwaz technique

2105
01:17:14,679 --> 01:17:19,399
that I saw and I was trying to emulate

2106
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:20,800
um this grow buckets guy or whatever the

2107
01:17:19,399 --> 01:17:23,198
main lining method where you get like

2108
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,400
eight or like 16 colas and you basically

2109
01:17:23,198 --> 01:17:27,359
take off everything except for like the

2110
01:17:24,399 --> 01:17:28,799
main uh colas or whatever and um

2111
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:30,920
admittedly the bud turned out great I

2112
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,400
just didn't get a whole lot of it and uh

2113
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:34,679
I learned you know you don't necessarily

2114
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:35,920
have to go that extreme with it but um

2115
01:17:34,679 --> 01:17:39,039
that was another successful grow in the

2116
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:41,520
Coco and what I realized was it was

2117
01:17:39,039 --> 01:17:44,158
taking a lot of time to pipet out the

2118
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:47,480
nutrients mix them up pH do this and

2119
01:17:44,158 --> 01:17:49,638
that and make sure that I was using uh

2120
01:17:47,479 --> 01:17:52,559
even like we have pretty clean water

2121
01:17:49,639 --> 01:17:54,840
where I'm at and not on wood because you

2122
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:57,000
never know that you can change um but

2123
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:58,199
but even then I go and get my own

2124
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,800
personal water for my wife and I had a

2125
01:17:58,198 --> 01:18:02,399
drink so I don't mind lugging 5 gallon

2126
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:04,039
jugs like I carry two of them all the

2127
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:08,359
time and I fill them up and I bring them

2128
01:18:04,039 --> 01:18:09,960
home well there's my cat but uh the

2129
01:18:08,359 --> 01:18:11,559
water that I was using was just like you

2130
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:12,920
know you go to the store and you put it

2131
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:15,000
under the thing and whatever you get the

2132
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:16,399
clean water with as close to zero PPM as

2133
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:20,039
possible and it's filtered a whole bunch

2134
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:21,759
of different ways so I was using that

2135
01:18:20,039 --> 01:18:25,000
and feeling like I needed to use that

2136
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:26,719
for um the heavy 16 because when I

2137
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,279
didn't I felt like again like you could

2138
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:30,800
kind of see like maybe the plants didn't

2139
01:18:28,279 --> 01:18:32,479
uptake the nutrients as well or like the

2140
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:34,600
I didn't even know at the time because I

2141
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:36,919
hadn't met Dr MJ and like I didn't even

2142
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:38,800
use a PPM meter I was just like feed

2143
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:41,359
feed water feed feed water feed water

2144
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:43,920
feed or like give it a compos here and

2145
01:18:41,359 --> 01:18:46,000
there so I knew that PPM meters and EC

2146
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,639
meters existed and I had like that blue

2147
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,039
lab trench on but when I looked up like

2148
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:50,600
the hom grower scale of it it was like

2149
01:18:49,039 --> 01:18:51,760
so expensive and I didn't trust the ones

2150
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:53,440
on Amazon I was like if I'm going to get

2151
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:55,039
one it's going to be like a blue lab I'm

2152
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:56,359
like man that's like 100 bucks or

2153
01:18:55,039 --> 01:18:57,760
something and I was like [ __ ] that's

2154
01:18:56,359 --> 01:18:59,039
like as much as like my tent you know

2155
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:01,320
like I don't want to spend that kind of

2156
01:18:59,039 --> 01:19:02,519
money uh I was just starting my business

2157
01:19:01,319 --> 01:19:04,679
at the time I just moved back here and

2158
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:07,280
like I it's tough to you know make a

2159
01:19:04,679 --> 01:19:10,880
living here most businesses shutter in

2160
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:12,800
like a year so uh it's it's tough to

2161
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:15,760
make it happen and on top of that to be

2162
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:17,920
grow on your own but ultimately I

2163
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:20,079
realized if you do produce your own

2164
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:21,840
successfully it's cheaper cost per gram

2165
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:23,359
by a lot and especially because like my

2166
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:26,279
wife and I were going through at least 2

2167
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:28,119
ounces a week and or 2 ounces every two

2168
01:19:26,279 --> 01:19:30,880
weeks I think it was so like an ounce a

2169
01:19:28,119 --> 01:19:33,679
week um and I was like if I could grow

2170
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:35,239
this and electrical cost even what it is

2171
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:36,639
I could probably save a bunch of money

2172
01:19:35,238 --> 01:19:38,439
and I went through and documented

2173
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:39,719
everything and those first few grows and

2174
01:19:38,439 --> 01:19:41,839
realized like holy [ __ ] like I'm growing

2175
01:19:39,719 --> 01:19:43,920
it for like x amount of dollars per gram

2176
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:46,119
like versus if it's 10 a gram to buy it

2177
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:47,880
I was growing it for like1 two or $3 at

2178
01:19:46,119 --> 01:19:49,399
the very worst and like that was only

2179
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,639
going down cuz like a lot of one time

2180
01:19:49,399 --> 01:19:53,599
purchasers bought the light bought the

2181
01:19:50,639 --> 01:19:55,480
tent had all the stuff and nutrients

2182
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:57,400
were a recurring cost or whatever but

2183
01:19:55,479 --> 01:19:58,959
like that was only once every several

2184
01:19:57,399 --> 01:20:02,319
months or year depending on how much you

2185
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:04,719
buy and so I did notice that was one of

2186
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:06,519
my bigger costs and I did not like as

2187
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:07,960
you see I do have a cat over here behind

2188
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:09,760
me and I have a little green screen kind

2189
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:11,399
of situation going on but just so you

2190
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:15,520
don't see all the random [ __ ] occurring

2191
01:20:11,399 --> 01:20:17,319
behind me but um what I realized is like

2192
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:19,199
I didn't like the process of like what

2193
01:20:17,319 --> 01:20:20,960
felt like I'm not a chemist I don't work

2194
01:20:19,198 --> 01:20:22,198
in that kind of space I'm not in the lab

2195
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:24,359
I don't work with

2196
01:20:22,198 --> 01:20:26,158
chemicals I don't know which one of them

2197
01:20:24,359 --> 01:20:28,880
are dangerous to me and which one of

2198
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:29,920
them isn't dangerous to me if I spill it

2199
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,800
I know like you're supposed to I could

2200
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:34,000
read the directions it's all tiny little

2201
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:35,199
print in an emergency situation I'll

2202
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,399
admit I didn't read every single little

2203
01:20:35,198 --> 01:20:37,919
warning on the side of those things I

2204
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:39,158
just was excited to grow i' squirt it

2205
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:41,399
all out

2206
01:20:39,158 --> 01:20:42,679
and I I would worry if I ever spilled it

2207
01:20:41,399 --> 01:20:44,359
or got it on my hands I'd wash real

2208
01:20:42,679 --> 01:20:46,000
diligently and like I know some of that

2209
01:20:44,359 --> 01:20:47,799
stuff can actually cause harm so I

2210
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,319
didn't want it on or around me

2211
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:50,360
necessarily not say it's like the end of

2212
01:20:49,319 --> 01:20:52,840
the world people work with it all the

2213
01:20:50,359 --> 01:20:55,279
time right but um I figured if there was

2214
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:56,639
a safer and easier solution out there

2215
01:20:55,279 --> 01:20:59,800
and I'd already done it kind of in the

2216
01:20:56,639 --> 01:21:03,440
past with Organics why not try it inside

2217
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:05,199
and so I had heard about subcool looked

2218
01:21:03,439 --> 01:21:07,479
more into his stuff I'd been smoking his

2219
01:21:05,198 --> 01:21:09,279
stuff even before I started growing um

2220
01:21:07,479 --> 01:21:10,638
so I was like oh this dude has like an

2221
01:21:09,279 --> 01:21:12,719
Instagram and a YouTube and he just like

2222
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:14,600
shows his grow and he has a super soil

2223
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:18,639
and so I didn't actually start off with

2224
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:20,280
the super soil um I ended up seeming

2225
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:22,560
simpler to me than doing like the

2226
01:21:20,279 --> 01:21:23,880
Lasagna Tech was I found a bunch of

2227
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:26,120
people in the Michigan Community doing

2228
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:27,920
the M3 and there was also a breeder who

2229
01:21:26,119 --> 01:21:29,920
I thought at the time was cool and found

2230
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:32,158
out later he's a real dag so I'm not

2231
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:33,800
going to even name them but they were

2232
01:21:32,158 --> 01:21:37,079
claiming really good results with this

2233
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:38,360
M3 Michigan made mix and so I ordered a

2234
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:39,399
bag and I was like you know what [ __ ] it

2235
01:21:38,359 --> 01:21:41,719
it's not local at least it's from

2236
01:21:39,399 --> 01:21:44,359
America and uh so like they shipped me a

2237
01:21:41,719 --> 01:21:46,520
bag of soil or whatever and I tried it

2238
01:21:44,359 --> 01:21:48,960
out and sure enough it worked damn well

2239
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:51,440
and it was simple I just water only ran

2240
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:53,800
it through and I was like I did some

2241
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:55,559
experimenting like um I start in Solo

2242
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:57,800
solo cup and I transplanted up to a 1

2243
01:21:55,560 --> 01:22:00,440
gon and then I went up to a 3 gallon or

2244
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:01,400
5 gallon and I realized like 5 gallon

2245
01:22:00,439 --> 01:22:03,039
probably did a little bit better but it

2246
01:22:01,399 --> 01:22:05,279
was so much bigger and managing the

2247
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:06,519
water situation in my small space like

2248
01:22:05,279 --> 01:22:07,599
three gallons was as big as I wanted to

2249
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:09,520
go so I think I ended up with like three

2250
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:11,280
three gallon pots of soil and I had them

2251
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:13,760
all side by side for the flower tent

2252
01:22:11,279 --> 01:22:15,158
area ultimately with that situation and

2253
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:18,800
um it worked and I liked it and

2254
01:22:15,158 --> 01:22:20,119
ultimately um realized that people were

2255
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:22,440
having a lot of success with these Earth

2256
01:22:20,119 --> 01:22:24,158
boxes I was seeing build a soil using

2257
01:22:22,439 --> 01:22:26,879
the earth box and I saw Spartan grown

2258
01:22:24,158 --> 01:22:28,679
using City Pickers and um Cheddar Bob

2259
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:32,079
and others using Earth boxes and I was

2260
01:22:28,679 --> 01:22:33,520
like man like these pots are all laid

2261
01:22:32,079 --> 01:22:35,198
right next to each other like one next

2262
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:37,480
to the other next to the other I'm like

2263
01:22:35,198 --> 01:22:39,479
I could basically just use an earth box

2264
01:22:37,479 --> 01:22:42,039
and that would be a little bit more

2265
01:22:39,479 --> 01:22:44,799
volume of soil and like I see people use

2266
01:22:42,039 --> 01:22:48,039
beds so you can c-plant like at least

2267
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:49,719
two plants in there and so I got the

2268
01:22:48,039 --> 01:22:51,000
earth box and kind of have never looked

2269
01:22:49,719 --> 01:22:54,039
back that's what I've been rocking for

2270
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:56,800
the last several years now and uh I just

2271
01:22:54,039 --> 01:22:59,679
got shout out to Resurrection profit he

2272
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:01,880
just sent me a couple fresh bags of M3

2273
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:03,719
so I'm going to reset cuz my stuff I

2274
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:04,840
don't do soil testing and after a few

2275
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:07,279
years it's finally gotten to the point

2276
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:08,920
where it still produces it yields well

2277
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:10,319
it just doesn't taste as good as it did

2278
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:11,399
when I first started so there's

2279
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:13,679
something off in there that I can't

2280
01:23:11,399 --> 01:23:15,960
quite figure out and I think it probably

2281
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:17,199
over amended over the each Crow just

2282
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:18,639
gave a little too much a little too much

2283
01:23:17,198 --> 01:23:21,678
a little too much and at this point it's

2284
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:24,560
probably just like toxically high and so

2285
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:26,679
I'm gonna scrap that mix it with some um

2286
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:28,120
like potting soil and and garden soil

2287
01:23:26,679 --> 01:23:30,359
and use that for outdoor plants and

2288
01:23:28,119 --> 01:23:32,479
stuff and maybe even turn it into like a

2289
01:23:30,359 --> 01:23:34,079
compost slw worm bin depending on my

2290
01:23:32,479 --> 01:23:35,879
situation but my wife is not fond of the

2291
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:37,439
worm bin idea so happy wife happy life

2292
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:40,199
it'll probably just be a outdoor plant

2293
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:42,559
situation grow some like sunflowers and

2294
01:23:40,198 --> 01:23:46,759
uh Holly Hawks and other cool stuff

2295
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:49,440
outside nice yeah I um I love the idea

2296
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:51,719
of being able to use like an amended

2297
01:23:49,439 --> 01:23:53,960
substrate where you're just re amending

2298
01:23:51,719 --> 01:23:55,520
it and getting multiple rounds of

2299
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:57,960
harvests out of it I did that for a

2300
01:23:55,520 --> 01:24:00,480
while in like a 30 gallon Grassroots

2301
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:02,560
fabric pot I think I was able to pull

2302
01:24:00,479 --> 01:24:05,359
like seven harvests out of it with just

2303
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:08,239
minimal amendments over time but then um

2304
01:24:05,359 --> 01:24:11,639
unfortunately I I ran into rud aphids

2305
01:24:08,238 --> 01:24:14,158
and um I just scrapped the soil because

2306
01:24:11,639 --> 01:24:17,279
uh well I I composted it so that it the

2307
01:24:14,158 --> 01:24:19,039
thermophilic um uh process just

2308
01:24:17,279 --> 01:24:21,880
annihilated the root AIDS and anything

2309
01:24:19,039 --> 01:24:24,399
else that was problematic in there but I

2310
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:26,800
I that and that's like usually my big

2311
01:24:24,399 --> 01:24:28,198
biggest warning for anybody venturing

2312
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:30,239
into something that's going to be an

2313
01:24:28,198 --> 01:24:33,919
amended substrate used round after round

2314
01:24:30,238 --> 01:24:36,559
after round is um fungus knuts rud AIDS

2315
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:39,960
thrips uh anything that is going to be

2316
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:42,000
soil born um in terms of a pest you want

2317
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:44,800
to make sure that you're at least having

2318
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,760
some level of security in place to make

2319
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:49,360
sure that those populations either don't

2320
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:52,840
blow up or don't happen or um anywhere

2321
01:24:49,359 --> 01:24:54,000
in between um but also you you know you

2322
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:56,840
you even mentioned that you have the

2323
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:00,520
very easy opportunity of just resetting

2324
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:03,039
with a fresh bag of of a reputable um

2325
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:06,600
amended soilless media and going from

2326
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:08,439
there and you know I've even heard of

2327
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:12,760
people who will use like the kiss

2328
01:25:08,439 --> 01:25:14,079
Organics mix where um they just uh you

2329
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,440
know they'll only run it three or four

2330
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:17,238
times and then they'll reset it because

2331
01:25:15,439 --> 01:25:19,118
they're just like by the time the fifth

2332
01:25:17,238 --> 01:25:21,319
or sixth gets around I'm I'm losing my

2333
01:25:19,118 --> 01:25:23,479
tpine profiles of the same cultivars I'm

2334
01:25:21,319 --> 01:25:27,198
running I'm losing the resin production

2335
01:25:23,479 --> 01:25:30,319
the yield is significantly less um even

2336
01:25:27,198 --> 01:25:32,079
if everything else is met uh and even if

2337
01:25:30,319 --> 01:25:34,319
I've seen some people do the saturated

2338
01:25:32,079 --> 01:25:35,679
past Pace test and see that they're at

2339
01:25:34,319 --> 01:25:37,639
the same level as they were with the

2340
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:42,199
initial substrate but something's

2341
01:25:37,639 --> 01:25:44,319
happened there's some uh biology or uh

2342
01:25:42,198 --> 01:25:46,279
it's hard to know there's so much going

2343
01:25:44,319 --> 01:25:48,799
on in there that like my stuff still

2344
01:25:46,279 --> 01:25:50,599
yielding great it just doesn't tastes as

2345
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:52,440
good as it should and I know that I'm

2346
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:54,719
honest enough to tell myself like we're

2347
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:56,919
smoking some of the my other Buddies

2348
01:25:54,719 --> 01:26:00,560
stuff that they grow or even stuff that

2349
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:01,960
like from my wife's work that I'd rather

2350
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:03,960
have over home grow and that was just

2351
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:05,279
never the case before it was always i'

2352
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:07,960
rather have my home grow over any

2353
01:26:05,279 --> 01:26:09,439
commercial stuff and when that's not the

2354
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:11,840
case anymore it's like well I got to

2355
01:26:09,439 --> 01:26:13,479
admit my stuff is not as good as it once

2356
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:15,880
was and there's something wrong with my

2357
01:26:13,479 --> 01:26:18,279
process and at least be humble enough to

2358
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:20,159
admit you know that it probably is the

2359
01:26:18,279 --> 01:26:22,399
soil like there's I'm doing everything

2360
01:26:20,158 --> 01:26:24,479
else the same for the most part and um

2361
01:26:22,399 --> 01:26:25,559
not too much has changed I could of

2362
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:27,000
strain here and there but like sometimes

2363
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:28,080
it's stuff that I like you said you've

2364
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,920
grown it in the past and it was just

2365
01:26:28,079 --> 01:26:32,198
fine and it tasted how it's supposed to

2366
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:34,800
taste and now it's like when it's not

2367
01:26:32,198 --> 01:26:37,158
that way anymore well time to you know

2368
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:38,679
reset and I think admittedly I think if

2369
01:26:37,158 --> 01:26:40,679
you even get two runs out of a soil

2370
01:26:38,679 --> 01:26:42,880
you've probably more than uh gotten your

2371
01:26:40,679 --> 01:26:44,679
value out of it because you know even

2372
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:46,560
with cannabis down at like 1,000 a pound

2373
01:26:44,679 --> 01:26:49,399
I think is what the average is in

2374
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:51,480
California roughly it'ser even lower

2375
01:26:49,399 --> 01:26:55,439
depending on in in the legal Market I

2376
01:26:51,479 --> 01:26:57,638
should say um but the um

2377
01:26:55,439 --> 01:27:00,479
the trim you can get for like 20 50 I

2378
01:26:57,639 --> 01:27:01,719
don't know it's crazy low but um it's

2379
01:27:00,479 --> 01:27:03,638
fascinating depending on like the

2380
01:27:01,719 --> 01:27:06,920
quality and and like indoor outdoor

2381
01:27:03,639 --> 01:27:08,440
Greenhouse type thing um but even if

2382
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:11,000
just a th000 a pound being like the

2383
01:27:08,439 --> 01:27:12,399
reference metric I guess is um it's

2384
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,719
probably lower than that it will

2385
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:19,238
continue to get lower um even if it cost

2386
01:27:15,719 --> 01:27:23,600
you more to grow it yourself than it did

2387
01:27:19,238 --> 01:27:25,359
to um you know buy it I think it's still

2388
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:28,039
worth it it's just like the home Brewers

2389
01:27:25,359 --> 01:27:29,679
Market the craft you know Beer Market

2390
01:27:28,039 --> 01:27:31,238
whatever it is they're going to be a

2391
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:33,840
little bit more expensive and obviously

2392
01:27:31,238 --> 01:27:36,158
smaller batch and with that comes higher

2393
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:37,760
cost of production but it's worth it

2394
01:27:36,158 --> 01:27:40,879
because we have that passion and the

2395
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:42,800
main thing is there's just no way to

2396
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:46,279
produce what we're able to produce at

2397
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:49,719
scale I've never seen it done at even

2398
01:27:46,279 --> 01:27:51,559
the best of the bests um and like when

2399
01:27:49,719 --> 01:27:55,800
I'm saying scale I'm talking like

2400
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:58,600
hectars like several C scale I'm not

2401
01:27:55,800 --> 01:28:03,279
talking like an indoor production or 100

2402
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:07,239
lights or you know even a, lights like

2403
01:28:03,279 --> 01:28:10,158
that's you could do semi craft level or

2404
01:28:07,238 --> 01:28:11,919
high quality cannabis and those 1,000

2405
01:28:10,158 --> 01:28:14,519
lights and under depending on how big

2406
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:15,960
your team is and how good your team is

2407
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:18,520
but when you start getting into acres

2408
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:20,319
and Acres of so much that's hard area

2409
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:22,679
underglass to have the quality that I

2410
01:28:20,319 --> 01:28:24,880
can produce in my little and going back

2411
01:28:22,679 --> 01:28:27,239
to like the it's funny because in my

2412
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:30,359
head I saw like when I started like what

2413
01:28:27,238 --> 01:28:32,599
I thought was the best it was like the

2414
01:28:30,359 --> 01:28:34,479
whole if if you could dream as a

2415
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:36,280
cannabis carer like you dedicate a whole

2416
01:28:34,479 --> 01:28:39,799
house to it right and just spare no cost

2417
01:28:36,279 --> 01:28:43,479
on expense and things like that but um I

2418
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:47,360
just saw a report and this don't come at

2419
01:28:43,479 --> 01:28:50,759
me for racial stuff people but this was

2420
01:28:47,359 --> 01:28:52,880
documented in California 99% of indoor

2421
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:55,239
cannabis cultivation is done by Chinese

2422
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:56,480
individuals so like we were doing it

2423
01:28:55,238 --> 01:28:57,759
just how they do it like as you see all

2424
01:28:56,479 --> 01:28:59,879
these grow houses rated and it's like

2425
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:01,039
basically like an indentured servitude

2426
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:02,319
like these people owe people money and

2427
01:29:01,039 --> 01:29:04,719
they get sent over here and they have to

2428
01:29:02,319 --> 01:29:06,399
grow weed to pay off their debts type

2429
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:07,480
thing and they're like sleeping in a

2430
01:29:06,399 --> 01:29:10,759
sleeping bag and like the rest of the

2431
01:29:07,479 --> 01:29:12,118
house is plants so um you would think

2432
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:13,400
maybe in your head like oh that's the

2433
01:29:12,118 --> 01:29:15,118
ideal setup you got the most room for

2434
01:29:13,399 --> 01:29:17,238
the plants you got all the equipment all

2435
01:29:15,118 --> 01:29:19,279
the setup it's impossible for that

2436
01:29:17,238 --> 01:29:21,079
grower to tend to each one of those

2437
01:29:19,279 --> 01:29:22,800
plants as well as he needs to there's

2438
01:29:21,079 --> 01:29:24,719
too many plants even if you double

2439
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:26,679
triped quadrupled the grower

2440
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:27,920
like even at a commercial scale like

2441
01:29:26,679 --> 01:29:29,600
when there's thousands of plants or

2442
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:32,239
hundreds of plants the individual

2443
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:35,520
attention to each plant is dropped and

2444
01:29:32,238 --> 01:29:37,079
on top of that your personal choice is

2445
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:38,840
less like when you go out to the market

2446
01:29:37,079 --> 01:29:41,039
there might be 50 100 200 trains

2447
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:42,400
available thousand strains who who knows

2448
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:43,600
you could go to every single dispenser

2449
01:29:42,399 --> 01:29:46,559
in California and find a thousand or

2450
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:48,560
whatever there's 10,000 or more strains

2451
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:50,159
on the seed Market right now y you could

2452
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:51,560
go and find whatever strain you want

2453
01:29:50,158 --> 01:29:52,960
cross to whatever strain you want and if

2454
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:55,239
you can't you can probably find the cuts

2455
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:56,399
and make it yourself and like if you

2456
01:29:55,238 --> 01:29:58,238
can't you can probably find somebody

2457
01:29:56,399 --> 01:29:59,399
else who did something close to that

2458
01:29:58,238 --> 01:30:01,718
maybe like one of the parents is

2459
01:29:59,399 --> 01:30:03,759
different but even like if you can get a

2460
01:30:01,719 --> 01:30:04,960
50% something in a cross if you fenal

2461
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:08,560
hunt through that you're going to find

2462
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:10,600
something like that clone or cut or bag

2463
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:12,119
that you smoked that you liked if you

2464
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:15,000
that was how I did it and I've had tons

2465
01:30:12,118 --> 01:30:16,599
of tons of success finding exactly what

2466
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,439
I'm looking for and like you said

2467
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:20,119
popping a pack and if I don't move on to

2468
01:30:18,439 --> 01:30:22,039
the next breeder do your research

2469
01:30:20,118 --> 01:30:23,238
obviously because a lot of them are con

2470
01:30:22,039 --> 01:30:25,679
artists and fly by night they're going

2471
01:30:23,238 --> 01:30:27,839
to be gone tomorrow and they're doing

2472
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:29,719
knockoff work a lot of the time but uh

2473
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:31,480
even if they're still around like some

2474
01:30:29,719 --> 01:30:34,079
of the big ones are some of the worsts

2475
01:30:31,479 --> 01:30:36,678
so uh be aware of that but do research

2476
01:30:34,079 --> 01:30:38,039
on like who did the original um like

2477
01:30:36,679 --> 01:30:40,880
part of the reason I did 50 strains of

2478
01:30:38,039 --> 01:30:42,679
green was to basically highlight good

2479
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:44,319
old school breeders who did a lot of

2480
01:30:42,679 --> 01:30:45,679
that work to make things like we talked

2481
01:30:44,319 --> 01:30:47,158
about at the top of show kind of close

2482
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:48,679
to bulletproof or like really stable

2483
01:30:47,158 --> 01:30:50,000
where you're not going to see a Herm

2484
01:30:48,679 --> 01:30:52,039
just because it got a little hot or a

2485
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,719
little dry or a little overwat a little

2486
01:30:52,039 --> 01:30:56,960
underwater like one or two times isn't

2487
01:30:54,719 --> 01:31:00,399
going to cause it to just go you know

2488
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:02,600
where some stuff the first issue it's

2489
01:31:00,399 --> 01:31:06,238
just bananas everywhere or Chuck and

2490
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:08,000
pollen if it's a early male and so as a

2491
01:31:06,238 --> 01:31:10,238
quick sidebar do you mind just briefly

2492
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:13,479
touching on your um your work as an

2493
01:31:10,238 --> 01:31:14,759
author and and Publishing your own book

2494
01:31:13,479 --> 01:31:18,439
yeah it's been an interesting process

2495
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:20,360
for sure um I recently read or I'm

2496
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:23,479
reading a book from a self-published

2497
01:31:20,359 --> 01:31:27,238
author that goes back to the 1970s uh

2498
01:31:23,479 --> 01:31:29,638
Tom Kelly 's uh 10th Legion and uh it's

2499
01:31:27,238 --> 01:31:32,279
a really interesting book but reading

2500
01:31:29,639 --> 01:31:34,480
the back it it said I was a

2501
01:31:32,279 --> 01:31:36,118
self-published author because that meant

2502
01:31:34,479 --> 01:31:37,439
like I don't know if he said like stupid

2503
01:31:36,118 --> 01:31:40,039
enough or crazy enough I should it's in

2504
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:41,759
my car right now actively reading it but

2505
01:31:40,039 --> 01:31:44,319
um he said all that basically meant was

2506
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:46,760
like you found a publishing house that

2507
01:31:44,319 --> 01:31:49,279
was willing to charge you to like print

2508
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:50,480
your own stuff essentially like and

2509
01:31:49,279 --> 01:31:54,399
that's kind of what happened with my

2510
01:31:50,479 --> 01:31:55,759
situation is uh I wanted to make a book

2511
01:31:54,399 --> 01:31:57,559
I had heard about like the can of Bible

2512
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:59,600
and I've I've seen and own you know a

2513
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:01,719
couple of these books um subcools the

2514
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:04,280
Dank is one that I really like and the

2515
01:32:01,719 --> 01:32:07,639
Dank 2.0 where he documents the strs

2516
01:32:04,279 --> 01:32:09,519
with photos a description and you know

2517
01:32:07,639 --> 01:32:10,719
the story kind of about it and I love

2518
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:12,960
those books so much but like there's

2519
01:32:10,719 --> 01:32:14,399
only so many of them and they're not

2520
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:16,319
really making a whole bunch of new ones

2521
01:32:14,399 --> 01:32:18,799
and a lot of them were

2522
01:32:16,319 --> 01:32:20,679
like the canab for example just like a

2523
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:24,520
bunch of you know maybe like the top

2524
01:32:20,679 --> 01:32:26,520
strains of that time um but didn't have

2525
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:28,840
like a real specific focus and like I

2526
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:30,159
grew up in liking like dog breeds and

2527
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:31,560
there was so much if you look into the

2528
01:32:30,158 --> 01:32:32,879
American Kennel Club if you want to

2529
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:34,280
learn about any one of those dog breeds

2530
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,719
there's so much you can learn about it

2531
01:32:34,279 --> 01:32:37,800
like how long the tail is how long the

2532
01:32:35,719 --> 01:32:39,359
ears are the temperament all that stuff

2533
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:41,880
and I'm like this is so cool like if you

2534
01:32:39,359 --> 01:32:44,000
are into the hobby you have not endless

2535
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:45,719
but like tons and tons maybe it is

2536
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,639
endless cuz they keep making Fast

2537
01:32:45,719 --> 01:32:50,239
library though yeah and and there's a

2538
01:32:47,639 --> 01:32:52,880
lot of deep details and descriptions and

2539
01:32:50,238 --> 01:32:55,118
like with cannabis I feel like

2540
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:56,719
seedfinder EU is probably like one of

2541
01:32:55,118 --> 01:32:58,839
the closest things we had to that like

2542
01:32:56,719 --> 01:33:00,520
you can go and find and it's like a

2543
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:02,199
Wikipedia more than it is the American

2544
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:04,080
Kennel Club because anybody can put

2545
01:33:02,198 --> 01:33:05,960
anything on there and they say oh I made

2546
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:08,880
this trrain oh I did that and so you

2547
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:11,000
have to become you know Inspector Gadget

2548
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:13,319
over here and try and figure out 53

2549
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:16,039
entries for OG Kush and yeah like which

2550
01:33:13,319 --> 01:33:18,079
one for Blue Dream yeah and like who

2551
01:33:16,039 --> 01:33:19,960
actually made it and like so I was like

2552
01:33:18,079 --> 01:33:21,760
this is so ridiculous like I get a 100

2553
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:24,639
questions a day asking me not actually

2554
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:26,560
100 but like for a while like we I'd get

2555
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:27,639
hundreds per week of people asking me

2556
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:29,520
certain questions and a lot of the

2557
01:33:27,639 --> 01:33:30,760
recurring ones are what is this strain

2558
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:33,679
who like where did this come from who

2559
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:35,199
made this and a lot of times I'd be

2560
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:37,199
listening to shows and I still do like

2561
01:33:35,198 --> 01:33:38,519
I'll be in the chat like they'll be like

2562
01:33:37,198 --> 01:33:41,079
what is the strain I'll just be like

2563
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:43,880
it's xross to Y you know like I'll tell

2564
01:33:41,079 --> 01:33:46,279
them it's OG Kush cross to you know

2565
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:48,239
cookies or something like that and then

2566
01:33:46,279 --> 01:33:50,759
I start sort of like Matthew Gates

2567
01:33:48,238 --> 01:33:52,678
Whenever there would be somebody post a

2568
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:54,719
image of a plant with bugs on it

2569
01:33:52,679 --> 01:33:57,039
everyone would just tag at s angel on

2570
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:58,560
Instagram and then you'd see like a few

2571
01:33:57,039 --> 01:34:01,840
hours later s Angel would come in and be

2572
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:03,760
like that's uh tetron ear Decay or

2573
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:05,520
spider mites or whatever you know like

2574
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:07,000
he'd give like the Latin name the real

2575
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,600
name and he's like here's what you use

2576
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,920
to treat it and here's my you know

2577
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:11,800
there's a link on my website if you want

2578
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:13,039
to go watch my pest primer on YouTube

2579
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:14,119
and like it'll show you all the ways

2580
01:34:13,039 --> 01:34:15,960
that you can fight it and like

2581
01:34:14,118 --> 01:34:17,279
everything about like how they live and

2582
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:21,319
the reproductive cycles and this and

2583
01:34:17,279 --> 01:34:24,158
that so I came to know him by seeing

2584
01:34:21,319 --> 01:34:25,960
him basically demonstrating his

2585
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:27,960
professionalism by helping people for

2586
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:30,679
free online and so I was like you know

2587
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:32,319
what I can kind of be that person in a a

2588
01:34:30,679 --> 01:34:33,880
little bit of way CU I'm just a nerd for

2589
01:34:32,319 --> 01:34:35,359
cannabis strains I tried a bunch of them

2590
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:38,199
myself and I'm always wanting to learn

2591
01:34:35,359 --> 01:34:40,719
more about new ones so why don't I get

2592
01:34:38,198 --> 01:34:43,198
into that space a little bit more and

2593
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:46,439
make something concrete my Instagram can

2594
01:34:43,198 --> 01:34:49,039
be deleted my stuff can be Shadow fanned

2595
01:34:46,439 --> 01:34:51,238
but a paperback book that sits on your

2596
01:34:49,039 --> 01:34:54,399
desk or on your countertop where you

2597
01:34:51,238 --> 01:34:56,279
smoke nobody can censor that nobody can

2598
01:34:54,399 --> 01:34:58,719
delete that he might be burnt up in a

2599
01:34:56,279 --> 01:34:59,759
fire or something but um I I'll send you

2600
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:02,880
another copy if anything like that

2601
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:05,400
happened and um by making something

2602
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:07,079
concrete forums get deleted or lost and

2603
01:35:05,399 --> 01:35:08,920
one gets popular and then it fades out

2604
01:35:07,079 --> 01:35:10,559
of you know popularity and then the next

2605
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:15,039
one gets popular and Fades out of

2606
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:18,880
popularity and we lose so much of our

2607
01:35:15,039 --> 01:35:21,158
history um in a sense I felt almost in

2608
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:24,359
retrospect like an ethnobotanist in a

2609
01:35:21,158 --> 01:35:26,960
way because sure I'm covering ing people

2610
01:35:24,359 --> 01:35:30,639
and culture as much as I'm covering the

2611
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:33,039
plant because that's a major part of

2612
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:35,679
what this industry is and what this

2613
01:35:33,039 --> 01:35:37,479
plant took to survive you know through

2614
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:39,760
thousands of years like there was

2615
01:35:37,479 --> 01:35:41,718
cultural reasons and you know business

2616
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:43,119
even business reasons I'm sure back

2617
01:35:41,719 --> 01:35:44,679
times before we even had documentation

2618
01:35:43,118 --> 01:35:46,839
I'm sure people were selling it or

2619
01:35:44,679 --> 01:35:49,800
exchanging it for other Goods foods and

2620
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:51,199
services and things like that so it's um

2621
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:53,480
a very

2622
01:35:51,198 --> 01:35:56,198
historically you know significant plant

2623
01:35:53,479 --> 01:35:58,359
and and so little modern research has

2624
01:35:56,198 --> 01:36:00,079
been done it's getting better in the

2625
01:35:58,359 --> 01:36:01,238
recent years but so much of it for a

2626
01:36:00,079 --> 01:36:02,960
long time was just like how is this

2627
01:36:01,238 --> 01:36:05,879
addictive or how is it problematic and

2628
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:08,158
bad and how does it cause crime or what

2629
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:10,279
crimes are related to it and now we're

2630
01:36:08,158 --> 01:36:11,839
like What does it do medically like how

2631
01:36:10,279 --> 01:36:14,840
does it do it how is it helping all

2632
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:18,000
these people with sleep pain anxiety um

2633
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:19,920
you know mental illness so many other a

2634
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,719
like it's considered quote dirty drug

2635
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:23,679
because it treats more than one thing

2636
01:36:21,719 --> 01:36:25,520
like a clean drug is like oh this is a

2637
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:27,480
pain reliever it does pain relief and

2638
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:29,840
that's it this is a boner pill it gives

2639
01:36:27,479 --> 01:36:30,959
you boners like it does one thing it was

2640
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:33,079
initially supposed to be a heart drug

2641
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:35,359
and I found out it became an erection in

2642
01:36:33,079 --> 01:36:36,800
right but um it's got a very specific

2643
01:36:35,359 --> 01:36:38,519
Target now and there's a bunch of

2644
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:40,760
different knockoffs of that now or or

2645
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:43,960
different styles from gels to Mists to

2646
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:46,079
tabs and things like that so with uh

2647
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:47,319
cannabis it's kind of interesting

2648
01:36:46,079 --> 01:36:49,399
because it treats so many different

2649
01:36:47,319 --> 01:36:50,840
things and all the different strains

2650
01:36:49,399 --> 01:36:53,759
like certain ones are better for

2651
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:56,319
different things and so I wanted with 50

2652
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:58,320
of green to as much as I could document

2653
01:36:56,319 --> 01:37:01,559
my own personal experiences with what I

2654
01:36:58,319 --> 01:37:04,599
felt were 50 of the best strains That

2655
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:05,679
Grew green and finish green because I'd

2656
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:08,159
seen in

2657
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:09,679
California a lot of like OG's talked

2658
01:37:08,158 --> 01:37:12,158
about when the purple came in a lot of

2659
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:13,560
the OG's just threw all their old cuts

2660
01:37:12,158 --> 01:37:15,759
out and took the purple cuz that's all

2661
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:17,920
people were buying and so we lost a lot

2662
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:19,920
of history there when purple got popular

2663
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:21,079
and I was like well I need to go I like

2664
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:22,079
a lot of these green strains like in my

2665
01:37:21,079 --> 01:37:24,760
personal experience some of the best

2666
01:37:22,079 --> 01:37:26,000
effects came from the green strains and

2667
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:28,800
I know it's not just California

2668
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:30,960
California often leads the market but a

2669
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:32,239
lot of other markets kind of feel the

2670
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:34,118
same way like purple is cool it looks

2671
01:37:32,238 --> 01:37:35,559
cool I'm my first strain that I put out

2672
01:37:34,118 --> 01:37:36,880
V bunch is a purple strain and I wanted

2673
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:39,039
it to be purple because so many people

2674
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:40,440
have never experienced that I get that

2675
01:37:39,039 --> 01:37:43,039
like some people still haven't had

2676
01:37:40,439 --> 01:37:44,399
access to good purple bud so or any

2677
01:37:43,039 --> 01:37:45,719
purple bud to be able to grow that

2678
01:37:44,399 --> 01:37:47,198
yourself like seeing it go from Green

2679
01:37:45,719 --> 01:37:49,520
and veg to purple it's like a [ __ ]

2680
01:37:47,198 --> 01:37:51,879
magic trick so there's a satisfaction

2681
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:54,960
it's it's it's like nothing else I love

2682
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:56,840
that even if it turned pink or red like

2683
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:58,800
it it Chang in colors when it's been

2684
01:37:56,840 --> 01:38:00,480
green its whole life other than turning

2685
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:02,880
like yellow or something or brown like

2686
01:38:00,479 --> 01:38:05,399
would be uh it's such a beautiful

2687
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:08,800
experience but with as much as purple is

2688
01:38:05,399 --> 01:38:10,879
cool and I get that it's cool we lost

2689
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:13,840
some of the passion for green and so I

2690
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:15,359
was like what are my top 50 and I've

2691
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:17,000
tried over a thousand at this point and

2692
01:38:15,359 --> 01:38:18,839
I documented hundreds of them and I have

2693
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,039
a little Journal how did it smell how

2694
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:22,279
did it make me feel when did I use it

2695
01:38:20,039 --> 01:38:24,639
why did I use it uh set and setting like

2696
01:38:22,279 --> 01:38:26,279
I got this a couple of them had they're

2697
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:28,760
like cannabis specific journals that

2698
01:38:26,279 --> 01:38:31,238
have like pre cutout things for you to

2699
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:35,280
fill in like 1 through 10 or you know

2700
01:38:31,238 --> 01:38:37,359
uplifting sedating like smells flavors

2701
01:38:35,279 --> 01:38:38,479
uh did it linger did it like hit you

2702
01:38:37,359 --> 01:38:40,960
immediately and like all these different

2703
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:43,039
little subtle notes and so I was able to

2704
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:44,880
back reference those as I wrote the book

2705
01:38:43,039 --> 01:38:46,399
but then I realized at the same time

2706
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,800
like you mentioned earlier in the show

2707
01:38:46,399 --> 01:38:50,039
my experience isn't everyone's

2708
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:51,599
experience so I cross reference my

2709
01:38:50,039 --> 01:38:53,719
friends I cross reference my family I

2710
01:38:51,599 --> 01:38:55,520
cross reference the internet Leafly and

2711
01:38:53,719 --> 01:38:58,880
all these other websites and see how

2712
01:38:55,520 --> 01:39:01,719
does my experience stack up and I try to

2713
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:04,319
include a little bit of both often times

2714
01:39:01,719 --> 01:39:06,000
my experience is the common eight out of

2715
01:39:04,319 --> 01:39:07,639
10 nine out of 10 times if it's an

2716
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,439
uplifting strain I get that uplifting

2717
01:39:07,639 --> 01:39:11,960
effect sometimes I'm the one out of 10

2718
01:39:09,439 --> 01:39:14,079
outlier I'm like that Mac one that

2719
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:15,520
everybody loves I [ __ ] hate it I've

2720
01:39:14,079 --> 01:39:17,800
tried it 100 times I've tried it from

2721
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:20,239
him I've tried capulator Mac one didn't

2722
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:22,920
like it from the horse's mouth like I

2723
01:39:20,238 --> 01:39:25,839
got it directly from the hand and uh it

2724
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:27,560
just so unfortunate doesn't it's it's

2725
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:29,400
profile does not work with my endocan

2726
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:30,560
abinoid system sure a lot of people love

2727
01:39:29,399 --> 01:39:32,319
it a lot of people like how it smells

2728
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:34,719
how it tastes how it makes some I'm not

2729
01:39:32,319 --> 01:39:36,799
a fan it's like it's very best it's ever

2730
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:38,560
been to me was a seven out of 10 and I

2731
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:41,520
think I'm being generous like probably

2732
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:44,560
more like a 6.5 for me for me like so

2733
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:46,199
like how you talk about the form cut um

2734
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:49,679
Mac 1 was the first thing that I

2735
01:39:46,198 --> 01:39:52,039
experienced where I I had um like what I

2736
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:54,520
would call like a true medicinal

2737
01:39:52,039 --> 01:39:56,880
reaction to it where like pain that I

2738
01:39:54,520 --> 01:40:02,520
was feeling went away almost

2739
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:04,920
instantaneously and um it it was it was

2740
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:07,360
astonishing for me how well it worked so

2741
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:09,679
I mean even that alone right there shows

2742
01:40:07,359 --> 01:40:12,238
any of the listeners how unique an

2743
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:14,920
endocannabinoid system can be and how

2744
01:40:12,238 --> 01:40:17,799
unique a tarpine and uh cannaboid

2745
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:20,359
profile of a flower or a concentrate can

2746
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:22,079
be and not just that but like you said

2747
01:40:20,359 --> 01:40:24,559
you got it from the guy who bred it and

2748
01:40:22,079 --> 01:40:27,118
grows it now in the commercial Market I

2749
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:29,320
got it from someone who was not that

2750
01:40:27,118 --> 01:40:31,399
person in a completely different state

2751
01:40:29,319 --> 01:40:33,920
and so who even knows if the growing

2752
01:40:31,399 --> 01:40:36,759
styles were similar and well I only say

2753
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:38,639
that cuz I tried it 15 times before that

2754
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:39,960
wasn't his so I was like oh I just had a

2755
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:41,359
good representation or I haven't grown

2756
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:42,560
it myself yet cuz if I haven't grown it

2757
01:40:41,359 --> 01:40:43,960
myself yet I don't necessarily think

2758
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:47,840
I've given it a fair shake so I haven't

2759
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:50,079
grown mac one to say um for myself but I

2760
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:51,679
haven't grown it because I didn't like

2761
01:40:50,079 --> 01:40:53,000
any of it when I got it from him and I

2762
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:54,560
didn't like it that was really sealed

2763
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,800
the deal I got it from a guy who said

2764
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:58,440
they got it from him and then I got it

2765
01:40:55,800 --> 01:41:00,560
from him myself so I was like um but it

2766
01:40:58,439 --> 01:41:01,839
is cool that I will say this I don't

2767
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:02,960
want people to get tribal about it I

2768
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,159
think Cap's cool I like a lot of his

2769
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:06,599
other crosses I think he runs a good

2770
01:41:04,158 --> 01:41:08,638
forum I think that he maybe sells good

2771
01:41:06,599 --> 01:41:10,360
product I haven't tried it but um I've

2772
01:41:08,639 --> 01:41:12,319
heard good things about some of his

2773
01:41:10,359 --> 01:41:13,880
microbes and maybe even IPM products and

2774
01:41:12,319 --> 01:41:15,399
stuff like that think capulator schol I

2775
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:17,440
met him shook his hand he was super nice

2776
01:41:15,399 --> 01:41:19,238
to me but flower and you know we had a

2777
01:41:17,439 --> 01:41:21,439
good good experience good exchange I

2778
01:41:19,238 --> 01:41:23,718
didn't um you know I literally only got

2779
01:41:21,439 --> 01:41:27,279
the Mac one just to say that I some from

2780
01:41:23,719 --> 01:41:28,760
him to try it from him but um I'm happy

2781
01:41:27,279 --> 01:41:31,319
that it works for you some people are

2782
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:33,239
like oh like Jack doesn't like the Mac

2783
01:41:31,319 --> 01:41:34,439
one so he thinks that Mac one sucks and

2784
01:41:33,238 --> 01:41:35,959
no one should use it like no that's not

2785
01:41:34,439 --> 01:41:37,039
what I'm trying to say I'm actually

2786
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:38,880
trying to say like the opposite like

2787
01:41:37,039 --> 01:41:40,639
just cuz I like something that's why I

2788
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:43,400
cross reference cuz if I would have just

2789
01:41:40,639 --> 01:41:45,440
said 50 strains of Jack's favorite then

2790
01:41:43,399 --> 01:41:47,079
I think it's a limited book right cuz

2791
01:41:45,439 --> 01:41:49,279
like maybe I'd just like more sativa

2792
01:41:47,079 --> 01:41:51,118
than you maybe like my wife didn't start

2793
01:41:49,279 --> 01:41:53,960
smoking SAA until like a year or two ago

2794
01:41:51,118 --> 01:41:57,920
like and I use SAA very more uplift in

2795
01:41:53,960 --> 01:42:01,198
uh he highs well I like those you know

2796
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:02,679
especially daytime and midday she didn't

2797
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:04,198
like him for a long long long time until

2798
01:42:02,679 --> 01:42:07,199
she started working with certain brands

2799
01:42:04,198 --> 01:42:10,158
that had maybe more what I would call

2800
01:42:07,198 --> 01:42:13,479
like a closer to the heirloom or or even

2801
01:42:10,158 --> 01:42:15,118
um some land race type varieties and

2802
01:42:13,479 --> 01:42:16,479
funny enough she actually enjoyed those

2803
01:42:15,118 --> 01:42:18,799
more so I think there's something of a

2804
01:42:16,479 --> 01:42:22,158
balance in there and some of the more

2805
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:24,199
modern what we call sativa uplifting

2806
01:42:22,158 --> 01:42:26,039
crosses and I wonder how much of it

2807
01:42:24,198 --> 01:42:28,559
could have also just been with um you

2808
01:42:26,039 --> 01:42:30,560
know like with most other systems within

2809
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:33,199
the body nervous circulatory endoc

2810
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:35,800
canabo they develop and change over time

2811
01:42:33,198 --> 01:42:39,158
and The receptors can become blocked or

2812
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:41,560
open up or um even yeah through set and

2813
01:42:39,158 --> 01:42:43,319
setting as you get older and as as your

2814
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:44,679
uh you know your hormonal structure

2815
01:42:43,319 --> 01:42:46,960
changes and the rest of your body

2816
01:42:44,679 --> 01:42:49,079
changes over time and your mental state

2817
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:51,599
changes all those things could provide

2818
01:42:49,079 --> 01:42:54,198
just a different experience of the same

2819
01:42:51,599 --> 01:42:56,039
product from one year to the next I

2820
01:42:54,198 --> 01:42:58,198
totally agree and I know some people

2821
01:42:56,039 --> 01:43:00,118
will get paranoid now that can't even

2822
01:42:58,198 --> 01:43:01,439
use it anymore where they used to love

2823
01:43:00,118 --> 01:43:04,000
taking big bong hits and like they can't

2824
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:06,799
even smoke a little bit anymore and um I

2825
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:08,679
do think that's a major factor to how

2826
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:10,159
people are going to experience it so uh

2827
01:43:08,679 --> 01:43:12,480
you know I want to rein us back in just

2828
01:43:10,158 --> 01:43:13,719
a little bit actually and uh get back to

2829
01:43:12,479 --> 01:43:15,479
a little bit more of the growing

2830
01:43:13,719 --> 01:43:18,039
questions since we are coming up on the

2831
01:43:15,479 --> 01:43:19,638
2hour Mark here I want to just make sure

2832
01:43:18,039 --> 01:43:21,760
that I get as much of this in even if we

2833
01:43:19,639 --> 01:43:24,000
run over just a little bit sounds good

2834
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:26,639
um but throughout all of your experience

2835
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:28,399
growing uh you know from all the way

2836
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:31,118
back to your first experience where you

2837
01:43:28,399 --> 01:43:34,118
were helping uh to now where you have

2838
01:43:31,118 --> 01:43:37,880
multiple years of homow experience uh

2839
01:43:34,118 --> 01:43:41,920
changing from Hydroponics to uh Organics

2840
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:43,440
or amended substrates um what uh and and

2841
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:46,319
I'm going to pose this as a two-part

2842
01:43:43,439 --> 01:43:49,559
question so what have been some of your

2843
01:43:46,319 --> 01:43:51,880
biggest learning experiences and a um

2844
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:55,000
from a setback something that really

2845
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:57,599
made you feel like uh like you could

2846
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:58,880
call it a failure in the garden or um

2847
01:43:57,599 --> 01:44:01,119
something that you didn't want to have

2848
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:03,440
occur again and then on the other side

2849
01:44:01,118 --> 01:44:05,279
of the coin um what have you learned the

2850
01:44:03,439 --> 01:44:08,198
most from a success that you found in

2851
01:44:05,279 --> 01:44:11,118
your garden where uh you then took that

2852
01:44:08,198 --> 01:44:13,559
practice and either uh continued to

2853
01:44:11,118 --> 01:44:15,079
perfect it or just took it as it was and

2854
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:17,719
made sure that you were implementing

2855
01:44:15,079 --> 01:44:19,639
that every time moving forward so I'll

2856
01:44:17,719 --> 01:44:22,480
start with the success first and then

2857
01:44:19,639 --> 01:44:23,920
finish with the failure because uh we

2858
01:44:22,479 --> 01:44:25,638
recently did episode where we talked a

2859
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:27,039
lot about learning for failures and uh

2860
01:44:25,639 --> 01:44:28,440
growing with my fellow Growers so I do

2861
01:44:27,039 --> 01:44:29,800
encourage people to check it out uh

2862
01:44:28,439 --> 01:44:31,559
growing with my fellow Growers I do host

2863
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:33,840
on Sundays on the YouTube and uh we did

2864
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:36,400
a whole uh I think it was just two weeks

2865
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:38,599
ago about New Year just learning from

2866
01:44:36,399 --> 01:44:40,598
failures and a whole bunch of stuff came

2867
01:44:38,599 --> 01:44:42,360
up but with the success one thing that

2868
01:44:40,599 --> 01:44:44,719
you brought up in just how you asked the

2869
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:47,439
question made me think specifically of

2870
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:50,319
um using the drought stress to benefit

2871
01:44:47,439 --> 01:44:54,238
your tarpine expression to benefit the

2872
01:44:50,319 --> 01:44:55,840
resin production I listened to Hash

2873
01:44:54,238 --> 01:44:57,759
church for a long time and Bubble Man

2874
01:44:55,840 --> 01:45:00,480
and others mentioned that lavender grown

2875
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:02,800
in France had the highest tpine profile

2876
01:45:00,479 --> 01:45:04,839
it sold for the highest dollar per pound

2877
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:08,520
it had the most linol production which

2878
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:13,520
is a tpine found in cannabis so I

2879
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:15,679
figured well if line is increased by

2880
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:17,360
being grown in this Mediterranean region

2881
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:19,359
and they are known for getting a drought

2882
01:45:17,359 --> 01:45:21,279
late season then maybe we can give our

2883
01:45:19,359 --> 01:45:23,000
plants a late season drought just like

2884
01:45:21,279 --> 01:45:24,800
late and flower couple weeks before we

2885
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:26,118
Harvest them let them get real dry dry

2886
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:28,520
the pots all the way back until they get

2887
01:45:26,118 --> 01:45:29,960
droopy and did it once accidentally just

2888
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:31,639
cuz my pots were a little bit smaller

2889
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:33,599
and this is what really made me start

2890
01:45:31,639 --> 01:45:35,400
believing it and and push and doing it

2891
01:45:33,599 --> 01:45:37,719
every single Harvest because it was

2892
01:45:35,399 --> 01:45:40,000
actually that sour 76 and platinum Yeti

2893
01:45:37,719 --> 01:45:41,439
grow um they were in one gallon cocoa

2894
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:43,079
pots which if you know about growing in

2895
01:45:41,439 --> 01:45:44,719
one gallon cocoa pots especially in like

2896
01:45:43,079 --> 01:45:46,399
Southern California where it can get dry

2897
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:48,719
and you have good air flow um those pots

2898
01:45:46,399 --> 01:45:50,679
can dry out within like a day so late in

2899
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:52,399
flower you got big you know 2ft tall

2900
01:45:50,679 --> 01:45:53,920
plant and next to like a 1 and a2t Tall

2901
01:45:52,399 --> 01:45:56,079
plant that foot tall plant might drink a

2902
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:58,920
little bit quicker and so I had two

2903
01:45:56,079 --> 01:46:01,118
Platinum yetis one of them they were

2904
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:03,679
both really sandy I just de leafed the

2905
01:46:01,118 --> 01:46:05,479
resin was really Sandy and it felt like

2906
01:46:03,679 --> 01:46:07,679
grainy almost literally like grains of

2907
01:46:05,479 --> 01:46:11,559
sand on the on top of the leaf the one

2908
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:14,239
that got drought stressed the next day

2909
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:16,560
felt like super glue it was so sticky

2910
01:46:14,238 --> 01:46:18,399
and it was pungent it was so much louder

2911
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:20,639
and and just the smell was screaming off

2912
01:46:18,399 --> 01:46:21,679
that plant I could like when you'd stick

2913
01:46:20,639 --> 01:46:23,639
your fingers together they would like

2914
01:46:21,679 --> 01:46:25,840
there's like the glue Trace after you

2915
01:46:23,639 --> 01:46:27,440
just touched one leaf and it was so

2916
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:30,360
significantly different than the day

2917
01:46:27,439 --> 01:46:34,919
before that I just let the one next to

2918
01:46:30,359 --> 01:46:36,198
it drought as well to see like is it

2919
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:38,399
maybe just the stage of growth like

2920
01:46:36,198 --> 01:46:39,719
they're at the same day a flower this

2921
01:46:38,399 --> 01:46:41,559
one's so much stickier than that one and

2922
01:46:39,719 --> 01:46:43,639
it just routed and the the one next to

2923
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:46,119
it was still Sandy so I just let it go

2924
01:46:43,639 --> 01:46:49,199
dry dry dry dry dry soon as it dried

2925
01:46:46,118 --> 01:46:50,920
down watered it again came back it was

2926
01:46:49,198 --> 01:46:52,919
super glue sticky so I did that to the

2927
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:55,719
whole room every other plant the sour 76

2928
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:58,480
CU they all got it and from that point

2929
01:46:55,719 --> 01:46:59,920
forward I was like all right week seven

2930
01:46:58,479 --> 01:47:02,759
drought stress you know cuz I think

2931
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:04,560
that's what it was and um I mentioned

2932
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:06,320
this on the podcast a few times and then

2933
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:11,880
it turns out there was a university of

2934
01:47:06,319 --> 01:47:13,519
GF in Canada study uh G is gu l p um

2935
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:14,520
it's a Canadian pronunciation again we

2936
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:17,719
have Canadian listeners out there who

2937
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:19,719
product I used to call it gelf it's gu

2938
01:47:17,719 --> 01:47:21,719
um so shout out to the Canadians who

2939
01:47:19,719 --> 01:47:23,639
listen I appreciate all the it it's

2940
01:47:21,719 --> 01:47:25,118
humbling honestly to like I just I'm

2941
01:47:23,639 --> 01:47:26,560
sitting here in my room on a podcast or

2942
01:47:25,118 --> 01:47:28,880
whatever and there's people all over the

2943
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:30,320
world actually listening so it is

2944
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:32,960
honestly mind-blowing just like a

2945
01:47:30,319 --> 01:47:35,679
Midwestern dude like talking about weed

2946
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:38,359
but that was the biggest success that I

2947
01:47:35,679 --> 01:47:40,760
learned from the GU study ended up

2948
01:47:38,359 --> 01:47:43,238
showing a week eight drought stress

2949
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:45,239
increased the tarpine canabo production

2950
01:47:43,238 --> 01:47:47,359
and the yield the yield was even higher

2951
01:47:45,238 --> 01:47:48,638
than like their well-watered condition

2952
01:47:47,359 --> 01:47:50,880
which doesn't mean the water came from a

2953
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:52,199
well it was watered well or properly

2954
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:53,719
which meant they did a bunch of studies

2955
01:47:52,198 --> 01:47:56,158
figured out how to water as good as they

2956
01:47:53,719 --> 01:47:57,520
could did the good as they could method

2957
01:47:56,158 --> 01:47:59,679
and then tried that against the drought

2958
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:01,679
stress method the drought stress method

2959
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:02,639
outperformed and if anybody wants I

2960
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:05,440
could send them that link or you could

2961
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:07,719
just look up uh root Zone management GTH

2962
01:48:05,439 --> 01:48:10,079
drought cannabis study and it'll pop up

2963
01:48:07,719 --> 01:48:11,520
on Google free I would also suggest

2964
01:48:10,079 --> 01:48:13,559
anybody that wants to look up drought

2965
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:15,960
stressing and the benefits in a

2966
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:17,639
hydroponic setting as well as even in

2967
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:20,118
organic settings to look up how

2968
01:48:17,639 --> 01:48:22,039
commercial tomatoes are cultivated

2969
01:48:20,118 --> 01:48:23,279
especially Vining Tomatoes where they go

2970
01:48:22,039 --> 01:48:26,238
through

2971
01:48:23,279 --> 01:48:28,479
um uh in in like crop steering you would

2972
01:48:26,238 --> 01:48:30,879
call it generative versus vegetative

2973
01:48:28,479 --> 01:48:32,879
steering events and generative being

2974
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:35,520
that drought stress or other stress

2975
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:38,599
events and vegetative being reduced

2976
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:41,119
stress um events and you can have these

2977
01:48:38,599 --> 01:48:44,159
cycles of uh stress low stress stress

2978
01:48:41,118 --> 01:48:46,479
low stress where you can produce rapid

2979
01:48:44,158 --> 01:48:49,359
onset of uh the the fruit sets for

2980
01:48:46,479 --> 01:48:52,238
tomatoes and have it produce um and

2981
01:48:49,359 --> 01:48:54,359
ripen and create new Tomatoes all at

2982
01:48:52,238 --> 01:48:56,559
once so that you're having this constant

2983
01:48:54,359 --> 01:48:58,559
cycle of harvesting every I think it's

2984
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:01,560
nine days or something like that

2985
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:03,880
typically within a Vining tomato um and

2986
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:06,000
so taking those same practices and

2987
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:08,920
applying them to cannabis has shown in a

2988
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:11,760
lot of cases that it's very much a

2989
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:13,239
benefit to the to the plant overall

2990
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:15,480
you're not the first person that says

2991
01:49:13,238 --> 01:49:18,879
that they um you

2992
01:49:15,479 --> 01:49:20,439
know cuz they saw cannabis as their baby

2993
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:21,960
right they didn't want to hurt it they

2994
01:49:20,439 --> 01:49:23,198
wanted to make sure it was happy they

2995
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:24,760
wanted to make sure that they did

2996
01:49:23,198 --> 01:49:26,279
everything they could for it and then

2997
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:28,320
they missed something or they caused

2998
01:49:26,279 --> 01:49:31,039
some stress event and it opened up their

2999
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:34,198
mind to being like holy crap this plant

3000
01:49:31,039 --> 01:49:36,920
responds in a positive way to these

3001
01:49:34,198 --> 01:49:38,719
stressors how can I replicate this

3002
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:40,599
consistently without it being something

3003
01:49:38,719 --> 01:49:42,920
that is a true detriment to the plant

3004
01:49:40,599 --> 01:49:45,840
and so a lot of the times I'll refer to

3005
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:47,760
it as a perceived stress because it's

3006
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:50,039
not like a true stress event where it's

3007
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:52,800
going to cause uh degradation in the

3008
01:49:50,039 --> 01:49:54,359
plant tissue or in its growth processes

3009
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:56,119
or otherwise it's it's something where

3010
01:49:54,359 --> 01:49:58,039
it's like oh it thinks it doesn't have

3011
01:49:56,118 --> 01:50:00,039
water but it actually still does and

3012
01:49:58,039 --> 01:50:03,118
you're going to get it water in you know

3013
01:50:00,039 --> 01:50:05,000
really soon here anyway so uh just let

3014
01:50:03,118 --> 01:50:07,679
it let it go do the thing and then boom

3015
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:09,760
you got tpin that are louder than you

3016
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:12,319
thought they could be resin production

3017
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:15,280
that's off the charts yeah it's distress

3018
01:50:12,319 --> 01:50:16,920
versus ESS cuz distress is bad and UST

3019
01:50:15,279 --> 01:50:19,599
stress is positive in this case it was

3020
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:21,760
statistically shown the it was a ESS

3021
01:50:19,599 --> 01:50:24,400
that late flower drought stress and I'll

3022
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:25,880
also add I personally feel that there's

3023
01:50:24,399 --> 01:50:28,439
not a negative side effect and there

3024
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:29,719
could also be a positive side effect I

3025
01:50:28,439 --> 01:50:32,238
believe in a week seven or week eight

3026
01:50:29,719 --> 01:50:33,760
depending on how long you're I two weeks

3027
01:50:32,238 --> 01:50:35,959
before you harvest ideally but week

3028
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:38,000
seven or eight one drought stress

3029
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:39,319
throughout your whole flower cycle but

3030
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,920
the second one I would add on top of

3031
01:50:39,319 --> 01:50:43,880
that that I don't have data to support

3032
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:45,800
this but I like a drought stress up

3033
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:47,319
through Harvest so right before you

3034
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:48,960
harvest letting your media dry out and

3035
01:50:47,319 --> 01:50:51,639
even letting the plants kind of suffer a

3036
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:53,760
little bit on the low water end I can't

3037
01:50:51,639 --> 01:50:56,159
verify 100% but I do think just like

3038
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:58,239
that week seven and eight pushes out a

3039
01:50:56,158 --> 01:50:59,519
little bit more TPS I would do that and

3040
01:50:58,238 --> 01:51:02,359
then even somebody just asked me this

3041
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:04,040
today in the DM what do I feel about the

3042
01:51:02,359 --> 01:51:05,399
darkness before Harvest some people will

3043
01:51:04,039 --> 01:51:06,880
let the you know say Harvest right

3044
01:51:05,399 --> 01:51:08,839
before the lights come on 12 hours of

3045
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:11,359
Darkness I agree with that at the bare

3046
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:12,880
minimum I do like to do at least 24

3047
01:51:11,359 --> 01:51:15,479
hours myself so I'll double that dark

3048
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:18,800
cycle so if they're used to being 12 on

3049
01:51:15,479 --> 01:51:21,000
12 off or 1113 whatever it is I'll give

3050
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:24,079
them their last light cycle and then

3051
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:27,000
I'll go dark for 24 hours from at least

3052
01:51:24,078 --> 01:51:29,399
um I don't push I used to do 72 hours

3053
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:30,800
sometimes I'll do 24 to 48 usually just

3054
01:51:29,399 --> 01:51:32,920
on the convenience of my life like when

3055
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:35,320
I can get to it to be honest after 24

3056
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:38,118
though I I like 24 up to 48 I think

3057
01:51:35,319 --> 01:51:39,439
after 48 being in the darkness that long

3058
01:51:38,118 --> 01:51:41,078
uh sometimes moisture can creep up and

3059
01:51:39,439 --> 01:51:42,439
you don't want to like Risk any molds

3060
01:51:41,078 --> 01:51:43,759
and things like that um if you can

3061
01:51:42,439 --> 01:51:44,960
mitigate it really well with climate

3062
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:46,159
control then you can maybe get away with

3063
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:49,439
a little bit more I don't think that

3064
01:51:46,158 --> 01:51:51,279
there's a major benefit from 48 versus

3065
01:51:49,439 --> 01:51:53,399
72 I think as long as you get that full

3066
01:51:51,279 --> 01:51:55,039
24 Darkness the pl like what the hell

3067
01:51:53,399 --> 01:51:56,719
the lights were supposed to come back on

3068
01:51:55,039 --> 01:52:00,760
like what the [ __ ] happening and I'm

3069
01:51:56,719 --> 01:52:02,480
dry like I'm us all my metabolites man

3070
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:05,039
yeah so it's just like maybe I can put

3071
01:52:02,479 --> 01:52:08,078
out something to attract something to

3072
01:52:05,039 --> 01:52:10,519
whatever but they tend to uh in my

3073
01:52:08,078 --> 01:52:11,840
experience seem to really perform at

3074
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:14,960
their best if you give them just that

3075
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:17,480
little extra nods and um for sure in

3076
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:19,800
terms of mistakes that I learned from

3077
01:52:17,479 --> 01:52:21,638
definitely going into the jar too wet I

3078
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:23,480
got moisture meters now so I don't do

3079
01:52:21,639 --> 01:52:25,639
that and even then I'll still find a bud

3080
01:52:23,479 --> 01:52:28,279
here and there if uh you know I do like

3081
01:52:25,639 --> 01:52:31,440
it sticky so I tend to air on the side

3082
01:52:28,279 --> 01:52:33,759
of um a little bit damper than some if I

3083
01:52:31,439 --> 01:52:36,678
if I wanted to I could get my stuff into

3084
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:39,719
jars bone dry but um I think that

3085
01:52:36,679 --> 01:52:41,359
there's a window between like bone dried

3086
01:52:39,719 --> 01:52:43,520
powder which like a lot of stuff you get

3087
01:52:41,359 --> 01:52:45,880
the dispensary turns out to be and like

3088
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:47,880
that nice sticky sponginess I prefer to

3089
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:49,840
get it in that sticky spongy range but

3090
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:53,159
even a little bit under that is

3091
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:54,639
probably I don't know if it was um PM or

3092
01:52:53,158 --> 01:52:57,679
Bud Rod or whatever it was but just like

3093
01:52:54,639 --> 01:53:00,279
a spider Webby nasty bortus I think

3094
01:52:57,679 --> 01:53:02,000
maybe um within the jars after I

3095
01:53:00,279 --> 01:53:03,679
harvested some of the biggest letdowns

3096
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,279
and like like I said it was like one nug

3097
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:07,960
but it was always the fattest Cola so

3098
01:53:05,279 --> 01:53:11,519
like I lost a s gr Cola on one and 11 gr

3099
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:13,359
Cola on another one and um since then

3100
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:14,639
probably like three or four gram coals

3101
01:53:13,359 --> 01:53:18,279
were like the most recent the last few

3102
01:53:14,639 --> 01:53:20,199
years that I lost but um I ended up not

3103
01:53:18,279 --> 01:53:22,000
typically keeping the jar or I'll just

3104
01:53:20,198 --> 01:53:23,879
turn that jar into concentrate even like

3105
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:27,078
the stuff that that didn't have mold on

3106
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:29,520
it just uh if I don't straight up toss

3107
01:53:27,078 --> 01:53:31,439
it all I'll turn into like a oil or

3108
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:32,920
something that I end up using to cook

3109
01:53:31,439 --> 01:53:35,238
and at that point I feel like it's

3110
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:38,520
fairly safe but have any issues with

3111
01:53:35,238 --> 01:53:40,678
that but um some the that Spartan gave

3112
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:42,800
actually about the going into the jar to

3113
01:53:40,679 --> 01:53:47,000
wet being his biggest setback that he

3114
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:49,039
learned from um I you know I feel like I

3115
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:50,760
I could say that that was definitely one

3116
01:53:49,039 --> 01:53:53,238
point where I tried to get into jars too

3117
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:55,159
wet um because I wanted to to allow for

3118
01:53:53,238 --> 01:53:57,919
the enzymatic processes to continue in

3119
01:53:55,158 --> 01:53:59,759
the curing and um I think I just was

3120
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:01,239
looking about it as as though these

3121
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:04,119
enzymes really needed a lot more

3122
01:54:01,238 --> 01:54:05,439
moisture than they do um and there's

3123
01:54:04,118 --> 01:54:08,000
more moisture than you can feel without

3124
01:54:05,439 --> 01:54:09,078
a meter like my stuff feels crispy bone

3125
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,679
dry on the outside and I stick that

3126
01:54:09,078 --> 01:54:13,920
meter in there and it's still like 8 10

3127
01:54:10,679 --> 01:54:15,399
12 15% so like when you look at it 12

3128
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:17,719
hours or 24 hours after it goes in the

3129
01:54:15,399 --> 01:54:19,039
jar a lot often times it off gases that

3130
01:54:17,719 --> 01:54:21,198
stuff on the inside that you can't even

3131
01:54:19,039 --> 01:54:23,000
see the crispy little leaves on the

3132
01:54:21,198 --> 01:54:24,919
outside are really deceptive

3133
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:28,198
because there like you could flake them

3134
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:30,920
off with a little tap but the inside of

3135
01:54:28,198 --> 01:54:33,678
the butt is still really um pretty damp

3136
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:35,560
still yep absolutely I always tell

3137
01:54:33,679 --> 01:54:37,599
people um that they know that they dried

3138
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:39,000
and cured it well when you grind it up

3139
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:41,520
and you pour it out and it looks like

3140
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:43,000
kinetic sand where it keeps moving after

3141
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:45,960
you've poured it out onto your rolling

3142
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:48,078
tray or whatever I love that texture I

3143
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:50,000
mean it it rolls up so nicely you can

3144
01:54:48,078 --> 01:54:52,158
like I feel like you can take someone

3145
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:54,439
who's had trouble rolling joints and

3146
01:54:52,158 --> 01:54:55,679
give them flower that looks like that

3147
01:54:54,439 --> 01:54:58,638
and all of a sudden they'll be like man

3148
01:54:55,679 --> 01:55:00,639
I'm really good at rolling joints um it

3149
01:54:58,639 --> 01:55:02,679
basically pack like once you roll it one

3150
01:55:00,639 --> 01:55:04,279
time it keeps its shape and then uh

3151
01:55:02,679 --> 01:55:05,920
tends to burn even in like a bowl I have

3152
01:55:04,279 --> 01:55:07,479
like a little scooper and like if it's

3153
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:10,440
at the texture I actually like it it

3154
01:55:07,479 --> 01:55:11,879
won't fall into the bowl properly it'll

3155
01:55:10,439 --> 01:55:14,359
make like a lump and I have to like

3156
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:16,560
scrape it over and off and tap it

3157
01:55:14,359 --> 01:55:18,479
because it otherwise it's just like it

3158
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:19,560
sticks to itself too much or like I'll

3159
01:55:18,479 --> 01:55:21,759
have to take my finger and kind of like

3160
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:23,360
feather it in off of this little it's a

3161
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:25,920
little bent piece of cardboard or

3162
01:55:23,359 --> 01:55:28,319
whatever just like a a scoop and dump

3163
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:30,039
and uh yeah it's covered in resin or

3164
01:55:28,319 --> 01:55:31,359
whatever but it's just an easier way to

3165
01:55:30,039 --> 01:55:32,960
not necessarily I don't have long

3166
01:55:31,359 --> 01:55:35,880
fingernails I always keep mine trimmed

3167
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:38,560
low so it's hard to pick stuff off the

3168
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:39,800
rolling tray and get it into the bowl um

3169
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:41,840
but I know they make little tools and

3170
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:44,840
things like that but this is simple and

3171
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:47,360
it works so nice well those are great

3172
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:49,199
answers for um setbacks and successes

3173
01:55:47,359 --> 01:55:52,559
that have helped you kind of shape your

3174
01:55:49,198 --> 01:55:55,158
grow and and uh um practices that you

3175
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:56,800
more follow today setback is just

3176
01:55:55,158 --> 01:55:59,719
overwatering since Spartan had the same

3177
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:00,800
answer as me um in in terms of seedlings

3178
01:55:59,719 --> 01:56:03,158
especially I killed off a couple

3179
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:04,639
seedlings in my early growing by giving

3180
01:56:03,158 --> 01:56:06,960
them a little too much water and even

3181
01:56:04,639 --> 01:56:08,319
now like mature plants I'd rather air on

3182
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:10,279
the side of underwatering than over

3183
01:56:08,319 --> 01:56:12,759
watering because like as we I talked

3184
01:56:10,279 --> 01:56:13,840
about in the successes a drought stress

3185
01:56:12,760 --> 01:56:15,520
especially like in late flower can

3186
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:18,279
actually have a benefit but that said

3187
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:20,440
the one caveat I do want to give is um

3188
01:56:18,279 --> 01:56:21,840
the gal university did the same study

3189
01:56:20,439 --> 01:56:24,198
with like multiple drought stresses

3190
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:26,880
throughout earlier like weeks 2 3 4 5

3191
01:56:24,198 --> 01:56:28,799
six and if they had more than one before

3192
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:30,480
week seven or week eight then it

3193
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:32,199
actually decreased y decreased terine

3194
01:56:30,479 --> 01:56:33,598
production decrease cannaboids so if

3195
01:56:32,198 --> 01:56:34,960
you're just like oh Jack said that you

3196
01:56:33,599 --> 01:56:36,119
can get away with like all these

3197
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:37,560
stresses and like he loves trout

3198
01:56:36,118 --> 01:56:39,719
stressing SPS I'm just going to do it

3199
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:41,719
all the time like no you got to be

3200
01:56:39,719 --> 01:56:43,679
careful with it do it when it's supposed

3201
01:56:41,719 --> 01:56:45,399
to happen late in the season like it

3202
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:47,719
would in nature in that area where the

3203
01:56:45,399 --> 01:56:49,598
best stuff comes from or in a controlled

3204
01:56:47,719 --> 01:56:52,039
environment like we're trying to do with

3205
01:56:49,599 --> 01:56:53,960
uh horiculture we can control that kind

3206
01:56:52,039 --> 01:56:55,639
of stuff stuff and and get the desired

3207
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:57,279
results but if you're just doing it

3208
01:56:55,639 --> 01:56:59,199
every time that's like airing into the

3209
01:56:57,279 --> 01:57:01,118
side of being more of a lazy lazy

3210
01:56:59,198 --> 01:57:02,118
Gardener but more people are more on

3211
01:57:01,118 --> 01:57:03,479
gardeners where we just want to give

3212
01:57:02,118 --> 01:57:06,039
more more more water and I was that

3213
01:57:03,479 --> 01:57:08,359
person and tend to still lean on that

3214
01:57:06,039 --> 01:57:09,560
side so I try to like say like is it

3215
01:57:08,359 --> 01:57:11,118
ready for water and I'll like lift the

3216
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:12,760
pot I'm like can it wait another day is

3217
01:57:11,118 --> 01:57:14,279
it starting to droop like like sometimes

3218
01:57:12,760 --> 01:57:16,520
I'll push them a little bit too much in

3219
01:57:14,279 --> 01:57:17,840
the the veg side of things and I'll slow

3220
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:19,719
things down so like it's always a

3221
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:22,639
process to kind of Tinker with and dial

3222
01:57:19,719 --> 01:57:25,000
in and take time and put it on your

3223
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:27,679
calendar figure out like this V was 30

3224
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:29,920
days this V was 36 this was 40 what did

3225
01:57:27,679 --> 01:57:31,599
I do on the 30-day V to make it 30 days

3226
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:34,359
and try and replicate that and try and

3227
01:57:31,599 --> 01:57:36,159
cut it down to 25 20 21 however fast you

3228
01:57:34,359 --> 01:57:39,039
can get it to get a big healthy plant

3229
01:57:36,158 --> 01:57:40,759
ready flower yeah and I I I just like to

3230
01:57:39,039 --> 01:57:43,719
always add the caveat as well to you

3231
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:45,599
know anybody that is um attempting to do

3232
01:57:43,719 --> 01:57:47,399
like a drought stress or something that

3233
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:51,480
it it matters what substrate you're

3234
01:57:47,399 --> 01:57:53,399
using and it matters um the frequency

3235
01:57:51,479 --> 01:57:55,559
between your Dbacks because of the the

3236
01:57:53,399 --> 01:57:57,078
substrate sizing so all of these

3237
01:57:55,560 --> 01:57:59,639
different things need to be taken into

3238
01:57:57,078 --> 01:58:02,078
account and for a lot of cases it's

3239
01:57:59,639 --> 01:58:04,480
going to take multiple rounds for you to

3240
01:58:02,078 --> 01:58:06,880
figure out what is working what doesn't

3241
01:58:04,479 --> 01:58:09,519
work and the best practices involved in

3242
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:11,159
there so you know just kind of adding on

3243
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:12,679
uh don't just start drought stressing

3244
01:58:11,158 --> 01:58:15,118
your plants all over the place

3245
01:58:12,679 --> 01:58:19,319
throughout all of flower cuz more is

3246
01:58:15,118 --> 01:58:21,000
better um not necessarily um but so yeah

3247
01:58:19,319 --> 01:58:22,920
great great caveat that you added there

3248
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:24,679
as well I appreciate that that does it's

3249
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:26,719
very important especially I feel like we

3250
01:58:24,679 --> 01:58:28,440
do have a lot of new Growers um that

3251
01:58:26,719 --> 01:58:31,920
listen to the show and especially with

3252
01:58:28,439 --> 01:58:33,879
the um the cheap home grow uh show it it

3253
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:35,800
it really has a lot of new Growers that

3254
01:58:33,880 --> 01:58:37,400
are looking to glean some information I

3255
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:39,800
know I learned a lot from you guys early

3256
01:58:37,399 --> 01:58:42,719
on when I was getting back into growing

3257
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:45,239
um you know after the the covid shutdown

3258
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:47,279
and when being in restaurants was no

3259
01:58:45,238 --> 01:58:50,319
longer very tenable for at least you

3260
01:58:47,279 --> 01:58:52,559
know two or three years there um the

3261
01:58:50,319 --> 01:58:56,639
Dark Ages the dark

3262
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:59,320
ages the recent Dark Ages yes right um

3263
01:58:56,639 --> 01:59:02,039
so you know you had your setback your

3264
01:58:59,319 --> 01:59:04,559
success um is is there anything that you

3265
01:59:02,039 --> 01:59:06,719
feel that when when new Growers or

3266
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:09,280
growers in general are looking at

3267
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:11,920
cultivating um is there something that

3268
01:59:09,279 --> 01:59:13,840
you ever like to put your finger on and

3269
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:16,480
say this is probably the most important

3270
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:19,119
thing you need to pay attention to uh as

3271
01:59:16,479 --> 01:59:20,718
you're getting into this you know CU

3272
01:59:19,118 --> 01:59:22,799
there's there's so many different styles

3273
01:59:20,719 --> 01:59:24,158
of growing whether it be

3274
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:27,279
uh salt-based

3275
01:59:24,158 --> 01:59:29,799
fertilizers or an amended substrate

3276
01:59:27,279 --> 01:59:33,359
whether you're using U high-intensity

3277
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:35,039
discharge lighting LED lighting sunlight

3278
01:59:33,359 --> 01:59:36,920
you know there's so many different

3279
01:59:35,039 --> 01:59:38,599
parameters that can be unique to the

3280
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:40,319
grower and I feel like we've repeated

3281
01:59:38,599 --> 01:59:42,360
this over and over again in this podcast

3282
01:59:40,319 --> 01:59:44,158
so far but if you had to put your finger

3283
01:59:42,359 --> 01:59:45,839
on one is there any that you could and

3284
01:59:44,158 --> 01:59:48,359
if it's not just one like maybe just a

3285
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:50,239
couple it's easy for me because I think

3286
01:59:48,359 --> 01:59:52,118
all the things that you just mentioned I

3287
01:59:50,238 --> 01:59:54,000
hate to say it doesn't matter it matters

3288
01:59:52,118 --> 01:59:56,078
it'll change how the plant expresses

3289
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:57,158
itself and some things work better for

3290
01:59:56,078 --> 01:59:59,840
other people and some things are better

3291
01:59:57,158 --> 02:00:01,439
suited for certain environments um hid

3292
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:02,760
for example if you're in the great white

3293
02:00:01,439 --> 02:00:04,839
North and it's freezing cold all the

3294
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:06,560
time in Canada where you're at and you

3295
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:07,920
want a little bit of uh extra heat like

3296
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:10,360
some people get away with running HIDs

3297
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:12,039
and Noah the growa is up in Washington I

3298
02:00:10,359 --> 02:00:13,920
think and he grows with HIDs and still

3299
02:00:12,039 --> 02:00:15,519
kills it and there's people with the

3300
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:16,679
most modern LEDs Spartan growing out

3301
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:18,199
there with you know Grand Master

3302
02:00:16,679 --> 02:00:20,118
whatever and like you could get the

3303
02:00:18,198 --> 02:00:22,078
brand newest and coolest and you can get

3304
02:00:20,118 --> 02:00:24,960
the oldest and most classic and they

3305
02:00:22,078 --> 02:00:27,439
still work but what I think ultimately

3306
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:30,319
makes the biggest difference above all

3307
02:00:27,439 --> 02:00:33,799
is the genetics and that might be you

3308
02:00:30,319 --> 02:00:38,118
know a little bit generic thing to say

3309
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:41,159
but you could take a great grower and

3310
02:00:38,118 --> 02:00:42,960
give them terrible genetics and say pick

3311
02:00:41,158 --> 02:00:44,399
whatever equipment you want and they're

3312
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:46,520
going to have a hard time growing some

3313
02:00:44,399 --> 02:00:50,598
dank but you could take a brand new

3314
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:51,639
grower with entry level whatever kit you

3315
02:00:50,599 --> 02:00:52,440
know not even all the stuff that they

3316
02:00:51,639 --> 02:00:54,440
need

3317
02:00:52,439 --> 02:00:57,678
give them a good cut or a good pack of

3318
02:00:54,439 --> 02:00:59,559
seeds they're going to grow some fire so

3319
02:00:57,679 --> 02:01:01,359
genetics is like you can dial in the

3320
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:04,440
environment slowly over time and good

3321
02:01:01,359 --> 02:01:08,598
genetics will do okay to good even in

3322
02:01:04,439 --> 02:01:11,158
bad environments so I think having good

3323
02:01:08,599 --> 02:01:13,159
genetics is one of the most under

3324
02:01:11,158 --> 02:01:15,039
researched things because it's hard to

3325
02:01:13,158 --> 02:01:16,960
research like I talked about why I got

3326
02:01:15,039 --> 02:01:18,679
into writing 50 strands of green is like

3327
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:20,319
Google good cannabis genetics I want

3328
02:01:18,679 --> 02:01:23,158
good cannabis seeds well then I'm going

3329
02:01:20,319 --> 02:01:24,759
to get sent to you know some giant

3330
02:01:23,158 --> 02:01:26,198
generic white labeling seed bank that

3331
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:27,520
says that they have all these strands

3332
02:01:26,198 --> 02:01:29,559
that we just talked about they've got

3333
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:31,599
gg4 they've got OG Kush they've got Girl

3334
02:01:29,560 --> 02:01:34,119
Scout cookies they've got Mac one and

3335
02:01:31,599 --> 02:01:35,560
it's labeled that so you would think

3336
02:01:34,118 --> 02:01:37,439
well they're selling it as that just

3337
02:01:35,560 --> 02:01:39,159
like anything else in in life I can go

3338
02:01:37,439 --> 02:01:41,039
online and I buy something I should have

3339
02:01:39,158 --> 02:01:42,679
some sort of belief that what they're

3340
02:01:41,039 --> 02:01:43,639
selling is real and I'll get seeds in

3341
02:01:42,679 --> 02:01:45,199
the mail and I can grow them out and

3342
02:01:43,639 --> 02:01:48,800
maybe they'll be good maybe they won't

3343
02:01:45,198 --> 02:01:51,479
be but if you take the time even just

3344
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:52,360
like 15 minutes of research to try and

3345
02:01:51,479 --> 02:01:55,839
go and

3346
02:01:52,359 --> 02:01:57,238
like say who was the original creator of

3347
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:58,719
whatever strain and you're going to get

3348
02:01:57,238 --> 02:02:01,759
like 20 different articles and you start

3349
02:01:58,719 --> 02:02:03,480
reading through the first 10 and eight

3350
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:04,800
out of 10 of them say the same person

3351
02:02:03,479 --> 02:02:06,718
that's usually a good sign that is the

3352
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:07,719
one person who actually did it sometimes

3353
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:09,359
it's not sometimes there's a bunch of

3354
02:02:07,719 --> 02:02:12,279
people trying to like claim that they're

3355
02:02:09,359 --> 02:02:13,439
the original and they might be dead or

3356
02:02:12,279 --> 02:02:14,759
they might not be selling that seed

3357
02:02:13,439 --> 02:02:16,198
anymore or that seed might not be

3358
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:18,400
available in a pure form because it's

3359
02:02:16,198 --> 02:02:20,879
like their closely held cut and a

3360
02:02:18,399 --> 02:02:23,439
special thing to them so it's easy to be

3361
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:26,840
like well if I can't just get the purple

3362
02:02:23,439 --> 02:02:29,198
punch then like why even grow any seeds

3363
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:30,719
that are not the pure thing uh I just

3364
02:02:29,198 --> 02:02:31,759
want something called purple punch cuz I

3365
02:02:30,719 --> 02:02:33,599
want purple punch cuz purple punch

3366
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:36,000
sounds good so I go and buy purple punch

3367
02:02:33,599 --> 02:02:37,279
from Barney's Farm Barney's Farm didn't

3368
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,760
make purple punch and so they're going

3369
02:02:37,279 --> 02:02:40,759
to get some seeds that who knows if they

3370
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:42,560
even have purple punch in them and um

3371
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:44,920
some stuff from Barney's Farm is good

3372
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:47,440
but um like their Tangerine Dream It's

3373
02:02:44,920 --> 02:02:50,239
good they have a Vanilla Kush that like

3374
02:02:47,439 --> 02:02:51,519
the men dope boys use they were featured

3375
02:02:50,238 --> 02:02:53,198
in 50 strains of Green for their tangan

3376
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:55,560
Kush because because it's so high in a

3377
02:02:53,198 --> 02:02:57,039
few different T beIN and I'm pretty

3378
02:02:55,560 --> 02:02:58,679
confident that that is one that is from

3379
02:02:57,039 --> 02:03:01,599
them I couldn't find anywhere else the

3380
02:02:58,679 --> 02:03:02,800
Tangerine Dream came from so and same

3381
02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:05,159
with the Vanilla Kush like the Vanilla

3382
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:07,199
Kush definitely came from Barney for uh

3383
02:03:05,158 --> 02:03:10,238
meno dopes crosses that they use any

3384
02:03:07,198 --> 02:03:11,638
vanilla stuff or for the most part and

3385
02:03:10,238 --> 02:03:13,039
so even though I don't like that breeder

3386
02:03:11,639 --> 02:03:14,319
because they have poor ethics I think

3387
02:03:13,039 --> 02:03:15,960
and they pushed like breeder Steve one

3388
02:03:14,319 --> 02:03:17,238
of the ogs out of the space bur a long

3389
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:19,000
time thankfully he's back stars and

3390
02:03:17,238 --> 02:03:22,678
strip Seed Company shout out to Breer

3391
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:25,039
Steve but um I actually made a Instagram

3392
02:03:22,679 --> 02:03:28,560
account because I got so many people

3393
02:03:25,039 --> 02:03:30,719
asking me you know who should I follow

3394
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:32,159
like who should I get seeds from because

3395
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:37,319
there's so many out there like I said

3396
02:03:32,158 --> 02:03:39,879
there's 10,000 strains and um so I was

3397
02:03:37,319 --> 02:03:43,238
like I could figure this out I made an

3398
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:45,118
account called aromatic do Ain which is

3399
02:03:43,238 --> 02:03:48,558
a c h

3400
02:03:45,118 --> 02:03:51,000
NES yeah so aen is just like a seed and

3401
02:03:48,559 --> 02:03:53,800
Tao had uh something I think he's the

3402
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:57,319
American one with ke with yeah I think

3403
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:58,520
that's what it is so um I figured I

3404
02:03:57,319 --> 02:04:01,039
Googled what that was and I was like

3405
02:03:58,520 --> 02:04:02,239
okay cool seeds aromatic Ain and so I

3406
02:04:01,039 --> 02:04:03,399
was figured if I ever like got into

3407
02:04:02,238 --> 02:04:05,039
breeding or whatever I could maybe make

3408
02:04:03,399 --> 02:04:07,399
that my breeder name or something my my

3409
02:04:05,039 --> 02:04:08,840
brand but I ended up more so using it to

3410
02:04:07,399 --> 02:04:11,158
just follow breeders that I believe that

3411
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:15,039
are good I'll read off a couple of them

turned L low seeds into his actual thing

3428
02:04:49,319 --> 02:04:52,920

3458
02:05:51,399 --> 02:05:55,839
list of the 40 people and you can go and

3459
02:05:54,559 --> 02:05:57,360
check out any of their Instagrams find

3460
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:58,400
them on different seed banks if you grow

3461
02:05:57,359 --> 02:06:00,799
seeds from them and you don't like them

3462
02:05:58,399 --> 02:06:02,439
I'd be very surprised because all those

3463
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:04,400
people that I listed are they've been

3464
02:06:02,439 --> 02:06:06,198
doing it for a long time and they work

3465
02:06:04,399 --> 02:06:08,158
with some of the best if not the best

3466
02:06:06,198 --> 02:06:10,000
stuff and I'm I'm picky I'll tell people

3467
02:06:08,158 --> 02:06:11,920
straight up like this your stuff's not

3468
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:13,960
good like I don't or I don't like it not

3469
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:17,039
to say that it's not good but like I do

3470
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:19,719
think that I have a fairly um I try to

3471
02:06:17,039 --> 02:06:21,840
be a little bit objective in terms of

3472
02:06:19,719 --> 02:06:24,279
like there are certain qualities if it

3473
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:25,440
smells if there's a certain amount of

3474
02:06:24,279 --> 02:06:28,000
smell even if it's not a smell that I

3475
02:06:25,439 --> 02:06:29,078
like I'm not a big fan of how GMO smells

3476
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:31,679
but I know what it's supposed to smell

3477
02:06:29,078 --> 02:06:33,960
like and if it's present or not present

3478
02:06:31,679 --> 02:06:35,800
that'll dictate like how good the grade

3479
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:38,520
is like a lot of commercial GMOs cut way

3480
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:41,079
too early and you know may be harvested

3481
02:06:38,520 --> 02:06:43,520
for hash and tpin are added back in and

3482
02:06:41,078 --> 02:06:44,599
things like that so there's a difference

3483
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:47,480
between that and like a flower that's

3484
02:06:44,599 --> 02:06:50,239
supposed to be grown 77 78 80 days that

3485
02:06:47,479 --> 02:06:53,039
gets taken at 60 or 62 or

3486
02:06:50,238 --> 02:06:54,359
50 yeah I agree I think genetics is one

3487
02:06:53,039 --> 02:06:56,279
of those things that people really need

3488
02:06:54,359 --> 02:06:58,238
to pay attention to because there are so

3489
02:06:56,279 --> 02:07:00,399
many other variables within the grow

3490
02:06:58,238 --> 02:07:02,039
that um but good genetics are are kind

3491
02:07:00,399 --> 02:07:04,960
of a constant where if you have

3492
02:07:02,039 --> 02:07:07,158
something that um is stable and grows

3493
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:09,599
well and works for your um your

3494
02:07:07,158 --> 02:07:11,118
environment or for your endoc canabo

3495
02:07:09,599 --> 02:07:13,279
system whether you know kind of

3496
02:07:11,118 --> 02:07:16,319
depending on how you're going about uh

3497
02:07:13,279 --> 02:07:17,759
why you want to grow um yeah I feel like

3498
02:07:16,319 --> 02:07:20,319
genetics need to be at the top of your

3499
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:23,039
list in terms of what you're looking for

3500
02:07:20,319 --> 02:07:25,679
uh to make sure sure that the grow goes

3501
02:07:23,039 --> 02:07:27,198
off without too many hitches I would say

3502
02:07:25,679 --> 02:07:28,440
and even your list of 40 you know there

3503
02:07:27,198 --> 02:07:31,359
I feel like there's just so many more

3504
02:07:28,439 --> 02:07:32,519
that could be added to that list um and

3505
02:07:31,359 --> 02:07:34,679
and there's those are just the ones that

3506
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:35,800
I've vetted personally and can guarantee

3507
02:07:34,679 --> 02:07:37,239
cuz like I know that there's there's

3508
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:38,599
people that I would like to add to that

3509
02:07:37,238 --> 02:07:40,638
list because I see the stuff that

3510
02:07:38,599 --> 02:07:43,199
they're doing and it looks really good

3511
02:07:40,639 --> 02:07:45,520
but then I also see like that person

3512
02:07:43,198 --> 02:07:47,479
hearded out six people's Gardens and now

3513
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:49,520
all six of those five five out of six of

3514
02:07:47,479 --> 02:07:51,879
those people are no longer even growing

3515
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:53,520
cannabis because it shuts them down and

3516
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:55,279
so I'm like yeah I guess it it depends

3517
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:57,280
on the application right like if you're

3518
02:07:55,279 --> 02:07:58,960
if you have the ability to to pheno hunt

3519
02:07:57,279 --> 02:08:01,039
then you know like maybe going through

3520
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:02,960
someone like uh Caleb at CSI humble

3521
02:08:01,039 --> 02:08:05,639
where you get to just pop a whole bunch

3522
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:08,078
of s1's of literally whatever strain you

3523
02:08:05,639 --> 02:08:09,359
can think of he probably has an S1 of it

3524
02:08:08,078 --> 02:08:11,158
if I didn't list him he should be on

3525
02:08:09,359 --> 02:08:13,319
that list because um either his account

3526
02:08:11,158 --> 02:08:15,439
got deleted or he is's definitely one

3527
02:08:13,319 --> 02:08:18,078
that I should have on there that maybe

3528
02:08:15,439 --> 02:08:19,238
isn't on there cuz I I grow CS I love

3529
02:08:18,078 --> 02:08:20,558
his stuff and I think he does great work

3530
02:08:19,238 --> 02:08:22,238
so I would definitely agree

3531
02:08:20,559 --> 02:08:24,039
wholeheartedly with that

3532
02:08:22,238 --> 02:08:26,158
and then in terms of like for hash and

3533
02:08:24,039 --> 02:08:27,639
stuff I always uh like if people can

3534
02:08:26,158 --> 02:08:30,679
find it I always tell them to look for

3535
02:08:27,639 --> 02:08:33,880
Oni seeds because like so much of his

3536
02:08:30,679 --> 02:08:35,719
work is so stable and so prolific in

3537
02:08:33,880 --> 02:08:38,239
other people's breeding projects I mean

3538
02:08:35,719 --> 02:08:41,800
shoot I use a military chocolate for

3539
02:08:38,238 --> 02:08:42,959
breeding when I do um and then there's

3540
02:08:41,800 --> 02:08:45,840
people you know that have made their

3541
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:48,760
entire careers off of a cut of uh about

3542
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:51,840
on Bloom like on and Bloom Seed Co

3543
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:54,039
because I know I think Bloom Seed Co is

3544
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:56,119
one of On's original like I think they

3545
02:08:54,039 --> 02:08:58,479
used to be partners and maybe that's why

3546
02:08:56,118 --> 02:09:00,479
no idea I know that Oni stopped selling

3547
02:08:58,479 --> 02:09:02,198
seeds for a while because he wanted to

3548
02:09:00,479 --> 02:09:04,078
just put all of his seed stock into

3549
02:09:02,198 --> 02:09:08,198
production at a recreational facility

3550
02:09:04,078 --> 02:09:09,799
that he helped open in San Diego um so I

3551
02:09:08,198 --> 02:09:11,519
know more into that [ __ ] I'm in San

3552
02:09:09,800 --> 02:09:14,000
Diego so I need to I need to look into

3553
02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:15,840
the whole Oni thing cuz um when I

3554
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:17,000
initially looked into it I thought Bloom

3555
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:18,960
was kind of the direction that they went

3556
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:21,599
with the more modern and I think it was

3557
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:23,239
either a friend or uh you know C-

3558
02:09:21,599 --> 02:09:24,639
breeder or something like that and I

3559
02:09:23,238 --> 02:09:26,718
know Masonic is another one who works

3560
02:09:24,639 --> 02:09:29,760
with a lot of like On's uh like his

3561
02:09:26,719 --> 02:09:34,000
Wilson I think came from the Wilson

3562
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:36,960
zero yeah so it's it's um that's you

3563
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:39,399
know I definitely am a fan of what I've

3564
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:40,920
seen come out of Oni but uh like I said

3565
02:09:39,399 --> 02:09:43,920
I think I just generically included

3566
02:09:40,920 --> 02:09:45,199
Bloom because that's where I saw like a

3567
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:46,520
lot of the hash makers even now still

3568
02:09:45,198 --> 02:09:48,039
today will say like same thing about

3569
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:50,239
Bloom if you're going to make any hash

3570
02:09:48,039 --> 02:09:52,198
like Bloom seedco is uh y they're

3571
02:09:50,238 --> 02:09:53,919
specifically breeding stuff and I should

3572
02:09:52,198 --> 02:09:55,879
probably add another one Farmhouse but I

3573
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:58,880
haven't grown any other stuff but um

3574
02:09:55,880 --> 02:10:01,639
Farmhouse PDX like they do schwall yeah

3575
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:02,719
they're photography is insane and the

3576
02:10:01,639 --> 02:10:04,480
stuff that they're breeding looks

3577
02:10:02,719 --> 02:10:05,960
incredible I just haven't gotten around

3578
02:10:04,479 --> 02:10:09,279
to trying it and don't knowbody anybody

3579
02:10:05,960 --> 02:10:11,000
who has yet and so that's got me

3580
02:10:09,279 --> 02:10:13,639
reticent to include it because it's like

3581
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:14,840
a lot of stuff looks really really good

3582
02:10:13,639 --> 02:10:17,840
and then I try some of it and it's like

3583
02:10:14,840 --> 02:10:20,119
not as good as I was expecting or um but

3584
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:21,960
if I hear enough good opinions I think

3585
02:10:20,118 --> 02:10:23,519
that might be more open into it I just

3586
02:10:21,960 --> 02:10:25,039
don't know like I like to know somebody

3587
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:26,800
personally like that I've talked to a

3588
02:10:25,039 --> 02:10:29,559
lot that has been like I grew this and

3589
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:31,000
it was top 10 top five like I mean

3590
02:10:29,559 --> 02:10:33,039
you're basically giving it your stamp of

3591
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:35,000
approval you have to be pretty uh

3592
02:10:33,039 --> 02:10:36,519
assured that you're not giving that to

3593
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,880
someone that either doesn't deserve it

3594
02:10:36,520 --> 02:10:39,679
or that may fall short of the

3595
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:42,359
expectations that people that want to

3596
02:10:39,679 --> 02:10:45,480
listen to you are looking for um so I I

3597
02:10:42,359 --> 02:10:46,839
get it vetting is very important and um

3598
02:10:45,479 --> 02:10:48,158
you know it's great to have people like

3599
02:10:46,840 --> 02:10:51,039
you out there that are putting in time

3600
02:10:48,158 --> 02:10:53,399
and effort into reviewing these

3601
02:10:51,039 --> 02:10:55,359
different strains and putting in as as

3602
02:10:53,399 --> 02:10:57,558
accurate and holistic of information out

3603
02:10:55,359 --> 02:10:59,279
there as possible for people to use when

3604
02:10:57,559 --> 02:11:01,520
they're starting up their new grow

3605
02:10:59,279 --> 02:11:03,439
that's um it's a valiant effort and I'm

3606
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:05,840
sure it takes a lot of time and effort I

3607
02:11:03,439 --> 02:11:08,319
mean you know it it may not be the most

3608
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:09,719
uh you may not suffer while doing it

3609
02:11:08,319 --> 02:11:11,558
though if you get to try all these

3610
02:11:09,719 --> 02:11:14,279
different strains it's a fun it's a fun

3611
02:11:11,559 --> 02:11:15,599
process you know uh the discovery is is

3612
02:11:14,279 --> 02:11:17,279
good there's a lot of listening to

3613
02:11:15,599 --> 02:11:19,400
podcasts involved there's a lot of

3614
02:11:17,279 --> 02:11:20,960
trying different stuff out uh myself and

3615
02:11:19,399 --> 02:11:23,319
talking to people who've tried the same

3616
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:25,279
stuff or or you know similar things from

3617
02:11:23,319 --> 02:11:27,078
those breeders and kind of

3618
02:11:25,279 --> 02:11:29,118
conglomerating it all into one massive

3619
02:11:27,078 --> 02:11:31,639
thing like 50 strands of green came

3620
02:11:29,118 --> 02:11:33,319
together a lot faster than purple I you

3621
02:11:31,639 --> 02:11:34,880
know and like I gave less than 50

3622
02:11:33,319 --> 02:11:36,238
breeders in my little list or whatever

3623
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:37,880
there's probably about 50 but I think

3624
02:11:36,238 --> 02:11:39,158
like a to be in a top 50 of anything in

3625
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:40,800
the world like you're doing pretty dang

3626
02:11:39,158 --> 02:11:42,558
good top 10 or whatever is like

3627
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:43,679
unbelievable and like to be the best

3628
02:11:42,559 --> 02:11:45,599
like you really have to dedicate your

3629
02:11:43,679 --> 02:11:47,800
whole entire life I think in most cases

3630
02:11:45,599 --> 02:11:49,480
to something uh you might get dumb luck

3631
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:51,599
sometimes but a lot of people are really

3632
02:11:49,479 --> 02:11:54,000
working really hard and those people I

3633
02:11:51,599 --> 02:11:57,199
can guarantee are going to provide solid

3634
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:59,719
product customer service Etc and um yeah

3635
02:11:57,198 --> 02:12:01,519
yeah it's 50 strands of purple is

3636
02:11:59,719 --> 02:12:02,920
finished actually now and I'm just

3637
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:04,679
getting with my formatter who's getting

3638
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:06,480
a new computer or something in uh

3639
02:12:04,679 --> 02:12:08,319
February so the pre-order will be going

3640
02:12:06,479 --> 02:12:09,879
live for that soon but that's been like

3641
02:12:08,319 --> 02:12:12,799
exciting two three years in the making

3642
02:12:09,880 --> 02:12:15,679
like it's yeah I was able to get more

3643
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:17,880
strains initially like than I did for

3644
02:12:15,679 --> 02:12:19,000
green like I got my top 50 pretty quick

3645
02:12:17,880 --> 02:12:20,319
like I was able to like narrow it down

3646
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:22,719
to that 50 and like it almost never

3647
02:12:20,319 --> 02:12:25,158
changed Maybe added one or subtracted

3648
02:12:22,719 --> 02:12:28,399
one but like 50 strands of purple I

3649
02:12:25,158 --> 02:12:29,719
started with like 60 or 75 and have

3650
02:12:28,399 --> 02:12:32,439
narrowed that down to 50 and then like

3651
02:12:29,719 --> 02:12:34,078
when I got to 50 I dropped a couple

3652
02:12:32,439 --> 02:12:36,479
because I was like this isn't as good as

3653
02:12:34,078 --> 02:12:38,399
that this is better than that like you

3654
02:12:36,479 --> 02:12:41,238
know and I was a little worried cuz like

3655
02:12:38,399 --> 02:12:44,198
I have a couple related like a few

3656
02:12:41,238 --> 02:12:46,279
different runs and I'm like well should

3657
02:12:44,198 --> 02:12:47,919
I just put this all under like one runs

3658
02:12:46,279 --> 02:12:49,639
should like that's how I took the gelato

3659
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:51,559
approach is all just one gelato and it

3660
02:12:49,639 --> 02:12:54,279
described the different cuts of G in

3661
02:12:51,559 --> 02:12:57,440
there but the um runs Cuts were so

3662
02:12:54,279 --> 02:12:59,599
different from one another that I

3663
02:12:57,439 --> 02:13:02,118
describe a few different ones because

3664
02:12:59,599 --> 02:13:04,719
their taste or their impact like U

3665
02:13:02,118 --> 02:13:06,719
medically were so much different from

3666
02:13:04,719 --> 02:13:08,480
the next runs that I was like this is

3667
02:13:06,719 --> 02:13:09,880
like a whole different strain so I'm not

3668
02:13:08,479 --> 02:13:11,359
just going to include it in the same

3669
02:13:09,880 --> 02:13:13,960
thing because it has the same name or

3670
02:13:11,359 --> 02:13:16,158
some similar shared genetic it would be

3671
02:13:13,960 --> 02:13:19,039
like trying to describe alls as one

3672
02:13:16,158 --> 02:13:21,679
thing you know it there there's such

3673
02:13:19,039 --> 02:13:25,078
vast differences from like uh like an OG

3674
02:13:21,679 --> 02:13:26,840
cush to a Tahoe OG or a white Tahoe

3675
02:13:25,078 --> 02:13:30,118
cookies even where it is like an OG

3676
02:13:26,840 --> 02:13:32,000
leaning cookies asphal yeah exactly and

3677
02:13:30,118 --> 02:13:34,519
then you have yeah within runs I feel

3678
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:37,639
like it was like the dawn of the candy

3679
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:39,520
gas era and within that you know I feel

3680
02:13:37,639 --> 02:13:41,400
like candy gas is a spectrum you have

3681
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:44,800
stuff that's more leaning towards that

3682
02:13:41,399 --> 02:13:47,719
gassy fuy burn your nose even rubbery at

3683
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:50,559
times all the way to this like pungent

3684
02:13:47,719 --> 02:13:52,599
sickly sweet candy that like you're

3685
02:13:50,559 --> 02:13:56,559
standing in the middle of a candy store

3686
02:13:52,599 --> 02:13:58,078
on a hot day um like and and anywhere in

3687
02:13:56,559 --> 02:14:01,039
between and so it it would be really

3688
02:13:58,078 --> 02:14:02,679
hard to describe those all is one um

3689
02:14:01,039 --> 02:14:04,279
especially considering the different

3690
02:14:02,679 --> 02:14:06,920
cannaboid profiles that you're going to

3691
02:14:04,279 --> 02:14:08,920
find across that Spectrum as well so I'm

3692
02:14:06,920 --> 02:14:11,078
I'm glad that you're taking so much

3693
02:14:08,920 --> 02:14:12,840
effort and and painstaking time into

3694
02:14:11,078 --> 02:14:15,399
making sure that this accurately

3695
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:18,559
represents um what is kind of the

3696
02:14:15,399 --> 02:14:21,399
current wave of uh of cannabis

3697
02:14:18,559 --> 02:14:23,719
throughout not only you know the

3698
02:14:21,399 --> 02:14:26,359
recreational and legal Market but the

3699
02:14:23,719 --> 02:14:28,359
world everyone wants purple every wants

3700
02:14:26,359 --> 02:14:30,719
everyone wants candy and everyone wants

3701
02:14:28,359 --> 02:14:32,598
gas even the origins of those purples

3702
02:14:30,719 --> 02:14:34,039
it's like a lot of people don't agree on

3703
02:14:32,599 --> 02:14:37,480
where it came from a lot of people don't

3704
02:14:34,039 --> 02:14:39,679
agree on what it is and um I would say

3705
02:14:37,479 --> 02:14:41,799
maybe even before runs the dawn of the

3706
02:14:39,679 --> 02:14:44,158
candy gas was that purple punch purple

3707
02:14:41,800 --> 02:14:47,320
punch is super candy gas like if you get

3708
02:14:44,158 --> 02:14:50,439
a good it's straight up grape uh Jolly

3709
02:14:47,319 --> 02:14:52,479
Rancher with gasoline like it it's super

3710
02:14:50,439 --> 02:14:54,279
like you said it can be candy store it I

3711
02:14:52,479 --> 02:14:56,319
found out it was methyl anthranilate

3712
02:14:54,279 --> 02:14:57,920
just because I was like what is

3713
02:14:56,319 --> 02:14:59,960
artificial grape smell because I was

3714
02:14:57,920 --> 02:15:03,279
like this is exactly that like there's

3715
02:14:59,960 --> 02:15:05,520
no way my nose is like I I've had enough

3716
02:15:03,279 --> 02:15:06,880
of those Jolly Ranchers to tell you like

3717
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:08,559
that grape Jolly Rancher has a certain

3718
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:11,440
chemical in there and it's the same

3719
02:15:08,559 --> 02:15:13,000
chemical that is in the purple punch and

3720
02:15:11,439 --> 02:15:14,879
sure enough I found studies and stuff

3721
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:17,078
that showed cannabis does produce methyl

3722
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:18,639
anthranol and that is what was making it

3723
02:15:17,078 --> 02:15:20,039
smell like that it's like sometimes if

3724
02:15:18,639 --> 02:15:21,719
it smells the same it actually is the

3725
02:15:20,039 --> 02:15:22,880
same like grapes can make Lang Langs can

3726
02:15:21,719 --> 02:15:25,319
make it like a few other different

3727
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:27,679
things in nature produce it so it's a

3728
02:15:25,319 --> 02:15:30,000
speaking of Oni we had we have a cross

3729
02:15:27,679 --> 02:15:32,039
of his that we um run commercially

3730
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:34,800
that's a beach grapes but we call it the

3731
02:15:32,039 --> 02:15:37,519
um like one pheno we called conquered

3732
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:39,239
Crush because it smelled so much like

3733
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:40,920
conquered grapes and and you find methyl

3734
02:15:39,238 --> 02:15:43,959
anthranilate and conquered grapes as

3735
02:15:40,920 --> 02:15:46,880
well and um and it's but it's pungent

3736
02:15:43,960 --> 02:15:51,000
and and heavy and Stony and so it's like

3737
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:52,880
a a purple punch without the same Bea

3738
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:55,399
beauty that purple punch has but with

3739
02:15:52,880 --> 02:15:58,520
all the flavor and all the potency and

3740
02:15:55,399 --> 02:16:00,960
and you know on level 10 I'll trade the

3741
02:15:58,520 --> 02:16:03,000
frost for you know potency and and other

3742
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:05,399
things to be honest like I'm realizing

3743
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:07,198
more now I want to move away from Frosty

3744
02:16:05,399 --> 02:16:08,799
strains because for sure we've all

3745
02:16:07,198 --> 02:16:10,279
picked towards Frosty for so long and

3746
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:12,840
like granted some of them do have

3747
02:16:10,279 --> 02:16:14,559
potency um but I'm like 50 strains of

3748
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:16,078
green I I feel like a lot of the strains

3749
02:16:14,559 --> 02:16:19,639
in there some even like some of the old

3750
02:16:16,078 --> 02:16:22,078
school chem 91 uh OG Kush like '90s

3751
02:16:19,639 --> 02:16:23,960
strains are still some of the strongest

3752
02:16:22,078 --> 02:16:26,238
smokers today and it's not just me

3753
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:28,039
saying that like I worked at a delivery

3754
02:16:26,238 --> 02:16:29,959
service my wife has worked at a

3755
02:16:28,039 --> 02:16:32,040
dispensary as delivery services people

3756
02:16:29,960 --> 02:16:34,040
are still saying I want gas I want OG I

3757
02:16:32,040 --> 02:16:34,880
want Kush you know I want this classic

3758
02:16:34,040 --> 02:16:37,399
and these are people that have been

3759
02:16:34,879 --> 02:16:40,478
smoken 10 20 30 40 50 years and they

3760
02:16:37,398 --> 02:16:41,679
want just OG like I I had one guy if I

3761
02:16:40,478 --> 02:16:43,159
if it wasn't gassy enough or cushy

3762
02:16:41,679 --> 02:16:44,719
enough he just wouldn't even accept it

3763
02:16:43,159 --> 02:16:47,439
get to his place and be like fair enough

3764
02:16:44,718 --> 02:16:49,718
not gassy enough sorry like I he knows

3765
02:16:47,439 --> 02:16:51,800
himself well that's awesome yep and I

3766
02:16:49,718 --> 02:16:54,879
was the same way with like a I ordered a

3767
02:16:51,799 --> 02:16:56,840
a jack her or herrer um here when I was

3768
02:16:54,879 --> 02:16:58,759
you know just moving out and I was still

3769
02:16:56,840 --> 02:17:00,920
getting stuff from delivery services and

3770
02:16:58,760 --> 02:17:01,920
um they came with like an XJ 13 or

3771
02:17:00,920 --> 02:17:04,000
something they're like well it's a jack

3772
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:05,760
her cross and I was like yeah but it's

3773
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:08,439
not Jack Herr like I'm looking for Jack

3774
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:11,159
her not you know xj13 like yeah there's

3775
02:17:08,439 --> 02:17:13,280
Jack in that and it smells Jack is but

3776
02:17:11,159 --> 02:17:14,920
like I've smoked xj13 and it's different

3777
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:17,559
like it's different high it's like Jack

3778
02:17:14,920 --> 02:17:19,599
with Gummy Bears yeah and there's like

3779
02:17:17,558 --> 02:17:21,239
there's more like it's it's messed up

3780
02:17:19,599 --> 02:17:22,960
the genetic profile like that it's

3781
02:17:21,239 --> 02:17:24,079
already a messy genetic profile it's

3782
02:17:22,959 --> 02:17:27,000
it's a whole bunch of whole bunch of

3783
02:17:24,079 --> 02:17:28,760
different things and uh it makes a

3784
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:30,439
really beautiful result I love its

3785
02:17:28,760 --> 02:17:32,359
result I think it's again like with blue

3786
02:17:30,439 --> 02:17:33,920
dream one of my favorite daytime smokes

3787
02:17:32,359 --> 02:17:35,880
and I think it's underappreciated

3788
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:37,920
because some people don't grow it that

3789
02:17:35,879 --> 02:17:39,518
well and a lot of people have uh taken

3790
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:41,478
that name and and thrown it on a bunch

3791
02:17:39,519 --> 02:17:44,639
of different genetics but like the real

3792
02:17:41,478 --> 02:17:46,638
stuff that's like terpinolene heavy uh

3793
02:17:44,638 --> 02:17:49,239
it's like creative nice Focus nice

3794
02:17:46,638 --> 02:17:51,478
uplifter I'm a huge fan of where where

3795
02:17:49,239 --> 02:17:53,159
it puts me at least mentally

3796
02:17:51,478 --> 02:17:55,079
nice I remember smoking that back in

3797
02:17:53,159 --> 02:17:57,239
like 2009 when I was going to Sacramento

3798
02:17:55,079 --> 02:18:00,478
State and I was like oh my I I never

3799
02:17:57,239 --> 02:18:01,959
knew that cannabis could taste like a

3800
02:18:00,478 --> 02:18:03,438
fruit basket and it was like the

3801
02:18:01,959 --> 02:18:05,558
fruitiest strain that I've ever had in

3802
02:18:03,439 --> 02:18:07,719
my life at that point with like you know

3803
02:18:05,558 --> 02:18:09,799
mainly leaning towards Citrus and I was

3804
02:18:07,718 --> 02:18:11,119
just so impressed by it and I think that

3805
02:18:09,799 --> 02:18:14,718
was like one of the first things where

3806
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:16,800
it was not just either purple or OG cuz

3807
02:18:14,718 --> 02:18:20,959
that was kind of what was popular in the

3808
02:18:16,799 --> 02:18:23,759
Bay Area at the time um so I you know I

3809
02:18:20,959 --> 02:18:26,718
I really like how this conversation has

3810
02:18:23,760 --> 02:18:29,398
gone so far and and your dedication to

3811
02:18:26,718 --> 02:18:32,000
the Cannabis Community is up there

3812
02:18:29,398 --> 02:18:35,159
amongst you know so many people that I

3813
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:36,760
have respect for um and one of the

3814
02:18:35,159 --> 02:18:38,239
questions that I do like to ask people

3815
02:18:36,760 --> 02:18:40,920
when they're on here especially when you

3816
02:18:38,239 --> 02:18:43,398
do have so much experience um running a

3817
02:18:40,920 --> 02:18:46,040
weekly podcast interacting with hom

3818
02:18:43,398 --> 02:18:49,039
Growers uh breeding homeg growing

3819
02:18:46,040 --> 02:18:52,960
yourself um seeing different commercial

3820
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:56,960
spots and their uh in in their operation

3821
02:18:52,959 --> 02:18:59,759
um what would you like to see change in

3822
02:18:56,959 --> 02:19:02,358
the Cannabis space whether it be uh from

3823
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:04,239
a hom Grower's perspective or a

3824
02:19:02,359 --> 02:19:06,318
commercial perspective or anywhere in

3825
02:19:04,239 --> 02:19:08,280
between really to me it'd be more and

3826
02:19:06,318 --> 02:19:09,920
larger hom grows lessen up the

3827
02:19:08,280 --> 02:19:11,280
regulations lessen up the restrictions

3828
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:13,960
allow everyone in California to grow

3829
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:15,599
outside immediately we have 67% of our

3830
02:19:13,959 --> 02:19:17,398
state that has bandn outdoor or

3831
02:19:15,599 --> 02:19:18,359
Greenhouse cultivation which is a shame

3832
02:19:17,398 --> 02:19:20,039
because we have some of the best

3833
02:19:18,359 --> 02:19:22,000
sunlight in the world and we grow some

3834
02:19:20,040 --> 02:19:22,960
of the best egg products in the world

3835
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,079
and I don't think anyone's going to be

3836
02:19:22,959 --> 02:19:25,518
harmed byy a little bit of cannabis

3837
02:19:24,079 --> 02:19:27,159
growing outside as is evidenced by the

3838
02:19:25,519 --> 02:19:29,920
33% of the state that's already doing it

3839
02:19:27,159 --> 02:19:31,879
and having any issues so I think we need

3840
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:34,280
to grow up and be adults about it and

3841
02:19:31,879 --> 02:19:36,759
say this is an agricultural crop this is

3842
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:39,599
a Horticultural crop as well and it can

3843
02:19:36,760 --> 02:19:41,800
be grown at field scale uh you know for

3844
02:19:39,599 --> 02:19:43,000
bulk and for lots of reasons you can

3845
02:19:41,799 --> 02:19:44,000
make flower out of that stuff you can

3846
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,120
make concentrate out of it you can do

3847
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:47,879
whatever you want with it it can be

3848
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:49,640
turned to rope or seed whatever um but I

3849
02:19:47,879 --> 02:19:51,799
think we need to allow a hom grower to

3850
02:19:49,639 --> 02:19:54,920
grow 100 PL in their backyard if they

3851
02:19:51,799 --> 02:19:57,199
want to in a hoop house and if they need

3852
02:19:54,920 --> 02:19:58,799
to make that into RSO then so be it and

3853
02:19:57,200 --> 02:20:00,000
if they want to use all that RSO

3854
02:19:58,799 --> 02:20:01,398
themselves so be it if they want to give

3855
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:03,680
it to their friend or family member who

3856
02:20:01,398 --> 02:20:05,920
got cancer then so be it we need to

3857
02:20:03,680 --> 02:20:07,639
lessen up the regulations and allow more

3858
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:10,439
just open free cultivation for home

3859
02:20:07,639 --> 02:20:12,760
Growers because that's where we get so

3860
02:20:10,439 --> 02:20:14,680
much more diversity like there's this

3861
02:20:12,760 --> 02:20:16,559
guy who famously saved like 150

3862
02:20:14,680 --> 02:20:17,960
different types of apples and he would

3863
02:20:16,559 --> 02:20:19,478
carry around all the different apples

3864
02:20:17,959 --> 02:20:21,358
and show them to people and sell seeds

3865
02:20:19,478 --> 02:20:23,398
and keep them alive and I think we need

3866
02:20:21,359 --> 02:20:24,600
to sort of be that person who's doing it

3867
02:20:23,398 --> 02:20:26,079
because otherwise as we see with the

3868
02:20:24,600 --> 02:20:28,079
commercial Apple Market there's like

3869
02:20:26,079 --> 02:20:30,039
four five six big varieties that get

3870
02:20:28,079 --> 02:20:32,478
grown and then everything else is just

3871
02:20:30,040 --> 02:20:34,280
lost and sort of like with 50 strains of

3872
02:20:32,478 --> 02:20:36,679
green or 50 strains of Purple like I

3873
02:20:34,280 --> 02:20:39,520
don't want genetic diversity to be lost

3874
02:20:36,680 --> 02:20:41,318
to history um yeah there's a reason some

3875
02:20:39,520 --> 02:20:43,520
stuff's more popular some stuff tastes

3876
02:20:41,318 --> 02:20:46,079
better and some stuff's easier to grow

3877
02:20:43,520 --> 02:20:47,680
and uh this and that but like just

3878
02:20:46,079 --> 02:20:49,920
because

3879
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:51,600
something even with like ugly looking

3880
02:20:49,920 --> 02:20:53,680
bud and like going away from the frosty

3881
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:56,239
stuff like just because something is not

3882
02:20:53,680 --> 02:20:58,239
the prettiest um in like the Apple

3883
02:20:56,239 --> 02:21:00,799
Market maybe it's not a eating apple but

3884
02:20:58,239 --> 02:21:02,239
it becomes a cider apple right so you

3885
02:21:00,799 --> 02:21:03,679
can use it for different things like

3886
02:21:02,239 --> 02:21:05,359
there's certain stuff that is better for

3887
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:07,720
washing like GMO is not the prettiest

3888
02:21:05,359 --> 02:21:09,079
flower it gets kind of fox taish looking

3889
02:21:07,719 --> 02:21:10,358
and if you grow it as long as it should

3890
02:21:09,079 --> 02:21:12,478
and you get it in the right environments

3891
02:21:10,359 --> 02:21:14,800
where I think it likes to be it's not

3892
02:21:12,478 --> 02:21:16,000
real appealing for flower but it make

3893
02:21:14,799 --> 02:21:18,559
some of the best concentrate in the

3894
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:20,000
world and we need to be able to say hey

3895
02:21:18,559 --> 02:21:22,799
some strains need to be taken even if

3896
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:25,439
you're taking it for concentrate 70 80

3897
02:21:22,799 --> 02:21:27,599
days and let that happen and even

3898
02:21:25,439 --> 02:21:29,079
allowing like the home Growers to have

3899
02:21:27,600 --> 02:21:32,479
larger numbers so that they can grow

3900
02:21:29,079 --> 02:21:34,600
those 16 22 week however long uh long

3901
02:21:32,478 --> 02:21:36,879
flowering plants because right now if

3902
02:21:34,600 --> 02:21:39,720
you only can have six plants it's sort

3903
02:21:36,879 --> 02:21:41,679
of limiting you to not growing that

3904
02:21:39,719 --> 02:21:43,599
strain that takes two three four times

3905
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:45,960
as long to finish as some of the other

3906
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:47,880
ones so I think that would allow people

3907
02:21:45,959 --> 02:21:50,279
to have access to what the plant is

3908
02:21:47,879 --> 02:21:51,159
really for ultimately which is to serve

3909
02:21:50,280 --> 02:21:53,840
us

3910
02:21:51,159 --> 02:21:56,719
and uh help us I think at least how we

3911
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:58,880
use it uh to live our best life if it's

3912
02:21:56,719 --> 02:22:00,559
to you know have a a medicine that

3913
02:21:58,879 --> 02:22:02,719
treats one of your ailments or if it's

3914
02:22:00,559 --> 02:22:04,519
just for the pure enjoyment that adults

3915
02:22:02,719 --> 02:22:06,079
are able to have adult use I think that

3916
02:22:04,520 --> 02:22:08,880
all use is medicinal even if there is

3917
02:22:06,079 --> 02:22:10,879
the adult use kind of mentality but the

3918
02:22:08,879 --> 02:22:12,159
more we have the better we have the

3919
02:22:10,879 --> 02:22:14,279
better the world is going to get I've

3920
02:22:12,159 --> 02:22:16,039
seen it like although there's a lot of

3921
02:22:14,280 --> 02:22:17,760
setbacks like there there's currently

3922
02:22:16,040 --> 02:22:19,399
big wildfires and some of them have

3923
02:22:17,760 --> 02:22:20,960
stretched on to San Diego and I am okay

3924
02:22:19,398 --> 02:22:23,000
thankfully the San Diego fire

3925
02:22:20,959 --> 02:22:25,039
department's been doing an amazing job

3926
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:29,000
with the Ramona fire and with the pal of

3927
02:22:25,040 --> 02:22:32,520
fire here uh recently but they are doing

3928
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:34,920
incredible but you know it's just um the

3929
02:22:32,520 --> 02:22:36,479
more and better herb that we have the

3930
02:22:34,920 --> 02:22:39,040
better I think Society is going to get

3931
02:22:36,478 --> 02:22:40,519
like we at least in my own personal

3932
02:22:39,040 --> 02:22:42,080
experience I feel myself I'm more

3933
02:22:40,520 --> 02:22:44,520
thoughtful more levelheaded more

3934
02:22:42,079 --> 02:22:46,159
centered uh more peaceful happy person

3935
02:22:44,520 --> 02:22:47,680
when I'm able able to use it and I think

3936
02:22:46,159 --> 02:22:49,840
if we have more people in society it's

3937
02:22:47,680 --> 02:22:51,040
like when you're hungry if you're hangry

3938
02:22:49,840 --> 02:22:52,478
then your life's going to be worse like

3939
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:55,640
if you're perpetually hungry like some

3940
02:22:52,478 --> 02:22:57,318
people are 20% of the US kids are uh

3941
02:22:55,639 --> 02:22:58,478
food insecure they don't know where the

3942
02:22:57,318 --> 02:23:00,519
next meal is coming from some of them

3943
02:22:58,478 --> 02:23:01,840
are literally starving or underfed uh

3944
02:23:00,520 --> 02:23:03,159
don't have enough nutrients per day so

3945
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:05,960
like it's harder for them to focus in

3946
02:23:03,159 --> 02:23:07,959
school and things like that so um if you

3947
02:23:05,959 --> 02:23:09,398
can fill those voids if you can give

3948
02:23:07,959 --> 02:23:11,438
those kids food they tend to perform

3949
02:23:09,398 --> 02:23:13,279
better well I think if you can fill the

3950
02:23:11,439 --> 02:23:15,800
void in the endoc canabo system we'll

3951
02:23:13,280 --> 02:23:18,680
see a big lessoning and endoc canabo

3952
02:23:15,799 --> 02:23:20,879
system deficiency syndromes like I think

3953
02:23:18,680 --> 02:23:23,600
I work in the autism space everyone in

3954
02:23:20,879 --> 02:23:26,199
my families are either on CBD or um

3955
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:28,960
ratio of CBD to THC or both and it's

3956
02:23:26,200 --> 02:23:30,640
benefit almost 80 to 90% of the clients

3957
02:23:28,959 --> 02:23:32,079
that I I work with and that was no

3958
02:23:30,639 --> 02:23:34,278
pushing on my own they kind of found it

3959
02:23:32,079 --> 02:23:36,039
got into it and I just advocated on top

3960
02:23:34,279 --> 02:23:38,720
of like hey you know maybe try this or

3961
02:23:36,040 --> 02:23:40,160
that or maybe this might help but

3962
02:23:38,719 --> 02:23:41,920
they've all found benefit in their own

3963
02:23:40,159 --> 02:23:44,639
ways and I think it's going to expand

3964
02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:46,478
out to other maybe ailments Parkinson's

3965
02:23:44,639 --> 02:23:48,599
and uh things like that like your dad's

3966
02:23:46,478 --> 02:23:50,199
with the you know Tremors and things

3967
02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:51,760
like that there's so many different

3968
02:23:50,200 --> 02:23:54,399
places places that it can help and the

3969
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:57,359
more we allow home Growers to grow wide

3970
02:23:54,398 --> 02:23:59,039
volumes and varieties of cannabis the

3971
02:23:57,359 --> 02:24:00,840
more we're going to find those blue

3972
02:23:59,040 --> 02:24:03,399
dream hashes that make me stop shaking

3973
02:24:00,840 --> 02:24:06,120
for my hash you know uh you know for my

3974
02:24:03,398 --> 02:24:07,278
arthritis and you will be able to find

3975
02:24:06,120 --> 02:24:08,520
those things and everyone will be able

3976
02:24:07,279 --> 02:24:10,279
to find those things maybe not just to

3977
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:11,720
help themselves but to help their father

3978
02:24:10,279 --> 02:24:13,399
to help their grandfather to help a

3979
02:24:11,719 --> 02:24:15,278
friend to help anybody a stranger in the

3980
02:24:13,398 --> 02:24:17,439
community like we should be able to help

3981
02:24:15,279 --> 02:24:19,680
I have an 80 two 80 plus year old

3982
02:24:17,439 --> 02:24:21,000
neighbors that we've got you know a

3983
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:23,239
little bit of cannabis in their systems

3984
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:26,559
and it's helping them out and you know I

3985
02:24:23,239 --> 02:24:28,279
think that we're technically not doing

3986
02:24:26,559 --> 02:24:29,519
things all like how you're supposed to

3987
02:24:28,279 --> 02:24:31,120
we don't have licenses and this and that

3988
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:33,600
we just like give them stuff you we're

3989
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:35,920
not selling them anything so it's uh

3990
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:37,960
more of just a passion to try and help

3991
02:24:35,920 --> 02:24:41,478
people and help ourselves and in so

3992
02:24:37,959 --> 02:24:44,119
doing I think we all it's not 100% just

3993
02:24:41,478 --> 02:24:46,318
uh altruistic there's a good feeling we

3994
02:24:44,120 --> 02:24:48,319
get from seeing people uh heal and

3995
02:24:46,318 --> 02:24:50,079
seeing people get better and um they

3996
02:24:48,318 --> 02:24:51,799
become our Advocates as well cuz like we

3997
02:24:50,079 --> 02:24:54,039
love Canabis helping somebody else with

3998
02:24:51,799 --> 02:24:55,478
it they become your Advocates and and

3999
02:24:54,040 --> 02:24:56,479
advocates for everybody because they

4000
02:24:55,478 --> 02:24:59,000
love it so much and they see how

4001
02:24:56,478 --> 02:25:01,799
valuable it is I mean we are such

4002
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:05,478
community-based creatures human beings

4003
02:25:01,799 --> 02:25:07,959
that to see a community succeed um

4004
02:25:05,478 --> 02:25:10,519
through the efforts that you put into

4005
02:25:07,959 --> 02:25:13,000
it there's there's just yeah there's

4006
02:25:10,520 --> 02:25:15,479
this huge positive feeling that is

4007
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:18,799
associated with that and I feel like

4008
02:25:15,478 --> 02:25:20,519
advocating for Access is such a huge

4009
02:25:18,799 --> 02:25:24,239
part of what needs to continue to to

4010
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:26,399
happen um because with that advocacy for

4011
02:25:24,239 --> 02:25:29,639
Access I feel like help it helps break

4012
02:25:26,398 --> 02:25:31,879
down the stigma um and um you know even

4013
02:25:29,639 --> 02:25:34,719
through the organizations like normal

4014
02:25:31,879 --> 02:25:37,679
where it's to normalize um cannabis you

4015
02:25:34,719 --> 02:25:40,519
know everybody's used to seeing a

4016
02:25:37,680 --> 02:25:42,398
relative or even themselves or you know

4017
02:25:40,520 --> 02:25:44,279
anybody that they know have a have a

4018
02:25:42,398 --> 02:25:47,239
glass of wine at the end of the day or a

4019
02:25:44,279 --> 02:25:51,479
few beers or even some cocktails or not

4020
02:25:47,239 --> 02:25:53,879
or whatnot um and and to add cannabis to

4021
02:25:51,478 --> 02:25:56,559
that list it almost seems like a

4022
02:25:53,879 --> 02:25:58,199
no-brainer um especially considering

4023
02:25:56,559 --> 02:26:00,799
like no

4024
02:25:58,200 --> 02:26:02,520
one I I feel like no one does like the

4025
02:26:00,799 --> 02:26:06,199
the crazy stuff that you can do when you

4026
02:26:02,520 --> 02:26:08,439
get hammered drunk uh when you're the

4027
02:26:06,200 --> 02:26:11,439
same level of stoned it's it's just not

4028
02:26:08,439 --> 02:26:13,200
necessarily the same in that aspect it's

4029
02:26:11,439 --> 02:26:15,318
not the same category it's safer yeah

4030
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:17,240
talk to any canab or to any bouncer or

4031
02:26:15,318 --> 02:26:19,920
to any police officer would you rather

4032
02:26:17,239 --> 02:26:22,600
deal with a room full of people that are

4033
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:24,040
so high they you know just stoned off

4034
02:26:22,600 --> 02:26:27,960
their butt or would you rather deal with

4035
02:26:24,040 --> 02:26:31,080
a group of people that is intoxicated on

4036
02:26:27,959 --> 02:26:33,079
alcohol meth Coke any one of those other

4037
02:26:31,079 --> 02:26:34,680
drugs you want to name like it's so much

4038
02:26:33,079 --> 02:26:36,200
easier for an officer to deal with

4039
02:26:34,680 --> 02:26:37,639
people that are on like weed or maybe

4040
02:26:36,200 --> 02:26:41,240
even like shrooms or something like that

4041
02:26:37,639 --> 02:26:43,879
like people they're just a lot less uh I

4042
02:26:41,239 --> 02:26:45,520
like a peaceful Society you know like I

4043
02:26:43,879 --> 02:26:47,079
I had my home broken into I know what

4044
02:26:45,520 --> 02:26:49,319
it's like to not have peace I know what

4045
02:26:47,079 --> 02:26:52,200
it's like to feel at at risk it's a lot

4046
02:26:49,318 --> 02:26:55,000
more fun to be you know relaxed and and

4047
02:26:52,200 --> 02:26:56,760
chilling out and just not worried about

4048
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,959
uh the things that we've evolved to not

4049
02:26:56,760 --> 02:27:00,040
have to worry about like our basic

4050
02:26:57,959 --> 02:27:03,000
survival our basic needs of like am I

4051
02:27:00,040 --> 02:27:06,279
safe do I have food do I have shelter

4052
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:07,639
and uh you know enjoying the Lesser and

4053
02:27:06,279 --> 02:27:09,359
ler time like we talked about it the

4054
02:27:07,639 --> 02:27:11,398
earli part in the show with you know

4055
02:27:09,359 --> 02:27:13,279
even the friends that I'm close with you

4056
02:27:11,398 --> 02:27:15,760
only get so much time with them so

4057
02:27:13,279 --> 02:27:17,399
getting to you know some of us have

4058
02:27:15,760 --> 02:27:18,840
anxiety whether it's social anxiety or

4059
02:27:17,398 --> 02:27:20,599
whatever like even hanging out with

4060
02:27:18,840 --> 02:27:22,239
friends or family can be difficult so if

4061
02:27:20,600 --> 02:27:24,120
you can lessen that down so you can

4062
02:27:22,239 --> 02:27:26,600
enjoy that time a little bit more it's

4063
02:27:24,120 --> 02:27:28,040
just like uh and you know some people

4064
02:27:26,600 --> 02:27:29,880
might say oh you're an addict or that's

4065
02:27:28,040 --> 02:27:31,439
a crutch or this and that but I think

4066
02:27:29,879 --> 02:27:33,000
when it's looked at like a medicine you

4067
02:27:31,439 --> 02:27:35,079
wouldn't say that to a diabetic about

4068
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:37,478
using insulin or to anybody else about

4069
02:27:35,079 --> 02:27:39,120
using their medicine so I think it's uh

4070
02:27:37,478 --> 02:27:40,959
sort of an old forgotten Trope at this

4071
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:42,520
point in some places and some places

4072
02:27:40,959 --> 02:27:44,719
still do have the stigma and stereotypes

4073
02:27:42,520 --> 02:27:46,600
I'm glad normal keeps pushing because um

4074
02:27:44,719 --> 02:27:48,799
I am seeing it become more normalized

4075
02:27:46,600 --> 02:27:51,239
like more and more it's like you ask

4076
02:27:48,799 --> 02:27:52,679
like somebody if they smoke and more

4077
02:27:51,239 --> 02:27:55,520
often than not they're

4078
02:27:52,680 --> 02:27:57,439
like yes and then there's not even the

4079
02:27:55,520 --> 02:27:59,359
discussion of like is it cigarettes or

4080
02:27:57,439 --> 02:28:00,639
cannabis it's like just cannabis in

4081
02:27:59,359 --> 02:28:02,000
certain circles in certain places and

4082
02:28:00,639 --> 02:28:04,000
it's getting to be more and more of that

4083
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:06,159
or like they'll be like oh smoke what

4084
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:07,879
question mark dot dot dot and like it

4085
02:28:06,159 --> 02:28:09,200
opens up that conversation because

4086
02:28:07,879 --> 02:28:10,318
they'll be like oh well I can actually

4087
02:28:09,200 --> 02:28:12,000
legally talk about this because maybe I

4088
02:28:10,318 --> 02:28:13,199
won't lose my job now maybe I won't lose

4089
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:15,239
my kids or maybe I won't have my house

4090
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:16,880
rated or whatever it is so it's like the

4091
02:28:15,239 --> 02:28:18,239
freedoms that we gain by having

4092
02:28:16,879 --> 02:28:20,599
regulation move the right direction

4093
02:28:18,239 --> 02:28:22,719
allow us to l and some of those

4094
02:28:20,600 --> 02:28:24,600
stressors that are related to or not

4095
02:28:22,719 --> 02:28:26,840
related to even the use of the plant

4096
02:28:24,600 --> 02:28:27,640
just the absolutely living with the laws

4097
02:28:26,840 --> 02:28:30,398
around

4098
02:28:27,639 --> 02:28:33,159
it absolutely I couldn't agree more with

4099
02:28:30,398 --> 02:28:34,599
what you said that uh and uh honestly I

4100
02:28:33,159 --> 02:28:36,318
feel like that's that's a great note to

4101
02:28:34,600 --> 02:28:39,200
start wrapping up the show here I do

4102
02:28:36,318 --> 02:28:41,719
like to always ask a few um sort of

4103
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:43,079
ubiquitous cannabis podcast questions uh

4104
02:28:41,719 --> 02:28:45,239
towards the end of the show because I

4105
02:28:43,079 --> 02:28:48,079
find them to be just a fun way to wrap

4106
02:28:45,239 --> 02:28:51,318
up and uh get the same same questions

4107
02:28:48,079 --> 02:28:53,279
out to everyone um so uh what what would

4108
02:28:51,318 --> 02:28:54,920
be your favorite strain of all time like

4109
02:28:53,279 --> 02:28:58,399
your desert island

4110
02:28:54,920 --> 02:29:02,680
strain right now I'd have to say Donnie

4111
02:28:58,398 --> 02:29:06,358
Burger nice uh is it for effects uh

4112
02:29:02,680 --> 02:29:09,159
flavor um it's the effect it's so strong

4113
02:29:06,359 --> 02:29:14,120
it's so strong and it's just like

4114
02:29:09,159 --> 02:29:16,439
um I really do like a a potent just like

4115
02:29:14,120 --> 02:29:18,160
fully even though I might use it during

4116
02:29:16,439 --> 02:29:19,760
the daytime for the most part it's going

4117
02:29:18,159 --> 02:29:21,079
to be a night time like hang out on the

4118
02:29:19,760 --> 02:29:23,960
couch watch something with the wife

4119
02:29:21,079 --> 02:29:27,200
maybe eat a little dinner um it relieves

4120
02:29:23,959 --> 02:29:29,438
pain very very strong it's so sedating

4121
02:29:27,200 --> 02:29:31,000
and like I said I'm kind of a chatty guy

4122
02:29:29,439 --> 02:29:33,960
it's one of the ones the rare ones that

4123
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:36,559
can kind of allow me to just like Zen

4124
02:29:33,959 --> 02:29:39,438
out and not feel like I have to talk or

4125
02:29:36,559 --> 02:29:41,639
think about something to say or uh you

4126
02:29:39,439 --> 02:29:43,120
know whatever it is it's just more of a

4127
02:29:41,639 --> 02:29:44,799
I almost joke that it feels like you got

4128
02:29:43,120 --> 02:29:47,120
whopped over the head with like a Nerf

4129
02:29:44,799 --> 02:29:48,318
bat and uh maybe it's because my Spanish

4130
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:49,640
teacher used to like literally do that

4131
02:29:48,318 --> 02:29:50,600
to people and she didn't wouldn't do it

4132
02:29:49,639 --> 02:29:52,599
hard

4133
02:29:50,600 --> 02:29:54,960
but she had like a a little it was like

4134
02:29:52,600 --> 02:29:56,680
a plastic bat and it had like a a foam

4135
02:29:54,959 --> 02:29:57,799
cover around it and she would like whack

4136
02:29:56,680 --> 02:29:59,800
people over the head with it if they

4137
02:29:57,799 --> 02:30:02,039
like one kid fell asleep and she whopped

4138
02:29:59,799 --> 02:30:04,879
him with it popped him oh that's funny

4139
02:30:02,040 --> 02:30:06,240
yeah old days man but uh she never even

4140
02:30:04,879 --> 02:30:09,079
got in any any amount of trouble for

4141
02:30:06,239 --> 02:30:10,520
that but uh it's just funny to but some

4142
02:30:09,079 --> 02:30:12,478
strains like when I take a hit of it

4143
02:30:10,520 --> 02:30:13,880
like it almost feels like a tingle the

4144
02:30:12,478 --> 02:30:14,959
reason I say that is it almost like hits

4145
02:30:13,879 --> 02:30:16,239
me like right here on the front of the

4146
02:30:14,959 --> 02:30:18,159
forehead and then like that tingly

4147
02:30:16,239 --> 02:30:20,199
feeling almost like like have you ever

4148
02:30:18,159 --> 02:30:22,879
ever been punched like that's not a

4149
02:30:20,200 --> 02:30:25,439
great feeling but like the U sensation

4150
02:30:22,879 --> 02:30:28,079
of something the pain or like the

4151
02:30:25,439 --> 02:30:29,920
reaction of like you know it it travels

4152
02:30:28,079 --> 02:30:32,600
from like you got hit in your jaw and it

4153
02:30:29,920 --> 02:30:35,478
travels up to your brain your body is

4154
02:30:32,600 --> 02:30:36,880
processing what happened and with a

4155
02:30:35,478 --> 02:30:39,278
punch obviously it sucks but with like

4156
02:30:36,879 --> 02:30:41,239
the bong hit it's like a nice tingly

4157
02:30:39,279 --> 02:30:42,840
like oh I almost got like a like a

4158
02:30:41,239 --> 02:30:44,398
pretty like my wife walked by or

4159
02:30:42,840 --> 02:30:47,000
something like oh I got some tingly like

4160
02:30:44,398 --> 02:30:49,398
a happy tingle going on not just like in

4161
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:50,799
like the nether regions but like in your

4162
02:30:49,398 --> 02:30:52,159
face and like your shoulders and down

4163
02:30:50,799 --> 02:30:55,239
your spine and like in your legs and

4164
02:30:52,159 --> 02:30:57,520
like it can extend to all parts of your

4165
02:30:55,239 --> 02:31:01,000
body but not even just the tinglin but

4166
02:30:57,520 --> 02:31:03,800
sort of the um decrease inflammation

4167
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:06,279
which I think helps with the pain um cuz

4168
02:31:03,799 --> 02:31:09,159
I have I work out a fair amount and I'm

4169
02:31:06,279 --> 02:31:10,560
my job is just very active but um yeah

4170
02:31:09,159 --> 02:31:12,760
that that's the main reason pain relief

4171
02:31:10,559 --> 02:31:14,760
relaxation and just Ultra potency like

4172
02:31:12,760 --> 02:31:17,840
it's probably as close to a 10 out of 10

4173
02:31:14,760 --> 02:31:20,279
without being like a fi fickle chem 91

4174
02:31:17,840 --> 02:31:22,318
as I can come across in terms of like

4175
02:31:20,279 --> 02:31:24,040
that sedating side of things and the

4176
02:31:22,318 --> 02:31:26,799
uplifting side of things like Jack the

4177
02:31:24,040 --> 02:31:29,520
Ripper would be like the super super

4178
02:31:26,799 --> 02:31:30,920
high like crazy uplifting Rippy sativa

4179
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:32,880
that's like I'm so paranoid my heart's

4180
02:31:30,920 --> 02:31:34,079
like like what's going on it's just weed

4181
02:31:32,879 --> 02:31:37,438
man take a breath you're going to be

4182
02:31:34,079 --> 02:31:40,879
fine for sure awesome those are great

4183
02:31:37,439 --> 02:31:42,200
answers um and then uh so as a followup

4184
02:31:40,879 --> 02:31:44,920
to that one who would be your favorite

4185
02:31:42,200 --> 02:31:46,640
breeder of all time I'd have to give it

4186
02:31:44,920 --> 02:31:49,318
to subcool even though he's not selling

4187
02:31:46,639 --> 02:31:50,719
seeds anymore um if it we're talking

4188
02:31:49,318 --> 02:31:52,239
about some could get seeds from right

4189
02:31:50,719 --> 02:31:54,398
now it be skunk house genetics because

4190
02:31:52,239 --> 02:31:56,000
the Burger work Donnie burger and

4191
02:31:54,398 --> 02:31:58,159
otherwise I think all of the burgers are

4192
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:00,799
good double burger triple Burger uh Han

4193
02:31:58,159 --> 02:32:02,600
Solo Burger they're basically a really

4194
02:32:00,799 --> 02:32:08,159
good representation of what happens when

4195
02:32:02,600 --> 02:32:10,559
you cross together um a good OG with a

4196
02:32:08,159 --> 02:32:14,760
basically mix of cookies and cams like

4197
02:32:10,559 --> 02:32:17,398
the GMO is a garlic cookies from mamiko

4198
02:32:14,760 --> 02:32:19,398
seeds and the guy skunk Master Flex

4199
02:32:17,398 --> 02:32:20,398
bought that found the feno that became

4200
02:32:19,398 --> 02:32:22,000
GMO

4201
02:32:20,398 --> 02:32:25,079
which is you know just the garlic

4202
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:26,959
cookies from them which is a GMO to chem

4203
02:32:25,079 --> 02:32:29,559
4 or chem D I can't remember which chem

4204
02:32:26,959 --> 02:32:32,599
it was and then you cross that into a

4205
02:32:29,559 --> 02:32:34,719
Larry OG f8 male and that Larry OG f8

4206
02:32:32,600 --> 02:32:37,720
just brings like power and Frost and

4207
02:32:34,719 --> 02:32:40,478
Funk and the combination of the GMO and

4208
02:32:37,719 --> 02:32:42,239
that Laro gf8 made that Han Solo and

4209
02:32:40,478 --> 02:32:45,199
then he crossed it back to the GMO which

4210
02:32:42,239 --> 02:32:46,799
made the Donnie burger and any of the

4211
02:32:45,200 --> 02:32:49,640
burgers they're just combinations of

4212
02:32:46,799 --> 02:32:51,398
basically all that genetic and um it

4213
02:32:49,639 --> 02:32:53,239
just Works in my endoc cannaboid system

4214
02:32:51,398 --> 02:32:55,239
and I tend to find a lot of people it's

4215
02:32:53,239 --> 02:32:58,318
like it might put them to sleep in half

4216
02:32:55,239 --> 02:33:00,639
an hour but it's a a strong potency

4217
02:32:58,318 --> 02:33:02,920
almost across the board and yeah that

4218
02:33:00,639 --> 02:33:04,358
that guy breeds nothing but fire and I

4219
02:33:02,920 --> 02:33:07,120
don't know anybody else really that BR

4220
02:33:04,359 --> 02:33:10,680
anything to f8 that used that male to

4221
02:33:07,120 --> 02:33:12,880
such solid effect like his work really

4222
02:33:10,680 --> 02:33:15,680
seemed to pay off and in

4223
02:33:12,879 --> 02:33:17,278
Spades absolutely I I feel like burgers

4224
02:33:15,680 --> 02:33:19,920
are one of one of my favorites when it

4225
02:33:17,279 --> 02:33:22,920
comes to like a gassy or a funky strain

4226
02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:25,398
um and yeah Donnie is the one that I

4227
02:33:22,920 --> 02:33:28,439
haven't tried unfortunately but I've

4228
02:33:25,398 --> 02:33:29,879
always heard good things about it um

4229
02:33:28,439 --> 02:33:31,279
yeah that's that's awesome to hear

4230
02:33:29,879 --> 02:33:33,839
that's when I got F2 I've got like five

4231
02:33:31,279 --> 02:33:36,640
seeds of it left so girl's out and make

4232
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:38,398
some f and send them out yeah share them

4233
02:33:36,639 --> 02:33:39,439
with their Community absolutely I don't

4234
02:33:38,398 --> 02:33:42,079
think he sells it anymore I wouldn't

4235
02:33:39,439 --> 02:33:44,760
want to like step on his toes if he is

4236
02:33:42,079 --> 02:33:46,200
selling no I don't I think I even looked

4237
02:33:44,760 --> 02:33:48,639
like I think it hasn't been available

4238
02:33:46,200 --> 02:33:50,200
for many years at this point

4239
02:33:48,639 --> 02:33:52,680
unfortunately

4240
02:33:50,200 --> 02:33:55,319
um all right so just one last question

4241
02:33:52,680 --> 02:33:59,398
then uh what has been your most uh

4242
02:33:55,318 --> 02:34:02,799
memorable smoking or cannabis related

4243
02:33:59,398 --> 02:34:04,959
experience that had to be growing out

4244
02:34:02,799 --> 02:34:07,559
some of subcool strains and then meeting

4245
02:34:04,959 --> 02:34:10,239
Tommy Chong my wife won a Instagram

4246
02:34:07,559 --> 02:34:12,079
contest and uh we got to go meet Tommy

4247
02:34:10,239 --> 02:34:14,119
Chong at L Cafe which is like the first

4248
02:34:12,079 --> 02:34:15,600
Cannabis Cafe in Hollywood that was

4249
02:34:14,120 --> 02:34:17,720
legally allowed to smoke in like in

4250
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:18,960
public and it's like going to a bar like

4251
02:34:17,719 --> 02:34:20,719
I brought my own weed so I had to pay an

4252
02:34:18,959 --> 02:34:22,839
unbottle fee like how you pay an

4253
02:34:20,719 --> 02:34:24,079
uncorking fee if you bring your own wine

4254
02:34:22,840 --> 02:34:26,200
so I did that cuz I didn't want to buy

4255
02:34:24,079 --> 02:34:28,120
their [ __ ] and I had pre-rolled like a

4256
02:34:26,200 --> 02:34:30,960
box full of joints and I had a

4257
02:34:28,120 --> 02:34:32,600
strawberry daquiri and I had Chernobyl

4258
02:34:30,959 --> 02:34:34,278
so like a really strawberry flavored and

4259
02:34:32,600 --> 02:34:35,880
then like a kind of almost like a

4260
02:34:34,279 --> 02:34:38,079
margarita like lemon lime slurpie

4261
02:34:35,879 --> 02:34:39,438
flavored and they're both more uplifting

4262
02:34:38,079 --> 02:34:42,239
it was the daytime so I was like you

4263
02:34:39,439 --> 02:34:43,960
know good smell good flavor and really

4264
02:34:42,239 --> 02:34:45,879
potent on both of them and they both

4265
02:34:43,959 --> 02:34:47,358
just the flavors rang true and like my

4266
02:34:45,879 --> 02:34:48,679
wife was the one who won so there was 10

4267
02:34:47,359 --> 02:34:50,040
people at the table there's like five

4268
02:34:48,680 --> 02:34:51,439
seats on each side or whatever and like

4269
02:34:50,040 --> 02:34:54,240
Tommy Chong like one of the other

4270
02:34:51,439 --> 02:34:55,639
promoters or whatever and there was no

4271
02:34:54,239 --> 02:34:56,600
seats at the end of the table and so

4272
02:34:55,639 --> 02:34:57,959
like I wasn't supposed to I was just

4273
02:34:56,600 --> 02:34:59,000
sitting there like watching like them

4274
02:34:57,959 --> 02:35:01,398
all smoke or whatever and like within

4275
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:02,719
like half an hour my wife comes over and

4276
02:35:01,398 --> 02:35:03,680
she grabs a few of my joints and she's

4277
02:35:02,719 --> 02:35:05,199
smoking them and they're like whose

4278
02:35:03,680 --> 02:35:06,680
joints are these like blah blah blah oh

4279
02:35:05,200 --> 02:35:08,520
that's my husband like he grew it blah

4280
02:35:06,680 --> 02:35:10,318
blah blah and so they invite me over to

4281
02:35:08,520 --> 02:35:11,760
the table and they pull up a t a chair

4282
02:35:10,318 --> 02:35:12,840
at the end so I got to sit and smoke

4283
02:35:11,760 --> 02:35:15,279
joints with Tommy Chong for like the

4284
02:35:12,840 --> 02:35:17,639
next three hours and uh he was like the

4285
02:35:15,279 --> 02:35:19,319
exact guy you expect from the movies and

4286
02:35:17,639 --> 02:35:21,358
TV shows interviews he's actually come

4287
02:35:19,318 --> 02:35:23,519
on and podcast I bet you if you ask him

4288
02:35:21,359 --> 02:35:25,359
he'd come on potentially he's done the

4289
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:27,000
uh we should probably ask him to come on

4290
02:35:25,359 --> 02:35:29,120
he's so cool he's getting older so got

4291
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:31,680
to get him on at some point but he did

4292
02:35:29,120 --> 02:35:32,960
um some of the European or european

4293
02:35:31,680 --> 02:35:35,120
buddies I can't remember if it was

4294
02:35:32,959 --> 02:35:37,719
Percy's grow room or one of the other

4295
02:35:35,120 --> 02:35:39,840
guys over there um but he's been on

4296
02:35:37,719 --> 02:35:41,478
their show a couple times actually and

4297
02:35:39,840 --> 02:35:43,279
yeah he was super cool like they say

4298
02:35:41,478 --> 02:35:45,239
don't meet your heroes or whatever um

4299
02:35:43,279 --> 02:35:46,760
because often times you get let down

4300
02:35:45,239 --> 02:35:47,959
like their personality is not as maybe

4301
02:35:46,760 --> 02:35:49,639
they're busy maybe they're hungry maybe

4302
02:35:47,959 --> 02:35:51,079
they're tired maybe they just have met

4303
02:35:49,639 --> 02:35:52,079
way too many people then get swarmed

4304
02:35:51,079 --> 02:35:53,719
with hey can I get a picture can I get

4305
02:35:52,079 --> 02:35:54,959
an autograph this and that I get it I

4306
02:35:53,719 --> 02:35:56,959
would never ever want to actually be

4307
02:35:54,959 --> 02:35:58,318
famous like give me all the riches sure

4308
02:35:56,959 --> 02:36:00,039
but I would never want to be famous it

4309
02:35:58,318 --> 02:36:03,039
seemed almost like a curse at this point

4310
02:36:00,040 --> 02:36:04,960
in many cases it ruins a lot of lives so

4311
02:36:03,040 --> 02:36:06,960
I get them not wanting to have that

4312
02:36:04,959 --> 02:36:08,519
interaction but Tommy Jong was the

4313
02:36:06,959 --> 02:36:10,398
opposite of that and in the Cannabis

4314
02:36:08,520 --> 02:36:13,560
space I think he's on Mount Rushmore for

4315
02:36:10,398 --> 02:36:16,318
me it'd be like him Willie Nelson Snoop

4316
02:36:13,559 --> 02:36:17,920
and uh I don't know some others but yeah

4317
02:36:16,318 --> 02:36:19,278
he's definitely way up there and the

4318
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:21,040
fact that I even met him that wouldn't

4319
02:36:19,279 --> 02:36:22,399
even have been on my bucket list like I

4320
02:36:21,040 --> 02:36:23,920
grew up watching his movies and stuff

4321
02:36:22,398 --> 02:36:25,318
and never thought I could meet him and

4322
02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:26,600
let alone smoke with him for like hours

4323
02:36:25,318 --> 02:36:28,039
and have that kind of real human

4324
02:36:26,600 --> 02:36:29,800
connection especially with stuff that I

4325
02:36:28,040 --> 02:36:31,520
grew myself that like he was blown away

4326
02:36:29,799 --> 02:36:32,920
by and like I got a they caught him on

4327
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:35,040
video like smelling the jar and like he

4328
02:36:32,920 --> 02:36:37,279
had a really big smile I's like what woo

4329
02:36:35,040 --> 02:36:38,279
like he's impressed by I was just like

4330
02:36:37,279 --> 02:36:40,760
damn this dude has been smoking for a

4331
02:36:38,279 --> 02:36:42,120
long time he thinks my shit's good I I

4332
02:36:40,760 --> 02:36:43,920
thought it was good right like I'm like

4333
02:36:42,120 --> 02:36:45,479
oh I grow good stuff right but like to

4334
02:36:43,920 --> 02:36:47,279
see somebody like that give a good

4335
02:36:45,478 --> 02:36:50,159
reaction it was almost like a big pat on

4336
02:36:47,279 --> 02:36:51,800
the back for me for sure I mean to me

4337

4338
02:36:51,799 --> 02:36:55,759
commercial 10 out of 10 and that's what

4339
02:36:54,600 --> 02:36:57,120
the commercial guy who was there with

4340
02:36:55,760 --> 02:36:58,800
him who had like a 10 lighter and 100

4341
02:36:57,120 --> 02:37:00,520

4347
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:10,959

comments and and people on the internet

4349
02:37:10,959 --> 02:37:14,278
