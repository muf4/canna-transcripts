know it's been pretty busy at the uh

13
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:42,599
cultivation facility that I work at and

14
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:45,160
um we've just been trying to perfect

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,359
every little thing so uh it's great to

16
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:50,759
have some like-minded perfectionists in

17
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:52,320
the building uh talking about some some

18
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,878
gross stuff today well I'll be

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,520
completely honest not having had plants

20
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,558
in the ground for a couple of months now

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,840
I've uh I've started I've started to get

22
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:04,000
the itch so I'm I'm looking forward to

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,320
talking shop for sure for sure well you

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
know like right off the bat then because

25
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,438
it feels as though there's been some new

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,920
stuff in your grow world lately why

27
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:13,478
don't you both talk about a little bit

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,079
of what you've been doing over the past

29
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:19,599
few months and uh how you've uh slowly

30
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:22,959
taken down the one big old flowering

31
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:26,879
room and done something else with

32
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:28,879
it so um I don't I don't know how many

33
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,239
of uh your viewers are going to going to

34
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,640
recognize me from a pre previous

35
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:36,759
iteration of what I did um I'm shark

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,478
most farms uh previously on Instagram um

37
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:40,200
and you know obviously my whole thing

38
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,478
was cultivation education made

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,640
accessible to the average hom grower you

40
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,679
know I like to take complex subjects and

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,879
break them down and distill them into

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,640
actionable executable um topics that we

43
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:53,679
we were all capable of going right now

44
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,118
down into our tent or our grow room and

45
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,799
and and implementing and seeing seeing

46
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:01,039
some progress and Improvement in in our

47
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,600
Sops over what we had been doing

48
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:05,759
previously um unfortunately as I'm sure

49
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,598
all of us are are quite familiar with

50
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,439
Instagram's

51
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,200
um random decision- making processes

52
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:14,519
when it comes to what is and what isn't

53
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:17,639
allowed as far as content U my page went

54
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:20,840
down without any warning whatsoever uh

55
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:24,399
back in November with 92,000

56
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,959
followers um and I had made the decision

57
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,439
after that had happened that you know it

58
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,400
it was unlikely that it'd be able to to

59
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,519
regain

60
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,159
the same kind of momentum that I had hit

61
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,560
a few years previously that allowed me

62
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:40,959
to grow to that stage um and as

63
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,319
unfortunate as as it it was it felt like

64
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,360
an opportunity to to push myself a

65
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:48,000
little further into something new into

66
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,000
something um more sustainable from you

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,360
know a a social aspect and an

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,519
educational

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,959
aspect pardon me but also feels like

70
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,360
that's where the industry is heading and

71
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,640
I've always prided myself on trying to

72
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,080
be on The Cutting Edge of of where we

73
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,719
were going and where we were trying to

74
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,080
be as as an industry as a as a niche as

75
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:11,719
a market um so tissue culture felt like

76
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,680
the next logical step um and from a

77
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:16,239
functional perspective it just felt like

78
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,640
the right move to transition that one

79
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,878
big flower room um that when it came

80
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,798
down to it you know just ended up

81
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:26,000
producing flower for myself and flower

82
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:28,040
Fox uh on a personal level um

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,239
transitioning that room into a

84
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:34,199
micropropagation and tissue culture in

85
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:38,120
myum lab where flower Fox can continue

86
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:40,639
to to cultivate not only you know new

87
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,080
phenotypes that we're getting from from

88
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,238
you know various breeders that we like

89
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,680
to work with but also some of the tissue

90
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,039
culture samples that I'll be pulling out

91
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,879
of my lab and it seems like a pretty

92
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:52,239
seamless transition to go from you know

93
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:54,560
educating like you had alluded to

94
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,640
earlier the the level of perfectionism

95
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,239
that I like to bring to the table going

96
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:02,119
from cultivation to to where I believe

97
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,519
the market will end up being based on

98
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,360
what we're seeing today in in in the

99
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,480
industry um into tissue culture and try

100
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,519
and and and bring some of you over with

101
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:15,759
me um earlier on in the

102
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:18,560
game right on right on and what about

103
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,639
the on the uh melum side of

104
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,639
things so that's been something I've

105
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,800
wanted to do for quite some time I'm

106
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,960
actually I'm very excited that he's

107
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,520
turned it into a tissue culture lab and

108
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:32,638
I love watching and learning and I think

109
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:35,599
it's a great step forward and like it

110
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,879
was absolutely unfortunate what

111
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,800
Instagram did but I think it was the

112
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:44,600
perfect time to have it and I'm super

113
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,520
excited for what's next um I'm also very

114
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,639
happy that I get to use that space for

115
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,879
mycelium this is something so new to me

116
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,120
but it's something that I wanted to do

117
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:54,038
for a long time now I just didn't have

118
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,000
the proper space or environment to do it

119
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:58,839
you also have previous experience with

120
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,600
mushrooms just not in not in a lab

121
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:03,959
setting

122
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,840
like I just tried to grow them in a tent

123
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:07,399
downstairs and I didn't have my

124
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:10,758
temperatures right but I did enjoy it

125
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:12,519
and I got some gorgeous like huge great

126
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:15,319
oyster mushrooms I did Lions man I did

127
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:18,120
turkey tail before so I did spend a

128
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:21,399
little bit of time last year doing that

129
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm excited to continue on yeah I love

130
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:24,478
that it's it's kind of this dual

131
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,800
functionality where anything that you

132
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:29,079
need to just use uh like a septic

133
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,120
technique you can kind of just bust out

134
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:32,959
the flow Hood get right to it you

135
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,160
already have your procedures in place so

136
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,638
it's just a nice transition either

137
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,960
absolutely great that we can both use

138
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,840
the space which is really exciting as

139
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:44,879
well well and as you you just mentioned

140
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:47,918
is a lot of the Sops are directly

141
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:50,079
transitional to to um you know both

142
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:53,680
functions which is nice to be able to

143
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:56,159
you know if I'm if I'm implementing um a

144
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,720
specific D scrub technique for example

145
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,880
that that I'll be utilizing for my

146
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,759
tissue culture the same thing will apply

147
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:03,639
to to what what she's doing when

148
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,720
entering the room as well so there's

149
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:08,120
there's a lot of direct crossover

150
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,520
there's a lot of um you know learning

151
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:14,560
opportunity on on on both side to to

152
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:17,318
sort of um cross paths and and and and

153
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,720
pick up a new sort of area of expertise

154
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:21,039
if you will for both of us which is

155
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,680
always always nice to add tools to the

156
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:26,560
toolbox for sure well I mean um let's

157
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,918
let's start at where the toolbox started

158
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,879
then and uh let's go back to what were

159
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:35,799
some of your first experiences with

160
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:38,079
plants in general um uh I like to you

161
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,960
know say sometimes cannabis starts the

162
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,359
journey into vegetables and sometimes

163
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:44,758
it's vegetables that you have your first

164
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,840
experience with with Grandma or mom or

165
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:50,680
dad or some relative or some friend um

166
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:54,159
so where did uh cultivation start for

167
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:57,840
both of you well quite honestly

168
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:01,199
Nicole's flower fox has been the expert

169
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:03,638
um when it came to PL long before I I

170
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,160
ever even show showed uh you know any

171
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,720
any specific aptitude for it um when we

172
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,919
were you know young kids she was she was

173
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,680
doing her thing at a at a at a nursery

174
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:15,680
you know teaching me about house plants

175
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,400
and and and and how to how to work in

176
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,319
the garden and and you know she's got

177
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:22,679
family lineage who work in horiculture

178
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,199
so I'll let her take that that one um

179
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,199
and go with it and then we can get to me

180
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:28,960
after for

181
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,038
sure yeah so gardening is definitely in

182
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,079
my blood

183
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:35,279
um my first job was at a nursery and I

184
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:37,038
spent many years there and I learned all

185
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,959
a lot about tropical plans and penals

186
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,598
and

187
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:44,918
annuals um now he took the leap first

188
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:47,199
into the Cannabis journey and I kind of

189
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:49,959
stood back for quite some time and just

190
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,000
observed and watched what he was doing

191
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:54,279
and then I started mixing nutrients and

192
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,240
then I guess I got more and more

193
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:59,799
involved and then I wanted to take off

194
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:03,280
and grow my own plants and it's been

195
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:06,360
quite the journey but I'm so glad that

196
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:09,318
he started first and convinced me to

197
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:13,080
start growing as well he's been a huge

198
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:14,759
motivation and he through all of this

199
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,478
with my

200
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,759
endless and so on and

201
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:22,318
so how long do you think you guys have

202
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,280
been growing then I've been throwing bag

203
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,360
seed into the ground since I was a

204
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:29,598
teenager when my stepdad would you know

205
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,280
he like we we'd go gorilla seed the the

206
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,278
the forest in our backyard or whatever

207
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,240
and it was you know it's always fun to

208
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,038
come back in in August and see like you

209
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,038
know this this six foot tall plant that

210
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:42,038
you obviously I wasn't paying very much

211
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:44,399
attention to but it it sets that sort of

212
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:46,360
internal seed for you of like you know

213
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,839
falling in love with the process right

214
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:52,720
understanding the timelines and all that

215
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:55,399
but um about eight years ago

216
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,040
um you we had just like everybody else

217
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:58,440
had gotten sick and tired of running

218
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,599
back and forth to the plug to The

219
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,120
Dispensary hey sure we'll give it a shot

220
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,879
to try her hand up growing how hard

221
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,560
could it be right we we'll put two

222
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:09,919
plants in the ground

223
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:13,159
and the the immediacy with which I was

224
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,559
humbled um from my original idea with

225
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:18,120
what it was going to be to how it turned

226
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:20,799
out was was more of a driver than

227
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,399
anything else for me right and and I as

228
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,359
you could probably tell I'm a little bit

229
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,399
obsessive when I when I when I latch on

230
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,919
to something and trying to understand

231
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:32,720
why it wasn't exactly what I thought it

232
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:35,559
was going to be became became the the

233
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,639
the inherent driver for me and from that

234
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:40,599
moment on it's never really been about

235
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,199
the plants for me I guess it's always

236
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,120
been about the process getting to the

237
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,480
plants and I love cannabis I love flower

238
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,759
but more than that I love I love the

239
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,839
intricacies of the process the biology

240
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:56,480
the physiology um the physics involved

241
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:58,560
the chemistry involved it's all so

242
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,079
fractal and and and you can keep going

243
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,119
further and further fur and further and

244
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:06,278
there's always a new thing to ah aha

245
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:09,000
that's why um so I I guess where this

246
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:11,200
all started was the inability to access

247
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,639
any of that information right you'd go

248
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,720
on seven or eight years ago to to to

249
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:19,600
Reddit or roll it up 420 and you ask any

250
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,560
question you put up you'd get 35

251
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,000
different answers none of which were

252
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:26,199
based in in any sort of empirical

253
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,120
evidence all of just all of which were

254
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,200
just anecdotal opinions from people who

255
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,600
had exper experienced something that

256
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,879
looked potentially similar right um and

257
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,879
that for me was an immediate red flag

258
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,639
like okay well like you can go anywhere

259
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:41,439
in agriculture and and find very

260
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,480
specifically what any of the

261
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,399
functionalities of the planter are from

262
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:49,399
a from a you know a a microscopic level

263
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:51,440
and we can't do that here and I know

264
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,879
that in Canada specifically especially

265
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,079
during the early 2000s there was tons of

266
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:57,519
research it just wasn't available we

267
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:01,679
couldn't get it we didn't know where to

268
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,839
find it um so I started chasing it and

269
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:07,599
basically found the need to reverse

270
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,320
engineer a botany degree um from the

271
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,680
topics you know I'd start at a very high

272
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:15,278
level topic and and I'd read through a

273
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:16,799
peer reviewed paper and I'd come up to a

274
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:18,399
you know a segment of that paper that I

275
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,000
didn't understand what I was reading so

276
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,839
I'd have to go back and now I'm reading

277
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,759
a peer-reviewed paper on what this this

278
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:26,399
subject is and I oh I don't understand

279
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:28,078
something here and we just kept going

280
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,519
back and back and back till you know I

281
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:33,838
found myself back in 11 chemistry again

282
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,159
um understanding what photosynthesis

283
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,320
actually was and how it drove uh various

284
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,838
systems within the plant and that for me

285
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,879
is just what what I find most

286
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,839
enthralling about about growing in

287
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:49,000
general for sure I um I can agree with

288
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:51,360
that wholeheartedly it seems like there

289
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,559
was not a lot of accessible information

290
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,759
early on and when like because there was

291
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:59,278
information out there but the

292
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:02,439
application to cannabis seemed so

293
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:04,399
esoteric it was made to almost seem like

294
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,360
there was this magic happening when it's

295
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,600
just another plant and it just does the

296
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:12,000
same things other plants do but it

297
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:14,560
assimilates nutrients in its own way um

298
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,278
and so like one of the books that like

299
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:19,838
was available earlier was something like

300
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,360
plant empowerment but no one told you to

301
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,680
go and look at plant empowerment and

302
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,199
then start applying that to your

303
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:27,879
cannabis and boom all your Greenhouse

304
00:12:25,198 --> 00:12:30,078
yields start skyrocketing and all your

305
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:32,559
indoor Environmental parameters are that

306
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:37,078
much tighter and it

307
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:40,039
it seem like it was hard quite

308
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:43,519
honestly sorry I also asking the

309
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:45,240
question like asking anyone back then

310
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,039
like nobody wanted to help nobody want

311
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,079
to tell you anything every so is

312
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:52,958
everyone's so set in their ways too so

313
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:54,719
even now that's that's that's such a

314
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:58,078
great point is that even now it's such

315
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,800
an ego-driven industry that that it it's

316
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:03,479
almost like taboo to

317
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,319
to admit that you don't understand a

318
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,120
specific aspect of of what you're doing

319
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,600
and and to just sort of power through it

320
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,000
so that nobody else knows that you don't

321
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,600
know what you're doing and that it

322
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,759
builds this this entire

323
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:21,000
generational um sort of foundation of

324
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:22,600
anecdotal experience based on nothing

325
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,039
but guesswork because everybody's too

326
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,920
afraid to sort of asked the question and

327
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:28,759
it's such a great point is not only even

328
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:32,360
back then but even now like a lot of

329
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:34,039
people are are oh yeah I knew that um

330
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,800
and just sort of brush past it without

331
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:40,240
ever trying to actually understand it

332
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:45,078
whereas you know for us we find that

333
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:47,399
that being wrong is not is not a that's

334
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:49,439
not a a knock on your skill set it's not

335
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:53,078
a it's not a it's not a weakness to

336
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,480
towards your personality it's it's it's

337
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:57,000
what science is right being being wrong

338
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,360
means we now get to find the right

339
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,198
answer so you know whatever that answer

340
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,399
is we'll just chase the data down and it

341
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:05,719
doesn't impact me personally I'll just

342
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:08,278
I'll just you know

343
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,680
adjust figure it out based on what the

344
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:13,720
data tells us yeah absolutely it it was

345
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,719
UN it's unfortunate how much of it is

346
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,360
like a fake it till you make it

347
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,240
mentality and too many people are

348
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,560
ego-driven in this industry because I

349
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,879
feel like there's

350
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,919
uh there's this thing with branding

351
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:29,480
where you have to have this personality

352
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:31,278
and because so much of what's going on

353
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,959
right now in the industry is you have to

354
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:35,240
have branding to make sure that people

355
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:37,919
remember your face when Instagram takes

356
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,839
you down one day and you have to pop up

357
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,639
with a new account the next day and have

358
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,839
the same people be able to come and find

359
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:47,720
you it you know it's things like that

360
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:50,839
that limit our ability to just maintain

361
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,399
some sort of uh honest reputation in

362
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:56,920
certain aspects and that's that's really

363
00:14:53,399 --> 00:15:00,399
frustrating and I I it is hard then to

364
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:02,240
even continue to try to to share like

365
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,839
applicable knowledge when people have

366
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,720
encampments that they're sitting in

367
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,480
saying oh well this is better than that

368
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,639
or how do you know what you're talking

369
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,800
about you know I I grow organic you

370
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:13,959
don't know what you're talking about you

371
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,639
grow in with salts and I'm like I sure I

372
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:19,278
have no idea what I'm talking about

373
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:22,039
that's then try try and come at that try

374
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:24,039
and come at that perspective as as as a

375
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:27,480
as a woman as I imagine flower fox has

376
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:30,039
to deal with you know trying trying to

377
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,800
have to validate yourself simply because

378
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:33,879
you know we're in such a such a

379
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:36,198
male-dominated industry where ego is

380
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:37,679
such a big driver of the fact and oh

381
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:39,679
here comes this little girl what could

382
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,879
she possibly know about when you know in

383
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:45,599
fact she's she's a phenomenal cultivator

384
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,720
who knows more about the in in intrinsic

385
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,399
sees about uh

386
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,480
about uh you know every facet of of of

387
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,679
the plant then a lot of the people I've

388
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,399
I've had the pleasure of encountering so

389
00:15:54,679 --> 00:16:00,000
there's just there's such weird um

390
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:02,360
unnecessary entries to barrier for so

391
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,399
many different groups of people in this

392
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,800
industry that um I think are so easily

393
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:11,440
knocked down when we when we eliminate

394
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:14,559
the veils of of you know the aesthetic

395
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,360
we all try to hold up here for sure well

396
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:18,958
let's take it back a little bit then to

397
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,639
when you both uh started cultivating

398
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,159
cannabis it sounds like shark you were

399
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,799
kind of taking that dive first but what

400
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:26,679
were some of those first harvests like

401
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:29,318
and when did you guys find some really

402
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:32,078
good success with with what you uh

403
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:32,078
experimenting

404
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:41,440
with cool what was your first harvest

405
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:44,600
like well my first harvest um I tried to

406
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,160
like fully let him let me take the lead

407
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,480
and I I I was a little stubborn and I

408
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:54,439
guess I should listen more and I was

409
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:56,319
hanging my plants off the rafters at the

410
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:01,480
thing as I let everything stretch and I

411
00:16:56,318 --> 00:17:04,159
didn't listen but I must say that like

412
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:07,959
with every grow I learned so much I made

413
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:11,480
a lot of mistakes and each grow was

414
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:14,880
unbelievably better than the last and

415
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,959
it's only gone up since then so and I'm

416
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,600
all I'm all about the con constru

417
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,759
criticism

418
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:24,198
now from the very from the very

419
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:26,400
beginning when I started you know making

420
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:28,160
an attempt at at doing this seriously

421
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,320
and and deciding that this is what I was

422
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,080
going to be that I wanted to do I had it

423
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,359
in my head that this was going to be

424
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:36,159
data driven one way or another you know

425
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:38,079
no matter how rudimentary that data

426
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,160
started out being was that I was going

427
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,480
to be able to implement some some form

428
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,440
of repeatability here and and and I

429
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,558
wanted predictability in my sop so that

430
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:51,360
I knew no matter how bad this first one

431
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:54,519
ended up being right no matter how Grand

432
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,279
grandiose my my my idea was that it was

433
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:57,639
going to turn out to be that at the end

434
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:00,279
I'd be able to look back and say well

435
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:03,038
this is exactly what I did to get here

436
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:05,960
um and this is what I feel worked versus

437
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:07,158
this is what I feel didn't work now

438
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,720
obviously

439
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:12,080
without you know a vast pool of

440
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,360
experience and and especially practical

441
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:15,720
experience it's hard to it's hard to sit

442
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,839
there after your first girl and say okay

443
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,880
this is what I did and this is what

444
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:20,480
worked but at least you know when you go

445
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,080
back and you're you're now still reading

446
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,599
things on Reddit and you're asking your

447
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,439
questions on roll it up 420 and and now

448
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:27,678
we're trying different things because

449
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,240
you know people are telling you no this

450
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,919
is the way you should do it and now we

451
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,519
go back and we cross reference okay well

452
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:34,520
I didn't do that the first time and I

453
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:36,599
you know I I saw I saw an improvement

454
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:40,480
here and and you

455
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:42,399
know we start to we start to mitigate

456
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,798
the things we're finding aren't working

457
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:49,960
for us and the more the more I Chas that

458
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:50,960
that repeatability um the more success I

459
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,079
started to

460
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:57,279
find

461
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:59,519
obviously um once I started to

462
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:02,480
understand how power powerful a tool

463
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,440
automation could be towards achieving

464
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,720
that repeatability that's when I started

465
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,519
seeing actual success right and and I

466
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,279
know I catch a lot of flak for it all

467
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:12,359
the time is that um you know not

468
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:13,839
everyone can automate and uh some people

469
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:16,119
like to just connect with their plants

470
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:18,038
and I will never take that away from

471
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:19,639
anybody I'll never I'll never insist

472
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:21,400
that somebody goes spends without

473
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,000
outside of their means in order to to

474
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,000
achieve this this you know 100% dialed

475
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,640
in environment especially if it's just

476
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,880
you know you love to go down and water

477
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,880
your plants but what I will give you is

478
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,400
what the data tells me about automating

479
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:37,760
a space 24 hours a day on a 100

480
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:40,038
different metrics versus a a human being

481
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:43,720
who can't possibly manage that many

482
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:47,798
metrics that that that minutely that

483
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:49,960
often um there is a vast vast difference

484
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:52,918
in in the performance of the plant

485
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:56,120
simply based on on Kinesiology and

486
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:58,038
Physiology um and I can I can fully

487
00:19:56,119 --> 00:20:00,319
agree to that like I was pretty stubborn

488
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:03,759
I loved hand watering I felt that if I

489
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:05,678
gave up hand watering I was not going to

490
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,079
be able to connect and be in that space

491
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,919
But like honestly I'm in my space a

492
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:12,439
million times more and the difference is

493
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:15,240
night and day like I I tried to keep up

494
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,080
even with his Sops like I followed it

495
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,519
into a tea hand watering I was hand

496
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:22,279
watering seven to eight times a day in

497
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:25,440
flower like I wanted to keep up to that

498
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:27,279
and but it just it's it's night and day

499
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,519
it it makes such a difference and you

500
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:32,480
get to actually spend time being there

501
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:34,440
keeping your space clean making sure

502
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,240
everything's and the fact of the matter

503
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,880
is you hear you hear a lot of one of the

504
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,359
bigger arguments against automating a

505
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,000
space from a homeg grower perspective is

506
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:46,279
that they they have this this

507
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,159
romanticized view of of their part in

508
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:50,200
the gardening process and it's it's

509
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,360
spiritual and I I don't I don't want to

510
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:56,000
take away from that but um at the same

511
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:58,639
time what I can say is that you know

512
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,319
automating your space doesn't negate you

513
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,400
you being being a part of the process

514
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:05,759
you're still a driver of that process

515
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,919
you're you're you still have to

516
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:10,319
obviously understand um the nuances of

517
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:12,840
the systems that are that are that are

518
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:16,079
occurring within that plant and and and

519
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:17,918
and curate your program in order to to

520
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:20,759
satiate and and and make those plants

521
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:23,679
happy like this is this

522
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:27,519
is to use their terms connecting with

523
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:29,600
your plants on on on a level that that's

524
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:33,759
even more

525
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:35,759
I want to say um in sync with with what

526
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,158
your plants are are feeling and in tune

527
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:39,798
with with their energy or or or whatever

528
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,400
it is we're trying to achieve because

529
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,720
you know now we're we're we're looking

530
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,159
at

531
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,079
every every minuscule aspect and every

532
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,799
every every tiny function that's

533
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:56,480
happening within that plant on on a on

534
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:58,079
such a a scaled down um perspective that

535
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,759
that you know I've got such a better

536
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:02,519
picture of what my plant is doing versus

537
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:04,480
going in and handw watering and seeing

538
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:06,918
that the leaves are droopy and you know

539
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,319
just sort of feeling the plant which

540
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:12,759
again I don't I don't that guess

541
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:15,000
work like I think it just it's right

542
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:17,000
like Nicole you you you can attest to

543
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,558
the fact that you know it felt like you

544
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,480
were you were more in tune with your

545
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:22,558
plants when you were handw watering

546
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,440
until you started automating that

547
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,359
process and realizing that like now I

548
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:30,400
can read better um you know I know

549
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:33,158
what's going on like I can catch myself

550
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,240
much quicker like I just feel they're

551
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:39,080
much happier my yield

552
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:41,000
is much incredible night day difference

553
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:42,839
like and we have more data on how the

554
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,679
plant is feeling at any given moment

555
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:46,599
which is and I still spend just as much

556
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:48,759
time down there like I don't I don't

557
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:51,158
really see a difference unless you want

558
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:53,158
to right and and and the the other

559
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:55,559
aspect is you know if if if if she

560
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:57,120
needed to go away for a day and a half

561
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:59,399
that's another thing like we've we've

562
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,959
got five kids like some days are crazy

563
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,120
like at least I know my plants are being

564
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,319
taken care of at never at any point am I

565
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,678
neglecting them and like I can go about

566
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:11,519
what needs to be done and when chaos

567
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:14,038
happens I'm not worried which is like

568
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:17,119
people are busy life is busy you still

569
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:20,079
deser absolutely like at the same time I

570
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:21,759
still want my garden but some days they

571
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,759
just yeah I feel like automation doesn't

572
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:26,119
necessarily remove your attention to

573
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:29,400
details it removes your distraction from

574
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:32,879
the details yes because exactly abity

575
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:36,159
focus more on like what needs to be done

576
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,159
absolutely I I feel like a lot of people

577
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,080
um they look at automation as this thing

578
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,919
where they have to automate everything

579
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,639
and in some cases you can just automate

580
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,278
certain aspects of your grow like let's

581
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:49,159
say you still need to handw water uh you

582
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:52,278
can maybe automate your uh if you're

583
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:54,960
using a an intake and exhaust system you

584
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:58,079
can to a point where it's it has some

585
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:01,679
parameters for VPD or or you can maybe

586
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:04,439
autom your um air conditioning or heat

587
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,120
or humidity or you know just to

588
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,320
eliminate just to Simply eliminate

589
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:11,439
fluctuations of of you having to come in

590
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:13,200
and check and see that oh it's dipped a

591
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,759
little bit I'll better turn it up which

592
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,798
you know over the course of an hour and

593
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:18,599
a half it's gone down three degrees and

594
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:20,440
you know it doesn't seem like a big deal

595
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:22,000
but those fluctuations and we'll get

596
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,480
into this in more detail if you'd like

597
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,159
it in a bit those those fluctuations

598
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,558
over the course of 24 hours are limiting

599
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:31,679
limiting the amount of time

600
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:34,759
your plants have in a in a in a 12-hour

601
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:37,200
light cycle to to to utilize everything

602
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:39,158
we're trying to provide it in that time

603
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,558
if it's falling outside of those optimal

604
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:44,640
parameters for an hour here an hour

605
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:45,839
there in and out right so the the the

606
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,880
the more we can mitigate those

607
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:52,119
fluctuations in any capacity if it's

608
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,720
it's whatever our our limiting factor is

609
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:56,359
the higher we can push that ceiling and

610
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,480
the more of those ceilings we can move

611
00:24:56,359 --> 00:25:01,719
up um the higher the the higher we're

612
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,360
going to see an exponential progress uh

613
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,120
happening in our in our performance in

614
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:08,479
the garden absolutely it feels like uh

615
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:10,959
leig law keeps coming up in my

616
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,880
conversations lately where you have like

617
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,679
the the different staves and if one of

618
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,440
them is too low then that's as far as

619
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:19,679
you can fill that barrel and even if you

620
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,399
have other parameters that are set

621
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,759
ideally at other set points and

622
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:26,119
conditions there's something else

623
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,519
holding you back and so find those

624
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:32,439
little things if if if if we're pushing

625
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:34,599
in 1500 ppfd of light because um because

626
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,840
we're pushing 3.0 EC and we're we're

627
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:40,678
scaling it up to you know a 10p wec by

628
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:43,639
by our by our Peak by our Peak uh

629
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:46,919
dryback but our VPD isn't on point right

630
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:49,600
so that that one little that one little

631
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:52,799
uptick in our in our in our sop is now

632
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:54,119
causing that that VPD to be our limiting

633
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:56,759
factor and and we're going to see

634
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:58,639
exponential exponential problems start

635
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:01,079
start working their way outwards because

636
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,520
of that that that one little Ripple in

637
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:06,720
the system um that's that's causing

638
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:08,679
these these cataclysmic outward waves

639
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,120
almost like a like a ripple in a pond

640
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:14,720
right absolutely and uh you know

641
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:18,959
sometimes I feel like people try to

642
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,480
perfect the little minutia within the

643
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,519
all of these different settings within a

644
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,200
grow and sometimes you have to allow for

645
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:28,558
a little bit of wiggle room on either

646
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,080
end if your control parameters can't be

647
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:32,158
as tight as you would want them well and

648
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:34,000
that that makes a question would you

649
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,000
would you rather have would you rather

650
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,119
have all of your

651
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,679
parameters 100% dialed into spec with

652
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,759
one of them uncontrollable and and

653
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,278
falling completely out of spec or would

654
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:48,720
you rather have all of your parameters

655
00:26:46,278 --> 00:26:50,519
within a within an acceptable range and

656
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,319
none of them falling completely out of

657
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:54,158
spec right like there so there's there's

658
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:57,439
a there's a dichotomy there where you

659
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,440
have to decide um and and and sort of

660
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,558
formulate what what

661
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,320
what's what you're capable of in of

662
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:09,038
controlling in your space and and and

663
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:11,798
what where you want to sort of give that

664
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:15,079
give back if that makes sense right like

665
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:18,639
so at some point none of us can can have

666
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:20,439
it 100% perfect at all times so for

667
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,320
example right if if I can't get my

668
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,600
humidity on point do I scale back the

669
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:25,960
lighting a little bit or do I just keep

670
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:27,798
everything as it is and just try and

671
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,679
push through that one humidity issue

672
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:31,440
right or do I do I bring the room back

673
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,000
to where that humidity is no longer an

674
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,798
issue um and I'll be giving up I'll be

675
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,599
leaving something on the table somewhere

676
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:41,480
in order to achieve that it's just a

677
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:43,959
matter of

678
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,599
um what's going to be the big exactly

679
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,720
the bigger risk the least impact when it

680
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:50,798
feels like sometimes those those

681
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,558
different uh aspects of like let's say

682
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:54,599
you do have something where you can't

683
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:58,480
control humidity but you can push

684
00:27:54,599 --> 00:28:02,558
everything else you know at 100% let's

685
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,399
say um then I feel like the the thing

686
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:09,440
that it affects in the end is the

687
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:11,479
quality because we have this uh you know

688
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:15,000
it's a it's a it is a special plant in a

689
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,440
certain way because it does have um all

690
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,240
these different needs that can be met

691
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,720
that then produce this really

692
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,679
exceptional end product that can be so

693
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,480
unique and different based on the the

694
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:27,000
different environmental parameters and

695
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,240
so like let's say you are in a situation

696
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,679
where you're running really high VPD

697
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,599
throughout the grow just because you

698
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:36,120
have low humidity you're North in the

699
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:40,000
latitudes and you just get really cold

700
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:42,119
and dry in Winter um so yeah if you

701
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,839
can't really get that part up then maybe

702
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:45,639
you bring everything else down because

703
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:48,079
that might be your best option for

704
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,720
quality but if you need quantity then

705
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:51,918
maybe maybe you're okay with a little

706
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,159
bit lower quality right so the analogy

707
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,240
the analogy would the analogy I guess

708
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,399
would be is you know you've got a race

709
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:02,200
car on the racetrack in the middle of a

710
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:05,319
race right and when you floor that gas

711
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:08,000
pedal you've blown one you've blown one

712
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:09,639
valve do you keep pushing as hard as you

713
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,640
can to try and get it across the finish

714
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,240
line or do you ease off the gas pedal

715
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,720
and try and preserve the engine so

716
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,558
there's a chance you at least cross in

717
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,558
third do you know what I mean or do you

718
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:20,000
you go for first and chance you blow the

719
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:22,278
blow the motor and don't even cross the

720
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,319
line at all right that's the yeah

721
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:25,960
exactly cuz sometimes you see those

722
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,439
those parts where one aspect of the

723
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:31,480
grill kind of crashes out and the Tire

724
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,519
grow just does not make it to the finish

725
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,319
line or what does make it to the Finish

726
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:38,640
Line is pretty much

727
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:41,278
like Edibles at

728
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:44,600
best get the get the washers we're get

729
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:47,398
we're washing it up yeah

730
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:50,119
right well so when when do you feel like

731
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:52,959
you uh other than automation where do

732
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:54,959
you feel like you found early success

733
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,640
with your growing style and and what

734
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,640
kind of LED you or like pushed you

735
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:04,038
towards uh the different aspects of what

736
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,840
you kind of explored to try and either

737
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:09,879
increase quality or or increase some

738
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:11,639
sort of U helpful parameter of what the

739
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:16,360
end product was cuz I feel like you have

740
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:18,120
a few of those tricks that um commercial

741
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:20,240
cultivators will keep really close to

742
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:23,319
the chest but that you seem to talk

743
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,960
about openly in terms of helping people

744
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:27,519
one of one of the easiest ones I mean I

745
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,480
mean it's obviously not an easy topic

746
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:32,038
it's relative complex but one of the the

747
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,519
the first most immediate ones that comes

748
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:40,319
to mind is is high frequency fertigation

749
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:43,278
and understanding um understanding

750
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:47,519
how pwe

751
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:49,038
vwc um and and and water potential I'm

752
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,480
sorry I've got to sneak out I've got to

753
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:52,919
go catch no worries thank you so much

754
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,558
for joining us if you want to hop back

755
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:59,919
in later feel free yeah I'll try to hop

756
00:30:55,558 --> 00:30:59,918
back in later thanks so much for sure

757
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:04,918
I

758
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:09,038
think one of the one of the ways I like

759
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:10,720
to educate um is a little different than

760
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:12,839
than I tend to see a lot of the other

761
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,038
you know cultivation Educators doing is

762
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:19,798
that everybody likes to say you know

763
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:21,278
here's step a b CDE e FG all the way

764
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:25,079
through Z follow these and this is how

765
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:27,200
it'll do it but that leads us as as

766
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:28,558
consumers of that education to just try

767
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,200
to hit numbers

768
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:31,359
that we don't necessarily understand

769
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,679
right as long as I hit those numbers

770
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:37,240
it'll be fine but as soon as something

771
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:39,120
goes um goes goes a little off track we

772
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,480
don't have the comprehension to

773
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:43,879
understand how to a bring it back or B

774
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,960
why it's continuing to to slide left or

775
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:49,080
right and I

776
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:52,200
think not focusing on here's how you

777
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:53,678
germinate a seed 8080 whatever right let

778
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,440
it germinate in the dark put it out put

779
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,440
it in your in your Solo Cup and not

780
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:02,200
giving you the the linear steps of how

781
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:04,159
to grow a plant but focusing on on the

782
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,200
systems that are occurring within the

783
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,000
plant itself it's a living being and

784
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,840
understanding how all of those all of

785
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,880
those functions are are operating in

786
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:16,879
unison to create um this symbiotic

787
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:19,440
process that's that's machine like right

788
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,799
and if we understand if we understand

789
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,519
osmotic pressure and we understand water

790
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:25,599
potential and we understand vapor

791
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,319
pressure we understand transpiration if

792
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:28,959
we understand transpiration we

793
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:30,918
understand how movement occurs within

794
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,639
the plant and if we understand that

795
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:35,480
along with understanding osmotic

796
00:32:32,638 --> 00:32:37,558
potential we know how we can how we can

797
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,319
drive that up in order to in order to

798
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:43,158
force a higher higher uptake of ions and

799
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:46,158
and and all of these all of

800
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:48,200
these these fancy sounding you know

801
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:51,399
technical terms that we're trying to get

802
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:54,600
to you know stacking high pwe in in

803
00:32:51,398 --> 00:32:57,398
during bulk could these are all just buz

804
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:59,480
buzzwords unless we understand what the

805
00:32:57,398 --> 00:33:01,558
plant it's itself is doing on a on on an

806
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,278
ionic level on a microscopic level on a

807
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:06,720
cellular level that's that's allowing

808
00:33:04,278 --> 00:33:08,960
these things to happen and as soon as as

809
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,720
soon as I you know started focusing on

810
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,519
that I understood how high frequency

811
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,159
fertigation could be much more

812
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:17,919
beneficial than what I was trying to

813
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,440
accomplish just you know throwing water

814
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,399
in the pot and and and and hoping that

815
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,038
it takes it up and as soon as as soon as

816
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:28,278
we start doing that we can start we can

817
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:30,440
start tightening in our irrigation Sops

818
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:32,720
and the tighter that irrigation sop

819
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,320
becomes through experience and through

820
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,919
understanding um through understanding

821
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:40,678
the system itself water adhesion water

822
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,679
potential matric potential um osmotic

823
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:44,240
balance and gradient understanding those

824
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:46,360
and it sounds like a lot when I just

825
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,399
said it to you right now in a you know

826
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:49,798
in a in an unbroken sentence but the

827
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:52,638
fact of the matter is each of those

828
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:56,038
concepts are are are something that

829
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:58,398
we've all basically already understand

830
00:33:56,038 --> 00:33:59,759
just not in this context so

831
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:02,918
understanding that water likes to stick

832
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:05,200
to itself right it that means that the

833
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:07,159
drier the the cocoa gets the harder it's

834
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,159
going to be for the plant to pull up uh

835
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:11,679
water away from the fibers of the soil

836
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:14,119
that it's sticking to you know this

837
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,159
already um but having me explain it to

838
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:18,760
you in in the context of what that's ha

839
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:21,760
what's happening when you water your

840
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,240
plant now you have this that makes sense

841
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,560
to me so you're no longer looking at

842
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:27,439
your drying out pot is is it too dry is

843
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:29,878
it not too dry now you're looking at it

844
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,918
in the context of matric potential and

845
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:33,759
how far can they drive back while while

846
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,960
the roots build up osmotic gradient in

847
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,879
order to pull those those those increase

848
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:42,000
salt and it it it makes it makes sense

849
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:46,118
to you now as as somebody who doesn't

850
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:50,199
have a degree in Biochemistry I don't um

851
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:52,599
but when I was able to put watering into

852
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:56,279
that context it all made sense and from

853
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:58,320
there I was able to improve my process

854
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,880
simply because I understood

855
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,440
what what was happening from a from a

856
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,079
thermodynamic perspective or a a fluid

857
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,440
mechanics perspective right no longer a

858
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:10,640
uh

859
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:13,039
uh whatever the the the nutrient manual

860
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:17,199
is telling me perspective it's it it's

861
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:19,119
two different ways of of looking at uh

862
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:21,439
what you're trying to accomplish one

863
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:24,119
just allows you to to understand the

864
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,880
complexities of what what it is you're

865
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:29,559
doing right absolutely I mean I've I've

866
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,880
heard it described as simply as uh

867
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:33,639
plants just being water pumps and

868
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,079
they're just taking water from the

869
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:39,078
ground and pushing it out into the air

870
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:41,839
and um then yeah by applying the

871
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:48,160
different ideas of you know there's that

872
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:50,759
old uh chemistry um experiment for like

873
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,960
first you know there like really young

874
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,119
kids and you take salty water and you

875
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,240
pour it into a beaker and then you pour

876
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,039
uh fresh water on top of it and you can

877
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:00,598
color one of them and you can see how

878
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:03,039
they sit in the difference and then you

879
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:04,800
can go oh so why do they do that so

880
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:06,920
that's exactly what I was alluding to is

881
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,318
that we know all of these Concepts we're

882
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:12,639
we we're we taught them in a in a in a

883
00:36:10,318 --> 00:36:15,480
in a very functional way at a very early

884
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:18,199
age um how all of these things work it's

885
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:21,920
just a ma matter of of applying those

886
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:24,318
those concepts of physics to to what it

887
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,960
is we're doing and one of the first tips

888
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:28,440
I give anybody is if you've got access

889
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,440
to a grade 11 um bi ology book go crack

890
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,358
that son of a [ __ ] open um because

891
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,318
it'll tell you a lot about uh it'll tell

892
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:38,239
you about a lot about you know cellular

893
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:41,318
mitosis and and how osmosis works and

894
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:43,479
and and almost three4 of what you're

895
00:36:41,318 --> 00:36:45,119
going to open in those pages you can you

896
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,800
can then turn around and go back and say

897
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,599
oh that's actually happening right here

898
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:53,200
in my garden when you know when when I

899
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:54,440
see I'm adding too much calcium or you

900
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:57,919
read for

901
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,639
example in those books how how um

902
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,039
chemical bonds happen and understand

903
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:05,039
that um you know with a with an

904
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:07,239
increased amount of of calcium ions in

905
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:08,679
in in a solution if you add phosphorus

906
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:10,199
to that solution they're going to stick

907
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:12,039
together and create gypsum and fall to

908
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:13,480
the floor making them not plant

909
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:16,480
available

910
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,920
so instead of somebody telling you like

911
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,719
oh you need more calmag in your solution

912
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,400
helping them understand how calcium

913
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:25,439
actually works with in a chemical

914
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,639
solution gives them the understanding um

915
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,639
of of of why their plants might not be

916
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:31,519
calcium or might be calcium deficient

917
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:33,318
and adding more calcium to the reservoir

918
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:35,639
isn't helping your problem it's only

919
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:38,559
exacerbating it right um and these are

920
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:42,639
these are the ways that I found I found

921
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:46,159
my my my successes in the garden and I I

922
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:49,239
would voraciously read um every peer

923
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:53,559
reviewed paper I I could the the deeper

924
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:55,759
I got into um into in into each function

925
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:57,480
like I said you know there there was a

926
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,079
point where I became almost obsessed

927
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,920
mely exploratory about about um cation

928
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:05,318
anion balance and how nutrient

929
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:07,200
compositions were were were formulated

930
00:38:05,318 --> 00:38:09,159
and understanding how those things

931
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:11,078
interact together and why why would we

932
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:13,118
put chlorine in our water that's crazy

933
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:16,839
talk but turns out all of these things

934
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:18,920
have have um chemical basis and chemical

935
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:21,639
Foundation that that span back hundred

936
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:23,318
years of of Agriculture were just

937
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:27,759
applying them to to what we're trying to

938
00:38:23,318 --> 00:38:30,318
do um you know some of the some of the

939
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,599
we have to give credit I guess to to the

940
00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:34,838
people who figured a lot of this stuff

941
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:36,720
out anecdotally without access to the

942
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:40,239
information and that is a lot of the you

943
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:42,159
know the the the B the the the the grow

944
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:44,239
house guys and that the Emerald Triangle

945
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:48,078
guys who were doing a gorilla

946
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:50,078
style I give them a lot of flak because

947
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,079
a lot of that Community refuses to

948
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,280
advance forward despite the fact that

949
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,880
science has come such a long way we're

950
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,400
doing a lot of the resting on our

951
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,760
Laurels um deal but the fact of the

952
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,800
matter is is they figured it out without

953
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,960
without having any of this these tools

954
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,880
available to them um whether they

955
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,159
understood what they had figured out or

956
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,800
not and I think that's where a lot of

957
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:12,279
the Bro Science comes from a lot of

958
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,640
these myths come from is that well these

959
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,040
guys did something that worked in

960
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:17,719
1999 uh compared to what we were doing

961
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:20,679
in

962
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:23,399
1999 um and they attributed their

963
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:25,559
success to X Y and Z flushing it with

964
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,920
ice or whatever the case is and the fact

965
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:28,599
of the matter is those weren't

966
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,720
inherently what were responsible for

967
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:33,440
their successes but the way the

968
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:35,000
environment you know mitigated some of

969
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,960
those crazy things that were they were

970
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,079
doing because it was such a perfect

971
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,760
environment um you know so

972
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:47,039
whether whether you know we're we're

973
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:50,440
introducing things that that have been

974
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:52,159
done for forever or not you know we've

975
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,119
been figuring out these things for a

976
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:56,719
long time but now we've got the evidence

977
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:58,599
to either say well yes this one was true

978
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:01,439
this one is true

979
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:03,480
like so let's let's talk a little bit

980
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,159
about experimental design then because

981
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:08,559
it sounds like you're one of the issues

982
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:10,920
that you have with these older School

983
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:12,920
thoughts of uh growing is that they

984
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,480
would throw something at the plant and

985
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,440
if the plant did well that year they'd

986
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,519
say well that's what caused it and then

987
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,000
if they did it next year and something

988
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:22,039
else happened they'd say oh well

989
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,318
something else happened I'm but I'm

990
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:27,838
still applying this next year because it

991
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:29,880
did it really good that one year so you

992
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:31,440
know but with experimental design a lot

993
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,318
of that needs to be that you're making

994
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,720
sure that it's not some external Factor

995
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:39,279
that's causing the change and then being

996
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:41,719
misattributed to whatever that

997
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,560
experimental design is so what are some

998
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:46,519
of the things that you've done in your

999
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:49,000
garden where you put together a plan of

1000
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:51,719
being like this is the thing that I'm

1001
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,599
changing and where did you see that it

1002
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:56,480
like succeeded in what you were hoping

1003
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:59,318
for the two the two biggest ones that I

1004
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,119
three I we'll call it three um one of

1005
00:40:59,318 --> 00:41:06,599
the things I guess I'm most famous for

1006
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:09,358
is is my my drwing protocol um it it it

1007
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:11,720
was pretty controversial when I when I

1008
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:13,719
first uh started talking about it but as

1009
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:15,679
people started digging into the science

1010
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:17,519
the more people felt comfortable um

1011
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:19,519
trying to implement it the more feedback

1012
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:21,119
I started getting that this is this is

1013
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:23,559
gamechanging I've never seen anything

1014
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,838
like it and so that goes directly

1015
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:26,838
towards what we were talking about

1016
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:27,838
initially is that the 6060 drawing

1017
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:33,400
principle

1018
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:34,920
comes from from that era where you know

1019
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,358
this is the best we could basically

1020
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,159
achieve right we could hang it where we

1021
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:42,358
could hang it in hiding and and this Got

1022
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:44,598
Us close and the problem is is that like

1023
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:46,799
I said we were we were attributing sort

1024
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:50,200
of accidental success or not even

1025
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:53,000
success you know coming close to success

1026
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:54,679
with success because it was better than

1027
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,358
the failures we were seeing outside of

1028
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:59,919
that

1029
00:41:55,358 --> 00:42:02,598
realm the problem is is it doesn't 6060

1030
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,599
doesn't follow the logic that they're

1031
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:08,640
trying to employ implementing a 6060

1032
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:12,079
drying technique and what I mean by that

1033
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:13,679
is by leaving a plant on the rack for an

1034
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:15,560
x amount of days it doesn't follow a

1035
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:16,719
linear drying path right we have to

1036
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:18,559
bring in the principles of

1037
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:21,199
thermodynamics and water adhesion and

1038
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:22,719
the fact that that a at a certain point

1039
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:26,439
the vapor pressure is going to overcome

1040
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:30,039
the water adhesion um uh factor and

1041
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:31,639
break that so now we're pulling you know

1042
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:33,400
where at first we were pulling water

1043
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:35,920
from the middle of the flowers through

1044
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,599
through um water adhesion this water

1045
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,039
droplet was pulling the one in the

1046
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,599
middle closer to the to the surface at

1047
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:43,838
some point the vapor pressure is is

1048
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,160
going to overcome that wateran and that

1049
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:47,519
Chain's going to break and now we're

1050
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:49,318
left with water slowly in the middle of

1051
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:51,838
the flower not being pulled out by that

1052
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:53,920
surface water anymore that surface water

1053
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:55,838
exits the flower it feels crumbly and

1054
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,519
dry outside even after 2 days or

1055
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:59,318
whatever right and then we leave it

1056
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:02,800
again the water in the middle starts to

1057
00:42:59,318 --> 00:43:05,800
slowly diffuse back outwards um and and

1058
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,800
eventually over 14 days we get to near

1059
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,400
or hopefully near an acceptable water

1060
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,318
activity the problem with with with

1061
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,960
leaving it on the rack for 14 days is

1062
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:15,279
Once that once that chain in the middle

1063
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:18,358
breaks and we're left with that water

1064
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:21,000
sitting that's like a a 30 or 40%

1065
00:43:18,358 --> 00:43:24,318
moisture content inside an organic

1066
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,519
material over the course of the next 10

1067
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:29,358
days what is that the best environment

1068
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:31,800
for that you've ever heard right M mold

1069
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:33,480
loves to grow in moist dank environments

1070
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:38,200
that sit for 10

1071
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:39,559
days what I looked at was how how do we

1072
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:42,838
achieve a

1073
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:46,359
linear dry so the same rate of

1074
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:48,199
evaporative drying over over a linear

1075
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:51,078
amount of time and and and and what that

1076
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:53,279
means is that we have to we have to do

1077
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:55,599
drying in two phases right one's got to

1078
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,800
be our our normal dry and then once that

1079
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,519
chain breaks we have to kick up the

1080
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:02,599
vapor pressure in order to pull that

1081
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:04,280
water out faster to maintain that even

1082
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:06,000
drying rate because the first phase is

1083
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,920
going to come out really quick if we

1084
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,559
don't pull out that second phase at the

1085
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,318
same rate we're going to be left with

1086
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:14,240
that sitting water so I looked at every

1087
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:17,400
imaginable metric all of the the

1088
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:19,799
compiled data um and we looked at what

1089
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,760
temperature degradation to tpin did at a

1090
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,359
certain value over a certain amount of

1091
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:28,520
time and what was found was

1092
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:30,759
that temperature to a certain Point has

1093
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:32,199
negligible effect on tpine degradation

1094
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,920
and they looked at something like 32

1095
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:41,960
different

1096
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:45,400
tpin between 4° C and 42° C the loss of

1097
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:48,400
tpes for every 10° was something like

1098
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,680
like uh 2% or whatever and we can go

1099
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,519
back and look at my study I've got it

1100
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:56,199
all referenced there negligible

1101
00:44:52,519 --> 00:44:57,599
basically um versus the degradation loss

1102
00:44:56,199 --> 00:45:00,318
we saw at

1103
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:02,480
60° temperature over the course of two

1104
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:05,838
weeks which is nearly a 30% loss in

1105
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,920
Turpin um just sitting on the rack so

1106
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:09,599
that tells us no matter what we do the

1107
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,599
longer we leave a plant hanging on the

1108
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,200
rack to dry the lower those secondary

1109
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:16,519
metabol numbers are going to be the

1110
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:18,719
quicker we can get it off the rack the

1111
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:20,838
faster we can get it down to our safe aw

1112
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:23,959
and into our preservative conditions the

1113
00:45:20,838 --> 00:45:27,480
higher those numbers are going to be um

1114
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:29,639
so that was that was that one took

1115
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:32,159
a significant amount of of trial and

1116
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:34,000
experimentation and and and going

1117
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:36,960
against the grain right I got called

1118
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,400
crazy I enjoy your hay blah blah blah

1119
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,358
but we can go back now and we can review

1120
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,400
everybody like people are doing this in

1121
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:46,318
100 lighters I've got I've got I've got

1122
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,639
I've never seen a single person come

1123
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:51,318
back with negative feedback on that Pro

1124
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:53,358
protocol specifically and I take I take

1125
00:45:51,318 --> 00:45:55,199
pride in the fact that you know I I I

1126
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:57,440
dug up as much of that the evidence of

1127
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:59,358
as I could I tried to put it into a

1128
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,159
digestible readable format that was

1129
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:03,199
accessible to everybody but at the end

1130
00:46:01,159 --> 00:46:05,879
of the day that's not I didn't invent it

1131
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:07,838
it's just what physics says is the way

1132
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,440
it should be done right it's not it's

1133
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:12,799
not some magical Discovery by me the the

1134
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,960
the principles of diffusion are are are

1135
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,480
there like they're they're just sitting

1136
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,800
right there waiting to be applied to

1137
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,719
your plant because we've been doing it a

1138
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:24,839
way that kind of worked 40 years ago

1139
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:27,598
sure yeah it's like a 6060 is kind of

1140
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:30,759
where you want it to be at right as

1141
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:34,480
you're bucking it off the plant but you

1142
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:37,559
don't want to sit there to get there and

1143
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,358
so we also have in certain commercial

1144
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:42,280
settings one of the things that I've ran

1145
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:44,440
into is that your drawing room is the

1146
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:46,839
same as your storage room and so

1147
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,720
temperature there then is extremely

1148
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:51,199
important so what what we found is we

1149
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:54,078
just drop it down to a really low

1150
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:56,239
relative humidity at 60 or

1151
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:59,160
55° and leave it there until you get

1152
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:01,519
your acceptable water activity

1153
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:05,838
absolutely and then from there we just

1154
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:07,759
slowly raise it back up and uh works

1155
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:10,639
great usually everything's done about

1156
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,880
still 12 days but it is hard in certain

1157
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:15,639
aspects but I think the way the way

1158
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,920
you're doing is is is significantly more

1159
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:20,679
beneficial than than well we can't hit

1160
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:22,480
those targets so we'll just leave it on

1161
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:24,799
as long as we can get it out because low

1162
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,480
and slow or whatever the case is no

1163
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,519
being able to that goes to the other

1164
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,960
huge misconception about what is curing

1165
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:35,199
and a lot of people have this

1166
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:37,559
this very very romanticized idea about

1167
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:38,879
what curing is and without having an

1168
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:40,720
understanding and and I don't think the

1169
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,640
industry yet clearly has a good

1170
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:43,558
understanding of what they're trying to

1171
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:45,159
accomplish when curing and it's not it's

1172
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:49,559
not this it's not

1173
00:47:45,159 --> 00:47:51,879
this um you know fabled magic Elixir

1174
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:55,079
that we're we're we're going from you

1175
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:57,519
know product a to product 12 it's we're

1176
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:59,599
not changing the Constitution of of of

1177
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:01,159
what it is we're growing and I think

1178
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,440
understanding that curing has many

1179
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:04,239
different forms depending on what we're

1180
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:06,440
trying to apply to is it wine is it wood

1181
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:08,679
is it cheese is it concrete is right is

1182
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:10,000
it is it resin so all these things mean

1183
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:13,399
different things and I think when we're

1184
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,639
looking when we're looking at curing

1185
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:19,318
dried flour what that means to me is we

1186
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:22,318
got our flour down to a safe water

1187
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:25,039
activity but we still have that problem

1188
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:26,800
where the water is not evenly diffused

1189
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:28,400
throughout that entire flower right

1190
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,400
there's pockets of moisture here and

1191
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,880
here and some are drier here and here so

1192
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:36,240
when we get that flour into a jar or

1193
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:39,200
into a cure container or a cure space

1194
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:39,199
that's

1195
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:45,519
at so atmospheric equilibrium or vapor

1196
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,520
pressure equilibrium equals water

1197
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:51,199
activity right so if we can get our

1198
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:53,838
equilibrium to 64% humidity in our cure

1199
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:57,239
jar close it down to the point where

1200
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:59,599
where that vapor pressure only pulls the

1201
00:48:57,239 --> 00:49:01,039
water to equilibrium to the point where

1202
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,079
you know there's no there's no longer

1203
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:04,838
force acting on the flower the water is

1204
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:07,039
going to distribute to the surface

1205
00:49:04,838 --> 00:49:09,078
everything's going to be exactly evenly

1206
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:11,719
distributed and our flow is going to be

1207
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:13,760
one homogeneous moisture content and

1208
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:15,439
that's all we're trying to achieve if we

1209
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,400
have to burp it and let moisture out

1210
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,358
because it keeps climbing higher than

1211
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,440
than than than our relative equal

1212
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:24,440
relative equal humidity um that means we

1213
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:26,960
didn't hit our safe water activity

1214
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:29,760
Target so you're still drying it's just

1215
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,599
in yeah curing should simply be the

1216
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,000
final extension of drying where we're

1217
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:36,119
trying to reconstitute the homogenity

1218
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,239
homogenity of the of the moisture

1219
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:40,160
content of the flour we're not we're not

1220
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:42,279
doing this it's breaking down this and

1221
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:44,199
it's breaking down that that's going to

1222
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,000
happen over the course of weeks along

1223
00:49:44,199 --> 00:49:48,719
with your secondary metabolites along

1224
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,798
with the fats the lipids the chlorophyll

1225
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:54,118
molecules which will you know the more

1226
00:49:51,798 --> 00:49:56,199
of those unwanted pigments and stuff

1227
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:57,720
that that that we allow in a

1228
00:49:56,199 --> 00:50:00,118
preservative condition to sort of

1229
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:02,118
degrade naturally on their own we're

1230
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:04,079
also going to lose Turpin and

1231
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:06,720
cannabinoids and and flavonoids we're

1232
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:09,318
losing all of those things as well but

1233
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:10,838
because it's not as adulterated with

1234
00:50:09,318 --> 00:50:12,358
some of the compounds that were still in

1235
00:50:10,838 --> 00:50:14,920
there the chlorophylls the fats the

1236
00:50:12,358 --> 00:50:17,679
alcohols the ethanols we're going to

1237
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:20,480
perceive the flavor pallet of what we do

1238
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:22,558
have left as much more uh refined and

1239
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,240
much more palatable so that's where I

1240
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,960
think the notion that you know a long

1241
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:30,078
Flor we cure makes it taste better the

1242
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,559
count is is inarguably less than it was

1243
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,920
four weeks ago when it made it might

1244
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:35,440
have tasted grassier but it's also a

1245
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,440
little bit more refined because we've

1246
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,920
eliminated some of those other things as

1247
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,960
well right you know it makes me think as

1248
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,480
though there's kind of and and there's

1249
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,358
just hearing you talk about it made me

1250
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:47,280
think about this but it's almost like

1251
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:48,759
there's two different thresholds that

1252
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,000
you're kind of aiming for and one of

1253
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,960
them is the the mold operational

1254
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,440
threshold where you're getting a water

1255
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,559
activity below this operational

1256
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,838
threshold so that the mold will not

1257
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:02,880
sporulate it or it shouldn't um unless

1258
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:04,920
you have some sort of random humidity

1259
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:07,960
Spike event or something like that uh

1260
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:10,960
and then you get into the enzymatic uh

1261
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:13,199
operational um act water activity zone

1262
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:15,400
so all your enzymes can continue what

1263
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:17,598
they're doing there and then below that

1264
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:20,119
that's where a lot of people will over

1265
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:21,838
dry and they'll still have that hay

1266
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:23,599
smell and they'll like but I dried it

1267
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:25,719
all the way and it's like well you you

1268
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:27,400
you need to allow for the enzymes to

1269
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:29,679
operate you need to allow for the

1270
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:32,119
breakdown and the homogenizing of

1271
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:34,598
moisture and for all of these other

1272
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:37,599
things to occur that are still occurring

1273
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:40,318
in this and that's that's the Cure right

1274
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:42,240
so and and what's so important about

1275
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:46,119
that what's so important about that is

1276
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:49,558
that you know having having uh a water

1277
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:51,880
activity uh uh below a certain threshold

1278
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:55,240
we still need that moisture which still

1279
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:57,079
leaves the potential for for you know

1280
00:51:55,239 --> 00:51:59,318
that water's not bound that water is

1281
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:02,079
available for any any cellular organism

1282
00:51:59,318 --> 00:52:05,440
to to to to to use for their needs

1283
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:07,240
including including mold spores the goal

1284
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,039
here is that if we get it below that

1285
00:52:07,239 --> 00:52:11,358
that acceptable threshold it's not

1286
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:13,199
nearly enough bound water to compete

1287
00:52:11,358 --> 00:52:15,719
with the enzymes that are still actively

1288
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:18,000
working to do those those those

1289
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:21,399
biological functions right and this is

1290
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,599
this is going to keep the cfu Far Below

1291
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:26,599
even a registerable amount you know

1292
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:28,599
hopefully zero which it never is but uh

1293
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:30,760
um you know it's it's it's all a matter

1294
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:32,559
of water competition and the enzymes are

1295
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:35,359
always going to outc compete a foreign

1296
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:37,400
organism for for that that Unbound water

1297
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:39,838
within the flower so as long as we're in

1298
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:41,798
within a safe range like you said we're

1299
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:43,960
we're now out of the danger zone where

1300
00:52:41,798 --> 00:52:46,559
Colony forming units start to start to

1301
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:49,679
propagate um and we're but we're still

1302
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:51,400
within within that that cell you know

1303
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:52,679
the cells are hydrated enough to the

1304
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,358
point where where there is that

1305
00:52:52,679 --> 00:52:58,318
enzymatic activity and there is there is

1306
00:52:55,358 --> 00:53:00,920
um uh uh cellular breakdown of various

1307
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:02,440
pigmentations and and and and the

1308
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:05,639
remaining chloroplast that are left in

1309
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:08,519
there which like I said while degrading

1310
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:12,358
um you know the secondary metabolite

1311
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:14,639
count it's also reducing that that

1312
00:53:12,358 --> 00:53:17,000
unwanted adulterant in your plant so

1313
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:19,558
right you know it's it's a matter of you

1314
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,719
know you can have your quote unquote 34%

1315
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:24,839
THC right off the plant but at the same

1316
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:27,199
time it it it is going to taste better

1317
00:53:24,838 --> 00:53:30,440
once it's down to you know

1318
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:32,558
22% but still has 4% tpin and none of

1319
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:35,480
the other or or much fewer of the other

1320
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:37,798
compounds that we that we end up tasting

1321
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:41,400
um absolutely it's very similar to like

1322
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:43,798
curing meats or pickles um where you're

1323
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:48,079
aiming for a specific water activity

1324
00:53:43,798 --> 00:53:49,599
within these brins or um salt packs or

1325
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:52,960
other things like that where then you're

1326
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:54,920
allowing for specific bacteria specific

1327
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,159
microbes to operate

1328
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:59,039
specifically yeah absolutely with cheses

1329
00:53:57,159 --> 00:54:01,719
as well and then other things to not

1330
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:03,639
operate with and that because the the

1331
00:54:01,719 --> 00:54:05,639
salinity is too high and when we say

1332
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:07,679
salinity is too high it's because that

1333
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:10,598
affects the water activity within that

1334
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:12,399
product so it's it's curing is curing

1335
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:13,838
all all the way around well and you

1336
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,440
brought up such a good point that I

1337
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:18,119
think we both skipped over a little bit

1338
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,480
is that um you know the people people

1339
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:20,680
will complain about this hay smell and

1340
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,318
they'll attribute it to either being a

1341
00:54:20,679 --> 00:54:26,159
salt grow

1342
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:28,759
or I can say with confidence that 99.9%

1343
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:31,078
of the time this happened in your dry or

1344
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:33,720
cure phase and it's either that you

1345
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:36,760
undershot your your your aw Target

1346
00:54:33,719 --> 00:54:38,480
during the the dry you came in with your

1347
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,839
lights on so one of the funny things

1348
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,079
that happens that people don't realize

1349
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:42,519
is they'll chop down their plants

1350
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:44,039
they'll hang it up and then they'll come

1351
00:54:42,519 --> 00:54:45,599
in with their with their with their grow

1352
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:47,199
lights blasting and take their videos

1353
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:49,599
and stuff for two days of The Upside

1354
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:51,318
Down plants hanging that plant basically

1355
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,880
has no idea that you chopped it down

1356
00:54:51,318 --> 00:54:54,440
especially in the first two days when

1357
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,680
when the water content in that plant is

1358
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:58,079
80% and all the cellular functions still

1359
00:54:56,679 --> 00:54:59,919
happening like plants are on right and

1360
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,599
as soon as you flip those lights on the

1361
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,559
chloroplasts flip over and they're like

1362
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:05,640
oh time to photosynthesize again so

1363
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:08,040
we've been here for you know chlorophyll

1364
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:09,519
will break down it's been shown in rice

1365
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:11,679
um over the course of three days of

1366
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:13,440
darkness it'll break down to next to

1367
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:15,679
nothing and the plant will be will have

1368
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,960
no no ability to photosynthesize past

1369
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:20,879
that 3 days of darkness but the instant

1370
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:22,318
you turn the light on above four yo it's

1371
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,838
like hello waking up and as long as

1372
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:26,480
there's moisture content within those

1373
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:28,038
cells to to to complete that that Calvin

1374
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,679
cycle it's going to start taking in

1375
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:31,680
those photons and producing more

1376
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:34,399
chlorophyll to do that again and again

1377
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:37,358
so by the end of week week two or

1378
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:39,119
whatever of your of your 6060 dry and

1379
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:42,400
you take it off and you it smells like

1380
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:44,318
I'm smoking grass and that's because you

1381
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,838
we got to our dry period but you kept

1382
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:48,440
turning the lights on it kept producing

1383
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:50,318
chlorophyll that we were trying to to to

1384
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,400
eliminate in the first place and by the

1385
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:54,440
time that water activity was so low it

1386
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:57,240
could no longer it could no longer break

1387
00:55:54,440 --> 00:56:00,280
that down um into CFC blues and now

1388
00:55:57,239 --> 00:56:02,118
that's all you taste is green um yep and

1389
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:03,559
W that's that's a really good point and

1390
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:05,920
I don't think a lot of people think

1391
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:07,760
about that but absolutely um that's

1392
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:11,280
that's a really wonderful

1393
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:13,599
Point uh and that's it's those little

1394
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,400
things like you know it's the drawing

1395
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:16,680
part is everybody thinks they got to the

1396
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,280
end now and we'll just hang it up and

1397
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:20,399
then I'll get to smoke it but this is

1398
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:24,280
this is like the critical part in my in

1399
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:26,798
in in my opinion is getting getting it

1400
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,480
down to our acceptable aw as quickly as

1401
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:31,318
we can and then getting into the right

1402
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:34,760
preservative conditions as quickly as we

1403
00:56:31,318 --> 00:56:36,759
can it's not a matter of of I didn't

1404
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:41,359
slush for two weeks

1405
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:43,079
which um it's it's simply a matter of of

1406
00:56:41,358 --> 00:56:44,920
understanding what the plant is going

1407
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:47,640
through in those last couple of days

1408
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:49,798
while it's trying to um you know while

1409
00:56:47,639 --> 00:56:51,519
it's it's basically trying to survive

1410
00:56:49,798 --> 00:56:53,440
and it's sending out it's sending out

1411
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:55,079
all sorts of crazy signals to try and do

1412
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,720
things

1413
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:59,400
and the the the deeper we understand

1414
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:00,798
that on a cellular level like I said I

1415
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,519
had to read papers on on how

1416
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:05,719
chloroplasts behave in the dark um in

1417
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:08,599
order to understand that but once I did

1418
00:57:05,719 --> 00:57:10,000
now I understood that you know during

1419
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:11,838
those first three days my plants are

1420
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,719
actually still alive and and they're

1421
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:17,199
they're they're behaving accordingly um

1422
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:19,199
right including with transpiration um

1423
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:21,519
other than the fact that we're

1424
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:23,199
eliminating the vascular aspect of being

1425
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:24,838
able to take up water they're still

1426
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:26,639
sweating it out they're still trying to

1427
00:57:24,838 --> 00:57:31,038
photosynthesize and they're still very

1428
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:32,639
much utilizing um the the molecules

1429
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:35,839
they've got within their within their

1430
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:39,400
structure to to complete those functions

1431
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:42,880
right I I definitely smoke uh somebody's

1432
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:45,680
first grow who knew how to cure it well

1433
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:49,960
uh you know even if it was the airest

1434
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:51,719
larest you know weirdest uh end product

1435
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:54,358
but then they dried it and cured it well

1436
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:56,439
and it didn't have terrible Haze smell

1437
00:57:54,358 --> 00:57:59,880
smell or anything like that to it and if

1438
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:03,119
it was uh you know crumbly like kinetic

1439
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:05,480
sand and not overly dried and uh I would

1440
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:07,599
still for sure give it a try but

1441
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:10,199
absolutely I've had plenty of people be

1442
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:13,160
like oh this is you know my 10th 12th

1443
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:14,798
however many you know tens of grows

1444
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:17,199
theyve they just keep missing that one

1445
00:58:14,798 --> 00:58:19,599
part and it's the it's the dry and the

1446
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:24,798
Cure always that it seems like you can

1447
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:26,599
just really ruin the best of products so

1448
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:28,599
yeah that's a that's a very you know

1449
00:58:26,599 --> 00:58:31,680
that's I feel like that's hugee and I

1450
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:36,680
could see how that could make sort of

1451
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:41,399
the it can demystify a lot of this um

1452
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:44,838
stigma about like bad bud or you know

1453
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:47,440
yeah and well or what it I think I found

1454
00:58:44,838 --> 00:58:50,480
it's also it's

1455
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:52,440
also open people's perspectives who were

1456
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,318
like dead set against salt growing

1457
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,679
because that was their experience is

1458
00:58:54,318 --> 00:58:57,798
that every time they smoked something

1459
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:59,440
from their bu who grows with salt it

1460
00:58:57,798 --> 00:59:01,679
tastes disgusting but they get organic

1461
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,720
from the dispensary and it tastes and

1462
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:05,239
and

1463
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:07,679
and they seem to conflate those two

1464
00:59:05,239 --> 00:59:12,000
things as being an issue and that sets

1465
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:13,558
them off growing um in in a salt-based

1466
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,679
system simply because they think that's

1467
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:16,319
what their end results going to be I

1468
00:59:14,679 --> 00:59:18,879
hear the same thing with Athena all the

1469
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:20,920
time like oh no Athena's Athena's

1470
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:23,599
cardboard or whatever and and the fact

1471
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:26,240
of the matter is is that's that can be

1472
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:29,280
very true but it's not because of the

1473
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:32,439
reason people think it is and this leads

1474
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:35,480
into my other one um you ever heard the

1475
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:38,440
the the the Bro Science myth cut out

1476
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:40,719
nitrogen and late flour just cut it out

1477
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:44,159
so there's

1478
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:45,838
actually huge validity to that um the

1479
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:47,519
problem is is the way these nutrient

1480
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:50,000
companies formulate their

1481
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:53,960
nutrients

1482
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:56,280
one there's been uh there's endless data

1483
00:59:53,960 --> 01:00:00,079
to show that that high amounts of NH for

1484
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:02,960
in any capacity um will absolutely [ __ ]

1485
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:06,200
up your plant's secondary metabol count

1486
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:08,318
no ifs ants or butts about it all all of

1487
01:00:06,199 --> 01:00:13,879
the better nutrient companies will have

1488
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:15,519
a a a blend of of nh4 plus and and um

1489
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:17,480
and non- nitrate

1490
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:20,119
nitrogen because the plant likes a

1491
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:22,079
combination of both specific uh nitrogen

1492
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:27,960
molecules in order to optimize the

1493
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:31,440
uptake the thing is over a certain

1494
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:35,358
value we see the secondary metabolite

1495
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:39,159
and Canan aboid um production

1496
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:41,719
drop unfathomably so uh you go from

1497
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:45,639
something like 60 uh

1498
01:00:41,719 --> 01:00:49,038
micro milliliters per liter or whatever

1499
01:00:45,639 --> 01:00:51,440
and you see a sharp drop of 30%

1500
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:53,680
reduction in in secondary metabolites

1501
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:56,318
all the way up to all the way up to a

1502
01:00:53,679 --> 01:01:00,199
60% reduction in secondary metabolites

1503
01:00:56,318 --> 01:01:03,079
whereas if we start to show a nitrogen

1504
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:06,960
deficiency this causes a stress response

1505
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:10,318
in the plant to produce um secondary

1506
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,400
metabolites so simply by finding a way

1507
01:01:10,318 --> 01:01:14,599
to

1508
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:17,920
to uh manipulate your specific nutrient

1509
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:20,000
regiment to reduce the amount of of

1510
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,920
nitrogen post bulking once your plants

1511
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,960
have finished setting their flowers put

1512
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:26,559
on as much mass as they can we want to

1513
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:29,358
shut that that nitrogen number down to

1514
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:31,760
as much as we can if zero because we've

1515
01:01:29,358 --> 01:01:34,719
still got a lot of it built up inside

1516
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:36,960
the root Zone the problem is is that we

1517
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:39,679
can't necessarily just like cut out

1518
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:41,639
let's call it Advanced Nutrients uh a or

1519
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:43,199
whatever because that's got that's got

1520
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:45,558
your Cal nitrate so now you're cutting

1521
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:47,759
out calcium magnesium nitrogen zinc

1522
01:01:45,559 --> 01:01:52,200
Boron all of the micros that that we're

1523
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:55,960
going to do so um I found I found that

1524
01:01:52,199 --> 01:02:00,118
by playing with specific nutrient um

1525
01:01:55,960 --> 01:02:03,079
ratios in mixes particularly by slowly

1526
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:05,079
tapering down on on Bloom and

1527
01:02:03,079 --> 01:02:07,760
introducing fade at the same time with

1528
01:02:05,079 --> 01:02:09,760
Athena which isn't part of the program

1529
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,880
I'd been able to see a huge increase in

1530
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,880
secondary metabolite production to the

1531
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:16,358
point where Athena chemist had reached

1532
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:19,720
out and asked me to to sort of help

1533
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:22,440
Drive their sop changes in that regard

1534
01:02:19,719 --> 01:02:24,639
so like it's it's it's little there

1535
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:27,559
there are little things that we can do

1536
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:29,960
that will AB absolutely changed the way

1537
01:02:27,559 --> 01:02:32,359
our Gardens perform from the last run

1538
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:35,960
with just a little alteration right

1539
01:02:32,358 --> 01:02:38,880
as as as to how we apply those nutrient

1540
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:40,880
ratios or how we how we we we dry our

1541
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:43,720
plants in 10 days less than we than we

1542
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:47,880
ordinarily would or how we implement the

1543
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:49,919
Emerson effect um during flow those

1544
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:52,039
those type of things those three things

1545
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,920
in particular have been the biggest

1546
01:02:52,039 --> 01:02:58,559
improvements to my garden and as you

1547
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:58,559
know the more experienced you have the

1548
01:02:59,318 --> 01:03:05,239
less the less wide those increases feel

1549
01:03:03,239 --> 01:03:07,278
right they they become they become much

1550
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:10,199
more

1551
01:03:07,278 --> 01:03:12,239
uh much more incremental increases in

1552
01:03:10,199 --> 01:03:14,919
your in your improvement because there's

1553
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:17,719
only so much more to understand right

1554
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:19,720
every every win is now just a a micro

1555
01:03:17,719 --> 01:03:21,838
win on top of something we already knew

1556
01:03:19,719 --> 01:03:23,558
right so when you start out every every

1557
01:03:21,838 --> 01:03:25,078
Improvement is this big massive leap

1558
01:03:23,559 --> 01:03:27,359
whereas now we're making these small

1559
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:29,359
incremental improvements to our to our

1560
01:03:27,358 --> 01:03:33,000
to our processes but those three that we

1561
01:03:29,358 --> 01:03:36,838
just discussed moved me from a guy who

1562
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,599
grows flower to to to shark M Farms as

1563
01:03:36,838 --> 01:03:41,759
as arrogant as that may come across you

1564
01:03:38,599 --> 01:03:45,400
know I I don't I never intend it to be

1565
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:47,200
that way but I think my processes are

1566
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:49,720
revered for a specific reason it's

1567
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:52,679
because I was willing to do

1568
01:03:49,719 --> 01:03:54,719
um that experimentation and and I wasn't

1569
01:03:52,679 --> 01:03:57,558
Bound by

1570
01:03:54,719 --> 01:04:01,038
by you know fiduciary responsibility to

1571
01:03:57,559 --> 01:04:04,798
my shareholders or or or an obligation

1572
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:06,839
to to fulfill a specific quote of flower

1573
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:09,199
or whatever the case is I had enough

1574
01:04:06,838 --> 01:04:11,798
room to be able to to experiment and

1575
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:15,399
Implement different different scientific

1576
01:04:11,798 --> 01:04:18,798
ideas and and and and see what was most

1577
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:20,519
beneficial for sure well let's uh let's

1578
01:04:18,798 --> 01:04:24,199
kind of do a little thought experiment

1579
01:04:20,519 --> 01:04:26,719
then and um run so since you haven't

1580
01:04:24,199 --> 01:04:30,558
really been growing uh for flower for a

1581
01:04:26,719 --> 01:04:33,838
few months now um run us through your

1582
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:36,920
final iteration that you did run you

1583
01:04:33,838 --> 01:04:38,679
know what what was your um like what

1584
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:40,720
were some of the different ear uh

1585
01:04:38,679 --> 01:04:43,278
parameters and set points that you shot

1586
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:46,078
for um just so that people can kind of

1587
01:04:43,278 --> 01:04:49,519
get a a picture of what you were doing

1588
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:52,079
in that final iteration so we

1589
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:55,038
went we went for a bit of a Turn and

1590
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:58,200
Burn um I would have I would have my

1591
01:04:55,039 --> 01:05:00,920
clones rooted and and into the

1592
01:04:58,199 --> 01:05:03,199
blocks within 7 days and once they went

1593
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:05,838
into the blocks I'd water those one

1594
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:08,199
gallon one gallon blocks you know I I

1595
01:05:05,838 --> 01:05:10,400
I'll calculate the best way to figure

1596
01:05:08,199 --> 01:05:12,639
out how big your media should be in your

1597
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:14,760
space is to figure out what your overall

1598
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:17,519
canopy size is going to end up being in

1599
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:20,240
that space and and from there we can

1600
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:22,400
calculate the expected water loss volume

1601
01:05:20,239 --> 01:05:23,838
through uh through transpiration which

1602
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,318
will give you an idea of how much water

1603
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:27,719
you need to go through giving you an

1604
01:05:25,318 --> 01:05:28,480
idea of how big your media should be in

1605
01:05:27,719 --> 01:05:33,358
any

1606
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:35,000
case I ended up running 261 gon pots um

1607
01:05:33,358 --> 01:05:37,759
in that

1608
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,599
room and I was putting

1609
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:43,319
[Music]

1610
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:46,119
on for the most part I during most of

1611
01:05:43,318 --> 01:05:50,159
the Run no more than eight shots a day

1612
01:05:46,119 --> 01:05:52,358
of irrigation but the goal was to slowly

1613
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:54,440
stack up the EC from the moment those

1614
01:05:52,358 --> 01:05:56,519
plants were rooted I wanted to bring up

1615
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:59,960
the EC all the way up up to its Max

1616
01:05:56,519 --> 01:06:02,480
point I wanted to have um my ppfd ready

1617
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:05,358
to go at 1200 ppfd from the moment I

1618
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:08,798
flipped in flower um stacked all the way

1619
01:06:05,358 --> 01:06:11,159
up to 10 EC and then drive that

1620
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:14,199
transition as hard as I could for the

1621
01:06:11,159 --> 01:06:14,199
first two and a half

1622
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:20,920
weeks one of the things so a couple of

1623
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:22,960
the things I implemented it as as a to

1624
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:27,680
make that run as much of a success as it

1625
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:31,880
was was to be able to one go into

1626
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:33,719
bulking um at about week at about day 17

1627
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:36,838
instead of waiting till you know I got

1628
01:06:33,719 --> 01:06:39,798
to day 24 or 25 which gave me a leg up

1629
01:06:36,838 --> 01:06:41,558
um and and by doing that you know I was

1630
01:06:39,798 --> 01:06:45,639
able to do that because I was able to

1631
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:48,480
start day one of flower at 1200 ppfd

1632
01:06:45,639 --> 01:06:52,239
pushing that high EC you know already

1633
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:54,838
coming into a 25% overnight dryback so

1634
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:57,959
those first three weeks are critical and

1635
01:06:54,838 --> 01:06:59,880
you can't go back and fix them um it's

1636
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:01,720
all about setting the flowers in place

1637
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:05,240
and getting that that

1638
01:07:01,719 --> 01:07:07,078
plant's physiology into a hormonal shift

1639
01:07:05,239 --> 01:07:09,519
where it's going anyways but we got to

1640
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:12,079
push it into that flowering shift as

1641
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:15,038
quickly as possible and by applying as

1642
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:18,079
much as much

1643
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:20,520
um as much targeted stress onto the

1644
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:22,240
plant as we can during those first three

1645
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:24,719
weeks we're able to flip it over as

1646
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:27,118
quickly as we can set those flowers and

1647
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:29,118
then EAS off the pressure as much as we

1648
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:30,960
can come bulking to allow it to just

1649
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:33,358
take up whatever it needs it's the

1650
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:36,358
flowers are already set they're already

1651
01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:38,278
established as to as to what that that

1652
01:07:36,358 --> 01:07:41,239
entire coal is going to end up looking

1653
01:07:38,278 --> 01:07:44,000
like we're already the plant isn't going

1654
01:07:41,239 --> 01:07:45,639
back into a vegetative hormonal state so

1655
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,920
now that we're already in a flowering

1656
01:07:45,639 --> 01:07:50,480
hormonal State we can ease off all that

1657
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:53,440
pressure and give it everything it wants

1658
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:55,798
from from you know week two and a half

1659
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:58,079
all the way to week six and just fill it

1660
01:07:55,798 --> 01:07:59,920
up fill it up fill it up and from there

1661
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:01,720
I dropped the nitrogen right out I

1662
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,400
starved it for nitrogen while still

1663
01:08:01,719 --> 01:08:07,078
giving it really and and now I move back

1664
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:09,358
into um a targeted stress phase where

1665
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:11,200
I'm giving it a really heavy dryback I

1666
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:14,239
start to increase the VPD and really

1667
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:17,039
make that plant sweat um in order to

1668
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:18,838
think you know danger ahead you know the

1669
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:21,640
end of my life is coming I'd better do

1670
01:08:18,838 --> 01:08:23,838
everything I can um to build resinous

1671
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:25,920
flowers throw it as many sigmas as I can

1672
01:08:23,838 --> 01:08:27,719
to try and collect some pollen which I'm

1673
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:30,079
not going to let it do obviously so it's

1674
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:32,679
just going to keep stacking those those

1675
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:37,198
cxes on top of one another and the end

1676
01:08:32,679 --> 01:08:42,920
result by um implementing those three

1677
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:42,919
specific strategies that uh together was

1678
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:48,719
was minimal we'll call it uh minimal

1679
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:51,319
yield dilution and what I mean by that

1680
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:53,399
is generally it's either it's either you

1681
01:08:51,319 --> 01:08:56,120
know all the plant spends as much of its

1682
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:58,358
resources building building biomass Mass

1683
01:08:56,119 --> 01:09:00,158
which takes away from its ability to to

1684
01:08:58,359 --> 01:09:02,000
create those secondary metabolites that

1685
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:04,838
were after those volatile oils that were

1686
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,679
after those tricomes that were after or

1687
01:09:04,838 --> 01:09:10,278
you know we we we stress it so hard that

1688
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:13,158
it spends all of its energy producing

1689
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:15,159
those protectants like the that are the

1690
01:09:13,158 --> 01:09:18,559
main function of the tricomes and it

1691
01:09:15,158 --> 01:09:21,639
doesn't have the energy necessary to to

1692
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:23,679
um divide that into additional biomass

1693
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:26,679
implementing some of these cues like I

1694
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:28,520
said being able to transition it from

1695
01:09:26,679 --> 01:09:31,039
transition to bulking quicker due to the

1696
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:33,040
Emerson effect and pushing on and

1697
01:09:31,039 --> 01:09:35,560
letting off of the targeted stress at

1698
01:09:33,039 --> 01:09:38,079
specific implemented times allows you to

1699
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:40,359
sort of walk that line where you can

1700
01:09:38,079 --> 01:09:43,640
build up the the the biomass of the

1701
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:45,079
plant before allowing it to pack on um

1702
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:47,400
all of those secondaries that we're

1703
01:09:45,079 --> 01:09:50,119
after so the biggest takeaway for me is

1704
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:53,399
that we're in a fluid system here right

1705
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:54,880
and it's it's it's never you know week

1706
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:56,279
one this is what we're doing week two

1707
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:58,239
this is what we're doing week three this

1708
01:09:56,279 --> 01:10:01,198
is what we're doing we're we're

1709
01:09:58,238 --> 01:10:03,718
following what the plant is is is

1710
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:05,960
naturally doing and we're we're we're

1711
01:10:03,719 --> 01:10:09,198
we're we're optimizing and tailoring it

1712
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:11,800
to that plant's physiology for the best

1713
01:10:09,198 --> 01:10:14,479
outcome what what were some of your um

1714
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:16,600
EC uh targets as well as like

1715
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:20,559
temperatures and humidities throughout

1716
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:22,920
the this run so a big thing is people

1717
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:26,039
like to and we discussed this with with

1718
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:29,119
the drying thing is that tpin evaporate

1719
01:10:26,039 --> 01:10:33,479
at at 77° or whatever the case is and

1720
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:36,319
this is this is true to an extent um off

1721
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:40,599
gassing happens but uh this is this is

1722
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:43,319
occurring uh in in environments from

1723
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:45,719
ambient uh you know 68 degree

1724
01:10:43,319 --> 01:10:47,599
temperature all the way up to 100 degree

1725
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:50,520
temperature I I

1726
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:55,760
think the key here is to ensure that

1727
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:58,840
your your VPD is acting in as an agent

1728
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:59,760
for your water potential so when when we

1729
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:02,640
talk

1730
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:04,320
about understanding VPD it's doing so in

1731
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:07,280
the context of knowing how that's

1732
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:11,439
impacting how the plant is pulling water

1733
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:13,238
so I if I'm if I'm driving um a really

1734
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:15,519
high EC that's going to be pulling a lot

1735
01:11:13,238 --> 01:11:17,079
of water I need to understand what

1736
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,760
that's going to be doing to the osmotic

1737
01:11:17,079 --> 01:11:21,920
pressure and the PWC in my root Zone and

1738
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:24,400
I'm going to have to adjust all of those

1739
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:26,880
those metrics in unison so that they all

1740
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:29,599
fit one another accordingly

1741
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:31,840
um during transition like I said I was

1742
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:34,840
pushing really hard I wanted to see a

1743
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:37,360
minimum of of 6 EC at the root Zone to a

1744
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:39,159
peak of 10 EC U just as I started

1745
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:41,719
introducing those first p1s over the

1746
01:11:39,158 --> 01:11:43,759
course of the day and as I'd get as i'

1747
01:11:41,719 --> 01:11:45,960
get to that PTC especially during

1748
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:49,079
transition I would be pushing very

1749
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:53,158
minimal if any runoff just to maintain

1750
01:11:49,079 --> 01:11:54,479
that 10c the whole right through um now

1751
01:11:53,158 --> 01:11:57,679
when we get talk about getting to

1752
01:11:54,479 --> 01:12:00,319
bulking I'm slow I'm not I'm not W I'm

1753
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:01,960
not now starting to push 20% runoff on

1754
01:12:00,319 --> 01:12:04,119
every irrigation to try and bring that

1755
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:06,399
down what I'm doing is I'm slowly

1756
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:08,279
reducing that osmotic pressure day over

1757
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:11,799
day just so it's lower than it was the

1758
01:12:08,279 --> 01:12:14,719
day before that way it's it's now it

1759
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:16,000
it's like working out with with um a

1760
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:17,800
barbell right and then putting that

1761
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,960
barbell down and picking up a pencil all

1762
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:22,840
of a sudden the pencil feels like

1763
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:24,880
nothing right if I'm if day one my PWC

1764
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:27,520
is at 10 and then the next day with a

1765
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:28,760
little a runoff I bring it down to 9.5

1766
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,120
that pencil is going to feel a little

1767
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,840
bit lighter I'm going to be able to pull

1768
01:12:30,119 --> 01:12:34,319
up more nutrients I'm going to be able

1769
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:36,440
to bulk higher so the goal is to ride

1770
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:38,599
that pyc through transition and then

1771
01:12:36,439 --> 01:12:41,000
when I get into bulking day over day

1772
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:43,159
bringing it back down to that six number

1773
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,920
um but not all the way down because once

1774
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:46,559
bulking is done and we go into ripening

1775
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:52,239
I got to scale it all the way back up

1776
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:54,520
again so we're right 3.0 EC uh input yep

1777
01:12:52,238 --> 01:12:58,359
okay and you do you run that all the way

1778
01:12:54,520 --> 01:13:02,000
from veg through flower as well as fade

1779
01:12:58,359 --> 01:13:04,920
so I'll get i'll get my I'll get my EC

1780
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,439
up from clone so I'll I'll I'll start my

1781
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:13,039
clones out at 2 EC and I'll allow them

1782
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:15,158
to start to to work uh the PWC up um as

1783
01:13:13,039 --> 01:13:17,519
they root into the blocks and as they do

1784
01:13:15,158 --> 01:13:19,519
I'm slowly increasing my input EC

1785
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:21,040
because I'm only getting 10% Drive backs

1786
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:23,360
in that first couple those first two

1787
01:13:21,039 --> 01:13:25,880
weeks of vge right so I can safely

1788
01:13:23,359 --> 01:13:28,198
increase the input EC while not worrying

1789
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:30,840
about overdoing the PWC and as soon as

1790
01:13:28,198 --> 01:13:34,039
we flip and I start to see those 15 20

1791
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:36,159
25% dyb backs I don't have to worry

1792
01:13:34,039 --> 01:13:37,960
about climbing up the EC because I'm

1793
01:13:36,158 --> 01:13:40,238
already there my and now I'm just

1794
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:41,600
worrying about the PWC as managed

1795
01:13:40,238 --> 01:13:44,519
through my

1796
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:46,560
dybs got it yeah know I mean

1797
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:49,520
that's I I like to ask because some

1798
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:51,920
people will try to manipulate it through

1799
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:53,440
uh raising or lowering their input but I

1800
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,880
like to say you know it's it's really

1801
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:57,638
more about raising or lowering your

1802
01:13:55,880 --> 01:14:00,560
volume just to make sure that you hit

1803
01:13:57,639 --> 01:14:02,840
run off um yeah I got mine up here too

1804
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,960
as I've been seeing them floating around

1805
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:08,079
they

1806
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:10,359
say um but it's like all the things that

1807
01:14:08,079 --> 01:14:13,439
you can keep consistent without having

1808
01:14:10,359 --> 01:14:17,359
to chase something is really important

1809
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:20,119
um so one of one of the cool uh little

1810
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:24,039
papers I stumbled upon um while trying

1811
01:14:20,119 --> 01:14:26,359
to understand photosynthetic ceiling um

1812
01:14:24,039 --> 01:14:30,198
was was a concept called photop

1813
01:14:26,359 --> 01:14:33,519
plasticity and this allowed me to get to

1814
01:14:30,198 --> 01:14:35,198
my Peak ppfd for day one of flour

1815
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:39,679
without having to go into flour and

1816
01:14:35,198 --> 01:14:41,519
scale it up from 600 to 1,000 um and

1817
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:43,760
what we all do and what we've all always

1818
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:45,840
done is we've slowly increased these our

1819
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:48,400
our light intensity in increments week

1820
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:51,360
over week we'll go from you know 90 ppft

1821
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:53,599
to 250 to 450 to 650 and what's

1822
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:55,198
happening is somewhere somewhere in that

1823
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:57,520
day where you're increasing the light

1824
01:14:55,198 --> 01:14:59,359
your plant's hitting its DLI Max and it

1825
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:01,400
can't take any more light in it just

1826
01:14:59,359 --> 01:15:02,799
doesn't have the capacity to do it and

1827
01:15:01,399 --> 01:15:05,198
now we start a process of photo

1828
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:07,239
inhibition so whether that's 12 hours

1829
01:15:05,198 --> 01:15:09,439
into the day 14 hours into the day 16

1830
01:15:07,238 --> 01:15:11,079
hours into the day there's this block of

1831
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:12,960
time where your plant's being smashed

1832
01:15:11,079 --> 01:15:15,679
with light and it can't absorb it and

1833
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:17,239
it's creating reactive oxygen species

1834
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:21,119
just to try and mitigate some of that

1835
01:15:17,238 --> 01:15:23,759
damage right so right there we're we're

1836
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:25,880
now so that's that's creating you know

1837
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:28,440
chlorosis and yellow and all sorts of

1838
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:30,000
other problems that's making that's

1839
01:15:28,439 --> 01:15:31,279
bringing down that photosynthetic

1840
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,800
ceiling so the next day we're going to

1841
01:15:31,279 --> 01:15:34,519
increase the increment but we've

1842
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,560
actually reduce the amount that plant's

1843
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:38,199
capable of photosynthesizing right and

1844
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,840
we find ourselves oh so I don't know I'm

1845
01:15:38,198 --> 01:15:41,479
going to keep my light at 450 for 2

1846
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:43,119
weeks till it catches up or something

1847
01:15:41,479 --> 01:15:48,000
and we find ourselves losing a lot of

1848
01:15:43,119 --> 01:15:49,479
time if we go day one at 120 ppfd and

1849
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,198
then the next day we bring it back down

1850
01:15:49,479 --> 01:15:53,599
to

1851
01:15:50,198 --> 01:15:55,519
90 your plant has has had the ability to

1852
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,159
take in all those photons

1853
01:15:55,520 --> 01:16:00,719
but then we've given it a chance to sit

1854
01:15:57,158 --> 01:16:01,960
back relax regenerate with the

1855
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:03,679
understanding that that light is a

1856
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:05,480
possibility now so it's got that

1857
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:07,239
Reservoir filled but we're not

1858
01:16:05,479 --> 01:16:08,839
overloading it because now it's it's

1859
01:16:07,238 --> 01:16:11,039
kicking back on an easy day and then the

1860
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:13,239
next day we go up to 200 ppfd and it's

1861
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:15,399
like oh A Little Bit Stronger but it it

1862
01:16:13,238 --> 01:16:17,799
it has that capacity and we come back

1863
01:16:15,399 --> 01:16:19,559
the next day down to 120 and we let it

1864
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:22,440
ease off a little bit then the next day

1865
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:25,239
we're at 350 and we keep staggering our

1866
01:16:22,439 --> 01:16:28,519
approach upwards and it NE that that

1867
01:16:25,238 --> 01:16:30,718
continuously pushes the the physiology

1868
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:32,760
of the Leaf's photosynthetic capability

1869
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:34,840
higher while not overloading it and

1870
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:37,400
we're not compounding this this photo

1871
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:40,079
inhibition problem day over day over day

1872
01:16:37,399 --> 01:16:43,119
and what we see is that by the time we

1873
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:44,559
go from Week 1 where we're at 90 PFD

1874
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:46,439
we're in week three now and we're at

1875
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:48,560
12200 and the plant's asking for more

1876
01:16:46,439 --> 01:16:50,839
more more more more right so we can go

1877
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:53,000
ahead and flip day one not losing a

1878
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:55,600
single day pushing the plant as hard as

1879
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:58,198
it can we're on a clock right we have 55

1880
01:16:55,600 --> 01:17:00,400
to 70 days to flower if we're spending

1881
01:16:58,198 --> 01:17:02,879
the first two weeks coming up from 450

1882
01:17:00,399 --> 01:17:04,559
ppfd trying to hit our Max during

1883
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:07,600
transition when we're really trying to

1884
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:10,679
push that plant hard we're really behind

1885
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:13,679
the eightball now you right y so we can

1886
01:17:10,679 --> 01:17:16,359
save ourselves that whole that whole

1887
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:17,960
process just by getting it done in veg

1888
01:17:16,359 --> 01:17:19,158
that way the day we flip we're all ready

1889
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:22,560
where we need to be we don't even have

1890
01:17:19,158 --> 01:17:24,599
to touch our lights anymore no no I mean

1891
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:28,159
I I really like that approach I've um

1892
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:31,000
I've use the approach of uh dou or um

1893
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:34,000
not doubling but um increasing by half

1894
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:38,238
the ppfd day one of flower because you

1895
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:42,319
lose uh a third of your DLI uh by going

1896
01:17:38,238 --> 01:17:44,439
from 18 to 12 and so just by doubling it

1897
01:17:42,319 --> 01:17:46,920
your your ppfd at canopy you hit the

1898
01:17:44,439 --> 01:17:49,279
same DLI pretty easily that way but you

1899
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:51,158
can in certain cultivars run into some

1900
01:17:49,279 --> 01:17:53,119
huge stress factors of them not being

1901
01:17:51,158 --> 01:17:55,158
able to photosynthesize at that same

1902
01:17:53,119 --> 01:17:56,760
rate but some plants they just go right

1903
01:17:55,158 --> 01:17:59,279
into it and they're fine with it as long

1904
01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:02,960
as I think I think people people tend to

1905
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:05,559
focus a lot on on ppfd while ignoring

1906
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:07,800
DLI as a as a greenhouse metric right

1907
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:09,320
when when in fact it's it's it's the

1908
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,719
most important metric we should be

1909
01:18:09,319 --> 01:18:12,319
measuring when we're talking about light

1910
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:15,079
because your plants are only capable of

1911
01:18:12,319 --> 01:18:17,599
eating so much light in a day right I

1912
01:18:15,079 --> 01:18:20,519
mean understanding that metric will will

1913
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:22,639
go in veg a lot of people tell me I hate

1914
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:25,120
veg flowers so much

1915
01:18:22,639 --> 01:18:26,520
easier chances are you're over loading

1916
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:28,880
your plant with lights and veg and

1917
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:30,880
that's why they look sad and purple and

1918
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:33,159
and and what whatever you're sitting

1919
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:35,400
here dumping on all these amendments and

1920
01:18:33,158 --> 01:18:37,799
fixes and and flushing it and drying it

1921
01:18:35,399 --> 01:18:39,198
out and turn down the light like a

1922
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:41,400
little bit and you'll see it bounce back

1923
01:18:39,198 --> 01:18:44,000
to happiest can be because we're not

1924
01:18:41,399 --> 01:18:47,479
paying attention to what 18 hours of

1925
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:50,319
photons radiating a leaf does versus 12

1926
01:18:47,479 --> 01:18:53,718
absolutely no I um I feel like there are

1927
01:18:50,319 --> 01:18:55,519
a lot of oversights within hom Growers

1928
01:18:53,719 --> 01:18:57,119
and just like what you were talking

1929
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:00,000
about earlier how there's just so much

1930
01:18:57,119 --> 01:19:02,679
of this stuff that was bro sciencer

1931
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:06,359
because they told me so and it works and

1932
01:19:02,679 --> 01:19:08,639
now there's the ability to apply a more

1933
01:19:06,359 --> 01:19:10,960
scientific lens as well as just have a

1934
01:19:08,639 --> 01:19:15,039
little bit more access to information

1935
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:17,399
that is um well formulated and it

1936
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:19,719
doesn't rely on because someone told you

1937
01:19:17,399 --> 01:19:21,599
so it it it'll tell you why it works and

1938
01:19:19,719 --> 01:19:23,319
you can look into those processes and be

1939
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,120
like oh well this happens for all plants

1940
01:19:23,319 --> 01:19:27,599
or this happens for all cellular

1941
01:19:25,119 --> 01:19:29,439
respiration or this is you know it

1942
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:33,520
there's a lot of things like

1943
01:19:29,439 --> 01:19:35,559
that holistic approach on I I I did one

1944
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:37,360
of my drawing posts where I tried to get

1945
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:38,920
the information about what I was what

1946
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:41,279
what I was trying to educate people on

1947
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:43,840
and one of the things uh oh you

1948
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:46,960
referenced a you referenced a paper on

1949
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:49,239
on rice rice isn't cannabis and it it

1950
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:51,119
was directly discussing how chlorophyll

1951
01:19:49,238 --> 01:19:53,959
behaved in the dark and I I I I had

1952
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:55,359
referenced this paper to you earlier and

1953
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:57,198
the fact of the matter is is

1954
01:19:55,359 --> 01:19:59,119
chlorophylls chlorophylls chlorophyll

1955
01:19:57,198 --> 01:20:01,399
and it's going to do what chlorophyll

1956
01:19:59,119 --> 01:20:03,439
does in the presence of either light or

1957
01:20:01,399 --> 01:20:05,158
dark it's it's it's a molecule that's

1958
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:06,879
evolved a very specific function whether

1959
01:20:05,158 --> 01:20:10,119
it's in a tomato or it's in rice or it's

1960
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:12,039
in cannabis or it's an algae um it it

1961
01:20:10,119 --> 01:20:14,719
has a specific inherent function that

1962
01:20:12,039 --> 01:20:16,000
doesn't that doesn't negate its purpose

1963
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:18,920
simply because it doesn't fit your

1964
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:21,039
ideology right right it's like we we

1965
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:22,560
don't know that these different tpin

1966
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:24,840
oxidize at different temperatures

1967
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:27,000
because we took cannabis derived tpin

1968
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:28,719
and oxidize them these are the same tpin

1969
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:31,399
that you find everywhere else and we

1970
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:34,560
have plenty of data from 100 years ago

1971
01:20:31,399 --> 01:20:36,359
plus on oxidation uh go look at the go

1972
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,520
look at a paper on hops it'll tell you

1973
01:20:36,359 --> 01:20:41,599
everything you need to know exactly and

1974
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:43,239
so a lot of this stuff that is you know

1975
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:45,960
like I said earlier people think

1976
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:47,879
cannabis is this special magical plant

1977
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:50,520
and while there are aspects of it that I

1978
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:52,520
will not deny are pretty darn cool and

1979
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:55,159
not really necessarily found in a lot of

1980
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:57,960
other places on Earth um it's still a

1981
01:20:55,158 --> 01:21:00,039
plant and it still does what plants do

1982
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:03,679
and so I I was being I don't know if you

1983
01:21:00,039 --> 01:21:05,560
saw my my my oped post I did a few days

1984
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:08,520
ago but I ended it with a little tongue

1985
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:10,400
and Chic sort of sort of Quip saying if

1986
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:12,719
you want verified data go follow a

1987
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:14,920
tomato farmer cuz they don't do they

1988
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:16,880
don't do anything that doesn't work

1989
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:19,199
there's too much money they've invested

1990
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:21,319
there's too much risk stake in the game

1991
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:23,359
that if it doesn't work the SOP is

1992
01:21:21,319 --> 01:21:26,158
eliminated and if it works we're using

1993
01:21:23,359 --> 01:21:29,198
it plain and simple um there's not n of

1994
01:21:26,158 --> 01:21:31,479
the it's like the generative vegetative

1995
01:21:29,198 --> 01:21:33,559
uh cycles of crop steering it's like

1996
01:21:31,479 --> 01:21:34,959
that is not at all even close to

1997
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:37,239
something that cannabis started with

1998
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:40,039
this is what Greenhouse Vine tomato

1999
01:21:37,238 --> 01:21:42,559
Growers been doing for centuries not

2000
01:21:40,039 --> 01:21:43,800
centuries decades sorry I mean like but

2001
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:45,719
that this is what I'm saying like there

2002
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:49,400
there's been there's there's there are

2003
01:21:45,719 --> 01:21:51,840
papers from from 1977 expressing how a

2004
01:21:49,399 --> 01:21:53,198
generative Q uh through high EC can

2005
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:55,400
increase the sugar content of your

2006
01:21:53,198 --> 01:21:57,960
tomato right like it's it's it's not new

2007
01:21:55,399 --> 01:21:59,638
we just like oh this works too yeah it's

2008
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:01,119
like you go to a tomato farmer and you

2009
01:21:59,639 --> 01:22:04,600
show them a dosatron and they're going

2010
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:08,439
to be like yeah I have like 30 of those

2011
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:10,800
um them yeah it's really silly to think

2012
01:22:08,439 --> 01:22:14,719
that like because it's implemented in

2013
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:16,600
cannabis that it is uh the first uh of

2014
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:18,880
any kind it's you know they're it's all

2015
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:20,920
just plants and we've understand a lot

2016
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:23,119
of the aspects of how plants work for

2017
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:24,719
quite some time and so looking at those

2018
01:22:23,119 --> 01:22:27,238
other aspects like I said with like

2019
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:30,520
plant empowerment or uh books like

2020
01:22:27,238 --> 01:22:32,198
hydrop hydroponic food production um all

2021
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:33,880
these different things that are really

2022
01:22:32,198 --> 01:22:36,799
well written they give a lot of great

2023
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:39,319
information but are not at all directly

2024
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:42,360
talking about cannabis soil food web

2025
01:22:39,319 --> 01:22:43,920
great one exactly especially yeah if if

2026
01:22:42,359 --> 01:22:46,319
you're going towards like a salt-based

2027
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:48,079
feed I would say like hydroponic food

2028
01:22:46,319 --> 01:22:49,599
production soil food web if you're going

2029
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:51,800
for something where you want to

2030
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:53,679
understand the different components of

2031
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:55,639
the soil and how those are going to

2032
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:57,279
break down uh the inputs that you're

2033
01:22:55,639 --> 01:22:59,960
putting in that aren't readily available

2034
01:22:57,279 --> 01:23:01,880
to plants all these different things are

2035
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:03,079
well known and understood and I mean

2036
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:06,079
there's still parts of them that are

2037
01:23:03,079 --> 01:23:08,319
still being discovered but um I wouldn't

2038
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:11,399
say cannabis Growers are the ones doing

2039
01:23:08,319 --> 01:23:14,238
the discovery ab and that's such that's

2040
01:23:11,399 --> 01:23:17,359
so bang on is that like there's there's

2041
01:23:14,238 --> 01:23:20,158
very very little left for us to to

2042
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:21,799
Eureka the agricultural agricultural

2043
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:23,799
World about they're they're all sitting

2044
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:25,520
back like oh welcome young nephew like

2045
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:29,039
come on in we been here a while like you

2046
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:31,280
know what I mean it's it's we we if we

2047
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:33,519
if we recognize that we can utilize

2048
01:23:31,279 --> 01:23:36,238
their experience to our advantage and a

2049
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:38,360
lot of us are are missing that one it's

2050
01:23:36,238 --> 01:23:40,279
it's like uh triploid and polyploid

2051
01:23:38,359 --> 01:23:42,399
breeding and everyone's like oh look how

2052
01:23:40,279 --> 01:23:46,079
cool this is and it's like uh Monsanto

2053
01:23:42,399 --> 01:23:47,319
enters the chat um get get real we've

2054
01:23:46,079 --> 01:23:48,880
we've known about this you're telling me

2055
01:23:47,319 --> 01:23:50,399
it won't reproduce but we can still get

2056
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:52,719
we can still get the monetary value off

2057
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:54,439
it we've been invested thank you yeah

2058
01:23:52,719 --> 01:24:00,198
we've been invested in that yeah exactly

2059
01:23:54,439 --> 01:24:01,879
ex l so um well uh let's let's go into a

2060
01:24:00,198 --> 01:24:04,319
little bit of what you're doing now

2061
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:06,039
currently um we touched on it briefly at

2062
01:24:04,319 --> 01:24:08,238
the beginning but like run a little bit

2063
01:24:06,039 --> 01:24:09,760
of uh like through your process you know

2064
01:24:08,238 --> 01:24:13,638
you you've created a really good uh

2065
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:16,679
egress point to your your sterile um

2066
01:24:13,639 --> 01:24:18,079
workspace and uh you have some other

2067
01:24:16,679 --> 01:24:19,440
other cool things that you're working on

2068
01:24:18,079 --> 01:24:22,519
in there so why don't you just talk

2069
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:24,158
about it for a bit so like I said in the

2070
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:26,600
beginning I think you know I'm noticing

2071
01:24:24,158 --> 01:24:29,920
a paradigm shift in the industry we've

2072
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:35,079
got we've got pathogens just running

2073
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:38,119
rampant and and and pervasively uh in in

2074
01:24:35,079 --> 01:24:40,039
intervening on on on our Market to the

2075
01:24:38,119 --> 01:24:41,760
point where we're seeing we're seeing

2076
01:24:40,039 --> 01:24:46,399
widespread damage and and near

2077
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:49,000
destruction of of of whole crops and um

2078
01:24:46,399 --> 01:24:54,439
I I think the number was somewhere like

2079
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:58,279
66% of of uh all plant samples tested

2080
01:24:54,439 --> 01:25:01,359
from a Litany of facilities and and and

2081
01:24:58,279 --> 01:25:03,840
Distributors had all tested for hlv and

2082
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:05,679
and I think that we're only going to see

2083
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:08,480
that problem get worse and worse and

2084
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:10,000
worse um and I think with tissue tissue

2085
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:11,559
culture

2086
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,399
being

2087
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:16,400
inherently

2088
01:25:13,399 --> 01:25:18,799
um the solution to that specific problem

2089
01:25:16,399 --> 01:25:20,279
in the sense that um you know with

2090
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:22,079
scalability doesn't come the same

2091
01:25:20,279 --> 01:25:23,719
problems as we see with with with

2092
01:25:22,079 --> 01:25:26,000
cultivation scalability right you can

2093
01:25:23,719 --> 01:25:28,079
keep an entire higher mother Renos the

2094
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,600
more plants you have in there the the in

2095
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:32,279
the higher your increased risk of

2096
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:35,400
pathogen in infection becomes um

2097
01:25:32,279 --> 01:25:37,479
scalability and labor costs on keeping

2098
01:25:35,399 --> 01:25:39,879
uh on keeping that R&amp;D room up and

2099
01:25:37,479 --> 01:25:42,238
running is is is becoming more and more

2100
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:44,480
exponential every day and as I've shown

2101
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:46,118
proof of concept and as tissue culture

2102
01:25:44,479 --> 01:25:50,000
the industry itself is showing

2103
01:25:46,118 --> 01:25:53,000
repeatedly um when you can scale an

2104
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:57,679
entire thousand light grow room with

2105
01:25:53,000 --> 01:26:00,000
4,000 plants from a single 400q foot lab

2106
01:25:57,679 --> 01:26:02,840
um with minimal overhead costs next to

2107
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:06,039
no maintenance costs and no maintenance

2108
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:08,279
labor um that's just a a no-brain move

2109
01:26:06,039 --> 01:26:11,399
so I think for me what I'd like to do is

2110
01:26:08,279 --> 01:26:14,359
I'd like to start an an an elite clean

2111
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:16,799
sterile genetics Library um that's just

2112
01:26:14,359 --> 01:26:19,158
always available and and on stock for

2113
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:21,600
the Breeders themselves specifically I

2114
01:26:19,158 --> 01:26:23,638
don't I don't I don't want to have you

2115
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:26,119
know this won't be a public clone bank

2116
01:26:23,639 --> 01:26:28,960
or anything but what it will be is a a

2117
01:26:26,118 --> 01:26:32,759
safe clean repository for the storage of

2118
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:38,000
of breeder specific hunted phenotypes

2119
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:41,760
and and what I aim to be is is the go-to

2120
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:43,880
place for for ensuring that the

2121
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:46,199
preservation of the of those lineages

2122
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:48,679
going forward um and it you know it

2123
01:26:46,198 --> 01:26:50,439
won't it won't be a a single serve

2124
01:26:48,679 --> 01:26:54,000
operation where it's it's meant to

2125
01:26:50,439 --> 01:26:58,158
preserve my genetics or I'd like to be

2126
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:01,039
the Norwegian seed Vault of of cannabis

2127
01:26:58,158 --> 01:27:04,279
genetics and I think for sure I think

2128
01:27:01,039 --> 01:27:06,118
that with with my positioning in the

2129
01:27:04,279 --> 01:27:10,238
market and my relationships with a lot

2130
01:27:06,118 --> 01:27:13,238
of a lot of great breeders

2131
01:27:10,238 --> 01:27:14,919
um my propensity to get the things I'd

2132
01:27:13,238 --> 01:27:17,638
like to get and do the things I want to

2133
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:21,600
do in life I I I'm confident that I'll

2134
01:27:17,639 --> 01:27:23,239
be able to to build into in into that so

2135
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:26,159
what I'm doing now is I'm starting off

2136
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:29,279
now I've got all of um um phenoh hunter

2137
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:30,879
green lab genetics new uh feminized line

2138
01:27:29,279 --> 01:27:33,319
he's did a collaboration with flavor

2139
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:35,079
genetics and I've got their entire line

2140
01:27:33,319 --> 01:27:37,079
uh backed up on my shelf now we're going

2141
01:27:35,079 --> 01:27:39,319
to be doing rooted plantlets I'll send a

2142
01:27:37,079 --> 01:27:40,800
bunch back to him a couple of the rooted

2143
01:27:39,319 --> 01:27:43,519
plantlets we're going to harden and run

2144
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:45,440
in my space as well U you know and try

2145
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:47,800
and collect a couple of phenotypes back

2146
01:27:45,439 --> 01:27:50,919
off of those and in doing so I'm going

2147
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:52,600
to advertise that that you know other

2148
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:55,199
other geneticists and breeders that that

2149
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:58,320
would like to partake in the Pro that

2150
01:27:55,198 --> 01:28:01,919
that it'll be a

2151
01:27:58,319 --> 01:28:04,479
uh easily accessible you know send in

2152
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:06,199
your sample I'll have it ready to go

2153
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:09,039
when you have a room you know say you

2154
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:11,799
need 2500 plants you give me two weeks

2155
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:13,760
notice I get you 2500 plantlets ready

2156
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:15,920
ship them out in a box and your room is

2157
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:19,719
ready to go so I think the the

2158
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:21,719
turnaround time for for these facilities

2159
01:28:19,719 --> 01:28:25,760
and these breeders to

2160
01:28:21,719 --> 01:28:29,399
get um to get from order to room full

2161
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:33,000
filled with rooted plantlets is

2162
01:28:29,399 --> 01:28:35,799
is gamechanging as far as reducing their

2163
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:38,639
overhead costs yeah we we just did an

2164
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:41,039
episode with uh Jesse lock from uh I

2165
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:43,279
think it's Jesse lock from uh Mothership

2166
01:28:41,039 --> 01:28:46,560
labs and uh they do tissue culture

2167
01:28:43,279 --> 01:28:48,759
services and um he was showing us uh in

2168
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:51,280
the background of he had to run out to

2169
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:55,560
Florida to a facility that does uh 5

2170
01:28:51,279 --> 01:28:57,238
million um xplants a year and it was you

2171
01:28:55,560 --> 01:29:00,239
know it's very impressive and it's a lot

2172
01:28:57,238 --> 01:29:03,158
of work but the the maintenance on it is

2173
01:29:00,238 --> 01:29:06,279
where I feel like the win is because you

2174
01:29:03,158 --> 01:29:08,839
have such uh reduction in maintenance

2175
01:29:06,279 --> 01:29:10,118
overall um reduction square footage

2176
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:13,319
overhead

2177
01:29:10,118 --> 01:29:16,960
operational everything um where it it

2178
01:29:13,319 --> 01:29:20,039
does become this sort of um like it

2179
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:23,039
could be a secret tool to help a lot of

2180
01:29:20,039 --> 01:29:26,198
even the small mom and pop grows and I

2181
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:27,800
think I think consistency uh in your end

2182
01:29:26,198 --> 01:29:30,118
product right like if if you as a

2183
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:31,639
consumer go to The Dispensary for a

2184
01:29:30,118 --> 01:29:33,118
certain product and you get that product

2185
01:29:31,639 --> 01:29:35,560
and I love it and I'm going back to get

2186
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:37,319
that one but the next bag came from a

2187
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:39,280
different plant that's a slightly

2188
01:29:37,319 --> 01:29:41,599
different choar simply because of

2189
01:29:39,279 --> 01:29:43,960
abiotic factors that occurred 10 tables

2190
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:45,440
down right that that's that's altering

2191
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:48,279
your customers's experience either for

2192
01:29:45,439 --> 01:29:53,238
the better or for the worse there is

2193
01:29:48,279 --> 01:29:54,759
zero genetic um Drift from a from um

2194
01:29:53,238 --> 01:29:56,919
propagation perspective perspective that

2195
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:59,039
we would see with with ordinary cloning

2196
01:29:56,920 --> 01:30:02,319
um because especially for doing Mary

2197
01:29:59,039 --> 01:30:04,719
stem it's nonvascular cell cellular uh

2198
01:30:02,319 --> 01:30:07,759
um propagation meaning it's happening so

2199
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:12,079
fast there's that that there's little

2200
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:14,199
chance for for those alal mutations to

2201
01:30:12,079 --> 01:30:16,639
occur in such a small space of time so

2202
01:30:14,198 --> 01:30:19,000
every single plant is every single

2203
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:21,560
genetic identical which is huge when

2204
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:24,198
you're running a room of a thousand PLS

2205
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:27,400
I I think about it for the application

2206
01:30:24,198 --> 01:30:29,519
in pheno hunting especially when you see

2207
01:30:27,399 --> 01:30:32,000
that um you know you got a keeper you

2208
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:35,159
want it to be your keeper yeah and and

2209
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:37,118
the the upkeep on you know a thousand

2210
01:30:35,158 --> 01:30:39,439
plant feno hunt let's say that means you

2211
01:30:37,118 --> 01:30:42,519
need a thousand clones of it going or a

2212
01:30:39,439 --> 01:30:45,279
thousand moms and then you're watering

2213
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:48,040
all of them watering

2214
01:30:45,279 --> 01:30:49,679
lighting everything that goes into I

2215
01:30:48,039 --> 01:30:55,118
already think about it and it's a

2216
01:30:49,679 --> 01:31:00,118
headache but if I have one single um

2217
01:30:55,118 --> 01:31:03,439
you know 48 by 72 by8 rack with five or

2218
01:31:00,118 --> 01:31:04,880
six shelves on it with minimal lighting

2219
01:31:03,439 --> 01:31:07,799
just go with like clone lighting or

2220
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:11,639
something you know you could have 10,000

2221
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:13,600
different xplants on there and so it's

2222
01:31:11,639 --> 01:31:17,319
and from those 10,000 xplants right I

2223
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:20,600
can subculture 50,000 uh 50,000

2224
01:31:17,319 --> 01:31:22,599
subcultured plantlets right and then

2225
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:24,920
those 10,000 plantlets are I'll either

2226
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:26,239
make more xplants or we'll let them

2227
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:28,399
we'll let them re-shoot and there's

2228
01:31:26,238 --> 01:31:30,959
another 50,000 more in two in two weeks

2229
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:33,479
so it's it's it's it's infinite plants

2230
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:35,079
for for minimal square footage which is

2231
01:31:33,479 --> 01:31:37,718
the name of the game right when when we

2232
01:31:35,079 --> 01:31:40,920
look at our overhead costs especially

2233
01:31:37,719 --> 01:31:42,880
especially as they scale up um any area

2234
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:45,158
you can reduce especially especially

2235
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:48,239
your energy input costs like this when

2236
01:31:45,158 --> 01:31:50,839
when you can go from from you know 4,000

2237
01:31:48,238 --> 01:31:55,279
foot mom room down to like I said a 400

2238
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:57,199
square foot uh shelving unit then then

2239
01:31:55,279 --> 01:31:57,960
you're you're saving yourself 300 Grand

2240
01:31:57,198 --> 01:32:00,479
a

2241
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:05,118
year yeah easily on the on the

2242
01:32:00,479 --> 01:32:06,759
electrical Alone um yeah it's and in in

2243
01:32:05,118 --> 01:32:08,920
this in this climate how do you argue

2244
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:12,079
that really it's really hard to

2245
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:14,639
especially considering how the market uh

2246
01:32:12,079 --> 01:32:16,639
demand changes on a weekly basis for

2247
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:19,199
what flavor people want on the shelf and

2248
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:20,760
so in order to be able to anticipate

2249
01:32:19,198 --> 01:32:22,879
what that you need to have a huge

2250
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:26,159
library to select from we've gone into

2251
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:28,440
this fun blood leing era of the industry

2252
01:32:26,158 --> 01:32:30,439
where we're no longer a cash crop you're

2253
01:32:28,439 --> 01:32:32,759
an agricultural commodity that's

2254
01:32:30,439 --> 01:32:35,000
unsubsidized um Corn's got to leg up on

2255
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:37,280
you big guy so you know you got to you

2256
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:39,479
got to make you got to make that that

2257
01:32:37,279 --> 01:32:41,960
those savings where you can get them

2258
01:32:39,479 --> 01:32:44,158
yeah we can't even row crop with

2259
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:46,920
seeds that's what I

2260
01:32:44,158 --> 01:32:50,599
mean we're we're so hindered and so

2261
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:54,639
handcuffed by by by not only legislation

2262
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:58,079
but but the market cap based on

2263
01:32:54,639 --> 01:33:00,118
on supply and demand that you know if if

2264
01:32:58,079 --> 01:33:01,920
if you really want to lose a 100 Grand

2265
01:33:00,118 --> 01:33:03,920
because you wanted to keep a couple of

2266
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:05,719
moms around it it it just seems

2267
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:07,800
fiduciary

2268
01:33:05,719 --> 01:33:11,000
irresponsible right

2269
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:13,239
absolutely um well I feel like you've

2270
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:16,118
pivoted a few times just to make sure

2271
01:33:13,238 --> 01:33:17,479
that you stay ahead of the curve um so

2272
01:33:16,118 --> 01:33:21,279
you might be one of the PE perfect

2273
01:33:17,479 --> 01:33:23,879
people to ask um and and you could

2274
01:33:21,279 --> 01:33:27,238
approach this in either of two ways uh

2275
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:29,520
what do you feel you see changing in the

2276
01:33:27,238 --> 01:33:31,638
Cannabis industry coming up or what

2277
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:33,560
would you like to see change in the

2278
01:33:31,639 --> 01:33:35,440
Cannabis industry and you can tackle

2279
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:36,719
those together or separately or just one

2280
01:33:35,439 --> 01:33:39,319
or the

2281
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:40,960
other we're heading for a reckoning one

2282
01:33:39,319 --> 01:33:44,840
way or another whether I like it or I

2283
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:48,719
don't like it um the genetic dilution

2284
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:53,000
we've seen from just years of

2285
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:54,880
unregulated pollen chucking um has has

2286
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:59,760
been detrimental there's no there's no

2287
01:33:54,880 --> 01:34:02,279
way around it um you know the the

2288
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:07,199
variety with which we're

2289
01:34:02,279 --> 01:34:09,759
we're accustomed to now is one thing but

2290
01:34:07,198 --> 01:34:13,638
you get this this sense that that we've

2291
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:15,920
lost um we've lost something along the

2292
01:34:13,639 --> 01:34:18,159
way right with every with every new cake

2293
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:21,560
cross with every new with every new

2294
01:34:18,158 --> 01:34:23,039
zittles this and candies that um

2295
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:24,480
everything starts to become a little

2296
01:34:23,039 --> 01:34:27,158
more

2297
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:28,079
Blended a little less unique a little

2298
01:34:27,158 --> 01:34:30,238
less

2299
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:34,479
defined

2300
01:34:30,238 --> 01:34:39,399
um frankly what I see happening

2301
01:34:34,479 --> 01:34:42,559
is the closer we get to normalizing um

2302
01:34:39,399 --> 01:34:44,759
genetic sequence editing the the better

2303
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:46,039
off will all be uh frankly and I know

2304
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:48,800
that sounds like a

2305
01:34:46,039 --> 01:34:50,600
scary you know you reference Monsanto

2306
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:53,000
earlier and I know that sounds you know

2307
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:54,679
it's a big scary evil word but when we

2308
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:58,238
think of

2309
01:34:54,679 --> 01:35:00,319
of GMO we only hear like the boogeyman

2310
01:34:58,238 --> 01:35:02,279
speak and not some of the benefits

2311
01:35:00,319 --> 01:35:04,599
available through through being able to

2312
01:35:02,279 --> 01:35:06,599
to to moderate what it is we're trying

2313
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:08,320
to accomplish like I said we're seeing a

2314
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:12,639
massive problems with pathogens we're

2315
01:35:08,319 --> 01:35:15,840
seeing huge problems with um

2316
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:17,960
um genetic and fallacies like there's

2317
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:21,800
there's just there's just so much

2318
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:24,800
looseness and not there not enough um

2319
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:27,000
structure to

2320
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:29,760
to preserve what it is we all we're all

2321
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:32,679
so passionate about right I think if we

2322
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:36,039
can get to a point where where we've got

2323
01:35:32,679 --> 01:35:37,960
where we've got plants that we can we we

2324
01:35:36,039 --> 01:35:41,238
can you know

2325
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:44,560
make resistant to specific specific

2326
01:35:41,238 --> 01:35:48,678
pathogens and and and and we can we can

2327
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:50,480
um Express specific dominant traits uh

2328
01:35:48,679 --> 01:35:52,520
to better suit what it is our customers

2329
01:35:50,479 --> 01:35:54,479
are after at the end of the day this

2330
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:56,400
isn't about like a a dick measuring

2331
01:35:54,479 --> 01:35:58,479
contest or I'm the best grower because I

2332
01:35:56,399 --> 01:35:59,799
know how to do it naturally the end of

2333
01:35:58,479 --> 01:36:01,359
the day we're just trying to We're just

2334
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:04,199
trying to provide the best product to

2335
01:36:01,359 --> 01:36:07,399
our our consumer um and if we can do

2336
01:36:04,198 --> 01:36:10,279
that with with the computer then I'm I'm

2337
01:36:07,399 --> 01:36:13,399
I'm for it and I think you

2338
01:36:10,279 --> 01:36:15,198
know while monopolizing an entire

2339
01:36:13,399 --> 01:36:17,359
agricultural industry because you're the

2340
01:36:15,198 --> 01:36:21,519
most powerful company on Earth has its

2341
01:36:17,359 --> 01:36:21,519
ethical issues I don't think that's a

2342
01:36:21,639 --> 01:36:28,840
necessary intrinsic inher cury that

2343
01:36:24,238 --> 01:36:33,118
comes along with with with Gene editing

2344
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:34,840
or or or um you know sequencing our food

2345
01:36:33,118 --> 01:36:37,399
or or or any of the technological

2346
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:39,639
advances we're capable of achieving just

2347
01:36:37,399 --> 01:36:41,599
because it's used for nefarious purposes

2348
01:36:39,639 --> 01:36:43,600
in some instances right I think yeah

2349
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:45,679
that technology is not evil inherently

2350
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:47,800
it's all about the people using it

2351
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:49,760
absolutely then turn it into something

2352
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:51,520
that it wasn't either intended for but

2353
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:54,639
you know part of the responsibility of

2354
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:57,159
even like the creation of these new

2355
01:36:54,639 --> 01:37:00,359
technologies and and applications and

2356
01:36:57,158 --> 01:37:03,118
stuff is uh trying to

2357
01:37:00,359 --> 01:37:06,118
forecast what some of

2358
01:37:03,118 --> 01:37:09,118
those uses might be who's in a position

2359
01:37:06,118 --> 01:37:10,238
to leverage those over over you know

2360
01:37:09,118 --> 01:37:14,118
what

2361
01:37:10,238 --> 01:37:16,678
what your your ideology would would

2362
01:37:14,118 --> 01:37:18,399
suppose it would versus what the reality

2363
01:37:16,679 --> 01:37:21,079
of the situation is right like at the

2364
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:24,638
end of the day do I have more money than

2365
01:37:21,079 --> 01:37:26,238
than say Monsanto to say all go and edit

2366
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:28,639
and patent it no they probably just

2367
01:37:26,238 --> 01:37:30,158
steamroll me you know take the patent do

2368
01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:32,359
it themselves hey what a great idea look

2369
01:37:30,158 --> 01:37:34,279
what we've just reintroduced so that's

2370
01:37:32,359 --> 01:37:36,960
obviously always a huge consideration is

2371
01:37:34,279 --> 01:37:38,679
the ethical um responsibilities that

2372
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:40,158
come along with with some of these

2373
01:37:38,679 --> 01:37:42,760
discoveries and and and and these

2374
01:37:40,158 --> 01:37:45,279
advances but at the end of the

2375
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:47,000
day things move forward with or without

2376
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:50,000
us right and we'd rather be on the right

2377
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:53,039
side of it than the wrong absolutely I I

2378
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:55,599
couldn't agree more um so with with all

2379
01:37:53,039 --> 01:37:57,519
of your experience as well uh in terms

2380
01:37:55,599 --> 01:38:00,760
of the different experiments that you've

2381
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:03,320
applied to your Gardens you know Finding

2382
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:06,560
success in certain aspects perhaps

2383
01:38:03,319 --> 01:38:08,559
failures in other aspects um what are

2384
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:10,800
some of those pitfalls that you see

2385
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:14,039
growers face maybe that you've faced

2386
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:16,639
yourself uh that you would help uh

2387
01:38:14,039 --> 01:38:20,840
caution new growers

2388
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:22,000
in so one of the biggest failing points

2389
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:24,840
that

2390
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:26,439
that tends to be a really hard learning

2391
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:28,840
curve despite how many years of

2392
01:38:26,439 --> 01:38:33,279
experience you have in this field tends

2393
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:37,119
to be the this this inclination to need

2394
01:38:33,279 --> 01:38:39,079
to Baby new plants um and it's always

2395
01:38:37,118 --> 01:38:43,759
almost detrimental to the point where

2396
01:38:39,079 --> 01:38:45,079
you're you're causing long-term issues

2397
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:47,199
that you're not going to be able to

2398
01:38:45,079 --> 01:38:49,279
outrun simply by overwatering that

2399
01:38:47,198 --> 01:38:51,000
little plantlet in your three three

2400
01:38:49,279 --> 01:38:52,800
gallon pot that's got no roots and

2401
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:54,960
you're just sitting there watering soil

2402
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:56,840
and this this happens repeatedly over

2403
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:58,960
and over and over as even happens with

2404
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:00,560
experienced cultivators who are oh I

2405
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:04,039
haven't watered it in 2 days I'd better

2406
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:04,039
get on it I'll tell you a

2407
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:11,000
secret um I'll let I'm gonna until I see

2408
01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:13,599
until I see that tror pressure start to

2409
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:15,560
drop and the leaves go now you're

2410
01:39:13,599 --> 01:39:18,119
thirsty I know the roots are out there

2411
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:21,039
somewhere searching for water but the

2412
01:39:18,118 --> 01:39:24,359
entire goal of the first two weeks of

2413
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:26,920
that plant's life is to establish a

2414
01:39:24,359 --> 01:39:28,960
strong healthy vigorous root Zone and

2415
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:31,760
the only way to do that is to make it go

2416
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:34,439
find water stop Watering your young

2417
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:36,520
plants that don't need it a lot of

2418
01:39:34,439 --> 01:39:39,198
people won't believe me when I say that

2419
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:41,679
uh from transplant until flower I

2420
01:39:39,198 --> 01:39:44,559
probably water twice me too and that's

2421
01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:46,800
once and that's once at transplant me

2422
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:48,639
too like I'll saturate the blocks I'll

2423
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:51,320
put it in I'll Water the thing in I'll

2424
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:52,960
see you in a week later yep saturate

2425
01:39:51,319 --> 01:39:56,000
again and then usually people people

2426
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:58,719
people always very apprehensive about

2427
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:01,760
that but as I've seen Time and Time and

2428
01:39:58,719 --> 01:40:04,319
Time Again setting them up strong with a

2429
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:07,480
strong Foundation a good vigorous root

2430
01:40:04,319 --> 01:40:08,960
base is the only way to ensure that

2431
01:40:07,479 --> 01:40:10,919
they're going to be taking up the amount

2432
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:12,560
of water you're going to need to put on

2433
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:14,760
them in order to get the results you

2434
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:16,719
want to get well and the fertilizer

2435
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:19,119
Blends are so much better nowadays than

2436
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:21,279
they used to be that a big reason for

2437
01:40:19,118 --> 01:40:23,479
these high paracity Blends where they

2438
01:40:21,279 --> 01:40:24,880
would even take cocoa out a little P

2439
01:40:23,479 --> 01:40:28,638
moss and then a bunch of perlite and

2440
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:32,159
pmus and vermiculite to it would be to

2441
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:34,960
uh increase the available Air at Field

2442
01:40:32,158 --> 01:40:37,118
capacity so that you could water every

2443
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:39,000
day because you needed to replenish

2444
01:40:37,118 --> 01:40:41,319
those nutrients that you watered the day

2445
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,920
before because they were imbalanced

2446
01:40:41,319 --> 01:40:44,679
going in and they're even more

2447
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:46,599
imbalanced now that the plant's used

2448
01:40:44,679 --> 01:40:48,440
What It Wants plants are taking up and

2449
01:40:46,599 --> 01:40:49,800
leaving some behind plus you're you're

2450
01:40:48,439 --> 01:40:51,839
having this evaporative these

2451
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:53,679
evaporative forces leaving salts behind

2452
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:56,079
that are only exacerbating what now left

2453
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:59,639
in the root Zone um and that's 100

2454
01:40:56,079 --> 01:41:03,840
that's that's I try to show people what

2455
01:40:59,639 --> 01:41:05,840
a what a a vwc and a pwe graph look like

2456
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:09,360
in comparison with one another and how

2457
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:11,679
those how those two lines interact as as

2458
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:13,880
we both dry out our medium and

2459
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:16,199
reconstitute it with water and adding

2460
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:20,319
additional ions into it once it's been

2461
01:41:16,198 --> 01:41:22,479
dried back and um you know how how how a

2462
01:41:20,319 --> 01:41:24,079
plant behaves at Field capacity is

2463
01:41:22,479 --> 01:41:25,519
vastly different from how it behaves at

2464
01:41:24,079 --> 01:41:27,840
a dryback right because it's got to do

2465
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:29,280
two entirely different things but

2466
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:31,920
understanding how

2467
01:41:29,279 --> 01:41:36,158
those how those things are working

2468
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:38,960
inside the cocoa itself is is vastly

2469
01:41:36,158 --> 01:41:41,598
more beneficial than just saying okay

2470
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:43,719
water at 2 EC until 10% runoff because

2471
01:41:41,599 --> 01:41:45,400
now you know what's happening when we're

2472
01:41:43,719 --> 01:41:47,520
past that runoff part you haven't your

2473
01:41:45,399 --> 01:41:50,158
plants haven't had water in in 4 hours

2474
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:52,679
and have dried back now an additional 8%

2475
01:41:50,158 --> 01:41:54,598
and what what's happening to our pwe and

2476
01:41:52,679 --> 01:41:56,118
what the plant is doing with the ions

2477
01:41:54,599 --> 01:41:58,440
that were in there and now aren't like

2478
01:41:56,118 --> 01:42:02,279
there's there's so much going on but at

2479
01:41:58,439 --> 01:42:04,479
the same time it's all relatively um

2480
01:42:02,279 --> 01:42:07,198
intuitive when you have the foundation

2481
01:42:04,479 --> 01:42:09,198
to understand it right it's like uh you

2482
01:42:07,198 --> 01:42:11,519
don't need to necessarily explain how

2483
01:42:09,198 --> 01:42:13,799
much runoff you need if you can explain

2484
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:16,639
to someone what that poor water

2485
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:18,560
electrical conductivity is doing to the

2486
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:20,760
plants and how you can manipulate it

2487
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:22,440
with runoff then they can make that

2488
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:24,400
decision themselves even if they can't

2489
01:42:22,439 --> 01:42:26,839
read what's in the substrate they can

2490
01:42:24,399 --> 01:42:28,799
look at the plant and make some educated

2491
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:31,000
guesses as well as the stage of life

2492
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:33,279
that the plant is in and go okay so I

2493
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:35,840
want to make sure that the plant uh gets

2494
01:42:33,279 --> 01:42:37,920
a little bit of stress early on lower

2495
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:40,159
your runoff well I I want less stress

2496
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:42,920
when it bulks increase your runoff I

2497
01:42:40,158 --> 01:42:44,879
want uh more stress at the end decrease

2498
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:48,520
your runoff like there's simple things

2499
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:51,599
like that where it it it is hard to

2500
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:53,760
grasp the overall concept of crop

2501
01:42:51,599 --> 01:42:55,880
steering so but that's actually always

2502
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:57,760
my very first starting point is when I'm

2503
01:42:55,880 --> 01:43:00,639
when I'm doing consults or I'm educating

2504
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:03,800
people on my on on my irrigation

2505
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:05,118
sop I say let's let's not get stuck in

2506
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:07,560
the mud here we're not going to get all

2507
01:43:05,118 --> 01:43:11,399
to the the every single detail and

2508
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:13,360
understanding how how uh you know

2509
01:43:11,399 --> 01:43:15,439
positive ions interact we're not doing

2510
01:43:13,359 --> 01:43:17,559
all that let's just let's just do this

2511
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:19,638
you have a little dial and every time

2512
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:21,320
you turn the dial up more water comes

2513
01:43:19,639 --> 01:43:23,279
out of the bottom of the pot and with

2514
01:43:21,319 --> 01:43:25,399
that come out salts and every time time

2515
01:43:23,279 --> 01:43:27,319
you dial it down less come out which

2516
01:43:25,399 --> 01:43:28,839
make the salt in the pot increase and

2517
01:43:27,319 --> 01:43:30,439
the more they understand that that you

2518
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:31,360
can see them visualizing in their head

2519
01:43:30,439 --> 01:43:34,000
okay I need

2520
01:43:31,359 --> 01:43:35,439
to and you can see them turning the dial

2521
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,118
and now it's starting to make sense to

2522
01:43:35,439 --> 01:43:39,719
them so like you said you don't they

2523
01:43:37,118 --> 01:43:41,598
don't necessarily need to understand the

2524
01:43:39,719 --> 01:43:45,198
the complexity behind what we're trying

2525
01:43:41,599 --> 01:43:47,239
to express just understanding the the

2526
01:43:45,198 --> 01:43:48,279
mechanics of those of the motion that

2527
01:43:47,238 --> 01:43:50,559
occurs when we're when we're

2528
01:43:48,279 --> 01:43:53,158
implementing those things it's it's like

2529
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:56,480
uh providing the simplistic dichotomous

2530
01:43:53,158 --> 01:43:58,799
key where you have uh more stress or

2531
01:43:56,479 --> 01:44:01,279
less stress you can do that with more

2532
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:04,520
dry less dry you can do that with more

2533
01:44:01,279 --> 01:44:06,639
EC less EC you can do that with VAP

2534
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:08,679
pressure lesser vapor pressure exactly

2535
01:44:06,639 --> 01:44:10,800
so each one of those you can apply this

2536
01:44:08,679 --> 01:44:13,000
dichotomous key to so that they can say

2537
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:14,800
okay I just need to turn that dial in

2538
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:17,359
One Direction exactly I'm either

2539
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:20,639
increasing it or decreasing it um and

2540
01:44:17,359 --> 01:44:22,238
then the complexity of it is when you're

2541
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:24,199
then the DJ and you're turning all the

2542
01:44:22,238 --> 01:44:26,598
dials at once pulling this lever this

2543
01:44:24,198 --> 01:44:28,279
one's going but but you've already

2544
01:44:26,599 --> 01:44:30,920
you've already learned how to manipulate

2545
01:44:28,279 --> 01:44:33,639
this Le lever so it's it's not it's not

2546
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:35,719
taking brain power to figure okay while

2547
01:44:33,639 --> 01:44:37,400
I'm doing this this needs to be in the

2548
01:44:35,719 --> 01:44:40,359
down position because that makes sense

2549
01:44:37,399 --> 01:44:42,839
to me right right and it's it is then

2550
01:44:40,359 --> 01:44:44,439
correlating those different dials and

2551
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:46,159
how you turn it and how they affect the

2552
01:44:44,439 --> 01:44:48,439
other dials and then how you need to

2553
01:44:46,158 --> 01:44:51,039
adjust those that I feel like a lot of

2554
01:44:48,439 --> 01:44:52,638
people find the whole concept of crop

2555
01:44:51,039 --> 01:44:54,479
steering starts to become a little more

2556
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:57,039
confusing using and that's where I feel

2557
01:44:54,479 --> 01:44:59,678
like the the learning curve lessons you

2558
01:44:57,039 --> 01:45:00,760
know it it can increase a lot just by

2559
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:02,880
understanding that all these different

2560
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:05,520
things can be turned towards one or the

2561
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:08,239
other uh but then when you're saying

2562
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:10,320
well this applies to this this this this

2563
01:45:08,238 --> 01:45:12,439
applies to this this this that's where

2564
01:45:10,319 --> 01:45:14,039
it can then sort of start to get harder

2565
01:45:12,439 --> 01:45:15,678
but if you do try to provide that

2566
01:45:14,039 --> 01:45:17,679
holistic approach of saying but this is

2567
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:19,440
all like you're all just looking at it

2568
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:21,960
from the plant's point of view as a

2569
01:45:19,439 --> 01:45:25,319
water pump trying to move

2570
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:27,840
nutrients it's got to get out so you got

2571
01:45:25,319 --> 01:45:29,599
to if you if you try to start there and

2572
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:31,520
then be like okay like bring it try to

2573
01:45:29,599 --> 01:45:33,840
bring it back to that home base of this

2574
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:35,119
is what plants do how do you apply these

2575
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:37,199
different things if you get a little

2576
01:45:35,118 --> 01:45:39,158
loss just step back a little bit right

2577
01:45:37,198 --> 01:45:40,799
back to the last point and we could what

2578
01:45:39,158 --> 01:45:42,439
we'll call this a staggered learning

2579
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:44,199
approach like you'll never find me

2580
01:45:42,439 --> 01:45:45,678
you'll never find me directing somebody

2581
01:45:44,198 --> 01:45:47,598
in a like I said at the beginning in an

2582
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:49,158
A to B okay we plant the seed and now we

2583
01:45:47,599 --> 01:45:52,119
take it out of the paper towel and we go

2584
01:45:49,158 --> 01:45:53,799
here it's it's I I'll give you a million

2585
01:45:52,118 --> 01:45:55,880
different concepts but by the time

2586
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:57,679
you're ready to use that Concept in your

2587
01:45:55,880 --> 01:46:00,679
garden we'll have already talked about

2588
01:45:57,679 --> 01:46:02,560
it and and and you'll have a you'll

2589
01:46:00,679 --> 01:46:04,000
you'll put your hands into it with that

2590
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:07,159
in the back of your head and it won't

2591
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:09,158
feel so new to you anymore right exactly

2592
01:46:07,158 --> 01:46:13,198
it does it does take a lot of experience

2593
01:46:09,158 --> 01:46:16,399
to get that uh ease of motion in the

2594
01:46:13,198 --> 01:46:18,759
garden I would say absolutely but for a

2595
01:46:16,399 --> 01:46:20,198
lot of people it will come with time and

2596
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:21,840
and with uh you know listening to

2597
01:46:20,198 --> 01:46:25,319
conversations like this hopefully it

2598
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:28,079
helps more people see that you know you

2599
01:46:25,319 --> 01:46:29,519
just maybe there's a different thing

2600
01:46:28,079 --> 01:46:32,079
something that you're not thinking about

2601
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:33,800
that might come up that goes oh it

2602
01:46:32,079 --> 01:46:36,039
clicks now I know I know what they're

2603
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:37,800
talking about that makes so much sense

2604
01:46:36,039 --> 01:46:39,479
or you had yeah exactly you had just

2605
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:41,400
gotten to that point in your journey

2606
01:46:39,479 --> 01:46:43,359
where now it finally does make sense to

2607
01:46:41,399 --> 01:46:45,279
you despite having having heard it a

2608
01:46:43,359 --> 01:46:47,039
million times before yapping from my

2609
01:46:45,279 --> 01:46:49,000
mouth talking about it over and over and

2610
01:46:47,039 --> 01:46:50,880
over but now you're finally there you're

2611
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:52,399
at that point you've progressed past all

2612
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:53,920
the other things I was talking about and

2613
01:46:52,399 --> 01:46:55,960
you're like oh [ __ ] now I'm at this part

2614
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:57,599
where I got to start worrying about vwc

2615
01:46:55,960 --> 01:47:00,960
I remember he was telling me about that

2616
01:46:57,599 --> 01:47:03,119
and it's it's now less of a less of a of

2617
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:05,319
a of a of a new door that that they've

2618
01:47:03,118 --> 01:47:06,880
got to open and more of a a refresher

2619
01:47:05,319 --> 01:47:08,319
like okay so I remember him talking

2620
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:10,159
about this that's what he was talking

2621
01:47:08,319 --> 01:47:11,799
about that makes sense to me so and

2622
01:47:10,158 --> 01:47:13,679
that's how I like to approach it I it's

2623
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:15,400
really fun when you start to make all

2624
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:17,239
those connections because you can see

2625
01:47:15,399 --> 01:47:18,598
how they tie in with each other and it

2626
01:47:17,238 --> 01:47:21,638
becomes almost like if you're if you're

2627
01:47:18,599 --> 01:47:23,520
a Puzzler uh you know it becomes this

2628
01:47:21,639 --> 01:47:25,679
puzzle that you're putting the border

2629
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:26,960
piece yeah and and yeah you get the

2630
01:47:25,679 --> 01:47:28,440
Border in and you're like all right I

2631
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:31,319
got it from

2632
01:47:28,439 --> 01:47:33,598
here exactly what I that's exactly how I

2633
01:47:31,319 --> 01:47:35,158
feel about it like you sit there and you

2634
01:47:33,599 --> 01:47:36,719
I I'll spend three hours I'm trying to

2635
01:47:35,158 --> 01:47:38,158
find the corner but all of a sudden you

2636
01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:39,599
got that one border piece in and now

2637
01:47:38,158 --> 01:47:41,279
pieces are just starting to fill in one

2638
01:47:39,599 --> 01:47:43,360
by one by one by one and it's starting

2639
01:47:41,279 --> 01:47:45,920
to starting to feel natural again right

2640
01:47:43,359 --> 01:47:47,158
and and that's I pushed people out of

2641
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:48,760
their where they were comfortable

2642
01:47:47,158 --> 01:47:50,519
growing oh I'm good i' I've gotten

2643
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:52,639
Harvest and I pushed them out of that

2644
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:54,159
comfort zone until it's comfortable

2645
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:55,480
again and now this is where your comfort

2646
01:47:54,158 --> 01:47:57,960
zone is right so we're just going to

2647
01:47:55,479 --> 01:47:59,479
keep moving that that that goal post for

2648
01:47:57,960 --> 01:48:02,719
you

2649
01:47:59,479 --> 01:48:06,238
absolutely um well so uh what what would

2650
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:07,960
then be like one of like what would be

2651
01:48:06,238 --> 01:48:10,559
the first piece of advice you would give

2652
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:10,560
to any new

2653
01:48:11,079 --> 01:48:18,158
grower so I I like I like to think that

2654
01:48:16,279 --> 01:48:20,639
that

2655
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:23,319
understanding

2656
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:26,440
understanding that concept that

2657
01:48:23,319 --> 01:48:29,039
your your whole goal is to fill the

2658
01:48:26,439 --> 01:48:31,598
media with root Zone uh with roots as

2659
01:48:29,039 --> 01:48:35,439
opposed to just allowing it to be empty

2660
01:48:31,599 --> 01:48:37,880
media um will will get you a really long

2661
01:48:35,439 --> 01:48:39,839
way as a new grower but my biggest piece

2662
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:41,639
of advice like if whether you've been

2663
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:43,599
growing for three years and you know

2664
01:48:41,639 --> 01:48:44,880
you're just sort of Meandering your way

2665
01:48:43,599 --> 01:48:46,279
through and haven't seen very much

2666
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:49,239
progression or this is your first ever

2667
01:48:46,279 --> 01:48:51,719
grow quite honestly go crack open a

2668
01:48:49,238 --> 01:48:54,118
grade 11 Biology book a grade 11

2669
01:48:51,719 --> 01:48:56,039
chemistry book and just skim through

2670
01:48:54,118 --> 01:48:57,598
some of the major Concepts familiar

2671
01:48:56,039 --> 01:48:59,560
familiarize yourself with things that

2672
01:48:57,599 --> 01:49:01,279
you thought were like that you already

2673
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:04,080
knew for example everybody knows what

2674
01:49:01,279 --> 01:49:06,279
photosynthesis is right but do you

2675
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:07,880
really know what photosynthesis is go

2676
01:49:06,279 --> 01:49:09,439
familiarize yourself with things that

2677
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:11,118
you thought you already knew and don't

2678
01:49:09,439 --> 01:49:12,960
need to know and you'll be surprised how

2679
01:49:11,118 --> 01:49:15,319
much information you're able to pull out

2680
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:17,239
of these these simple Concepts like I

2681
01:49:15,319 --> 01:49:18,359
said when you when you dive deep into

2682
01:49:17,238 --> 01:49:19,759
understanding that yeah plants eat

2683
01:49:18,359 --> 01:49:21,238
sunlight but when you understand how

2684
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:22,920
they do it and what's happening inside

2685
01:49:21,238 --> 01:49:24,839
where that energy goes and what you need

2686
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:27,239
to do to maintain that cycle then all of

2687
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:29,880
a sudden you're like you have a better

2688
01:49:27,238 --> 01:49:31,718
understanding of why you need to it

2689
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:33,319
eliminates so many different wise for

2690
01:49:31,719 --> 01:49:34,039
you so now I understand why I need a

2691
01:49:33,319 --> 01:49:36,799
high

2692
01:49:34,039 --> 01:49:38,158
ppfd proper Spectrum grow light now I

2693
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:40,880
understand how water moves in the plant

2694
01:49:38,158 --> 01:49:43,238
and it's by by doing understanding these

2695
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:44,760
Core Concepts that we didn't think we

2696
01:49:43,238 --> 01:49:47,399
really needed to know because we're not

2697
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:49,159
in grade 11 high school anymore um you

2698
01:49:47,399 --> 01:49:50,598
find that it eliminates a lot of the

2699
01:49:49,158 --> 01:49:52,279
questions that are going to come up for

2700
01:49:50,599 --> 01:49:53,920
you as you're progressing through this

2701
01:49:52,279 --> 01:49:56,639
journey

2702
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:59,039
absolutely that I don't think I could

2703
01:49:56,639 --> 01:50:01,359
have said it better myself at building

2704
01:49:59,039 --> 01:50:04,000
these foundations and then building upon

2705
01:50:01,359 --> 01:50:06,000
those foundations and you know always

2706
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:08,158
trying to bring yourself back to the

2707
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:09,679
basics if you can if you start to feel

2708
01:50:08,158 --> 01:50:11,799
yourself getting lost it it helps

2709
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:13,800
tremendously if you don't understand

2710
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:16,800
something take it one step back where

2711
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:18,719
did we get lost right this where where

2712
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:20,320
was the last place I was comfortable and

2713
01:50:18,719 --> 01:50:22,480
let's go from there and we keep working

2714
01:50:20,319 --> 01:50:24,639
back problems are Treasures right like I

2715
01:50:22,479 --> 01:50:27,678
said said earlier we we have the ability

2716
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:30,039
to be wrong which gives us the ability

2717
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:32,118
to be right about being wrong right we

2718
01:50:30,039 --> 01:50:33,639
get to correct and no longer be wrong

2719
01:50:32,118 --> 01:50:35,039
about that thing so if you're one of

2720
01:50:33,639 --> 01:50:36,760
those people that just hates to be wrong

2721
01:50:35,039 --> 01:50:39,560
and has to be right all the time being

2722
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:41,119
wrong is good for you right mistakes are

2723
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:42,119
only mistakes if you don't learn from

2724
01:50:41,118 --> 01:50:44,799
them

2725
01:50:42,118 --> 01:50:47,679
precisely yep well you know this has

2726
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:49,840
been a wonderful talk and uh I just have

2727
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:51,599
a few little wrapup questions for you

2728
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:54,440
that I like to ask everyone that comes

2729
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:56,159
on the podcast sure um so what's your

2730
01:50:54,439 --> 01:51:00,598
favorite strain of all

2731
01:50:56,158 --> 01:51:04,679
time so I had a a Ken est's original

2732
01:51:00,599 --> 01:51:05,960
Granddaddy Purple um that I don't know

2733
01:51:04,679 --> 01:51:07,440
if you remember like going to the

2734
01:51:05,960 --> 01:51:09,078
grocery store the toy store as a kid and

2735
01:51:07,439 --> 01:51:10,238
they had those bowls that smelled like

2736
01:51:09,078 --> 01:51:11,880
like they were bouncy balls and they

2737
01:51:10,238 --> 01:51:13,839
smelled like lemon cherry fruit

2738
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:16,199
watermelon all those they had like a

2739
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:18,319
really plasticky flavored smell this

2740
01:51:16,198 --> 01:51:20,198
smelt exactly like that grape ball when

2741
01:51:18,319 --> 01:51:22,719
you open the jar you'd smell that like

2742
01:51:20,198 --> 01:51:25,198
toy grape smell and I can't get it out

2743
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:27,359
of my head so that sticks out as like my

2744
01:51:25,198 --> 01:51:29,598
favorite pheno type of all time my

2745
01:51:27,359 --> 01:51:32,359
favorite just general cultivar in

2746
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:34,239
general is Lamb's breath um it's an

2747
01:51:32,359 --> 01:51:36,158
older sativa that comes right out of

2748
01:51:34,238 --> 01:51:37,718
Jamaica I believe Bob Marley had

2749
01:51:36,158 --> 01:51:42,960
something to do with it but it's got

2750
01:51:37,719 --> 01:51:45,679
this this very very gassy um hydrocarbon

2751
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:48,118
diesel flavor to it it's yeah very hard

2752
01:51:45,679 --> 01:51:51,199
to find nowadays I chase it everywhere

2753
01:51:48,118 --> 01:51:52,920
but I lost no luck yet oh man that

2754
01:51:51,198 --> 01:51:55,638
brings back memories I'm from the Bay

2755
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:58,399
Area and uh there's this dispensary

2756
01:51:55,639 --> 01:52:01,039
that's been there forever harbor side

2757
01:51:58,399 --> 01:52:04,399
and they used to get kst test Granddaddy

2758
01:52:01,039 --> 01:52:07,519
Purple grown by him back in like man

2759
01:52:04,399 --> 01:52:09,719
0809 or something like that and it was

2760
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:12,599
memorable to see it was it was the top

2761
01:52:09,719 --> 01:52:14,599
shelf at the time for sure it was and

2762
01:52:12,599 --> 01:52:16,960
Lamb's bre too or Lamb's breath you know

2763
01:52:14,599 --> 01:52:18,719
whichever one uh people are used to that

2764
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:21,760
one you know I've heard stories of where

2765
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:24,599
it was just that's what uh anything

2766
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:26,679
grown in an a area was was called if it

2767
01:52:24,599 --> 01:52:28,199
came out of Jamaica but a lot of it

2768
01:52:26,679 --> 01:52:33,118
seemed very similar to me when I would

2769
01:52:28,198 --> 01:52:36,279
try yeah so it it all has this very

2770
01:52:33,118 --> 01:52:39,519
um I I can't really pin the smell but

2771
01:52:36,279 --> 01:52:42,359
it's like it's it's it's like jet fuel

2772
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:44,920
like a skunk fell into a jet fuel tank

2773
01:52:42,359 --> 01:52:46,719
and it's it's it's very very you like

2774
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:48,960
you open it and you're like yeah that's

2775
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:52,078
that's the guy for sure and it must be

2776
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:54,118
the ter the terroir um on those Jamaican

2777
01:52:52,078 --> 01:52:57,078
Hills Ides if if if that's what what's

2778
01:52:54,118 --> 01:52:59,118
coming out but you know again with with

2779
01:52:57,078 --> 01:53:02,039
tissue culture one of one of the main

2780
01:52:59,118 --> 01:53:04,078
benefits is some of that um some of that

2781
01:53:02,039 --> 01:53:06,078
the Gen genetic refreshing that that can

2782
01:53:04,078 --> 01:53:07,759
be done and if if anybody's got any of

2783
01:53:06,078 --> 01:53:09,599
those land races laying around I'm happy

2784
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:12,679
to take a sample and bring it back to to

2785
01:53:09,599 --> 01:53:15,480
its vigorous life nice nice that's

2786
01:53:12,679 --> 01:53:18,679
awesome um well so uh of course to

2787
01:53:15,479 --> 01:53:20,879
follow up favorite strain uh as a grower

2788
01:53:18,679 --> 01:53:24,440
um if you had to reach for a pack of

2789
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:24,440
seeds what breeder are you reaching for

2790
01:53:26,319 --> 01:53:30,679
so obviously I've got a couple of

2791
01:53:28,439 --> 01:53:34,279
favorites that I that I've run with for

2792
01:53:30,679 --> 01:53:35,599
a while um green lab genetics were he's

2793
01:53:34,279 --> 01:53:37,759
a good friend of mine but he's an

2794
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:39,400
exceptional breeder with a great eye

2795
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:41,960
that being said you know Relentless

2796
01:53:39,399 --> 01:53:44,158
genetics just puts in we're not even

2797
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:45,800
particularly friends um we we used to

2798
01:53:44,158 --> 01:53:49,198
have a pretty close working

2799
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:51,279
relationship um whatever happened

2800
01:53:49,198 --> 01:53:54,359
happened I guess but that takes away

2801
01:53:51,279 --> 01:53:58,198
nothing from from from his skill his

2802
01:53:54,359 --> 01:54:00,960
attention to detail and his his um

2803
01:53:58,198 --> 01:54:03,598
diligence as a breeder not everybody is

2804
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:06,960
willing to put in the work necessary to

2805
01:54:03,599 --> 01:54:08,840
to get such uniformity and consistency

2806
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:11,639
out of the the top level work that they

2807
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:13,199
do um but Relentless genetics is

2808
01:54:11,639 --> 01:54:16,078
definitely near the top of the chain

2809
01:54:13,198 --> 01:54:19,238
when it comes when it comes to that um

2810
01:54:16,078 --> 01:54:21,759
for sure he he I hope he continues to do

2811
01:54:19,238 --> 01:54:25,198
the amazing work he's done I mean for

2812
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:28,480
purples and uh consistency in purples

2813
01:54:25,198 --> 01:54:32,238
and uh just like really photogenic weed

2814
01:54:28,479 --> 01:54:34,399
that's uh usually like fros and very po

2815
01:54:32,238 --> 01:54:37,919
uh pungent uh you know I've never really

2816
01:54:34,399 --> 01:54:39,439
had a Relentless genetics uh cut or seed

2817
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:43,118
or anything that I've grown out where it

2818
01:54:39,439 --> 01:54:45,198
didn't rek of something delicious so

2819
01:54:43,118 --> 01:54:47,598
yeah his consistency is pretty great

2820
01:54:45,198 --> 01:54:51,279
with that guy I'm looking forward to

2821
01:54:47,599 --> 01:54:55,760
seeing um what Chris Lynch puts out um

2822
01:54:51,279 --> 01:54:58,920
with compound not with um what's his new

2823
01:54:55,760 --> 01:55:01,440
what's his new uh Cipher sorry Cipher

2824
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:03,158
Cipher genetics that that blue lobster

2825
01:55:01,439 --> 01:55:05,678
like everything he touches personally

2826
01:55:03,158 --> 01:55:08,039
looks good I can't I can't especially

2827
01:55:05,679 --> 01:55:11,359
speak for what makes it to Market some

2828
01:55:08,039 --> 01:55:14,000
of the some of the the the people he's

2829
01:55:11,359 --> 01:55:14,759
surrounded himself with have uh have

2830
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:17,760
some

2831
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:19,679
predatory uh tendenc tendencies in in

2832
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:22,639
this in this industry with this Market

2833
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:25,840
but yeah the stuff that he person Al

2834
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:27,679
builds and grows and finds um you know I

2835
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:30,599
put him up there as some of the some of

2836
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:33,719
the the best breeders on Earth for sure

2837
01:55:30,599 --> 01:55:36,800
definitely yeah I'd agree with that um

2838
01:55:33,719 --> 01:55:39,639
all right just one more so uh you've

2839
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:43,599
been probably consuming cannabis I

2840
01:55:39,639 --> 01:55:45,639
assume before you were uh growing it so

2841
01:55:43,599 --> 01:55:48,159
let's talk about your most memorable

2842
01:55:45,639 --> 01:55:50,440
cannabis related experience first time I

2843
01:55:48,158 --> 01:55:52,879
ever smoked for sure all right tell me

2844
01:55:50,439 --> 01:55:54,198
about it um

2845
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:56,440
I

2846
01:55:54,198 --> 01:55:57,839
was actually you know what let's skip

2847
01:55:56,439 --> 01:55:59,279
that story it's not as interesting

2848
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:01,719
because I just realized this the one

2849
01:55:59,279 --> 01:56:05,920
where I didn't even smoke yet uh was

2850
01:56:01,719 --> 01:56:08,399
interesting so all right my stepdad used

2851
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:10,118
to smoke cigarettes occasionally um and

2852
01:56:08,399 --> 01:56:11,439
we'd go fishing every Monday night and

2853
01:56:10,118 --> 01:56:12,880
we'd stay till 2: in the morning and I'd

2854
01:56:11,439 --> 01:56:15,118
do my thing little kid running around

2855
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:17,920
fishing he'd sit there hacking his dirts

2856
01:56:15,118 --> 01:56:21,238
or whatever fishing like like like you

2857
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:23,440
know dads do and this would go on for my

2858
01:56:21,238 --> 01:56:24,678
entire childhood as I got older I you

2859
01:56:23,439 --> 01:56:27,719
know I started hanging out with friends

2860
01:56:24,679 --> 01:56:29,599
and one day I'm by myself with my friend

2861
01:56:27,719 --> 01:56:32,560
Mike Ellie and we're driving around in a

2862
01:56:29,599 --> 01:56:34,520
car and his car and we pull up to

2863
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:37,199
another person's car in a parking lot

2864
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:40,040
and he passes him a what I thought was a

2865
01:56:37,198 --> 01:56:42,678
cigarette and I'm not even 14 yet like I

2866
01:56:40,039 --> 01:56:44,439
turned 14 that winter or whatever and

2867
01:56:42,679 --> 01:56:46,960
it's summer and I'm still a 13-year-old

2868
01:56:44,439 --> 01:56:48,960
kid and he passes him the cigarette

2869
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:51,319
through the window and he smokes it and

2870
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:52,840
I remember catching a whiff of it and

2871
01:56:51,319 --> 01:56:54,639
all of a sudden like in the movies you

2872
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:56,560
saw everything just play Backwards every

2873
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:59,639
time I saw my D my stepdad put that

2874
01:56:56,560 --> 01:57:03,400
joint in his mouth the the the old

2875
01:56:59,639 --> 01:57:05,880
factory flood that I got smelling like

2876
01:57:03,399 --> 01:57:08,078
[ __ ] that wasn't cigarettes cuz

2877
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:09,679
he I had just seen finally that he had

2878
01:57:08,078 --> 01:57:11,840
been smoking weed in front of me this

2879
01:57:09,679 --> 01:57:13,960
whole time and immediately it it all

2880
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:16,719
clicked and I just it was just such an

2881
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:19,960
epiphany for me that that

2882
01:57:16,719 --> 01:57:21,319
um I I I think that that that kid was

2883
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:24,000
the first person I had ever ended up

2884
01:57:21,319 --> 01:57:25,799
smoking with um next in the same car but

2885
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:28,399
just the just the shock the

2886
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:30,440
instantaneous sort of visceral knowledge

2887
01:57:28,399 --> 01:57:32,519
that that comes flooding back when you

2888
01:57:30,439 --> 01:57:35,799
got that first smell was something I'll

2889
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:37,280
never forget for sure did did so you uh

2890
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:39,360
did you like ask your friend what is

2891
01:57:37,279 --> 01:57:41,078
that and he's like oh it's weed man and

2892
01:57:39,359 --> 01:57:42,118
instantly that changed everything cuz

2893
01:57:41,078 --> 01:57:44,439
you're like I

2894
01:57:42,118 --> 01:57:48,118
SM silently in the back seat just

2895
01:57:44,439 --> 01:57:49,839
dumbfounded like what I had no idea I

2896
01:57:48,118 --> 01:57:52,880
thought my stepdad was like a straight

2897
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:54,440
edged guy you know just um it turns out

2898
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:57,480
that he was just as cool as the rest of

2899
01:57:54,439 --> 01:57:59,039
us so um it definitely changed my and I

2900
01:57:57,479 --> 01:58:01,638
think I was a little nervous to approach

2901
01:57:59,039 --> 01:58:04,078
my stepdad for a while about it but so

2902
01:58:01,639 --> 01:58:06,800
it like for a while it was just a I know

2903
01:58:04,078 --> 01:58:09,359
you know kind of deal but eventually

2904
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:11,279
obviously you know we we ended up um you

2905
01:58:09,359 --> 01:58:13,880
know sharing a Dube or two together and

2906
01:58:11,279 --> 01:58:16,960
it was it was a quite a Coming of Age

2907
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:18,560
experience for sure for sure no that's a

2908
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:21,198
I mean I feel like there's a cinematic

2909
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:23,039
nature to that with the realization and

2910
