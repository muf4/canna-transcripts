known him for many years on social media

21
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:15,478
and he has a very interesting story that

22
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,640
I think you guys would be very

23
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:20,959
interested in he was the person that

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,799
invented sea of green as well as other

25
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:26,319
cultivation techniques he's got a wealth

26
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,560
of knowledge about cultivation about

27
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:31,359
lighting but he's also got a super

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,680
interesting story so let's all give him

29
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:37,599

32
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:49,640
it's fun to um be able to share some of

33
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:51,239
some of the history nice well I think we

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,680
should start by you telling us a little

35
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:56,199
bit about your history tell us about

36
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,880
your first experiences with cannabis

37
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:04,840
okay well I am a second generation

38
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:07,958
cannabis consumer I have been consuming

39
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,840
cannabis since I was born in

40
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:12,319
1956 but I've been consuming cannabis

41
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,640
since

42
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:18,318
1955 my parents were Greenwich Village

43
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:21,000
beatniks uh in a time when Greenwich

44
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:25,079
Village in New York was really a Lot

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,159
Like a Village so the artistic Community

46
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,599
was very very tight whether they were

47
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:35,400
musicians painters writers

48
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:38,479
my father crazy AB seagull was the was

49
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,840
his day job was as a second violinist

50
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:43,598
for the Carnegie Hall Symphony Orchestra

51
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,479
but what he loved to do and what his

52
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:49,639
preferred thing was he was also a studio

53
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:51,759
musician a session musician and when

54
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:54,719
someone came to town that needed a

55
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,799
violinist or a fiddle player to go with

56
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:00,639
the different styles they they'd send

57
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,159
for crazy AB seagull well

58
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:07,279
that Circle included among others Jack

59
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:09,878
kowak Mary Travers Sally gross which

60
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,360
gives me like one of my first sort of I

61
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:14,560
don't know it's kind of I like it I

62
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,560
actually can honestly say that I

63
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,878
consumed cannabis with Jack kowak before

64
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,959
I was

65
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:25,280
alive before I was born anyways so you

66
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,000
know not many people can claim that the

67
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,280
first time I voluntarily consumed

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,039
cannabis was in 19 68 and I can remember

69
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,598
the date really well it was August 6th

70
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:40,120
which appears some other times later on

71
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:41,878
in my life but my mother and stepfather

72
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,438
called me back into their bedroom we

73
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:46,959
lived on Bitter Lake in Seattle and said

74
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:49,959
we know that sooner or later you're

75
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,479
going to want to try this there's going

76
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,680
to be other things you're going to want

77
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:56,438
to try we can't tell you not to do it

78
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,760
you but what we'd like is if you're

79
00:03:56,438 --> 00:04:02,158
going to try something come to us tell

80
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,679

81
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:07,519
you something that isn't messed with and

82
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,159
then took my first HX like a lot of

83
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,879
people on their first experience I

84
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:13,959
didn't even know I was getting high I

85
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:16,238
mean it's like well okay hold your

86
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:19,160
breath and count you'll know how high

87
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:21,599
you are by how hard it is it it it'll

88
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,840
change your sense of time listen to the

89
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,199
music see how it sounds a little

90
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,359
different but you can't really put your

91
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,400
finger on it so that was my

92
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,400
first volum

93
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,918
voluntary conscious consumption of

94
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:39,079
cannabis um things picked up a little

95
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:43,680
speed from there in

96
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:46,120
1969 I was 13 I bought my first lids and

97
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,918
these were real honest to goodness Lids

98
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:52,280
not four finger Lids not a weight amount

99
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:54,839
but the amount that your dealer grabbed

100
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:57,559
out of the kilo cuz it was in kilos

101
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:59,758
usually then uh grab the amount that

102
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:04,439
your dealer grabbed out of the kilo and

103
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:07,759
put on the top the lid of a one lb

104
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:09,439
tobacco tin usually bugler or top where

105
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,199
the were the brands but they were about

106
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:16,199
the cans were about y big around so you

107
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:18,680
got a top about a lid about that big

108
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,478
around and just you know if if you were

109
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,400
good friends you I would say it was more

110
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:26,399
like a five or six finger lid than a

111
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,918
four-finger lid if you were to put it in

112
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,318
the bag and the bags were the fold type

113
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:34,399
flap sandwich bags so thank God we

114
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:37,800
didn't have Co happening then cuz there

115
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:42,839
was an awful lot of plastic that got

116
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,639
lit was closed um so I've sold my I

117
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:46,079
bought my first lids and sold my first

118
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,319
Lids in

119
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:53,680
1969 uh up on the AV in UN in in Seattle

120
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:56,039
University Avenue was sort of the

121
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,038
Seattle's version of the hate ashberry a

122
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:03,959
few years later than than the hashberry

123
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:06,318
but um 68 69 into the beginning of 70

124
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:08,839
and then like the hashberry too much

125
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:13,039
speed too much hero and the scene sort

126
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:14,879
of fell apart but um so my first

127
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:17,199
experiences of selling pot were of

128
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,719
course lids and there was a place over

129
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,680
on campus a block over from the

130
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,800
University Avenue one one block yeah a

131
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,079
block over uh where the the fronts right

132
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,360
the guys that would front you the lids

133
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:32,279
to go and sell to the people walking by

134
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,720
it was a very Street Scene I think I

135
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:39,318
think hashberry hate hashberry invented

136
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,960
Street dealing cuz you from what I hear

137
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:43,800
it was a lot like what it was like on

138
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,959
the AV in 69 you'd walk down and 20

139
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,520
different people would ask hey you want

140
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:50,198
to buy a lid acid mesculin and

141
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:54,279
eventually speed heroin but

142
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:57,879
um it was it's like I I think that

143
00:06:54,279 --> 00:07:00,399
social phenomena take um it's like lot

144
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:03,400
like when you drop a rock in into a pond

145
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:05,038
you got these ripples so the rock that's

146
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:09,598
hippie

147
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:11,038
1967 San Francisco hay ashburry is

148
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:16,519

154
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:36,560
um I I'll skip a lot of the in-betweens

155
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:40,318
home left me a lot of times um so I was

156
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:45,000
out on my own at 14 and my choices were

157
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:48,520
pretty much at 14 steal deal or sell

158
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,120
your ass I'm not a thief I wasn't into

159
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:53,680
selling my ass so that left me with

160
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:57,959
dealing which I'd already done some of

161
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,918
so I start hanging out up on Western

162

00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:09,959
pretty quickly can see who the fronts

166
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:15,000
are and now I'm

167
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:18,439
dealing and I had happened to have the

168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,120
very first deals that I did I got hooked

169
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:23,680
up with by this guy that I had met

170
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:29,158
selling the Helix the underground paper

171
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:32,839
in Seattle um this guy Frank uh uh he

172
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:36,120
was of Mexican descent and um when I

173
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:39,680
started dealing I reached back to him

174
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,240
cuz he was hooked up with La Familia

175
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,799
which there's a lot of different stories

176
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,039
about what it was like back in the 60s

177
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,319
and 70s and who was doing what my

178
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:53,599
understanding in

179
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,600
1969 was that cannabis although then it

180
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:00,240
was pot and most of the time I call it

181
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:03,120
pot um was that pot as an industry was

182
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,000
pretty much controlled by a few groups

183
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,519
one of which was a group that uses a

184
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,919
name that now I hear is a prison gang or

185
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:13,839
is used by a prison gang La Familia in

186
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:17,319
the west generally just referred to as

187
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:20,720
La Familia and my friend Frank's uncle

188
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:24,160
in Portland was the Northern end of a of

189
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,160
a pipeline so twice a week I would have

190
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:31,000
college kids drive me from

191
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:35,480
Bellingham down to Portland to pick up a

192
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:41,120
10 key batch and it at by

193
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:43,399
by by early 71 I was one of the biggest

194
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,399
pot dealers in Bellingham which is a

195
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:50,839
pretty good siiz college town but in the

196
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:53,519
summer of 71 or excuse me Summer of

197
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:56,480
70 I did what a lot of us were into

198
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,879
doing in those days which was what I

199
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:03,240
laughingly call a pharmaceutical vision

200
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:07,600
Quest um in my case

201
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,600
the the um

202
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:36,159
really really really well-written

203
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:39,200
description of the Quantum Leap the the

204
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:42,278
how how electrons move further out and

205
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,839
further out and then in Falling release

206
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:45,838
the energy that they have and that

207
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,760
that's where light comes from now I'm

208
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,200
I'm not being artistic in my description

209
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,919
of it

210
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:57,600
but something about his description

211
00:10:52,919 --> 00:11:00,679
stuck in my head and one of the things I

212
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,959
experienced on my pharmaceutical Vision

213
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:07,039
Quest was that Quantum Leap where I was

214
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:09,000
experiencing what I had read or believed

215
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,240
so because I think our minds make a lot

216
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,278
of what we

217
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,959
perceive and so I I go out to the point

218
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:19,879
which is a place in Bellingham it's on

219
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:23,518
the south end of chucking up of chucking

220
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:25,480
up Bay and um place a lot of people like

221
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,278
used to like to go out and melt into the

222
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,759
rocks and the waves real good

223
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:33,399
combination nice nice sensation

224
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:37,559
but while I'm out there I I noticed this

225
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:40,278
giant white wooden frame triangle and I

226
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:43,518
Ste through this triangle and now I'm

227
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:46,679
not where I was and I am in the presence

228
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:49,679
of God this sounds so hippie I'm in the

229
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:54,120
presence of the Goddess ganja who tells

230
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:57,919
me about what my life is going to be now

231
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,839
most of what I remember now I didn't

232
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:02,599
remember immediately

233
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,920
right then some of it I did but one

234
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:09,320
piece of what I was

235
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:13,759
shown was Cannabis growing under what I

236
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:16,680
called indoor Suns now many years later

237
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:18,958
what I'm talking about is 1981 in 1986 I

238
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:21,000
went back and asked the people where I

239
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:23,679
had been living at the time did I really

240
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,839
come back and talk about growing Under

241
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,120
the Sun

242
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:30,360
indoors and they said

243
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:34,519
yes so there's some validity you know

244
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:38,639
objective okay at least this part of it

245
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:41,399
I I believe I experienced and told these

246
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,480
people about the thing I believed I had

247
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:46,440
experienced I've gotten a lot more

248
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,440
skeptical now now I I always I'm trying

249
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:52,079
to be more scientific about stuff so I

250
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:55,399
always put in seems to and might have

251
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:57,958
been because just a more effective way

252
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,799
to communicate more honestly and I'm

253
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:02,000
working on

254
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:03,799
by the time I leave this plane I don't

255
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,320
want to have to come back because I will

256
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:08,120
have had my karma my karma will be

257
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,600
balanced so

258
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:14,519
in the course of this experience

259
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:18,159
this this pharmaceutical Vision Quest I

260
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:20,600
realized I want to grow pot I want to

261
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,399
grow cannabis and I'm a pretty good siiz

262
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:26,440
dealer at that point so I started saving

263
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,440
seeds this was August of

264
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:32,599
1970 excuse me

265
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:37,879
and I start saving seeds well by the

266
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:41,480
time late May of 71 rolls around I've

267
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:44,600
got call it a pound pound and a half so

268
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:47,839
25 30,000

269
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,199
seeds and I go out to play Michael

270
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,680
marijuana

271
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:54,758
seed I'd read on the road I knew a bunch

272
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:58,758
of people had done the hitchhiking thing

273
00:13:54,759 --> 00:14:01,919
it seemed like a standard well it's it's

274
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:04,639
on my um we hadn't we didn't have the

275
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:10,198
phrase bucket list yet but it was on my

276
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:12,519
bucket list to uh go grow pot and so I

277
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:14,439
got a ride down to Portland it was

278
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:17,078
illegal to aik in Washington and they

279
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,800
would bust and take you away and I knew

280
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:22,278
that with that many seeds that was

281
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:24,719
probably not going to be a good thing so

282
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:27,039
I get down to Portland and I started

283
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,759
hitching uh I

284
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:32,838
hitchhiked up down down and across

285
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:36,639
highways for those of you that know the

286
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:39,360
west coast of um United States the area

287
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,198
that I'm about to describe includes

288
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,879
What's called the Emerald Triangle I

289
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:47,399
call it the emerald rectangle because I

290
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:53,198
was going up and down one Highway 1

291
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:58,639
Highway 101 Interstate 5 and across the

292
00:14:53,198 --> 00:15:00,879
roads that go um from alur California

293
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,600
over to reading which is

294
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:06,838
196 and the road that goes from Crescent

295
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,278
City California up to Grant's Pass which

296
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:13,040
is 296 and then I I can't remember the

297
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:15,240
number of the road but from cous Bay you

298
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:18,919
kind of have to zigzag way the heck

299
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:21,320
North to get back over to I5 but pretty

300
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:24,519
much every place inside that area if you

301
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:28,319
drew a line from biger to the

302
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:30,759
mountains and another line from cous Bay

303
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:33,879
to the mountains

304
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:37,759
pretty much every place in that

305
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:39,720
rectangle I planted I planted every time

306
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,879
my gut said I I hitchhiked and every

307
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,480
time my gut said here I'd have them let

308
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,000
me out I'd walk up from the road almost

309
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,159
invariably this was someplace where

310
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,639
there was water running under the road

311
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:54,039
or there was ponds and I'd walk till I

312
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:56,879
couldn't hear the road and I'd planned

313
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:59,838
as many as felt right then I walked back

314
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,519
down to the road and hang my thumb out

315
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,399
if things were too slow going in the

316
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,360
direction I'd been going in I'd go back

317
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:08,318
the other way cuz I was just out to play

318
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,480
Michael marijuana seed

319
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:14,559
um well and I succeeded to the point

320
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,519
that it's probably I'm not going to say

321
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:19,318
definitely but it's probably an accurate

322
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:22,519
statement that there's no place in

323
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:24,759
Northern California or Southern Oregon

324
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:27,399
that I wasn't one of the first hundred

325
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:28,959
people to plant I figure you know I'm

326
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:31,198
not going to claim to be one of the

327
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:34,119
first but the first 100 I think is

328
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:37,439
probably pretty safe and it was you know

329
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:39,600
partially it was based on what the names

330
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,839
like there's a line in Donovan song The

331
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,360
Season of the Witch that says you've got

332
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:48,440
to pick up every Stitch and my mom and

333
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,318
stepdad had basically new stepdad from

334
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,079
the one I first smoked pot with but my

335
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:56,879
mom and new stepdad had um

336
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,958
basically taught me that picking up

337
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,639
every Stitch was like interpreting

338
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,239
everything you saw as many different

339
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,439
ways as you could to try and get as much

340
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,120
of an understanding and grock for you

341
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,360
Stranger in a Strange Land Robert

342
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,119
Highland readers and grock what was

343
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,318
going

344
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:15,239
on hey can I ask you a quick question

345
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:16,879
wolf say I'm sorry say again I have a

346
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,480
quick question for you you said that you

347
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,559
were like planting seeds on the road but

348
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,279
did you ever go back and and check out

349
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:25,678
the plants and see you know what

350
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,798
happened with them I I hear that some of

351
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,360
them did well but there's kind of a sad

352
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:32,639
thing that happened while was up in

353
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:36,359
Portland I heard that there was sugar

354
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,679
cube acid really good sugar cube acid up

355
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:40,240
in

356
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:43,759
Bellingham so you know I was already in

357
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,558
Portland I hitchhiked up uh I as as was

358
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:51,279
pretty much standard with me I dealt

359
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:54,000
Lids a lot to make money and um I got

360
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:57,558
busted in Bellingham

361
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,440
dealing on again this August 6th date is

362
00:17:57,558 --> 00:18:03,279
like a recurring date for

363
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:07,840
me I got busted on August 6th

364
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:11,079
1971 at the corner of Harris

365
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:14,319
and Fair Haven I think was the

366
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:17,079
combination but so I never got to go

367
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:19,439
back I heard that they had been busted

368
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:21,960
like in the intervening time that some

369
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,600
people at my biggest patch which was a

370
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,360
quarter of an acre just outside of

371
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:29,038
Wonder Oregon uh I heard they had been

372
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,279
busted and I had at that point been

373
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,519
selling trim you know just Leaf cuz

374
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:36,038
homegrown it was worth a 100 bucks a

375
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:41,720
pound during

376
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:44,759
drought so I I sold that and um got up I

377
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,319
think it was like 7500 bucks and and

378
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:50,200
sent that down to get the guy the people

379
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:52,119
who had been working the crop um I sent

380
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,960
the money down to bail those guys out

381
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:56,119
and that's why I was dealing Lids up up

382
00:18:53,960 --> 00:19:00,200
in Bellingham instead of having a little

383
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:05,000
of the money so uh fortunately we

384
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:08,679
managed to locate my mom and stepdad uh

385
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,599
he was on work release up in Alaska uh

386
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:14,000
for dealing oh that's part that's part

387
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:16,359
of the thing that I had left out my my

388
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,279
mom and stepdad were also that's that's

389
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:22,399
how they made their money too um they

390
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:26,038
got busted while I was out on the road

391
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,840
but he was out on work release and they

392
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:31,079
hitch down the Alcan

393
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:33,119
to show up in court when I appeared

394
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:36,038
before the judge and I got released to

395
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:39,119
my mom which was kind of cool

396
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:40,679
because go ahead say again oh I'm

397
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,798
laughing because I'm just like what a

398
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:47,919
different time to to compare to what I

399
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:51,200
know of has happened to people today

400
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,360
well also imagine if the judge knew that

401
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,480
your mom and dad were also weed dealers

402
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,399
they probably wouldn't have been so

403
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,240
quick to to release you to them the of

404
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,679
the situation and

405
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,159
is is

406
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:05,919
humorous and you reminded me so I have

407
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:09,080
to include this my my stepdad had a

408
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,759
joint Fallout during the hearing of his

409
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:13,319
stocking

410
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:15,759
cap but fortunately no one seemed to

411
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:15,759
notice

412
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:24,679
it that's crazy um so let's

413
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,960
see so I handed up having to my my

414
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:30,679
probation officer cuz I got released on

415
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,720
probation eventually uh um I mean I got

416
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,720
released to my mom but they put me on

417
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,038
probation and I ended up being on

418
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:41,480
probation till I was 18 so I took the

419
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:44,519
summer of 72 I only planted a couple

420
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:47,640
plants my my for me growing has also

421
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:50,319
been a political statement

422
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:54,038
because I can't think of anything that

423
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:57,918
more adequately fulfills the definition

424
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:59,759
of the pursuit of happiness then putting

425
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,720
something in your your own body to

426
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:05,119
change your mental state if if if that

427
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,679
isn't the pursuit of happiness and I was

428
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:12,479
raised very politically my mom I mean

429
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:14,960
they were my mom and and father had been

430
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,798
besides being grage Village beix they

431
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,159
were Freedom Writers down south uh they

432
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:22,960
did you know they my mom when I was when

433
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:25,799
when she came back when I'd been in

434
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,720
foster care uh at8 or nine when when she

435
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:32,918
came back we used to go hang out down at

436
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,960
the nwali delta in um Washington on

437
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:38,720
weekends during the fishings the

438
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,480
fishings were an effort by the nwali to

439
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,798
regain their tribal recognition and

440
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:47,720
regain their

441
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:50,119
um regain their treaty rights to fish

442
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:53,278
which uh had been G granted to them

443
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:56,038
under the Stevens treaty and then the

444
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:57,919
Bia just ignored it well there was a

445
00:21:56,038 --> 00:22:00,480
decision called the bolt decision that

446
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:03,799
came out of that that broke the Log Jam

447
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:07,679
on tribal recognitions and treaty rights

448
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:10,278
Restorations so wow my mom was a pretty

449
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:14,759
impressive person um

450
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:16,798
and that I can you know maybe do honor

451
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:19,240
to her memory by doing what I can which

452
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:22,038
is what I've tried to do in cannabis she

453
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,359
was a journalist besides all those other

454
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:26,359
things and

455
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:28,119
um I sort of followed that with cannabis

456
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:32,119
that slipped into that I'll get into

457
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:36,199
that in a minute so uh 72 I plant just a

458
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:39,599
few plants 73 I graduated from high

459
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,960
school planted a lot more plants um

460
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:45,599
worked various jobs and planted gorilla

461
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,759
Gardens up in the Seattle

462
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:51,558
area

463
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:56,079
um jump ahead it's

464
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:58,519
1975 I believe it was Steve Murphy Murph

465
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:02,439
brings out a book as Murphy Stevens

466
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:05,200
Steve Murphy owns the indoor Sun Shop in

467
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:09,159
Seattle it's located right near the

468
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,038
university and they were the first shop

469
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:13,400
I know of that was selling

470
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:16,000
high-intensity discharge lighting to

471
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,798
grow plants with but in 1975 the book he

472
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,640
put out was how to grow marijuana

473
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:23,480
indoors under lights no how to grow how

474
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,000
to yeah how to grow marijuana indoors

475
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,038
under lights and

476
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,919
um do you know if that book is still

477
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:35,000
around say again is that book still

478
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:37,759
available uh actually it is it it's Che

479
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,400
that book out it's Murphy Stevens and

480
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:44,640
then that that was 70 it was either 75

481
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:48,159
or 77 and then two years later which

482
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:51,278
would make it 77 or 79 he put out a book

483
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:53,799
called how to grow the finest marijuana

484
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:56,679
indoors under lights and that's where

485
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:59,798
the transition from vho from very high

486
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:02,798
output fluorescence over to

487
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:05,960
HIDs really took off before that the

488
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:08,480
only guys who were using HIDs were

489
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:11,759
people who had who were pretty hip to it

490
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:15,200
who were stealing street lights you know

491
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:17,558
first Mercury Vapors then halides then

492
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,000
sodiums um and the Mercury

493
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:22,440
Vapors we you know we did we understood

494
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,519
light a lot less than the Mercury Vapors

495
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:29,080
have a huge amount of ultraviolet sea in

496
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:31,079
them coming off of them they're not a

497
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:33,879
good combination of wavelengths for

498
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:36,879
plants to grow under the the what I call

499
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:39,960
the luminal harmony or spectral Harmony

500
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:44,960
had some Sour Notes um halides a little

501
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:47,480
closer to what really works for um

502
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:52,519
plants because it had more of the blue

503
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:55,720
that they need and it had some red

504
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:59,278
um the

505
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:02,360
uh the the scene in battle was kind of

506
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:04,278
interesting and it's like I I I call

507
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:07,038
myself one of the things I've referred

508
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:09,880
to myself as because someone else did it

509
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:12,558
is the Forest Gump of ganja I just keep

510
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:15,200
being in the right place at the right

511
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:19,000
time and find myself in the middle of

512
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,798
things well Steve Murphy's indoor son is

513
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,839
really where indoor growing I mean other

514
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:26,679
people had grown indoors don't get me

515
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:30,639
wrong and even much earlier because if

516
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:32,320
you look in Mary Jane superweed which is

517
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,278
actually a guy who wrote under that name

518
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,960
but Mary Jane superweed is the

519
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:40,398
connoisseur's guide to cultivating

520
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,919
cannabis has a light recipe in it and

521
00:25:40,398 --> 00:25:45,479
that's that I'd always given Bill Drake

522
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:47,799
credit for having the first book in

523
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:52,599
written in modern times in English about

524
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:55,839
growing cannabis for social use uh but

525
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:57,398
then recently was made aware of that of

526
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:01,398
Mary Janes one actually not that

527
00:25:57,398 --> 00:26:06,278
recently when 68 5 years ago is recent

528
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:08,599
but um fair enough it it it happened but

529
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:11,319
so I was made aware of that book and

530
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:15,000
then in talking about it online Dave

531
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:17,798
Watson skunkman Sam came on and told me

532
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,919
no there's a book even older than that

533
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:25,359
and it's true um there's a

534
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:29,278
book by a guy named Langdon l a n g d o

535
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:31,719
n I haven't read the book but scug man

536
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:35,759
Sam made me aware of it and now there's

537
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:37,159
a guy named Don Lang I I on LinkedIn and

538
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,558
I got a hold of him because he's

539
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:43,600
involved in cannabis and I thought wow

540
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:46,158
Lang could this be the same person and

541
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:48,678
it's not he says it was his uncle and I

542
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:52,600
believe it he's he's got a pretty cool

543
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:54,880
hemp operation going but

544
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:57,879
um so that

545
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,520
book Bill Drake's book got me thinking

546
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:03,039
about it it uh got me out planting

547
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:05,558
Outdoors Steve Murphy's first book Got

548
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:07,519
Me growing indoors under lights and I

549
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:10,398
did like as soon as I read it I went and

550
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:14,558
bought a set of VH lights over at indoor

551
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:18,038
sun and um I actually got all the way

552
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:21,678
through flower I I stuck them in a store

553
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:24,798
I stuck this 8ft fixture in a 6 and 1/2t

554
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:27,278
closet under a Stairway so part of the

555
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:31,918
light was hanging out of the end of it

556
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:35,599
and the closet was like 2 ft wide so I

557
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:39,120
ended up using Staples and pipe cleaners

558
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:41,079
to do what nowadays would be low stress

559
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:44,319
training and what before it was low

560
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:46,639
stress training was plant bondage I

561
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:49,200
guess someone decided plant bondage was

562
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,720
Politically Incorrect so it became low

563
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,240
stress training but you know if you tie

564
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,600
it to a wall say again Cosmic um so at

565
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,399
this point how many outdoor grows have

566
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,079
you did you successfully complete you

567
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:04,079
said you were doing gorilla grows uh you

568
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:07,678
know kind of out there in the in the

569
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:12,119
wilderness I had done probably a dozen

570
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:16,360
outdoor crops in different spots of

571
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:19,719
which six or seven actually got to

572
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:21,439
finish didn't have things like um well

573
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,919
the one that finally turned me mostly

574
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,240
indoors which is having this wonderful

575
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,440
crop in the middle of a multi Hundred

576
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,159
Acre Blackberry patch doing doing the

577
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,558
Viet Kong thing with hand Clippers going

578
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:36,080
in tunneling in to the middle of the

579
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:38,200
patch pulling these plants in under the

580
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:41,519
other plants so that something flying

581
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:44,919
overhead won't see brown putting plants

582
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,759
hauling water into them all season

583
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:49,600
having this plant that was the prettiest

584
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:53,240
plant I've ever grown this one plant

585
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:55,158
must have been 12 to 15 ft tall it had

586
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:57,519
decent flowers it had the flowers were

587
00:28:55,159 --> 00:29:00,919
probably 2 and 1/2 to 3 in across not

588
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:03,159
counting the fan leaves okay and I'm

589
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:05,000
like a week from Harvest and I come back

590
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:07,278
to take it down and it's all been

591
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,519
bulldozed by a contractor putting

592
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:12,398
together a residential

593
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:15,120
development that was I I continued to

594
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:20,558
grow outdoors but I began shifting to

595
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:20,558
indoors really heavily that happened

596
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:30,199
in 79 or 80 um one of the things that I

597
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:33,480
had noticed and and this is sort of

598
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:36,240
debated today too a lot of us had the

599
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:40,880
feeling that indoor grown cannabis

600
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:43,839
smelled great looked great tasted good

601
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,080
was [ __ ] no

602
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:48,720
high I've had a lot of people say that

603
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:51,199
outdoor weed has legs that's like the

604
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,120
term that they use or just the the high

605
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:57,200
L it's so much longer than

606
00:29:54,119 --> 00:30:00,479
indoors that's partially that you get

607
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,640
you you get SE TBN that's in the if you

608
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,440
read Michael Stark's first book

609
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:08,038
marijuana potency he talks one of the

610
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,600
things he talks about CBN doing is

611
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:13,359
extending the nature of the high well

612
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:14,839
there there are six tpin I can't

613
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:16,599
remember their names I'm sorry about

614
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:19,119
that but there are six tpin that you

615
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:22,199
will never find on indoor cannabis that

616
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:24,479
you find on outdoor cannabis uh or that

617
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:28,519
have never been found in DET testing on

618
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:32,798
indoor cannabis there's UV Outdoors

619
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:36,480
both B well ABN but the the primary

620
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:41,240
photo receptor for

621
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:43,440
UVB is the wavelength is 280 you got

622
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:46,038
very little of that even Outdoors

623
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,840
indoors and Green Houses don't have you

624
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:51,158
you unless you specifically bring in a

625
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:53,119
light source that will give you that you

626
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:54,760
aren't going to get it Greenhouse

627
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:59,119
coverings except for

628
00:30:54,759 --> 00:31:02,240
EFT and one type of glass don't pass any

629
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:05,000
wavelengths below 300 so you're going to

630
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,319
have different light is what makes

631
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,480
everything else happen light is light is

632
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:13,278
Radio light is the song that the sun

633
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,599
sings to summon the nutrients that those

634
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:18,798
plants want and each plant has each

635
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:21,678
variety has its own favorite song it

636
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:26,000
needs to hear to get just what it needs

637
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:28,278
from the earth and sort of I'm not going

638
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,839
to go real deep into light and Light

639
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:32,919
this time but one of the things I

640
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:34,199
believe is that the crystallin structure

641
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:36,320
of our

642
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,440
nutrients right if you look if you look

643
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:41,439
at the molecular level our nutrients are

644
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:45,320
all crystal and structured early radio

645
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:48,720
was tuned using crystals the length of a

646
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:51,398
radio wave compared to a light wave is

647
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,120
roughly proportionate to the difference

648
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:56,199
between the crystals that were being

649
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:58,558
used to tune radar and what we've got

650
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:02,240
going on as far as Crystal structure of

651
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:04,638
our nutrients so when we when when a

652
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,440
plant has specific nutrient needs that

653
00:32:04,638 --> 00:32:10,519
it does best what we're doing is tuning

654
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:13,080
the receiving end of a transmission of

655
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:15,599
electromagnetic radiation that the

656
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:19,638
American Society of agricultural and

657
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:22,038
biological Engineers now calls plant

658
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:25,959
biologically active radiation and that's

659
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:28,798
the full range from 800 big big

660
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,278
wavelengths are low frequency from 800

661
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:33,119
to

662
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:35,558
280 low short wavelengths are high

663
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:37,678
frequency the length of the wave the

664
00:32:35,558 --> 00:32:39,960
more frequency is how often the waves

665
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,360
are made the more often the waves are

666
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,360
made the shorter the distance between

667
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:48,798
their fronts are so really for accurate

668
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:51,519
portrayal we want our low frequency High

669
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:54,278
number long wavelength to be on the left

670
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,919
hand side of an image and our high

671
00:32:54,278 --> 00:33:00,919
frequency short wavelength low number to

672
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,519
be on the right hand side but and I'm

673
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:05,240
sorry I I I mean to do this at at

674
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,919
another time talking more no no no no

675
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:11,880
that that's okay I mean but I identify

676
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:13,480
to and a lighting freak you're

677
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,399
passionate about it we like it so if you

678
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,558
took the same clone and you grew it

679
00:33:15,398 --> 00:33:19,439
indoors versus Outdoors what you're

680
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:21,798
saying is the Outdoor sunlight would

681
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,480
help that particular plant produce

682
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:28,278
different cannaboids than the one inside

683
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,360
um is able to produce um

684
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:33,278
yeah the different the different

685
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:38,278
wavelengths if we think of them as a

686
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:39,919
Harmony then what happens is the peaks

687
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:43,159
of our

688
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:46,120
waves at the different frequencies if we

689
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:48,840
can get it so the Peaks are arriving at

690
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:51,759
the same time they do something called

691
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:55,319
constructive interference and what this

692
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:59,000
does is like the like a chord in music

693
00:33:55,319 --> 00:34:00,678
say say you're playing a g chord well G

694
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,919
is your dominant note in that but

695
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:05,960
there's three notes the time from when

696
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:08,240
you start that musical note by hitting

697
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:11,440
the by hitting the key or plucking the

698
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:14,918
string or blowing on the read till that

699
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,599
sound is gone is called the that time

700
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:19,878
the length of time is the duration of

701
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,119
the period of resonance so when it's

702
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:24,759
resonating when when you've got

703
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:28,320
reverberation from it the time that a

704
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:30,879
chord those three notes together lasts

705
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,480
is significantly

706
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:36,279
longer is significantly longer than the

707
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,159
period of duration of any of the

708
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:43,679
individual notes that same thing is true

709
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,960
in light so this room here is my office

710
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,039
and so what happens and this is

711
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,079
something that like people can

712
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:50,679
demonstrate for themselves at home

713
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:53,079
because and I'll tell you right now what

714
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:55,240
I'm telling you is heresy according to

715
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:57,839
Conventional photobiology or

716
00:34:55,239 --> 00:35:00,479
conventional plant physiology Bruce

717
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:02,759
bugby hates me because what I say does

718
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,920
not agree with what Bruce bugby says and

719
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,079
what conventional photobiology believes

720
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:10,400
again 8 to 10 photons result in the

721
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:13,800
release of one uh electron that one

722
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,280
electron results in one photosynthetic

723
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,640
incident and uh according to

724
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,480
Conventional photobiology frequency is

725
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:24,440
irrelevant it's not it's music it's

726
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:28,320
radio if we bring all our Peaks together

727
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:31,320
at the same time instead of

728
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,960
photosynthesis being a term that I've

729
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:37,400
invented or coined

730
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:40,079
capacitative sequential in other words

731
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,000
one proton or one Photon two Photon 8

732
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,519
Photon

733
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,239
electron it become it becomes Photon

734
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:51,199
Photon Photon Photon Photon constant so

735
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,598
instead of it being 8 to 10 photons

736
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:55,480
result in one

737
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:58,599
electron and then signal is lost and

738
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:00,838
then regain signal

739
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:03,240
that when we regain signal the process

740
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:05,279
of regaining signal takes energy away

741
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:07,759
from our transmission and the way you

742
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:11,319
prove it at home is you sit at a

743
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,680
radio and you dial in a song you like at

744
00:36:11,318 --> 00:36:15,880
the very beginning of the song so it

745
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:18,199
sounds properly tuned in now turn it

746
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,039
slightly off of the correct dialing some

747
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:23,118
of the signal is going to go

748
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:24,759
away add amplitude more energy right

749
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,160
you're adding amplitude so more energy

750
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:29,319
is coming into your transmission process

751
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:32,759
and what happens some of the signal

752
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:35,079
comes back you've regained that lost

753
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,440
signal but it sounds shitty it's

754
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:40,960
distorted because the energy that you're

755
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:45,159
spending to overcome electronic inertia

756
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,960
is not now delivering signal so you

757
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:50,000
turned it up you pulled it in a little

758
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:54,440
do it so that all told you've gone three

759
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,079
turns away from proper tuning leave it

760
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,079
at that improper tuning and return the

761
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:00,480
and and

762
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,200
or wait I'm sorry leave it at that

763
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,639
amplitude that comp what you've made up

764
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:07,559
for the the lack of correct tuning by

765
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:09,799
turning up amplitude leave it at that

766
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:13,239
and now go back to the correct tuning

767
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:16,680
you got a lot more signal available that

768
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:21,559
same thing is our plants taking light in

769
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:24,559
the photo receptive pigments the the you

770
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:27,119
know like kerene and the chlorophylls uh

771
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:29,838
the carotenoids the anthocyanins and

772
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:33,760
anos cyanid all of those biochemicals

773
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:36,039
those photo receptive pigments are doing

774
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:39,400
the same thing

775
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:42,838
banic that frequency specific components

776
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,639
in a phased array radar are doing

777
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:47,639
they're sending out or receiving

778
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:49,759
specific frequencies then as they come

779
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:52,799
back together where they're received

780
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:55,760
they get mixed back up into what's

781
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,440
needed if you're at the correct relative

782
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,720
amplitudes and all of your frequencies

783
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:04,960
are arriving as close as possibly in the

784
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:06,959
correct phase right so their their their

785
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,920
peaks are arriving where they can

786
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,119
reinforce each other that's called

787
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:13,880
constructive

788
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,440
interference where this all matters and

789
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,358
why I'm talking about this is because

790
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:21,400
this is a huge piece of what I hope is

791
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:23,679
going to be what people remember me for

792
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,119
is is bringing he bringing high energy

793
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:28,199
plasma to their awareness we can cut

794
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:31,400
down on the electrical consumption from

795
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:36,199
lighting worldwide by about

796
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:39,039
65% by replacing LEDs and hi IDs and

797
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:42,358
incandescents with high energy

798
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:43,639
plasma for everything except interior

799
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:46,559
home

800
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:48,358
lighting and but I mean I'll go into

801
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:52,639
that later it just it's it doesn't make

802
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:54,559
sense for us not to do everything we can

803
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:56,559
to save our planet it's the only one we

804
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:58,639
got it's the only one I mean I don't

805
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:00,799
have kids except for the kids of my

806
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:04,239
intellect to me everyone who grows

807
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,880
cannabis indoors or out is sort of I

808
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:07,239
regard them as the children of my heart

809
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,318
and the children of my mind because

810
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:13,719
they're doing what I love they're doing

811
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:17,000
what I've devoted to vast majority of my

812
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:20,719
life too going back so it's

813
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:23,239
7577 I've grown my first crop indoors

814
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:26,039
I've liked it but it's not really giving

815
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:28,759
me a good high and everyone I talk to

816
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:30,960
feels the same way but it's got

817
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:34,040
commercial value so we grow it but

818
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:37,920
mostly we keep nicely done outdoor for

819
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:40,679
head stash or Hawaiian or sitting up in

820
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,358
Washington a lot of times my stash was

821
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:46,399
hash plant grown in Northern California

822
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:48,358
cuz it was really good or kush or you

823
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,519
know a northern a northern California

824
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:54,799
outdoor or a Hawaiian or I think the

825
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:57,920
last time I saw Tai was like 81 or that

826
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,680
I knew for sure was Tai was 81 or 2 when

827
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,159
that ship went down off the coast of

828
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:06,759
Oregon um and I know it was some of that

829
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:09,559
for certain I know that very

830
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:12,720
certain but um so we started growing

831
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:15,838
indoors a lot of us because of weather I

832
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:17,480
mean the Pacific Northwest has a zillion

833
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:21,119
wonderful things the winters don't get

834
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:24,800
too cold the Summers don't get too hot

835
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:28,119
but it's wet and if you want to grow a

836
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,880
Himalayan variety wet just doesn't work

837
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:33,160
I mean you can breed for it you can

838
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:35,838
eventually bring out resistance look at

839
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:37,199
the Jers which are the uh Hindu kushes

840
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:39,599
that they're growing in southern Oregon

841
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:41,399
now some some of those are you can throw

842
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,800
them in the middle of a swamp and and

843
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:47,400
and they won't mold um and and some of

844
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,920
the some of the variants off of the

845
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,680
white widow uh what I'm told and I don't

846
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,960
know if it's true is that the Brazilian

847
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:58,039
that was used in making white widow had

848
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,440
come from Goa

849
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:03,318
which was the Portuguese Colony on the

850
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:07,000
Indian subcontinent had come in the mid

851
00:41:03,318 --> 00:41:10,318
1500s and that that was the Brazilian

852
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,159
that got used in making white widow well

853
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:13,639
I've had a lot of white widows rot but I

854
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:16,199
have a friend who had a white widow that

855
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:19,118
wouldn't rot I think that sometimes it's

856
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:21,960
just you know we get lucky how how how

857
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,400
did the AL get shuffled for

858
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:27,800
dispatch and and you

859
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:30,639
know I I I will try to to ask you

860
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:33,079
something uh the seeds the first seeds

861
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:35,159
that you were using for growing indoors

862
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:38,079
under artificial light what was the

863
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:41,519
genetics was it was it you know some

864
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:45,519
land races that you got from Land

865
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:47,800
probably were one or two from um from a

866
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:50,719
tie because at that point there really

867
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:53,960
wasn't a lot else that was exotic we we

868
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:56,439
had not seen um I mean there was down in

869
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,039
California but in terms of seeds and

870
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,440
availability

871
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:03,679
some some ties and they take forever and

872
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:06,079
they end up being Herms um which was

873
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:08,559
really frustrating I tried some

874
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,839
Colombians there was God there was some

875
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:13,759
phenomenal Colombians I I would love to

876
00:42:10,838 --> 00:42:17,679
see some of the mahogany Colombians we

877
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,800
had back then uh there was one haha the

878
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:21,480
very first Tiba I or the very first

879
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,880
Colombian I ever smoked was something

880
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,880
that they were calling

881
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,680
Chiba and I had sent my gu I was working

882
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,280
in a cry up in Alaska

883
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:32,838
I had sent my god brother 150 bucks to

884
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:36,240
send me a brick which you know a brick

885
00:42:32,838 --> 00:42:38,960
was about a pound and um sometimes a

886
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:42,159
little more sometimes a little less and

887
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,559
waited 3 weeks and what comes is this

888
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:48,639
itty bitty little candy box you know

889
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:52,440
like a metal uh exotic C or high-end

890
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:55,519
candy box and in it there's three

891
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:57,440
freaking ounces I mean I'm waiting for a

892
00:42:55,519 --> 00:43:00,639
pound and there's three fre freaking

893
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,920
ounces and I sent him 150 bucks you know

894
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:05,239
and this is

895
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:08,280
like but it's been 3 weeks since we had

896
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:12,679
any pot in Cold Bay was it cold Bay no s

897
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:14,000
point in s point and um so you know okay

898
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:15,480
well I'm not real happy with him I'm

899
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,679
going to have to beat him up when I go

900
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,159
back down to Seattle but at least I've

901
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:22,078
got some pot to smoke so we go up to the

902
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:23,318
bunk house and I roll up not a big one

903
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:27,160
not a

904
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:30,800
Pinner and we smoke it it's really

905
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:34,239
really really tasty and it's wacky weed

906
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:38,119
we're laughing our asses off all of us

907
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:41,679
nonstop for 3 hours and I look down and

908
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:44,920
there's an oil soaked half a joint left

909
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:47,239
that was my introduction to Colombian it

910
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,960
was and it was this variety called Sheba

911
00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:53,679
and from what I understand there is

912
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:59,039
someone who lives up by the Bay who has

913
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:59,039
been growing that same chba since

914
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:05,480
1975 they won't let go of it uh we're

915
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,318
we're we're getting ready to offer them

916
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,838
a $66,000

917
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:12,159
light in order to get the

918
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:14,078
genetics and even then it will be with

919
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:16,679
you know it'll be with a youth contract

920
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:19,839
that says uh I can use it for breeding

921
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:21,719
but I can't release that itself in pure

922
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:23,239
form and I'm willing to do that as long

923
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:24,439
as I get to have it for me and friends

924
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:28,039
to

925
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:30,280
smoke cuz that that was uh let's see

926
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:32,119
wacky weed was one of them I haven't

927
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,240
seen a lot of that out there I don't

928
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:37,440
hear of anyone finding that in

929
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:39,519
dispensaries um horny weed the weed that

930
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,679
you would smoke with someone that you

931
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:47,880
were close with and you would want to

932
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:50,719
get way way closer with immediately um I

933
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,760
haven't seen any of that we don't even

934
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:57,399
know where those effects come from we

935
00:44:52,760 --> 00:45:02,119
don't we don't have any real consistent

936
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:03,720
systematic search for how and this is a

937
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:07,240
piece of something I'll talk about how

938
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:09,598
epigenetic factors influence chemotypic

939
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:11,078
expression in known genotypes of

940
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,920
cannabis that would be the name of the

941
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:16,920
formal study for everyone else it's how

942
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,720
we grow how does how we grow it affect

943
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:22,358
the high or affect H how does how does

944
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:25,078
how you grow it affect the

945
00:45:22,358 --> 00:45:28,719
effects we we need to go at this

946
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:31,559
systematically um and and at one point

947
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:34,439
in the course of a very long discussion

948
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:36,400
with Section Chiefs boo who is now the

949
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:39,079
deputy director of the diversion

950
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,480
division over at the DEA with Section

951
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:45,000
Chiefs Boo and Armstrong I think

952
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:46,800
Armstrong is still uh uh section chief

953
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
in the diversion division which by the

954
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,519
way are the people who will be signing

955
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,559
the licenses to manufacture for research

956
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:58,639
purposes I mean this is really key for

957
00:45:55,559 --> 00:46:00,359
about two weeks I spent an hour a day on

958
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:02,838
the phone with them asking them

959
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:04,799
questions because I while in Puerto Rico

960
00:46:02,838 --> 00:46:07,279
I had had this idea that I thought was

961
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:10,200
like a glimmer of maybe this is a way we

962
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:12,839
can do this legally so I started asking

963
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:14,598
them questions about setting up a

964
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:17,558
research

965
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:20,200
collaborative because internationally

966
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:23,519
the two things that cannabis can be

967
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:26,279
legally used for are research and

968
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:27,880
medicine and you oh three you can use

969
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,760
hemp

970
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:32,599
uh for

971
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,119
industry well I I start asking them

972
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:36,079
questions and like I said it was about

973
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:38,800
an hour day and i' go well if I did this

974
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:41,200
and this and those people did that and

975
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,800
then we did

976
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:46,399
this would that be okay and they'd say

977
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,839
no and then i' we talk a little more and

978
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:51,358
I'd run another possibility by them and

979
00:46:48,838 --> 00:46:52,838
they'd say no so this goes on for a

980
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:56,159
couple weeks and then I say well if I

981
00:46:52,838 --> 00:46:59,159
did this and that and this and then did

982
00:46:56,159 --> 00:47:01,838
these could I do that and instead of

983
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:04,039
saying no they said you're probably

984
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:06,960
going to have to talk to the FDA about

985
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:09,679
that now I thought okay there's three

986
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,720
possible interpretations of this one

987
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:13,838
they've been jacking me around they've

988
00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:15,759
had their fun they're tired they've got

989
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:18,159
something else to do so they're going to

990
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:22,280
go send me to bug someone at the FDA

991
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:22,279
that was one possibility two

992
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,358
was there just not no way and I'm going

993
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:29,480
to go to the FDA they're not going to

994
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:32,000
want to talk about it and that's another

995
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:35,559
way to end the conversation

996
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,599
three they basically had guided me to

997
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:40,480
what they wanted to guide me to but they

998
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:42,519
as being in the position they were in

999
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:46,079
they could not say here's what you

1000
00:47:42,519 --> 00:47:49,679
should do so we spent those couple weeks

1001
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:53,119
going over it and what emerged was that

1002
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:55,399
one administrative rule it's not a law

1003
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,559
one administrative rule needs to change

1004
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,800
for the following to be possible

1005
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:02,000
if they

1006
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:06,559
allow distribution sample distribution

1007
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:10,639
centers to collect an administration fee

1008
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:11,440
for delivering their sample in a test in

1009
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:15,078
a

1010
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:19,960
study the following would be possible a

1011
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:25,200
before seed to Beyond sold vertically

1012
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:29,318
integrated multi-state 280e exempt

1013
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:32,719
distribution system before seed the the

1014
00:48:29,318 --> 00:48:36,079
Cannabis itself all gets genetically

1015
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:39,239
sequenced the patients the the patients

1016
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:43,079
in the research collaborative program

1017
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:46,000
all get full genetic and biochemical

1018
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:49,039
workups so now we've got pretty good

1019
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:52,318
idea of what cannabis we're using what

1020
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:54,480
people what conditions they have we have

1021
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:57,440
the patients that have been recommended

1022
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,199
by a doctor who tells them

1023
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,720
I don't know that this is going to help

1024
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:02,798
this is a recommendation not a

1025
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:06,879
prescription but according to this

1026
00:49:02,798 --> 00:49:10,199
relational database of the 47,000 people

1027
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:13,920
who have responded on their apps 23,000

1028
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:15,960
had your symptoms of those 23,000 10,000

1029
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:19,480
had this condition as the underlying

1030
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:21,400
condition of those 10,000 5,000 fit your

1031
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:23,960
were very similar to your genetically

1032
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:27,079
and biochemically based on that this is

1033
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:31,079
what you should try first

1034
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:34,760
and here's the bar graph that shows the

1035
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:38,318
dominant like the 10 dominant uh canono

1036
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:42,319
tend dominant in other words all of the

1037
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:45,039
different canabo tpine styles

1038
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:48,358
flavonoids um other Esters other

1039
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:51,558
alkaloids that gives a bar graph on

1040
00:49:48,358 --> 00:49:51,558
every package every

1041
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:58,359
sample it would basically be matching

1042
00:49:54,838 --> 00:50:03,159
like chemotype to the indiv ual's

1043
00:49:58,358 --> 00:50:05,279
uh yespe as well chemotype Tooty

1044
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:08,118
basically what we're looking for is it

1045
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:11,920
compensates for patient

1046
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:13,280
individuation okay I mean that's that's

1047
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,559
becomes very quantifiable and

1048
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,200
qualifiable so that it's easy to to pass

1049
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:19,559
that information on and get people on

1050
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:22,838
board to a program like that with with a

1051
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:24,680
lot of data to back it up and it's it

1052
00:50:22,838 --> 00:50:27,199
gets more elaborate you base it in

1053
00:50:24,679 --> 00:50:30,639
universities

1054
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:32,039
so that it can be part of the ongoing

1055
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:36,679
educational

1056
00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:41,440
process and the venders do in order to

1057
00:50:36,679 --> 00:50:44,879
know how all of the different epigenetic

1058
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:46,960
factors affect chemotypic

1059
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,480
expression we have to get as many

1060
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,960
Growers as we can growing as many

1061
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:55,519
different varieties as we can as many

1062
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:59,199
different ways as we can to find the

1063
00:50:55,519 --> 00:51:01,838
missing pieces that have gone away in 50

1064
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:05,118
years of being bred away from

1065
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:07,880
natural because I guarantee this plant

1066
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:10,440
has been more places with us this is the

1067
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:12,798
single most ubiquitous plant there is

1068
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:15,079
the single most ubiquitously cultivated

1069
00:51:12,798 --> 00:51:18,440
plant there is it's been grown at the

1070
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:21,599
South Pole in a

1071
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:23,318
closet under a

1072
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:26,160
fluorescent I don't know if it's been

1073
00:51:23,318 --> 00:51:28,558
grown up on the space station but every

1074
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:28,558
continent

1075
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:34,358
so this plant is our helper we need to

1076
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:36,719
the relationship do you know about like

1077
00:51:34,358 --> 00:51:39,759
the relationship between man and plants

1078
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:41,199
that uh poock talks about in the bodony

1079
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,520
of

1080
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:45,719
desire a little bit Yeah well B

1081
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:48,519
basically it's the plants have

1082
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:52,719
cultivated us so we'll cultivate them

1083
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:55,519
and cannabis coffee uh

1084
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:58,358
corn cannabis coffee corn and there's

1085
00:51:55,519 --> 00:52:00,880
one other have become so interdependent

1086
00:51:58,358 --> 00:52:03,838
the plants can't really do well without

1087
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:06,119
us or wouldn't do nearly as well but

1088
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:08,639
they have lifted us so it's been a

1089
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:12,240
symbiotic rather than a parasitic

1090
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:14,199
relationship and we need to know all the

1091
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:16,919
ways we can grow and all those things

1092
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:20,960
that it can produce because someplace in

1093
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:23,798
there is for instance I believe to cure

1094
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,519
to what my mom died of ALS Luke ging's

1095
00:52:23,798 --> 00:52:30,079
disease

1096
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:33,679
I've successfully provided full Ensemble

1097
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:36,400
cannabis extracts to parents who have

1098
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:40,679
come back and told me their kids don't

1099
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:44,280
have seizures anymore to cancer patients

1100
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:46,798
who tell me their gleo blasto is gone to

1101
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:48,880
you know this is I love growing to get

1102
00:52:46,798 --> 00:52:50,920
high I love getting high but I get

1103
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:54,400
higher on growing than I do on getting

1104
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:57,358
high and I get highest of all on someone

1105
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:59,798
being healed by something I've grown I

1106
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:02,400
love adult use I believe adult use is

1107
00:52:59,798 --> 00:53:05,199
medicinal we're we're treating people

1108
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:10,039
are self-medicating for undiagnosed

1109
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:11,719
cases of social anxiety disorder um and

1110
00:53:10,039 --> 00:53:13,558
and in support of which I say think

1111
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:16,519
about how many times the Icebreaker when

1112
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:19,079
you meet someone new is cannabis hey

1113
00:53:16,519 --> 00:53:20,639
smoke a joint you smoke smoke a joint

1114
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:23,280
start laughing an hour later your

1115
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:25,318
buddies really try that I mean alcohol

1116
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,040
to a lesser degree but I I regard

1117
00:53:25,318 --> 00:53:29,599
cannabis as the best social lubricant

1118
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:32,599
there is and I think that we need that

1119
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:34,240
because our society our world is getting

1120
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:36,680
to where we're scared of each other on

1121
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:39,598
some levels cannabis takes that away

1122
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:42,159
long enough to go hey hello over there

1123
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:45,318
instead of oh my God what do you

1124
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:48,318
do I already tried I know we've gotten

1125
00:53:45,318 --> 00:53:49,679
away from the story already um but when

1126
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:51,880
you were talking about the Colombian and

1127
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:53,199
you only got three o uh what happened to

1128
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:56,599
the other

1129
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:59,239
13 uh that's a dynamite question I

1130
00:53:56,599 --> 00:54:03,680
suspect knowing Kenny that he probably

1131
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:06,318
got four or five and I expected him to

1132
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:08,000
pinch it I mean you know that's that was

1133
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:10,318
a lot of times in the old days that was

1134
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,119
all you got out of it was that pinch and

1135
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:14,599
I I would always tell someone hey I'm

1136
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:17,440
making $2 in a pinch when I was when I

1137
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:19,720
was doing Street Front Lids you know I'm

1138
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,720
not but it was a 12 ooun pinch that's a

1139
00:54:19,719 --> 00:54:24,798
big pinch I don't know that's more like

1140
00:54:21,719 --> 00:54:27,358
a fistful or a couple fist I'm inclined

1141
00:54:24,798 --> 00:54:29,599
to believe that that was actually going

1142
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:35,400
for that price because when I got back

1143
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:37,240
down to Seattle like 4 months later um

1144
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,798
two or three people had Columbia none of

1145
00:54:37,239 --> 00:54:41,919
it was quite as good as that Sheba but

1146
00:54:39,798 --> 00:54:44,599
they were all up in the $4 to $50 an

1147
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,599
ounce range which was like three or four

1148
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:49,720
times what I was used to paying for an

1149
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:52,838
ounce and when on those few occasions

1150
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:52,838
when I would have to buy an

1151
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:59,558
ounce so so once you had your first GR

1152
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:01,879
going and everything and you um you were

1153
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:03,680
getting some some like when when were

1154
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:06,920
you first harvesting some of the bud

1155
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:06,919
that you were really excited

1156
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:14,318
about I was really excited about the

1157
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:17,679
little bits of Bud that I got the first

1158
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:21,480
time I grew outside anytime I can get a

1159
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:24,719
harvest I am excited I like I mean I I

1160
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:26,719
like a bumper crop is is preferable but

1161
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:28,639
even a crop failure if I get to to smoke

1162
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:30,598
some pot I've grown

1163
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:36,078
myself it's a

1164
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:38,240
success but where it's been for money um

1165
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:40,640
it was probably a year into it before I

1166
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:44,639
started really seeing it pay for itself

1167
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:47,920
and then get better and better from that

1168
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:52,239
point for sure and so after you using

1169
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:54,639
the um what was the uh the high output

1170
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:59,279
fluorescent is that what you called it

1171
00:55:54,639 --> 00:56:02,598
vho very high output growx lights they

1172
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:05,920
were made by a company called Luxor

1173
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:08,960
which was located in raway New Jersey

1174
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:10,920
Luxor also made something called the

1175
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:14,720
color matcher

1176
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:17,159
75 and because I'm a light GE a light

1177
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:20,038
fre lighting freak I got some of those

1178
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:22,639
and tried them and found out that these

1179
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:25,920
were truly outstanding lights for

1180
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:28,759
rooting clones under so then I got them

1181
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:31,880
to make make a they made a gross of them

1182
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:33,440
for me uh with a power twist I don't

1183
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,960
know if you remember fluorescence that

1184
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,720
or ever even saw them you're young

1185
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,960
enough that you might not have uh that

1186
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:42,279
had like a a Twist because it gave it

1187
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:44,679
more they had more output because there

1188
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:48,160
was more surface area for the light to

1189
00:56:44,679 --> 00:56:51,919
come from but they made him double anode

1190
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:55,078
very high output power twist for me and

1191
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:58,639
those were the most singularly

1192
00:56:55,079 --> 00:57:01,119
magnificent cloning lights that I to

1193
00:56:58,639 --> 00:57:03,598
this day have ever had after I got done

1194
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:06,720
doing my 15 years of prison we we'll get

1195
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:10,000
to that too um but after I did that I

1196
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:11,358
came out of prison Luxor was gone it had

1197
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,239
been absorbed by

1198
00:57:11,358 --> 00:57:16,318
oam

1199
00:57:13,239 --> 00:57:17,679
oam makes a lamp called the color

1200
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:21,318
classer

1201
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:25,078
75 which I had really

1202
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:26,798
hoped was the uh the okay color classer

1203
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:30,160
75 did I really hope was the color

1204
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:32,079
mattress 75 but it wasn't uh it didn't

1205
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:35,239
work anywhere near as well color

1206
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:37,680
mattress 75 is gone I've told the folks

1207
00:57:35,239 --> 00:57:37,679
over at

1208
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:48,400
ostram that one of the best things ever

1209
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:51,279
that they could do for their company

1210
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:56,200
would be start offering some cloning

1211
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:58,720
lights in the exact same spectral output

1212
00:57:56,199 --> 00:58:02,199
as those color match

1213
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:07,959
75s I was throwing clothes away that

1214
00:58:02,199 --> 00:58:07,960
weren't well rooted in seven days in

1215
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:12,920
plugs what was the color spectrum that

1216
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:15,358
you found to be so successful well it it

1217
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:18,000
was it was it was a

1218
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:20,239
7500 Kelvin color

1219
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,880
temperature unfortunately color

1220
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:26,439
temperatures are averages rather than

1221
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:28,720
specific Blends so like you can blend

1222
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:30,720
this from this wavelength and this

1223
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:33,759
wavelength and this wavelength and get

1224
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:36,719
the same color temperature in Kelvin

1225
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:39,160
that you do mixing other ones so that's

1226
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:41,199
why I wanted o Ram since they had bought

1227
00:58:39,159 --> 00:58:44,558
Luxor I figured they probably had the

1228
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:46,879
luxur files they had the spds that they

1229
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:50,200
would have all of

1230
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,519
that cuz I would really like to see

1231
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:54,480
those they

1232
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:58,838
were I mean it was great I I would take

1233
00:58:54,480 --> 00:59:02,199
a thing of take a trade of 50

1234
00:58:58,838 --> 00:59:06,798
and I would think I had had a bad run if

1235
00:59:02,199 --> 00:59:08,118
five didn't make it uh generally by the

1236
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:10,519
one week

1237
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:13,318
Mark from that point because by then I

1238
00:59:10,519 --> 00:59:16,719
was doing sea of green

1239
00:59:13,318 --> 00:59:20,558
um from that point it's they're rooted

1240
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:24,919
they get 5 or 10 days of veg 22 hours a

1241
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:28,039
day of veg under you a really lot of

1242
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:28,039
light um

1243
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:33,639
and then into flow and once I found

1244
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:35,318
varieties that it worked really well

1245
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:36,679
with it's really funny the very first

1246
00:59:35,318 --> 00:59:40,358
deliberate sea of

1247
00:59:36,679 --> 00:59:42,679
green was phenomenal and I didn't manage

1248
00:59:40,358 --> 00:59:47,000
to duplicate those results for a

1249
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:49,598
year but I kept at it and did um long as

1250
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:53,960
I'm at it how sea of green was

1251
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:56,960
born I'm over let's see I'm growing in a

1252
00:59:53,960 --> 01:00:00,720
hanger at Creston Airport

1253
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:04,599
southeast of Seattle got a hanger full

1254
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:08,358
of plants I'm three to four weeks from

1255
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:11,559
Harvest I get a phone call from Puget

1256
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:13,719
electric Mr seagull you're using an

1257
01:00:11,559 --> 01:00:17,039
enormous amount of electricity we'd like

1258
01:00:13,719 --> 01:00:19,078
to send one of our staff out to help you

1259
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:21,160
determine if there's some way you could

1260
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:23,318
save some

1261
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:26,639
electricity serious case of the old

1262
01:00:23,318 --> 01:00:29,838
[ __ ] because

1263
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:32,879
i' got a hanger full so what I did was I

1264
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:35,400
went and got the a bunch of U-Haul

1265
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:38,920
wardrobe boxes these plants were about 6

1266
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:42,119
ft tall I got a bunch of U-Haul wardrobe

1267
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:44,880
boxes and I double decked them I put

1268
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:48,000
pots and plants in one and then put the

1269
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:52,318
other one on top as as a cover taped

1270
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:53,960
them and fill the UL truck with

1271
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:57,679
them

1272
01:00:53,960 --> 01:01:00,760
now this truck stank these plants were

1273
01:00:57,679 --> 01:01:03,318
well into flower this truck red and I'm

1274
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:06,079
like I really hope I don't get pulled

1275
01:01:03,318 --> 01:01:08,719
over cuz where I was taking them was

1276
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:10,798
from just a little southeast of Seattle

1277
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:14,399
to the extreme northeast corner of

1278
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:17,960
Washington state about 300 miles 300 350

1279
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:19,880
mil nice little drive and I'm like I

1280
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:21,280
really hope I didn't get pulled over if

1281
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:24,240
I get pulled over what the [ __ ] am I

1282
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:26,720
going to do and what I came up with was

1283
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:29,318
I know it wouldn't save me but as a rule

1284
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:31,480
of thumb if you're interacting with cops

1285
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:33,719
if you can make them laugh if you can

1286
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:36,519
make them smile if you can make them

1287
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:40,118
believe that you might be a human being

1288
01:01:36,519 --> 01:01:43,318
and not filthy scum per you can usually

1289
01:01:40,119 --> 01:01:46,519
get looser handcuffs you can usually get

1290
01:01:43,318 --> 01:01:48,000
not as shittily treated so I thought

1291
01:01:46,519 --> 01:01:50,239
well what the [ __ ] maybe I'll come up

1292
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,358
with a story and what I came up with uh

1293
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:54,118
is it's made everyone I've told about it

1294
01:01:52,358 --> 01:01:56,798
laugh and that's why I like to share it

1295
01:01:54,119 --> 01:01:59,680
what I came up with was that I would

1296
01:01:56,798 --> 01:02:02,159
call it I would say officer I know what

1297
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:04,558
you think this is but it's not it's

1298
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:06,679
Himalayan mint weed we're getting or

1299
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:09,640
Himalaya mint Vine we're getting ready

1300
01:02:06,679 --> 01:02:12,960
to sell it as a novelty item here's our

1301
01:02:09,639 --> 01:02:16,038
slogan it looks like pot it smells like

1302
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,039
pot but it's

1303
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:21,078
not I figured you know the absolute did

1304
01:02:19,159 --> 01:02:23,838
you have to test that out you have to

1305
01:02:21,079 --> 01:02:26,278
test out if that worked here try it no I

1306
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:29,639
didn't have to test it out fortunately

1307
01:02:26,278 --> 01:02:33,278
I'm so glad but I end up over in Eastern

1308
01:02:29,639 --> 01:02:33,278
Washington with this truckload of

1309
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:41,439
plants at my friend Mike's and

1310
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:45,039
um odds are that someone watching this

1311
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:47,960
podcast lives on Kelly Road up by up

1312
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:50,640
above Davenport out by hunters in spum

1313
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:52,440
well Mike R you'll know who I mean by

1314
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:56,358
Mike R because he started all of you

1315
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:59,318
growing up there um is was growing

1316
01:02:56,358 --> 01:03:01,239
and he had planted a bunch of plants and

1317
01:02:59,318 --> 01:03:03,480
I arrive over there haven't even called

1318
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:05,239
him I've got a truck full of plants hey

1319
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:07,719
can I plant these over here I need to

1320
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:07,719
finish them

1321
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:14,278
out it says well I planted a lot of

1322
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:16,519
plants but yeah there's probably a few

1323
01:03:14,278 --> 01:03:18,960
places back there you could still throw

1324
01:03:16,519 --> 01:03:21,759
them right next to the door to his

1325
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:26,960
trailer was a little brown 1gallon

1326
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:32,119
terracotta pot with a 24 in flow coming

1327
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:34,838
out of it solid from maybe an inch 2 in

1328
01:03:32,119 --> 01:03:38,760
above the dirt all the way up to the end

1329
01:03:34,838 --> 01:03:40,719
no gaps so really freaking solid

1330
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:43,359
remember this is Eastern Washington

1331
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:47,000
which is very dry as far as the weather

1332
01:03:43,358 --> 01:03:49,239
the atmosphere um and I asked him about

1333
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,920
this plant he said well I got so busy I

1334
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:53,639
never got a chance to plant it but we've

1335
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:55,519
kept watering it looks kind of cool huh

1336
01:03:53,639 --> 01:03:57,199
and I say yeah that's really cool and I

1337
01:03:55,519 --> 01:04:01,400
don't think about it

1338
01:03:57,199 --> 01:04:04,558
anymore the next year I was doing a crop

1339
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:09,039
in Seattle along the there's a stretch

1340
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:12,839
of railroad that runs along the banks of

1341
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:15,880
Puget Sound the coast of Puget Sound but

1342
01:04:12,838 --> 01:04:18,199
in central well not Central but Slightly

1343
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:20,000
North of Seattle or in the northern part

1344
01:04:18,199 --> 01:04:25,239
of Seattle there's a neighborhood called

1345
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:26,679
Bard and it sits on a bluff over Puget

1346
01:04:25,239 --> 01:04:28,399
Sound

1347
01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:32,558
with the railroads running below the

1348
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:34,639
bluff and in between the railroad and

1349
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:37,119
the road that goes to a park that if you

1350
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:39,078
count each car that goes by and each

1351
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:41,440
person in those car in the course of the

1352
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:44,480
summer you probably have a quarter of a

1353
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:46,240
million people that go by the spot and

1354
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,440
there's a Blackberry patch that runs

1355
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:52,558
along the

1356
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:57,358
railroad it's maybe 75 to 125 ft

1357
01:04:52,559 --> 01:05:00,200
wide well I love BlackBerry patches so I

1358
01:04:57,358 --> 01:05:02,239
go do the Viet Kong thing in under the

1359
01:05:00,199 --> 01:05:04,558
tunnel pull them all pull plants under

1360
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:07,719
so Brown doesn't show up from above put

1361
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:09,119
in several pots put in Plants tunnel

1362
01:05:07,719 --> 01:05:14,558
down to the next

1363
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:17,599
spot no did the wi all told I did about

1364
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:20,400
3 miles of garden so let's see all told

1365
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:22,920
I do about 3 miles of garden and it was

1366
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:26,838
pretty funky because I've got in order

1367
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:29,920
to in order to water I've got to

1368
01:05:26,838 --> 01:05:32,798
backpack six gallons of water at a time

1369
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,760
in my backpack down there starting an

1370
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:37,358
hour or two before

1371
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:40,119
Sunset right down or rather Excuse Me

1372
01:05:37,358 --> 01:05:42,199
Before Sunrise right down to maybe half

1373
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:43,640
an hour an hour after Sunrise when it

1374
01:05:42,199 --> 01:05:46,879
starts getting light enough that I think

1375
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:48,759
people can see me I got to go back out

1376
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:51,240
well I did get that crop all the way

1377
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:54,119
done but there was like a dozen maybe a

1378
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:57,358
dozen and a half plants that I wasn't

1379
01:05:54,119 --> 01:06:02,318
able to get down there in time so they

1380
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:04,719
sat in a upside down pallet in Dix in in

1381
01:06:02,318 --> 01:06:08,639
20 o Solo

1382
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:11,399
cups and Mary my friend's wife John my

1383
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:14,078
friend and I watered several times a day

1384
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:18,079
to keep them from drying out and damned

1385
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:20,720
if I didn't get some 18in long solid

1386
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:23,640
flowers now this is all going on right

1387
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:27,439
in that Arrow where I'm starting to grow

1388
01:06:23,639 --> 01:06:30,920
indoors and one of the things I noticed

1389
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:33,760
looking at the plants growing indoors is

1390
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:37,480
I'm really not growing a 6-foot plant

1391
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:41,278
I'm growing a bunch of leaf and lumber

1392
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:45,559
and I'm growing I don't know 18 to 25 30

1393
01:06:41,278 --> 01:06:47,119
Ines of plant that's really

1394
01:06:45,559 --> 01:06:52,319
worthwhile

1395
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:54,680
so I think about [ __ ] a lot um and I

1396
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:58,159
start thinking about that plant in front

1397
01:06:54,679 --> 01:06:59,519
of Mike's PL Place those plants up on

1398
01:06:58,159 --> 01:07:03,798
top of John's

1399
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:08,199
shed this Grow Zone was the term I came

1400
01:07:03,798 --> 01:07:12,519
up with of 18 to 30 in

1401
01:07:08,199 --> 01:07:14,879
Max and I go hm I wonder what's going to

1402
01:07:12,519 --> 01:07:17,519
happen if I do this

1403
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:20,119
deliberately and while this is going on

1404
01:07:17,519 --> 01:07:23,038
I've been dealing with a company called

1405
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:25,519
hydrotech in Seattle I had been a

1406
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:27,799
customer of indoor son Steve Murphy the

1407
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:31,199
the guy who wrote those books but

1408
01:07:27,798 --> 01:07:33,880
hydrotech prices were less and they were

1409
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:35,919
a little more relaxed so I started doing

1410
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:39,200
business with them as a

1411
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:41,760
customer and Kevin the owner of the

1412
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:43,798
company likes to talk almost as much as

1413
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:46,520
I do so most of the time what would

1414
01:07:43,798 --> 01:07:48,639
happen is I would come in Kevin would be

1415
01:07:46,519 --> 01:07:50,278
talking to a customer and I would end up

1416
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:52,440
waiting on the customer who came in

1417
01:07:50,278 --> 01:07:54,519
after me because I was pretty familiar

1418
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:57,200
with his gear so I was able to tell

1419
01:07:54,519 --> 01:08:00,759
people about it

1420
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:03,000
um and I ended up helping them develop a

1421
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:05,839
it's like we had the Chinese Hat type

1422
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,719
cones the COO hack type cones or type

1423
01:08:05,838 --> 01:08:09,358
reflectors that was all there was and we

1424
01:08:07,719 --> 01:08:12,480
weren't very happy with those they they

1425
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:15,639
just didn't seem very good we tried some

1426
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:17,838
pyramid shapes uh we tried some let's

1427
01:08:15,639 --> 01:08:20,358
see three-sided pyramids four-sided

1428
01:08:17,838 --> 01:08:22,920
pyramids six-sided

1429
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:24,880
paraboloid and finally ended up with the

1430
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:27,719
eight-sided paraboloids that became the

1431
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:30,039
model for all of the umbrella style

1432
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:32,158
reflectors that came later uh I think

1433
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:34,198
the first people that copied us were M&amp;R

1434
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:36,238
lighting they did it in white we were

1435
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:38,719
using highly reflective aluminum the

1436
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:41,718
point of this being that I had a SE one

1437
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:44,399
of the very first 7ot

1438
01:08:41,719 --> 01:08:48,198
paraboloids hanging over this and four

1439
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:51,559
corners so I had 2,000 watts of light

1440
01:08:48,198 --> 01:08:54,079
over one gallon pots round one gallons

1441
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:58,319
and I had 198 of

1442
01:08:54,079 --> 01:09:04,559
them I got got between a half an oun and

1443
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:07,000
3/4 of an ounce of dry flour from each

1444
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:09,640
one 6 and2

1445
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,679
lb

1446
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:15,079
19

1447
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:18,279
1982 I believe it was 6 and 12 lb from

1448
01:09:15,079 --> 01:09:21,318
2000 watt 2000 watts of light a 1,000

1449
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:23,520
water in a 7ot paraboloid and four

1450
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:25,039
corner reflectors but they were actually

1451
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,839
what we were selling as horizontal

1452
01:09:25,039 --> 01:09:29,479
reflector reflectors four corner

1453
01:09:26,838 --> 01:09:32,278
reflectors so horizontals in the corners

1454
01:09:29,479 --> 01:09:36,039
shining in I believe what I had in them

1455
01:09:32,279 --> 01:09:38,880
was 250 watt General Electric

1456
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:44,278
Corporation not American GE but British

1457
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:48,239
GE HPS is the calux 4 and the calux 4

1458
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:51,400
made an appearance here semi recently as

1459
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:55,158
the uh hux ceramic

1460
01:09:51,399 --> 01:09:59,279
HPS hux is gone now but they uh that

1461
01:09:55,158 --> 01:10:03,839

1462
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:07,359

was 10 by 10 but it was but the corners

1466
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:21,000

01:11:00,399 --> 01:11:04,039
going to do in

1485
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:07,360
Slovenia oh that's possible yeah because

1486
01:11:04,039 --> 01:11:09,198
development companies are quite uh there

1487
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:12,799
is quite a lot of development companies

1488
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:16,198
in our country you know small small you

1489
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:20,039
know for any kind of scientific approach

1490
01:11:16,198 --> 01:11:22,359
you know uh we have you know I would if

1491
01:11:20,039 --> 01:11:24,679
I would start to talk about this now we

1492
01:11:22,359 --> 01:11:27,439
would go in different area but we talk

1493
01:11:24,679 --> 01:11:29,719
about conom today so so it's like for

1494
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:33,599
kobies we have an Institute for kabin

1495
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:36,760
nids you know an Institute for kabin

1496
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:38,560
research you know uh which is like only

1497
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:41,039
doctors are there you know there is like

1498
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:44,480
they are teaching doctors for medical

1499
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:47,600
approach for kabes you know so in the

1500
01:11:44,479 --> 01:11:50,959
future they they they will be kabi n

1501
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:53,639
clinics and uh I hope that a lot of

1502
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:56,119
medicine staff will be teached in the

1503
01:11:53,639 --> 01:11:58,520
future for for this development of

1504
01:11:56,119 --> 01:12:01,079
medicine which is you know controlled

1505
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:03,639
medicine you know because all of us you

1506
01:12:01,079 --> 01:12:07,039
know all of us know how to cook uh their

1507
01:12:03,639 --> 01:12:10,880
own Rick Simpson o at home yeah uh but

1508
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:14,880
uh the the the truth is that it's not

1509
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:17,319
everybody should do that because uh the

1510
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:19,880
it's people work with dangerous

1511
01:12:17,319 --> 01:12:22,399
substances and you know they can burn up

1512
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:24,480
their houses and you know stuff like

1513
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:26,839
that so you should actually give it to

1514
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:29,439
professionals who can control in a

1515
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:33,920
control environment do an extraction of

1516
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:33,919
it uh on a professional scale

1517
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:42,119
right I I agree with that absolutely

1518
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:45,000
Sasha so it's uh you are also developed

1519
01:12:42,119 --> 01:12:48,039
the the the light yeah you said the the

1520
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:51,000
one the hoods that look like uh like uh

1521
01:12:48,039 --> 01:12:54,158
flowers right what what is going on in

1522
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:56,560
Slovenia my understanding is that a lot

1523
01:12:54,158 --> 01:12:59,679
of the German companies like as I said

1524
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:02,719
ger Medical in particular has operations

1525
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:06,079
that they're developing there uh because

1526
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:08,840
you guys I guess have a lot better at

1527
01:13:06,079 --> 01:13:12,000
legal atmosphere than the Germans

1528
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:14,520
do um you know if if we are talking

1529
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,000
about Canabis Research or cannabis you

1530
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:20,280
know in development of what we because

1531
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:24,158
cannabis is still very much controlled

1532
01:13:20,279 --> 01:13:26,920
and illegal in Slovenia right yeah so uh

1533
01:13:24,158 --> 01:13:29,559
the the truth about this also is but it

1534
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:31,840
will be very soon change the law the law

1535
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:34,480
will be changed very soon even tonight I

1536
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:37,920
think now in this time there is an on

1537
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:40,279
national TV there is a uh they will show

1538
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:43,480
a report about it that uh they will put

1539
01:13:40,279 --> 01:13:45,960
a law into place now that small scale

1540
01:13:43,479 --> 01:13:49,158
growing will be allowed at for home

1541
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:52,198
Growers like German model now but this

1542
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:53,799
is a step to to to decriminalize it we

1543
01:13:52,198 --> 01:13:55,960
we say decriminalization not

1544
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:59,320
legalization cuz legality means

1545
01:13:55,960 --> 01:14:01,639
something else right you know uh but

1546
01:13:59,319 --> 01:14:05,399
this is step into the the right

1547
01:14:01,639 --> 01:14:08,679
directions yeah definitely I I I I love

1548
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:11,119
I love the model of growing of people

1549
01:14:08,679 --> 01:14:14,279
being able to grow for themselves I I

1550
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:17,519
think at least here in the United States

1551
01:14:14,279 --> 01:14:20,158
and perhaps in Europe as well that the

1552
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:22,480
pa the for the path forward for people

1553
01:14:20,158 --> 01:14:24,319
who want to grow I one I think green

1554
01:14:22,479 --> 01:14:27,559
Rush is dead you're not I don't think

1555
01:14:24,319 --> 01:14:30,079
anyone is going to get rich in a year or

1556
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:33,960
two growing but for the people who love

1557
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:36,719
ganja who want to grow who like to grow

1558
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:39,158
I think that the way forward is ready to

1559
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:41,960
flowers I think that people who really

1560
01:14:39,158 --> 01:14:43,799
know what they're doing should grow

1561
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:46,399
properly tended plants to the point

1562
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:49,039
where they're ready to flower and then

1563
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:51,638
we sell them to people to finish in

1564
01:14:49,039 --> 01:14:53,479
their own home so they've got that last

1565
01:14:51,639 --> 01:14:56,199
stretch they don't have to deal with

1566
01:14:53,479 --> 01:14:58,678
bugs coming in they've got a plant that

1567
01:14:56,198 --> 01:15:01,919
they know when they bought it was ready

1568
01:14:58,679 --> 01:15:04,719
to flower and was a clean plant they

1569
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:07,480
they follow the recipe they get what

1570
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:09,119
they want we had a great idea for like

1571
01:15:07,479 --> 01:15:12,000
so I I helped manage a farm here in

1572
01:15:09,119 --> 01:15:15,479
Oregon and we had a great idea if if

1573
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:18,560
there was a available cannabis tourism

1574
01:15:15,479 --> 01:15:21,079
to have people out to the farm showcase

1575
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:23,520
100 to 150 different strains in both

1576
01:15:21,079 --> 01:15:25,198
outdoor and indoor settings and be able

1577
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:27,400
to sell them the Clones of it so that

1578
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:29,399
they know what they can look for as the

1579
01:15:27,399 --> 01:15:32,439
plant flowers out and give them that

1580
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:34,638
sort of uh interactive experience where

1581
01:15:32,439 --> 01:15:36,599
they know what to do and how to do it

1582
01:15:34,639 --> 01:15:38,520
and then also have some recourse to be

1583
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:41,039
able to come to those people who are

1584
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:43,000
professional Growers and get advice on

1585
01:15:41,039 --> 01:15:45,000
their home grows so that they can have

1586
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:47,719
clean medicine that they made for

1587
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:51,560
themselves my my concern there on the

1588
01:15:47,719 --> 01:15:54,960
visits is every time you get

1589
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:57,679
any any additional visitor is a PO

1590
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:59,679
potential Nexus for problems you're

1591
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:01,600
absolutely right it would have to be

1592
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:03,920
with a lot of security and scrutiny

1593
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:06,960
that's the big problem there but where I

1594
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:08,800
see I'm I'm right on that page with you

1595
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:13,239
one of the things that I would like to

1596
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:17,440
do is offer grow yourself kits with a

1597
01:16:13,238 --> 01:16:20,399
voucher right you take that voucher to a

1598
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:23,359
state licensed Nursery to get your

1599
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:26,238
plants when you bought that kit one of

1600
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:30,319
the things you would be buying would be

1601
01:16:26,238 --> 01:16:34,119
you can call up who you who you bought

1602
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:37,439

1603
01:16:34,119 --> 01:16:39,800
helpline look right here's your phone

1604

1605

1606
01:16:43,279 --> 01:16:48,039

1607
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:49,600
experience to help you we we're going to

1608
01:16:48,039 --> 01:16:52,198

01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,199

okay I want to sleep I'm not doing

1611
01:16:55,198 --> 01:17:01,158
24hour s Tech I'm not patient enough but

1612
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:04,840
I do know I mean I actually have about

1613
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:06,879
eight people that if that ever happens

1614
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:09,199
have said yeah they would consider being

1615
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:12,760
a part of that that I think are at an

1616
01:17:09,198 --> 01:17:15,079
expertise level that I could rely I

1617
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:16,960
would feel confident that if I was

1618
01:17:15,079 --> 01:17:19,279
someone in that position I could call

1619
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:21,840
them and know that the advice I was

1620
01:17:19,279 --> 01:17:25,279
getting was

1621
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:27,840
valid you know I think that we need to

1622
01:17:25,279 --> 01:17:32,519
see more customer service more customer

1623
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:34,560
education more consumer education and we

1624
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:38,400
need to remember where where this comes

1625
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:41,440
from Cannabis is a gift cannabis is a

1626
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:45,198
blessing cannabis is not a

1627
01:17:41,439 --> 01:17:46,879
cpg to make millionaires richer with I

1628
01:17:45,198 --> 01:17:49,359
mean it's fine if it does that as long

1629
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:50,880
as everyone who needs it gets it and

1630
01:17:49,359 --> 01:17:54,479
everyone who wants to grow it can grow

1631
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:56,119
it like Bob Marley said legal like Bob

1632
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:58,638
Marley said it's a

1633
01:17:56,119 --> 01:18:00,079
plant yeah it's a plant you shouldn't be

1634
01:17:58,639 --> 01:18:04,480
you shouldn't be able to make a plant

1635
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:06,639
illegal no it doesn't make sense no is

1636

against any nature you know you cannot

1637
01:18:06,639 --> 01:18:11,679
be against nature you know that is like

1638
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:15,039
you know it's a a contradiction in

1639
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:16,880
itself you know how how can it be that

1640
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:20,000
we are against and we are against it in

1641
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:22,560

1672
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:44,279
[ __ ] I found the way it took me over a

1673
01:19:42,679 --> 01:19:47,800
year before I could get those same kind

1674
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:51,519
of results again one thing after another

1675
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:55,079
mes uh let me see mites mites

1676
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:58,040
again uh rot

1677
01:19:55,079 --> 01:20:00,439
pretty much it's like like when I'm when

1678
01:19:58,039 --> 01:20:03,319
I'm offering consulting services to

1679
01:20:00,439 --> 01:20:07,839
someone I like to say everything that go

1680
01:20:03,319 --> 01:20:11,399
wrong I've had happen so you can get the

1681
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:14,800
benefit of my trial and errors without

1682
01:20:11,399 --> 01:20:16,599
having to go through them yourself and

1683
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:20,719
everything that could happen did to keep

1684
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:23,840
it from happening but then about a year

1685
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:25,359
later the job that was my regular job

1686
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:28,639
which was working a beer and wine

1687
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:30,519
Warehouse sort of fell apart on me and

1688
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:32,880
Kevin the owner of hydrotech said well

1689
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:34,560
why don't you come work for me cuz I'd

1690
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,920
been selling gear every time I was in

1691
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:41,840
the store

1692
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:43,560
anyways and um so I said okay and now

1693
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:45,920
you're right I did skip over part of it

1694
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:48,320
Kevin Bon is the was the owner of a

1695
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:53,239
company called hydrotech which was one

1696
01:20:48,319 --> 01:20:56,639
of the first two hy/ Grow shops in

1697
01:20:53,238 --> 01:20:56,638
Seattle uh

1698
01:20:57,319 --> 01:21:04,119
Kevin is brilliant Kevin had been

1699
01:21:01,039 --> 01:21:07,158
writing a column in cmia tips magazine

1700
01:21:04,119 --> 01:21:09,519
called The Farmer in the sky for I think

1701
01:21:07,158 --> 01:21:11,960
he'd written it for let's see I think he

1702
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:17,880
wrote In Spring 82 and I think he wrote

1703
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:21,399
The Fall 82 one and then winter

1704
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:26,560
82 I started writing with Kevin we wrote

1705
01:21:21,399 --> 01:21:26,559
The Farmer in the sky column from

1706
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:37,320
1982 until operation green well no

1707
01:21:31,639 --> 01:21:39,920
until winter 88 Edition CIA tips itself

1708
01:21:37,319 --> 01:21:43,519
the full name is Cia tips domestic

1709
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:47,000
Growers journal for those who don't know

1710
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:48,440
was the online Growers Forum before

1711
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:53,439
there was an

1712
01:21:48,439 --> 01:21:55,319
online CIA tips was what High Times

1713
01:21:53,439 --> 01:21:57,399
would have liked to be

1714
01:21:55,319 --> 01:22:00,479
because it was all about growing

1715
01:21:57,399 --> 01:22:03,799
cannabis that was it it it wasn't off

1716
01:22:00,479 --> 01:22:06,198
into other it wasn't off into how to

1717
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:08,760
free base it wasn't off into selling

1718
01:22:06,198 --> 01:22:11,919
gear for free basing it was strictly

1719
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:14,119
about growing and did High Times talk

1720
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:17,359
about free basing and how to free base

1721
01:22:14,119 --> 01:22:18,359
yes I've I had never seen that I I think

1722
01:22:17,359 --> 01:22:20,920
that might have been something that was

1723
01:22:18,359 --> 01:22:24,119
earlier in the'80s but don't do that

1724
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:25,600
anymore go take a look at High Times uh

1725
01:22:24,119 --> 01:22:29,960
from

1726
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:32,520
um about 19 well let's see I would say

1727
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:34,239
the early the very last part of the 70s

1728
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:37,719
early part of the

1729
01:22:34,238 --> 01:22:41,119
80s maybe even the mid 70s you you've

1730
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:43,840
got it's like they became a a lifestyle

1731
01:22:41,119 --> 01:22:46,719
magazine and it was just all drug

1732
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:50,639
lifestyle they were selling AED pseudo

1733
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:53,399
aedin pills on the inside back cover to

1734
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:56,359
for people to make ba uh make meth from

1735
01:22:53,399 --> 01:22:58,920
um or sell as counterfeits they sort of

1736
01:22:56,359 --> 01:23:02,279
lost their way for a while I will say

1737
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:05,520
that Steve Hagar probably saved that

1738
01:23:02,279 --> 01:23:07,599
magazine by bringing it back and and

1739
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:09,920
when when green Merchant happened they

1740
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:13,079
gave him free reain and I I believe that

1741
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:17,440
Steve Hagar is

1742
01:23:13,079 --> 01:23:20,119
why uh High Time survived but um it was

1743
01:23:17,439 --> 01:23:22,039
never the grow magazine since Mia tips

1744
01:23:20,119 --> 01:23:24,800
was Tom

1745
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:27,359
Alexander the the publisher of of since

1746
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:31,000

01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:41,239
with zero tolerance happening and debate

1750
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:42,960
legalization with a DEA agent on Heraldo

1751
01:23:41,238 --> 01:23:47,519

1752
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:51,079
was he was a very popular um moderator

1753
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:52,800
had a show called Nightline I think or

1754
01:23:51,079 --> 01:23:54,559
or maybe it was just the Heraldo Rivera

1755
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:57,360
show I think it was called the Heraldo

1756
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:59,239
Vera show okay but I me please tell the

1757
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:01,639
story cuz this is something that I'm not

1758
01:23:59,238 --> 01:24:04,839
familiar with Tom

1759
01:24:01,639 --> 01:24:06,760
Alexander excuse me Tom Alexander went

1760
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:09,000
on the Heraldo Rivera show and debated

1761
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:10,079
him oh yeah oh yeah and debated I wonder

1762
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,760
if that's something that we could still

1763
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:16,639
find online I'll bet you probably could

1764
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:18,960
on D on the the AR excuse me on the

1765
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:21,400
archives and I I know you're your

1766
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:24,039

1770
01:24:28,319 --> 01:24:32,759
Tom debating Heraldo Rivera because that

1771
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:35,880
sounds like a great story well I mean

1772
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:39,560
basically it was just Tom was presenting

1773
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:43,279
common logic and the DEA guy was

1774
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:45,639
presenting anti-pot hysteria not as bad

1775
01:24:43,279 --> 01:24:47,800
as when the DEA agent or when the Bureau

1776
01:24:45,639 --> 01:24:49,960
of Narcotics and Dangerous Drug agents

1777
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:52,119
testified that when he tried marijuana

1778
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:54,920
he turned into an owl and flew around

1779
01:24:52,118 --> 01:24:56,439
the room but

1780
01:24:54,920 --> 01:25:01,000
that was actually

1781
01:24:56,439 --> 01:25:04,479
testimony a DEA agent said this me

1782
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:06,800
funny but he was talking about cannabis

1783
01:25:04,479 --> 01:25:08,839
not LSD right right maybe he was a

1784
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:11,159
little confused no I mean that's the

1785
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:13,960
thing this this was like back the the

1786
01:25:11,158 --> 01:25:18,920
what I'm talking about bndd comes in in

1787
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:21,800
like 71 replaces or DEA replaces bndd

1788
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:26,000
and three or four other federal agencies

1789
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:29,360
so BND was DEA before DEA was DEA and it

1790
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:31,719
was one of it was a bndd agent who said

1791
01:25:29,359 --> 01:25:33,519
he tried it and he turned into an owl

1792
01:25:31,719 --> 01:25:36,279
and flew around the

1793
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:38,480
room man if if that would work I would I

1794
01:25:36,279 --> 01:25:41,800
would love that let me try love be an

1795
01:25:38,479 --> 01:25:43,079
I'd love to be an owl exactly and to fly

1796
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:45,079
it's like the old pot commercial where

1797
01:25:43,079 --> 01:25:46,840
you melt into the couch and you're like

1798
01:25:45,079 --> 01:25:51,039
where can I find that

1799
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:52,800
weed oh I i' I've I've had pot like that

1800
01:25:51,039 --> 01:25:56,000
in the past

1801
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:58,360
year but you've never turned into an owl

1802
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:01,920
I have never turned into an

1803
01:25:58,359 --> 01:26:06,319
owl I melted through a wall on LSD once

1804
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:10,560
but who knows that's pretty exciting uh

1805
01:26:06,319 --> 01:26:13,960
The Beatles movie Let It Be was World

1806
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:16,400
Tri for the first time in

1807
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:17,960
1971 and it didn't it didn't get made

1808
01:26:16,399 --> 01:26:19,960
for three or four more years but they

1809
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:21,480
did it at Carver Auditorium and I melted

1810
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:23,920
through the wall I didn't have the money

1811
01:26:21,479 --> 01:26:26,279
but I ended up inside the concert and I

1812
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:28,239
my life as cont his memory was okay if I

1813
01:26:26,279 --> 01:26:30,319
get my if I can get my molecules to

1814
01:26:28,238 --> 01:26:33,000
vibrate at the same rate as the wall I

1815
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:35,079
can pass through it I don't know how I

1816
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:37,800
got there but I did

1817
01:26:35,079 --> 01:26:41,880
so maybe you

1818
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:45,119
could because well uh going back see a

1819
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:49,039
green tell us send some your tips okay

1820
01:26:45,118 --> 01:26:51,039
so Kevin writes for S of me a tips and

1821
01:26:49,039 --> 01:26:53,359
when I and I when I start going in as a

1822
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:55,560
customer eventually even before I got

1823
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:58,960
hired I'm helping him edit what he's

1824
01:26:55,560 --> 01:27:01,280
doing and helping him not put some

1825
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:02,840
ridiculous [ __ ] in it there was one

1826
01:27:01,279 --> 01:27:04,399
issue where he said if someone's

1827
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:06,119
knocking at your door and they claim

1828
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:08,399
they're the police hold a gun on them

1829
01:27:06,118 --> 01:27:10,399
until they show you their warrant I got

1830
01:27:08,399 --> 01:27:14,359
him to take that out think about what

1831
01:27:10,399 --> 01:27:17,439
the effects of that would have been okay

1832
01:27:14,359 --> 01:27:19,880
good editing a genius but but not not

1833
01:27:17,439 --> 01:27:23,198
always totally

1834
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:26,039
logical or sensible but you know we

1835
01:27:23,198 --> 01:27:29,599
start writing together and we we worked

1836
01:27:26,039 --> 01:27:32,519
well together as as The Farmer in the

1837
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:36,000
sky we introduced the world to the

1838
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:39,440
concept of sealed room growing it took a

1839
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:42,238
little while before they came up with um

1840
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:44,279
mini splits that made real sealed room

1841
01:27:42,238 --> 01:27:46,839
growing possible the the through the

1842
01:27:44,279 --> 01:27:50,840
wall air conditioners you always lost

1843
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:52,800
some uh we came up with when was that

1844
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:54,560
that oh God that would is there is there

1845
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:59,600
an article that you wrote on SE room

1846
01:27:54,560 --> 01:28:03,080
growing yeah on uh in in the uh in I

1847
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:06,679
believe it would be probably the fall

1848
01:28:03,079 --> 01:28:09,600
issue fall 85 issue because what turned

1849
01:28:06,679 --> 01:28:12,520
me what got me thinking about it was I

1850
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:15,320
went down to the National normal

1851
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:17,040
conference in DC in ' 85 and there were

1852
01:28:15,319 --> 01:28:19,158
three vendors there was me trying to

1853
01:28:17,039 --> 01:28:22,840
introduce growing endur for Fun and

1854
01:28:19,158 --> 01:28:25,679
Profit Kevin and I book uh there was

1855
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:27,920
Jack herrer that was when I met Jack he

1856
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:30,359
was there to introduce the emperor wears

1857
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:32,000
no clothes his book did a little better

1858
01:28:30,359 --> 01:28:35,079
than ours

1859
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:38,840
uh and Jeffrey

1860
01:28:35,079 --> 01:28:41,000
J and Jeffrey Julian DeMarco was there

1861
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:44,159
to show the

1862
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,760
Phototron and I looked at the Phototron

1863
01:28:44,158 --> 01:28:47,960
and while I didn't I was totally

1864
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:50,280
unimpressed with the lighting and I

1865
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:54,639
thought the execution left a lot to be

1866
01:28:50,279 --> 01:28:57,559
desired the concept made sense constant

1867
01:28:54,639 --> 01:29:00,600
fresh air all the light the plant can

1868
01:28:57,560 --> 01:29:04,080
use steadily delivering nutrients do it

1869
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:08,239
on room size and that was and I'd

1870
01:29:04,079 --> 01:29:11,760
already done that but not to the extent

1871
01:29:08,238 --> 01:29:14,479
that okay it works try it it works we

1872
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:18,600
wrote about it in I'm reasonably sure it

1873
01:29:14,479 --> 01:29:20,198
was the fall or winter 85 issue I've got

1874
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:23,679
a full collection I I'll look them up

1875
01:29:20,198 --> 01:29:26,638
I'll gab I'll send you an index of every

1876
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:29,039
Farm in the sky article and what or

1877
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:30,960
column and what the subjects were I I

1878
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:34,118
want to check that out you know not to

1879
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:37,480
uh to steal the light for a second

1880
01:29:34,118 --> 01:29:40,079
but I wrote for the growing Edge

1881
01:29:37,479 --> 01:29:42,439
magazine and I wrote an article that I

1882
01:29:40,079 --> 01:29:46,639
titled to vent or not to

1883
01:29:42,439 --> 01:29:49,238
vent yes okay and that was and honestly

1884
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:52,639
at that point I had never heard of

1885
01:29:49,238 --> 01:29:54,718
cannabis being grown in a sealed room

1886
01:29:52,639 --> 01:29:57,639
environment and I mean I knew it was

1887
01:29:54,719 --> 01:30:00,118
being done because at the time they were

1888
01:29:57,639 --> 01:30:02,719
growing in the space station and I said

1889
01:30:00,118 --> 01:30:06,679
well you know you can't grow in the

1890
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:10,079
space station and vent that's so so I I

1891
01:30:06,679 --> 01:30:11,960
so I I knew it was being done and I

1892
01:30:10,079 --> 01:30:16,118
started growing sealed room environment

1893
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:18,679
at that time but i' I'd never read about

1894
01:30:16,118 --> 01:30:21,719
it anywhere being done in cannabis so

1895
01:30:18,679 --> 01:30:24,118
now I'm getting my uh reality check that

1896
01:30:21,719 --> 01:30:26,840
you know over 15 years earlier you

1897
01:30:24,118 --> 01:30:29,399
discussing it with people oh it it's and

1898
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:33,000
and we see people don't realize just how

1899
01:30:29,399 --> 01:30:35,638
much green Merchant knocked all of the

1900
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:38,719
development of cannabis growing back

1901
01:30:35,639 --> 01:30:40,199
yeah some of it went to Holland but I

1902
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:43,039
was starting to talk about things we

1903
01:30:40,198 --> 01:30:45,000
introduced as The Farmer in the sky

1904
01:30:43,039 --> 01:30:48,600
first time we wrote about sea of green

1905
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:53,520
was as The Farmer in the sky um first

1906
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:56,880
time and F first time uh when when we

1907
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:59,800
came up with a device that would prevent

1908
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:02,639
you from adding CO2 from tanks or

1909
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:05,039
burners while you were venting or

1910
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:07,880
venting while you were adding CO2 we

1911
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:09,639
came up the F just a relay switch it was

1912
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:13,319
neck and neck this one's on this one's

1913
01:31:09,639 --> 01:31:15,600
off right us and green Air were neck and

1914
01:31:13,319 --> 01:31:18,118
neck on that one I'm pretty sure we were

1915
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:21,079
first but they might have been a little

1916
01:31:18,118 --> 01:31:24,039
ahead it it was I'm pretty sure we were

1917
01:31:21,079 --> 01:31:25,319
first uh we wrote about something called

1918
01:31:24,039 --> 01:31:28,399
organic

1919
01:31:25,319 --> 01:31:32,000
Hydroponics we had never heard the word

1920
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:32,000
it's also nowadays it's called

1921
01:31:32,118 --> 01:31:39,479
aquaponics the first article offering a

1922
01:31:36,359 --> 01:31:44,559
practical way to supplement

1923
01:31:39,479 --> 01:31:48,599
UV appears in the February 1986 issue of

1924
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:52,480
High Times author The Farmer in the sky

1925
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:54,480
um the first paraboloid not true not

1926
01:31:52,479 --> 01:31:57,479
true parabolic

1927
01:31:54,479 --> 01:31:59,158
not true Parabola but paraboloid because

1928
01:31:57,479 --> 01:32:02,079
it actually spreads out a little more at

1929
01:31:59,158 --> 01:32:04,879
the bottom to get more width we came up

1930
01:32:02,079 --> 01:32:09,679
with uh God I think we had the first one

1931
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:13,199
in 82 or 83 and uh then poot P who now

1932
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:15,920
do businesses PL Lighting swooped in and

1933
01:32:13,198 --> 01:32:18,238
took that same shape for the inside of

1934
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:21,000
their reflectors they put uh housing on

1935
01:32:18,238 --> 01:32:23,599
the outside but that that that shape

1936
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:26,158
they then swooped in on uh then the next

1937
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:30,320
people that were doing it in our

1938
01:32:26,158 --> 01:32:32,000
industry was Sunlight Supply or M&amp;R um

1939
01:32:30,319 --> 01:32:36,238
not Diamond

1940
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:39,600
lights on on the paraboloids no diamond

1941
01:32:36,238 --> 01:32:43,198
was still using cones at that point and

1942
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:45,719
and Diamond was in business as far as I

1943
01:32:43,198 --> 01:32:47,759
know Steve Murphy was the first one

1944
01:32:45,719 --> 01:32:50,880
selling halides and

1945
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:54,119
sodiums uh into the what came to be

1946
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:56,760
called the hydroponic Market that always

1947
01:32:54,118 --> 01:32:58,679
made me crazy it bothered me that back

1948
01:32:56,760 --> 01:33:01,039
back before yir and I started getting

1949
01:32:58,679 --> 01:33:03,319
along it bothered me that he would refer

1950
01:33:01,039 --> 01:33:05,679
to what we do as Hydroponics and what

1951
01:33:03,319 --> 01:33:08,039
they were selling into as

1952
01:33:05,679 --> 01:33:09,840
agriculture as if they as if what we

1953
01:33:08,039 --> 01:33:12,238
were weren't wasn't an agricultural

1954
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:14,039
industry now we get along really good he

1955
01:33:12,238 --> 01:33:15,279
he got me out of a mess a while back

1956
01:33:14,039 --> 01:33:20,399
he's good

1957
01:33:15,279 --> 01:33:24,359
people yeah I like that yeah um God

1958
01:33:20,399 --> 01:33:27,879
sorry scattered again no worries but uh

1959
01:33:24,359 --> 01:33:30,639
so let's see paraboloid reflectors oh uh

1960
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:33,560
the the first ceramic the the salt mix

1961
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:37,239
that eventually got used in the first

1962
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:41,800
dedicated ceramic metal halides was what

1963
01:33:37,238 --> 01:33:44,718
was originally in the osram optimar

1964
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:47,079
which uh we were the first I was the

1965
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:49,679
first one as far as I know to use it for

1966
01:33:47,079 --> 01:33:52,319
growing cannabis under we wrote about

1967
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:55,560
that same with the the lamp I mentioned

1968
01:33:52,319 --> 01:33:58,880
earlier the the brid GE Ultra

1969
01:33:55,560 --> 01:34:01,880
highpressure sodium SL Hilux ceramic

1970
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:05,359
highpressure sodium

1971
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:08,679
Hilux is another one of the cmia tip

1972
01:34:05,359 --> 01:34:10,439
things um I as I've said and you'll hear

1973
01:34:08,679 --> 01:34:15,158
me say it again because I repeat myself

1974
01:34:10,439 --> 01:34:18,439
a lot um I am a pot geek and a lighting

1975
01:34:15,158 --> 01:34:21,000
freak I used to stand around reading

1976
01:34:18,439 --> 01:34:23,719
lighting engineering bulletins to keep

1977
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:26,560
myself entertained between customers

1978
01:34:23,719 --> 01:34:30,760
coming in so one day I'm reading this

1979
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:33,360
bulletin and here is a lamp that I can

1980
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:36,800
run off a Halli ballast but it's a

1981
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:41,079
sodium lamp no big deal

1982
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:45,440
nowadays back then you had halide

1983
01:34:41,079 --> 01:34:49,399
ballasts sodium ballast halide sockets

1984
01:34:45,439 --> 01:34:52,319
sodium sockets we started out I I'll

1985
01:34:49,399 --> 01:34:55,118
start a little ways into it halides then

1986
01:34:52,319 --> 01:34:58,279
you did then later was halides followed

1987
01:34:55,118 --> 01:35:01,279
by sodiums then it was halides and

1988
01:34:58,279 --> 01:35:04,279
sodiums at the same time adding more

1989
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:07,599
sodium during flower and maybe pulling

1990
01:35:04,279 --> 01:35:10,800
halides out and then at the very

1991
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:12,760
end of hid people started putting

1992
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:15,199
halides in again for the last two weeks

1993
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:15,199
to get the

1994
01:35:15,479 --> 01:35:21,638
blue all of

1995
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:24,119
these used to have their own B like I

1996
01:35:21,639 --> 01:35:26,319
said sodium or H and didn't have the

1997
01:35:24,118 --> 01:35:28,279
same eventually they made a switchable

1998
01:35:26,319 --> 01:35:31,880
ballast basically it just brought an

1999
01:35:28,279 --> 01:35:34,840
igniter into the circuit um but at that

2000
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:37,760
point we didn't have those there weren't

2001
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:41,079
dual ballast there was one or the other

2002
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:43,400
but here was this lamp that I knew I

2003
01:35:41,079 --> 01:35:46,118
could sell a zillion of if it worked as

2004
01:35:43,399 --> 01:35:49,118
well as a standard sodium and I could

2005
01:35:46,118 --> 01:35:52,359
screw it onto a into a Halli socket run

2006
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:56,000
it on a Halli Ballance oh yeah so I

2007
01:35:52,359 --> 01:35:59,238
tried it I I took me it took me 6 months

2008
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:02,800
and going the LA people didn't want they

2009
01:35:59,238 --> 01:36:04,399
they would sell us lamps of types they

2010
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:08,360
already had but they didn't want to

2011
01:36:04,399 --> 01:36:10,279
order a new lamp in for our Market I

2012
01:36:08,359 --> 01:36:11,920
mean they knew who we were selling to

2013
01:36:10,279 --> 01:36:13,319
they but you know they could pretend

2014
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:15,960
that they weren't do you think it was

2015
01:36:13,319 --> 01:36:17,599
just because the market was small it

2016
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:18,960
could also be because it was just very

2017
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:21,119
small Market at that I don't think it

2018
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:22,800
was because it was Cannabis but cuz when

2019
01:36:21,118 --> 01:36:24,920
you think about how many lights they

2020
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:28,000
were selling to the street light market

2021
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:29,800
and to to all the other stuff Canabis at

2022
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:33,439
this point was still just a very small

2023
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:34,320
part of it oh yeah but it was still I

2024
01:36:33,439 --> 01:36:38,238
mean

2025
01:36:34,319 --> 01:36:41,359
it it here was this I tried it and I got

2026
01:36:38,238 --> 01:36:43,919
them how I got them to how I got the LA

2027
01:36:41,359 --> 01:36:47,118
wholesaler who had sent me the bulletin

2028
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:50,199
to carry these lamps was a friend of

2029
01:36:47,118 --> 01:36:52,759
mine I I asked around among my friends

2030
01:36:50,198 --> 01:36:55,678
and turned out I knew someone who is

2031
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:58,840
familiar with kanji which is the formal

2032
01:36:55,679 --> 01:37:00,960
Japanese writing style and I started

2033
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:03,639
writing I I would write letters have him

2034
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:07,158
translate them and we sent them to the

2035
01:37:03,639 --> 01:37:09,079
parent company which was I wasaki who

2036
01:37:07,158 --> 01:37:11,839
now are

2037
01:37:09,079 --> 01:37:16,519
IAS uh in some parts of the

2038
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:21,000
world but I finally got them to send the

2039
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:23,840
LA distributor a sixpack of these lamps

2040
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:25,639
took 6 months to do tried them freaking

2041
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:27,760
loved them they were a sodium except I

2042
01:37:25,639 --> 01:37:30,480
could run them on allies they were great

2043
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:30,480
we wrote about

2044
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:35,719
them they were really really popular

2045
01:37:33,158 --> 01:37:39,359
people started asking well does does

2046
01:37:35,719 --> 01:37:42,399
iwasaki make halides I can check yeah

2047
01:37:39,359 --> 01:37:45,880
they do do they make regular sodiums

2048
01:37:42,399 --> 01:37:48,039
yeah they do so now we're selling a

2049
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:50,599
bunch of it

2050
01:37:48,039 --> 01:37:54,719
wasaki the uh that original conversion

2051
01:37:50,599 --> 01:37:59,000
lamp was called the I wasaki I 940 right

2052
01:37:54,719 --> 01:38:00,639
it was 940 Watts not 1,000 yep and so

2053
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:02,238
those lights the whole thing with this

2054
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:04,599
light though is that you could basically

2055
01:38:02,238 --> 01:38:07,559
just swap the bulb out rather than put

2056
01:38:04,599 --> 01:38:09,119
the pull the whole fixture down yep yeah

2057
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:11,520
Didn't They also make like a

2058
01:38:09,118 --> 01:38:13,759
360 I think they all they would they

2059
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:15,920
made one like that too I believe later

2060
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:18,599
on was like it was like to fit in a 400

2061
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:22,440
watt fixture yeah

2062
01:38:18,599 --> 01:38:24,360
but but so people started buying these

2063
01:38:22,439 --> 01:38:26,359
and they became

2064
01:38:24,359 --> 01:38:30,158
it never picked up quite like the IAS

2065
01:38:26,359 --> 01:38:32,399
940 while I was still in it and I went

2066
01:38:30,158 --> 01:38:36,598
away for 15 years in

2067
01:38:32,399 --> 01:38:39,279
1989 we'll we'll get to that too

2068
01:38:36,599 --> 01:38:42,800
um but when I come back there's a new

2069
01:38:39,279 --> 01:38:44,359
company selling lights selling lamps

2070
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:47,480
their name is

2071
01:38:44,359 --> 01:38:49,479
Hilux that's how Hilux entered

2072
01:38:47,479 --> 01:38:51,799
Horticultural lighting for the first

2073
01:38:49,479 --> 01:38:54,238
time in their corporate

2074
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:56,679
history they they had even been selling

2075
01:38:54,238 --> 01:38:59,879
their standard lamps into horiculture

2076
01:38:56,679 --> 01:39:01,679
prior to that wow so I was disappointed

2077
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:04,199
to see them go a couple years ago

2078
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:05,118
because I have a lot of heart attachment

2079
01:39:04,198 --> 01:39:08,198
to

2080
01:39:05,118 --> 01:39:10,158
them plus I think their daylight blue Hy

2081
01:39:08,198 --> 01:39:13,960
was vastly

2082
01:39:10,158 --> 01:39:13,960
underrated they work really

2083
01:39:14,238 --> 01:39:19,718
good

2084
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:25,320
um let's see so the we brought hortilux

2085
01:39:19,719 --> 01:39:30,560
into it ceramic metal HED ceramic

2086
01:39:25,319 --> 01:39:33,880
uh ceramic so ceramic high-press sodium

2087
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:36,400
uh we introduced looking at Molasses I

2088
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:39,480
went well well if that works so well

2089
01:39:36,399 --> 01:39:41,719
wouldn't completely raw evaporated cane

2090
01:39:39,479 --> 01:39:44,839
juice work like not any heat just the

2091
01:39:41,719 --> 01:39:48,000
original basically plant blood dry plant

2092
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:50,000
blood wrote about that as a rejuvenant a

2093
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,319
lot of people still don't know about

2094
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:55,599
that it kicks ass you mix it with a

2095
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:58,238
little bit of vitamin B one you you have

2096
01:39:55,599 --> 01:40:01,599
a phenomenal rejuvenant for recovering

2097
01:39:58,238 --> 01:40:04,000
from say you had bugs it comes back from

2098
01:40:01,599 --> 01:40:07,719
it really good but you said vitamin B1

2099
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:11,279
and cane sugar yeah evaporated cane

2100
01:40:07,719 --> 01:40:15,960
juice not not not like turbinado but

2101
01:40:11,279 --> 01:40:19,719
actually evaporated Sun evaporated cane

2102
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:21,399
juice phenomenal stuff and and I I know

2103
01:40:19,719 --> 01:40:23,639
now that what it does you're not feeding

2104
01:40:21,399 --> 01:40:25,479
the plant what you're doing is you're

2105
01:40:23,639 --> 01:40:27,440
supercharging the feeding that you're

2106
01:40:25,479 --> 01:40:29,759
giving your microbes so you're feeding

2107
01:40:27,439 --> 01:40:33,879
your soil really well it just is a way

2108
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:36,760
to up it um we wrote about what would

2109
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:39,880
become called aquaponics as organic

2110
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:44,480
Hydroponics we wrote about

2111
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:46,840
um we wrote as as esparanza goo we wrote

2112
01:40:44,479 --> 01:40:49,559
and I love this one we wrote an AATA

2113
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:51,440
page for the Anarchist Cookbook because

2114
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:53,560
anyone using the Anarchist Cookbook

2115
01:40:51,439 --> 01:40:56,079
recipes had a really good chance of

2116
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:58,199
blowings to hell because there were a

2117
01:40:56,079 --> 01:40:59,479
lot of we think it might have been

2118
01:40:58,198 --> 01:41:02,079
deliberate

2119
01:40:59,479 --> 01:41:05,000
disinformation but we corrected it and

2120
01:41:02,079 --> 01:41:07,599
and put out an aat on that as asiran and

2121
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:10,639
G do just to warn people um God what are

2122
01:41:07,599 --> 01:41:13,079
some of the others sea of green plantlet

2123
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:16,279
we were the first ones to put that name

2124
01:41:13,079 --> 01:41:20,198
on that style of growing as far as I

2125
01:41:16,279 --> 01:41:22,599
know uh the first time I ever saw a

2126
01:41:20,198 --> 01:41:23,799
method the method was around before the

2127
01:41:22,599 --> 01:41:26,719
name was

2128
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:30,480
uh called Perpetual Harvest was when we

2129
01:41:26,719 --> 01:41:32,679
put that name on it in the column uh I

2130
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:35,678
believe that would be

2131
01:41:32,679 --> 01:41:35,679
1983

2132
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:44,960
um God there there's more I I always

2133
01:41:39,599 --> 01:41:46,760
remember all this stuff later um hoods

2134
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:49,560
lamps

2135
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:52,239
feeding method you talked about sea of

2136
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:56,239
green but you didn't talk about scrog

2137
01:41:52,238 --> 01:41:59,479
screen of okay scog comes later on uh

2138
01:41:56,238 --> 01:42:03,279
October 26th of

2139
01:41:59,479 --> 01:42:05,638
1989 the warrants the indictments in

2140
01:42:03,279 --> 01:42:09,840
operate in Phase One of operation green

2141
01:42:05,639 --> 01:42:13,760
Merchant are unsealed they bust 63 Grow

2142
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:16,800
shops in 48 states they arrest 20 200

2143
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:19,840
and some people the person arrested for

2144
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:23,159
the highest plant count in Phase One of

2145
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:27,440
operation green Merchant was me I was

2146
01:42:23,158 --> 01:42:30,719
orally indicted for 12,000 plus plants

2147
01:42:27,439 --> 01:42:32,839
eventually they let me plead down to

2148
01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:36,079
only

2149
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:39,400
3,999 now this was a huge difference

2150
01:42:36,079 --> 01:42:43,118
over 4,000 I was looking at a mandatory

2151
01:42:39,399 --> 01:42:45,879
minimum 10 year over 10,000 was it over

2152
01:42:43,118 --> 01:42:47,319
5,000 yeah over 10,000 a mandatory

2153
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:51,199
minimum

2154
01:42:47,319 --> 01:42:54,639
20 those were pretty ugly now what had

2155
01:42:51,198 --> 01:42:57,519
happened is in

2156
01:42:54,639 --> 01:43:01,319
2017 they had changed the sentencing

2157
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:04,800
guidelines for cultivation of cannabis

2158
01:43:01,319 --> 01:43:11,599
each plant for purposes of sentencing

2159
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:15,320
was regarded as a kilo as of November 17

2160
01:43:11,599 --> 01:43:17,679
1987 before that it was 100 gr what I

2161
01:43:15,319 --> 01:43:22,279
got for pleading

2162
01:43:17,679 --> 01:43:25,199
guilty was a reduction of uh a reduction

2163
01:43:22,279 --> 01:43:28,719
of what I was in dicted for

2164
01:43:25,198 --> 01:43:30,359
3,999 instead of over 4,000 or over

2165
01:43:28,719 --> 01:43:33,639
10,000

2166
01:43:30,359 --> 01:43:37,079
um date of offense this was the big one

2167
01:43:33,639 --> 01:43:40,079
was stipulated as having occurred prior

2168
01:43:37,079 --> 01:43:43,599
to November 17th

2169
01:43:40,079 --> 01:43:46,439
1987 and that sounds like oh cool so I

2170
01:43:43,599 --> 01:43:50,400
got sentenced for a tenth less of a lot

2171
01:43:46,439 --> 01:43:53,158
smaller number that's true but it needs

2172
01:43:50,399 --> 01:43:56,079
a little bit of background

2173
01:43:53,158 --> 01:43:57,519
they had busted someone in Alaska who

2174
01:43:56,079 --> 01:44:01,118
had some

2175
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:04,280
receipts in their trailer those receipts

2176
01:44:01,118 --> 01:44:06,839
had my thumb print on it and one of the

2177
01:44:04,279 --> 01:44:09,519
things on that receipt was a signed

2178
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:12,360
statement that they understood that no

2179
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:15,199
information nor technology obtained from

2180
01:44:12,359 --> 01:44:17,719
hydrotech was ever to be used for any

2181
01:44:15,198 --> 01:44:20,439
illegal purpose now this was lawyer

2182
01:44:17,719 --> 01:44:22,599
advice put this it's the same as when

2183
01:44:20,439 --> 01:44:25,960
someone orders a knife through the mail

2184
01:44:22,599 --> 01:44:27,800
you have to say no yes I'm over 18 so we

2185
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:30,439
had done everything we could and we had

2186
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:32,480
signs up in the store do not use

2187
01:44:30,439 --> 01:44:34,879
anything for illegal

2188
01:44:32,479 --> 01:44:36,598
purposes well I knew I was going to have

2189
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:38,279
to plead guilty I do bounce around a

2190
01:44:36,599 --> 01:44:41,520
little with this one uh I knew I was

2191
01:44:38,279 --> 01:44:44,479
going to have to plead guilty because

2192
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:47,480
the number one witness against me said

2193
01:44:44,479 --> 01:44:51,039
that I was conspiring with them at the

2194
01:44:47,479 --> 01:44:56,759
Pink Flamingo Hotel in northeast

2195
01:44:51,039 --> 01:44:56,760
Portland on December member 23rd

2196
01:44:58,399 --> 01:45:04,399
1987 sounds like pretty pretty certain

2197
01:45:01,399 --> 01:45:06,158
as to the date and time well during the

2198
01:45:04,399 --> 01:45:08,238
omnibus hearing which is the evidence

2199
01:45:06,158 --> 01:45:12,479
hearing when a judge decides if evidence

2200
01:45:08,238 --> 01:45:16,718
is or isn't going to be allowed we

2201
01:45:12,479 --> 01:45:19,799
presented the traffic right up from my

2202
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:24,399
having an accident in kyua Kona in the

2203
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:27,880
evening on 22 d December

2204
01:45:24,399 --> 01:45:31,719
1987 we presented the hotel records

2205
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:34,960
showing me checking out of the hotel the

2206
01:45:31,719 --> 01:45:38,359
morning of the 23rd of December

2207
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:40,760
1987 we showed phone records made from

2208
01:45:38,359 --> 01:45:42,839
the airport I mean I was on the big

2209
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:46,679
island so I flew over to the big island

2210
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:48,719
and sat in in uh the airport in Honolulu

2211
01:45:46,679 --> 01:45:50,800
for a couple hours made phone calls

2212
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:54,399
showed the phone records the judge ruled

2213
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:57,000
it was a reliable Witness

2214
01:45:54,399 --> 01:46:00,559
okay I'm 3,000 and some miles away can

2215
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:03,439
prove it at the specific time and date

2216
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:06,440
that this guy says I'm there the judge

2217
01:46:03,439 --> 01:46:10,399
ruled you know so at that point I

2218
01:46:06,439 --> 01:46:13,198
knew I was going to be doing time so I

2219
01:46:10,399 --> 01:46:16,598
told my lawyer find out what's the

2220
01:46:13,198 --> 01:46:20,359
absolute least I can get without giving

2221
01:46:16,599 --> 01:46:23,760
anyone up I was raised a particular way

2222
01:46:20,359 --> 01:46:26,000
and I believe firmly that you you you do

2223
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:28,199
you ride your beef alone you you if you

2224
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:31,039
get busted you don't take anyone with

2225
01:46:28,198 --> 01:46:32,719
you and anyone's more than welcome to go

2226
01:46:31,039 --> 01:46:35,238
back look at the records involving my

2227
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:39,520
arrest back then they'll find no one

2228
01:46:35,238 --> 01:46:42,319
else got indicted out of my incidents no

2229
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:44,800
Etc because of anything I did I didn't

2230
01:46:42,319 --> 01:46:46,920
get you did a lot of time I I did a lot

2231
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:48,400
of time I think it's pretty clear that

2232
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:50,279
if if you would have ratted people out

2233
01:46:48,399 --> 01:46:53,118
you wouldn't have spent what was it 15

2234
01:46:50,279 --> 01:46:56,158
years in jail 15 total actually a little

2235
01:46:53,118 --> 01:46:58,559
over 15 and and I do need to clarify

2236
01:46:56,158 --> 01:47:01,519
that this was in two pieces the first

2237
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:04,360
piece was the six-year bit Rising

2238
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:07,440
directly out of operation green Merchant

2239
01:47:04,359 --> 01:47:10,279
but when I got out someone who had owed

2240
01:47:07,439 --> 01:47:13,118
me money gave me stories for 6 months

2241
01:47:10,279 --> 01:47:15,759
laughed in my face about it I got very

2242
01:47:13,118 --> 01:47:17,759
upset and ended up catching a new beef

2243
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:20,880
that I never would have if I hadn't gone

2244
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:23,800
away on green Merchant it was not a nice

2245
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:25,960
beef I caught and you know tell people

2246
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:28,760
that I that my 15 years arose from Green

2247
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:31,760
Merchant because they did nine of them

2248
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:34,480
was for the guy laughing at me about

2249
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:37,599
owing me money after I held my mud and

2250
01:47:34,479 --> 01:47:41,158
he didn't go to prison cuz I held my mud

2251
01:47:37,599 --> 01:47:43,239
that was you know I I'm a lot nicer now

2252
01:47:41,158 --> 01:47:45,759
than I was but when he laughed at me I

2253
01:47:43,238 --> 01:47:50,039
put a 45 in his mouth and explained to

2254
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:52,960
him how much smarter it would be to get

2255
01:47:50,039 --> 01:47:56,359
right with me he managed to find the the

2256
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:58,399
money right away he also called the cops

2257
01:47:56,359 --> 01:48:00,359
and I caught kidnapping and armed

2258
01:47:58,399 --> 01:48:03,039
robbery beefs that never would have

2259
01:48:00,359 --> 01:48:04,359
happened if I had not gone to prison it

2260
01:48:03,039 --> 01:48:06,039
arose from Green

2261
01:48:04,359 --> 01:48:09,399
Merchant

2262
01:48:06,039 --> 01:48:11,880
$75,000 is a lot of money to someone

2263
01:48:09,399 --> 01:48:14,359
that's been away for 6 years let's put

2264
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:15,400
it in perspective too 6 years for

2265
01:48:14,359 --> 01:48:17,759
growing

2266
01:48:15,399 --> 01:48:20,359
cannabis 9 years for putting a gun in

2267
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:22,920
somebody's mouth right that doesn't seem

2268
01:48:20,359 --> 01:48:24,960
like a no it's a little a proper balance

2269
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:26,880
you know like honestly I could see you

2270
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:28,960
doing more time for putting somebody's a

2271
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:30,319
gun in somebody's mouth yeah I mean you

2272
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:32,000
shouldn't have spent a day in prison for

2273
01:48:30,319 --> 01:48:34,399
growing canab right and I never would

2274
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:37,880
have done the second one never never

2275
01:48:34,399 --> 01:48:40,198
would have I mean you know part of it is

2276
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:43,199
I need to also explain I had never

2277
01:48:40,198 --> 01:48:46,079
touched speed in my life and I was

2278
01:48:43,198 --> 01:48:50,198
around nothing or or in large measure a

2279
01:48:46,079 --> 01:48:52,800
bunch of CLS what not Crooks Cooks c o k

2280
01:48:50,198 --> 01:48:55,839
s the people that make meth while I was

2281
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:57,800
was in prison I was seeing them at their

2282
01:48:55,840 --> 01:49:00,960
best not their

2283
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:02,199
worst I ended up with a mild meth habit

2284
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:04,560
for 9

2285
01:49:02,198 --> 01:49:06,719
months it was toward the end of that

2286
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:08,320
that I went to collect and just finally

2287
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:13,399
it had

2288
01:49:08,319 --> 01:49:15,399
enough so you know I don't fault that I

2289
01:49:13,399 --> 01:49:18,000
don't feel like I shouldn't have had

2290
01:49:15,399 --> 01:49:20,439
those nine years for what I did but I

2291
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:23,639
never would have done it if I hadn't

2292
01:49:20,439 --> 01:49:26,439
gone to prison in the first place prison

2293
01:49:23,639 --> 01:49:28,880
no matter how good a person you are

2294
01:49:26,439 --> 01:49:32,000
takes something away from you your

2295
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:34,880
values change you it takes the the the

2296
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:37,800
rough rule of thumb I know that phrase

2297
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:40,920
is no longer PC but tough [ __ ] the the

2298
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:45,719
the general principle is that for every

2299
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:47,560
year of prison you do it takes a year to

2300
01:49:45,719 --> 01:49:51,279
deinstitutionalize anything over you're

2301
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:53,159
lucky huh if you're lucky cuz certain

2302
01:49:51,279 --> 01:49:55,079
effects probably never go away

2303
01:49:53,158 --> 01:49:57,679
right yeah and and your record never

2304
01:49:55,079 --> 01:50:01,039
goes away I mean the consequences never

2305
01:49:57,679 --> 01:50:04,319
go away they they they're there

2306
01:50:01,039 --> 01:50:07,279
and as a result this is a piece

2307
01:50:04,319 --> 01:50:08,920
of why I'm not thrilled with

2308
01:50:07,279 --> 01:50:11,519
legalization as it

2309
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:14,639
exists in most States because of my

2310
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:17,880
criminal record in most legal states I

2311
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:20,520
cannot hold a

2312
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:22,199
license some states only go back 10

2313
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:24,639
years when they look at the records I'm

2314
01:50:22,198 --> 01:50:28,000
good there it's

2315
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:31,560
been uh give me a

2316
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:34,118
minute 4 it's been 28 years since my

2317
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:36,080
last felony

2318
01:50:34,118 --> 01:50:38,920
conviction now do you think it's because

2319
01:50:36,079 --> 01:50:43,279
of your cannabis record or because of

2320
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:45,359
the kidnapping or both actually felony

2321
01:50:43,279 --> 01:50:47,639
Most states

2322
01:50:45,359 --> 01:50:50,799
specifically specifically include

2323
01:50:47,639 --> 01:50:54,000
cannabis some states make some of the

2324
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:57,599
states make an exception for if all of

2325
01:50:54,000 --> 01:51:01,840
your crimes would now be

2326
01:50:57,599 --> 01:51:03,078
legal so and even there they left

2327
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:05,000
themselves wiggle room when things

2328
01:51:03,078 --> 01:51:07,920
tighten down again as I believe they

2329
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:09,719
will over the next four years I I I

2330
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:12,319
think we're really going to be missing

2331
01:51:09,719 --> 01:51:15,279
what the last few years have been

2332
01:51:12,319 --> 01:51:20,479
because uh the political clout and and

2333
01:51:15,279 --> 01:51:22,880
where it is is not really very Pro

2334
01:51:20,479 --> 01:51:28,078
cannabis it's unfortunate but there's

2335
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:31,359
money there so maybe but if if so you

2336
01:51:28,078 --> 01:51:32,599
know look I I I hope and pray that

2337
01:51:31,359 --> 01:51:34,799
people are going to be able to keep

2338
01:51:32,599 --> 01:51:37,679
making a decent living in the contiguous

2339
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:39,119
48 and up in Canada but I honestly

2340
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:42,078
believe if you want to make a decent

2341
01:51:39,118 --> 01:51:44,479
living growing cannabis in these two

2342
01:51:42,078 --> 01:51:49,679
places you're going

2343
01:51:44,479 --> 01:51:52,759
to artisanal grow for high-end Market

2344
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:55,118
with one or two varieties and get the

2345
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:58,320
for having this is the best of this

2346
01:51:55,118 --> 01:52:01,279
there is you like this kind get it from

2347
01:51:58,319 --> 01:52:04,759
him yeah it costs

2348
01:52:01,279 --> 01:52:06,920
more uh the second thing would be and

2349
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:11,039
this is the probably the main route I

2350
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:14,359
hope to take is growing ready to flowers

2351
01:52:11,039 --> 01:52:16,399
I want to sell people grow gear sell

2352
01:52:14,359 --> 01:52:18,759
them the plants grow with and hold their

2353
01:52:16,399 --> 01:52:20,359
hand until they tell me look I've got it

2354
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:22,520
go

2355
01:52:20,359 --> 01:52:24,679
away I'm going to sign up for that 20

2356
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:27,520
24hour technical

2357
01:52:24,679 --> 01:52:29,840
support what hours what shift do you

2358
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:33,440
want no no no meaning I'm going to call

2359
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:34,599
you when I need help well yeah you know

2360
01:52:33,439 --> 01:52:37,039
that can be there too but you're

2361
01:52:34,599 --> 01:52:39,520
knowledgeable enough you can Pro I I

2362
01:52:37,039 --> 01:52:43,679
would be more inclined to put you on the

2363
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:47,159
answering end and the questioning end

2364
01:52:43,679 --> 01:52:49,679
um but ready to flower sell selling them

2365
01:52:47,158 --> 01:52:51,118
setting up get getting to research

2366
01:52:49,679 --> 01:52:53,078
collaborative that reminds me I'd never

2367
01:52:51,118 --> 01:52:55,719
finished telling you about that so how

2368
01:52:53,078 --> 01:52:59,439
this would work is the

2369
01:52:55,719 --> 01:53:01,840
farmers become vendors to the license

2370
01:52:59,439 --> 01:53:04,678
holders which are the university in

2371
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:06,639
order to be a vendor on a license where

2372
01:53:04,679 --> 01:53:08,679
you're manufacturing a controlled

2373
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:11,199
substance for research you're going to

2374
01:53:08,679 --> 01:53:13,880
have to be compliant with their security

2375
01:53:11,198 --> 01:53:16,719
regulations that means the model we're

2376
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:20,560
more likely to see would be industrial

2377
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:23,840
parks that are collectively owned by the

2378
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:26,599
farmers but that also puts it'll there

2379
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:29,199
is a way there to monetize and go around

2380
01:53:26,599 --> 01:53:32,239
2 ad but

2381
01:53:29,198 --> 01:53:35,919
medical with that rule

2382
01:53:32,238 --> 01:53:40,839
gone become and when it's under a DEA

2383
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:42,880
license is not subject to 280e you know

2384
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:44,840
we're two hours in but I know wolf

2385
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:47,560
hasn't even scraped the

2386
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:50,520
surface okay I'm I'm sorry about that no

2387
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:53,239
no no no bro talk a lot no no listen say

2388
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:55,000
that let us thank let us thank you

2389
01:53:53,238 --> 01:53:57,799
we don't want apologies we won't accept

2390
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:00,560
that so go finishing about the

2391
01:53:57,800 --> 01:54:02,480
collaborative right you go in you your

2392
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:04,039

01:54:30,238 --> 01:54:34,399
them the fee remember I said this is the

2405
01:54:32,599 --> 01:54:37,279
one rule that has to change you give

2406

2419
01:55:12,319 --> 01:55:17,078
and you have to do this if you want to

2420
01:55:14,399 --> 01:55:19,960
reup you get it you have to filled out

2421
01:55:17,078 --> 01:55:22,399
the questionnaire to be able to get

2422
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:26,158
more one of the things this will let

2423
01:55:22,399 --> 01:55:29,078
people do is say I'm in Portland Oregon

2424
01:55:26,158 --> 01:55:32,519
and I buy white widow and this white

2425
01:55:29,078 --> 01:55:33,920
widow is phenomenal this stuff makes my

2426
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:36,040
back stop

2427
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:38,719
hurting everything seems a little

2428
01:55:36,039 --> 01:55:41,439
funnier than it was and the old lady and

2429
01:55:38,719 --> 01:55:43,800
I are getting along really good well a

2430
01:55:41,439 --> 01:55:45,559
week later I'm out of white widow and

2431
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:47,960
I'm in Portland Maine and I walk into

2432
01:55:45,560 --> 01:55:50,000
the dispensary in Portland Main and I

2433
01:55:47,960 --> 01:55:53,000
hand them the package with the bar graph

2434
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:55,560
on it or the the thing that gave get you

2435
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:57,639
to the the um it doesn't even have to be

2436
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:59,599
on the package with these new the QR

2437
01:55:57,639 --> 01:56:00,960
things you show them the QR that's on

2438
01:55:59,599 --> 01:56:03,400
the package they

2439
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:04,800
go and you might say something like I

2440
01:56:03,399 --> 01:56:07,960
need some White Widow and they take it

2441
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:09,760
and they go well we have that same

2442
01:56:07,960 --> 01:56:11,880
profile at half the strength so you'll

2443
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:15,239
have to use about twice as much and this

2444
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:15,239
is called Purple UMO

2445
01:56:16,399 --> 01:56:23,198
gumo so now regardless of what technique

2446
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:25,840
the farmer used to grow regardless of

2447
01:56:23,198 --> 01:56:29,198
what he fed it regardless of what it was

2448
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:30,078
called at that other place you now have

2449
01:56:29,198 --> 01:56:33,479
the

2450
01:56:30,078 --> 01:56:38,078
medication that you know from personal

2451
01:56:33,479 --> 01:56:40,399
experience has benefited you with your

2452
01:56:38,078 --> 01:56:44,559
specific

2453
01:56:40,399 --> 01:56:48,839
condition stormcrows list on on on

2454
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:53,039
steroids H how many points of data um

2455
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:56,199
like have you seen required make

2456
01:56:53,039 --> 01:57:00,359
this is a this is a hypothetical I I was

2457
01:56:56,198 --> 01:57:02,238
looking I I have I am the world's best

2458
01:57:00,359 --> 01:57:04,679
thinker one of the world's best thinker

2459
01:57:02,238 --> 01:57:07,439
uppers of great ideas and one of the

2460
01:57:04,679 --> 01:57:09,239
world's worst finders of Thunders that

2461
01:57:07,439 --> 01:57:12,000
you're ever going to

2462
01:57:09,238 --> 01:57:13,919
meet I mean seriously at one point we

2463
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:15,920
would have at one point had my had what

2464
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:17,560
I was trying to do work six different

2465
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:19,719
people said they put the second million

2466
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:22,599
in I was going to buy the town of tiller

2467
01:57:19,719 --> 01:57:25,520
Oregon and turn it into a cannabis

2468
01:57:22,599 --> 01:57:27,360
centered Resort Town it would have been

2469
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:29,639
the tiller Homestead Community because

2470
01:57:27,359 --> 01:57:31,598
tiller had at one time been a homestead

2471
01:57:29,639 --> 01:57:34,118
government would have been by all of the

2472
01:57:31,599 --> 01:57:36,679
adults in the community once a week by

2473
01:57:34,118 --> 01:57:39,039
phone by computer they would have been

2474
01:57:36,679 --> 01:57:40,520
the community board of directors so THC

2475
01:57:39,039 --> 01:57:41,920
would have been governed by would have

2476
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:45,040
been regulated by

2477
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:47,078
CBD but the town would have included the

2478
01:57:45,039 --> 01:57:50,800
American College of canab culture it

2479
01:57:47,078 --> 01:57:54,639
would have included the Dr Todd hero Mia

2480
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:58,320
Center for in ative healing and

2481
01:57:54,639 --> 01:57:59,800
research there's uh that that was one of

2482
01:57:58,319 --> 01:58:03,078
of a number of them this research

2483
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:05,279
collaborative needs backing it needs

2484
01:58:03,078 --> 01:58:07,920
what it needs is for really I hate to

2485
01:58:05,279 --> 01:58:10,118
say it a pharmaceutical company to say

2486
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:12,679
we we we want to do stuff with cannabis

2487
01:58:10,118 --> 01:58:15,078
but we don't even know where to start

2488
01:58:12,679 --> 01:58:17,078
coming up with these what I'm I'm going

2489
01:58:15,078 --> 01:58:19,519
to call I wish I could claim this but

2490
01:58:17,078 --> 01:58:23,118
it's not my portmanto coming up with

2491
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:26,159
anic data to support where they should

2492
01:58:23,118 --> 01:58:29,118
begin subclinical or clinical

2493
01:58:26,158 --> 01:58:33,000
trials because right now medical

2494
01:58:29,118 --> 01:58:35,519
cannabis is us standing on the edge of a

2495
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:38,439
cliff overlooking the Grand Canyon it's

2496
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:40,760
a pitch black night we're blindfolded

2497
01:58:38,439 --> 01:58:42,559
and there's a hood over the top of that

2498
01:58:40,760 --> 01:58:44,719
we're shooting off a shotgun and we're

2499
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:46,679
hoping that in the morning when we get

2500
01:58:44,719 --> 01:58:49,359
to the bottom we're going to find

2501
01:58:46,679 --> 01:58:50,920
something that we can eat for breakfast

2502
01:58:49,359 --> 01:58:52,559
the kind of re the research

2503
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:55,679
collaborative I'm talking

2504
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:58,000
about realistically would take a couple

2505
01:58:55,679 --> 01:59:01,359
of decades off the research that's going

2506
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:04,439
to need to be done to find all of the

2507
01:59:01,359 --> 01:59:07,039
places cannabis can

2508
01:59:04,439 --> 01:59:09,919
help but hey I don't have letters after

2509
01:59:07,039 --> 01:59:11,920
my name I don't have those things but I

2510
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:14,840
mean it sounds like that sounds like a

2511
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:16,760
wonderful thing to have uh especially

2512
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:18,760
with the lack of research just due to

2513
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:20,520
the criminalization over years and the

2514
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:24,199
limitation of I what is it like

2515
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:27,960
Mississippi state that was able to uh do

2516
01:59:24,198 --> 01:59:31,279
any research whatsoever uh since Dr mmud

2517
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:33,760
El's Plantation down there at Parchman

2518
01:59:31,279 --> 01:59:35,519
yep and I mean and even that they were

2519
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:37,719
working with cultivars that were out of

2520
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:40,719
date for a long time and they weren't

2521
01:59:37,719 --> 01:59:42,279
really uh up upgrading any of the uh

2522
01:59:40,719 --> 01:59:45,800
applicable knowledge that was being

2523
01:59:42,279 --> 01:59:47,880
developed by the community elsewhere so

2524
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:52,079
like there's so much data that's just

2525
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:54,960
either lost to Minds like yours where

2526
01:59:52,078 --> 01:59:56,799
you don't have a PhD or an MD after your

2527
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:59,359
name where people are going to be

2528
01:59:56,800 --> 02:00:02,520
listening to you in a more intent

2529
01:59:59,359 --> 02:00:04,238
fashion and it's it sounds like

2530
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:07,760
something that would help though is a

2531
02:00:04,238 --> 02:00:10,839
community effort towards uh more refined

2532
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:12,599
research techniques that are able to be

2533
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:15,159
published in a way that would be

2534
02:00:12,599 --> 02:00:19,440
accepted overall by the medical or

2535
02:00:15,158 --> 02:00:23,078
scientific or general public in in a in

2536
02:00:19,439 --> 02:00:27,719
a positive way well this the thing about

2537
02:00:23,078 --> 02:00:30,399
the collaborative proposal that is I I

2538
02:00:27,719 --> 02:00:33,000
believe at strongest point is it's

2539
02:00:30,399 --> 02:00:35,158
actually strictly speaking not a

2540
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:37,560
clinical or subclinical study so it's

2541
02:00:35,158 --> 02:00:43,879
not subject to the same rules this would

2542
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:47,039
be a an organized collection of anic

2543
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:50,639
data right where it's anecdotes we're

2544
02:00:47,039 --> 02:00:54,760
relaying this is what a statistically

2545
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:59,440
significant sample population reports is

2546
02:00:54,760 --> 02:01:02,920
working this becomes a real thing that

2547
02:00:59,439 --> 02:01:05,759
for a CO for a college to get money from

2548
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:08,440
a pharmacy pretty easy and I I I should

2549
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:10,920
say at one point this was going to

2550
02:01:08,439 --> 02:01:15,879
happen and then the big hurricane in

2551
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:18,158
2016 hit Puerto Rico um I have great

2552
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:21,199
family Connections in Puerto Rico my

2553
02:01:18,158 --> 02:01:23,118
grandfather seor wolf is the man who's

2554
02:01:21,198 --> 02:01:25,719
considered to have begun the movement to

2555
02:01:23,118 --> 02:01:27,839
save old sanan when he died the governor

2556
02:01:25,719 --> 02:01:30,480
read his eulogy while they scattered his

2557
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:34,239
ashes over the paror from

2558
02:01:30,479 --> 02:01:38,279
Elmo uh I was down there to talk to some

2559
02:01:34,238 --> 02:01:40,158

2560

wishes to speak to you in my life a call

2563
02:01:46,039 --> 02:01:50,800
like that generally means either there's

2564
02:01:48,439 --> 02:01:52,638
a cop waiting for me or there's some

2565
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:54,480
dude who's not very happy about my

2566
02:01:52,639 --> 02:01:59,639

let's go see what this is I get to the

2571
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:13,520

02:02:27,319 --> 02:02:33,118
little bit about Puerto Rican

2579
02:02:30,078 --> 02:02:36,759
Society there was a big German migration

2580
02:02:33,118 --> 02:02:38,399
at the turn of the 20th century the

2581
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:42,000
social

2582
02:02:38,399 --> 02:02:45,158
Elite in Puerto Rico are mostly

2583
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:50,118
descended from Germans but they're all

2584
02:02:45,158 --> 02:02:53,000
they are all puos and pu kenas first and

2585
02:02:50,118 --> 02:02:56,000
foremost they they love Puerto Rico well

2586
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:58,198
Ladonia is this little old lady who is

2587
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:00,520
sort of the head if you will the she

2588
02:02:58,198 --> 02:03:04,359
would be the queen if Puerto Rico had a

2589
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:06,199
queen and you know I I know who L is

2590
02:03:04,359 --> 02:03:10,439
because I'm familiar a little bit with

2591
02:03:06,198 --> 02:03:11,839
Puerto Rico and so I say okay and I go

2592
02:03:10,439 --> 02:03:15,479
and I have lunch and the first thing I

2593
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:18,360
hear is that Sarita my Auntie Sarah was

2594
02:03:15,479 --> 02:03:21,319
one of ladon's favorite people when my

2595
02:03:18,359 --> 02:03:24,039
auntie lived in Puerto Rico and in fact

2596
02:03:21,319 --> 02:03:28,000
my auntie he was the only purely

2597
02:03:24,039 --> 02:03:30,599
non-puerto Rican that made it anywhere

2598
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:33,319
in the Puerto Rican Art Museum hierarchy

2599
02:03:30,599 --> 02:03:34,880
because she was one of ladon's favorites

2600
02:03:33,319 --> 02:03:37,679
but so Leonia asked what I'm doing in

2601
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:39,118
Puerto Rico and I tell her the next day

2602
02:03:37,679 --> 02:03:42,158
I had lunch with the governor's

2603
02:03:39,118 --> 02:03:44,719
executive assistant the day after that I

2604
02:03:42,158 --> 02:03:48,000
had lunch with the Deans of the med law

2605
02:03:44,719 --> 02:03:51,840
and a schools oh and the head of their

2606
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:53,679
technology transfer office so I sort of

2607
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:56,559
had a pretty good thing going and I come

2608
02:03:53,679 --> 02:03:58,800
back to California to the billionaire

2609
02:03:56,559 --> 02:04:00,880
who owned the company that was making

2610
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:02,840
the lights that I had helped design that

2611
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:06,279
I was down there to try to sell and I

2612
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:10,119
tell him about it and in the

2613
02:04:06,279 --> 02:04:11,920
meanwhile the DEA issued a clarification

2614
02:04:10,118 --> 02:04:15,399
memo that

2615
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:18,639
basically said we don't care if it's CBD

2616
02:04:15,399 --> 02:04:21,960
it's all THC analoges and we're going to

2617
02:04:18,639 --> 02:04:26,760
prosecute it now this billionaire is an

2618
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:29,639
East Indian fellow who the thing over

2619
02:04:26,760 --> 02:04:33,800
Enron here in California had cost him

2620
02:04:29,639 --> 02:04:36,279
$23 million he hadn't had any criminal

2621
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:38,639
proceedings he had avoided civil

2622
02:04:36,279 --> 02:04:41,399
proceedings but it had cost him $23

2623
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:43,118
million to do it he says no no no I'm

2624
02:04:41,399 --> 02:04:46,759
not putting my money into anything

2625
02:04:43,118 --> 02:04:48,439
that's directly to do with cannabis no

2626
02:04:46,760 --> 02:04:51,360
so that was the first Finance year that

2627
02:04:48,439 --> 02:04:55,359
went away had he said yes we would all

2628
02:04:51,359 --> 02:04:57,880
now be8 years into this having

2629
02:04:55,359 --> 02:05:00,799
happened I've talked with probably a

2630
02:04:57,880 --> 02:05:04,199
dozen wealthy people about this people

2631
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:05,480
who are into medicinal people well who

2632
02:05:04,198 --> 02:05:08,960
have large

2633
02:05:05,479 --> 02:05:12,598
companies I've talked with Watson a lot

2634
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:15,158
um so you know this this should have

2635
02:05:12,599 --> 02:05:16,880
happened it could happen it hasn't I

2636
02:05:15,158 --> 02:05:19,399
think we're going to see things tighten

2637
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:21,960
down a lot maybe even back to just

2638
02:05:19,399 --> 02:05:24,839
purely medicinal I already know how to

2639
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:27,760
tell people how to make money anyways if

2640
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:30,520
that happens but more importantly we

2641
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:32,320
could get that research done and I think

2642
02:05:30,520 --> 02:05:35,000
you know if if the Republicans tighten

2643
02:05:32,319 --> 02:05:37,238
[ __ ] down like

2644
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:41,960
that it's okay with

2645
02:05:37,238 --> 02:05:45,039
me because I still I will get it done

2646
02:05:41,960 --> 02:05:47,279
University of California or a European

2647
02:05:45,039 --> 02:05:49,519
University system any place with

2648
02:05:47,279 --> 02:05:51,000
multiple institutions their chemical

2649
02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:53,880
department they should have grad

2650
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:59,000
students doing the chemical analysis not

2651
02:05:53,880 --> 02:06:02,599
for profit for experience for skill for

2652
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:05,359
research agreed you have a question

2653
02:06:02,599 --> 02:06:07,520
Sasha yeah I wanted to add to this that

2654
02:06:05,359 --> 02:06:11,158
I know that in Israel for example there

2655
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:13,679
is a very very Advanced uh in Israel

2656
02:06:11,158 --> 02:06:16,399
right there is a very Advanced uh

2657
02:06:13,679 --> 02:06:19,319
medical system which is working with I'm

2658
02:06:16,399 --> 02:06:22,399
familiar with how Israel is doing it uh

2659
02:06:19,319 --> 02:06:25,399
IAL I talked with Daddy Eerie quite a

2660
02:06:22,399 --> 02:06:28,839
bit and they're they're not they aren't

2661
02:06:25,399 --> 02:06:30,558
doing random you know they're they are

2662
02:06:28,840 --> 02:06:33,279
doing samples they have a well-developed

2663
02:06:30,559 --> 02:06:35,639
medical system but they aren't doing the

2664
02:06:33,279 --> 02:06:36,880
kind of data collection that's the only

2665
02:06:35,639 --> 02:06:40,920
way that

2666
02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:43,880
given poly molecule multimolecule

2667
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:46,440
medicinal things it's hard enough you've

2668
02:06:43,880 --> 02:06:49,078
got so much patient individuation even

2669
02:06:46,439 --> 02:06:51,678
with Isom molecu with single molecule

2670
02:06:49,078 --> 02:06:55,158
medicines and we're talking about

2671
02:06:51,679 --> 02:06:57,599
something where the Ensemble effect I

2672
02:06:55,158 --> 02:07:00,558
hate the word entourage used there The

2673
02:06:57,599 --> 02:07:00,559
Ensemble

2674
02:07:00,599 --> 02:07:07,559
effect we need to know this this this

2675
02:07:03,599 --> 02:07:10,199
and this work for this if you if you got

2676
02:07:07,559 --> 02:07:11,320
I have this substance here are patients

2677
02:07:10,198 --> 02:07:13,919
who have

2678
02:07:11,319 --> 02:07:16,279
this that's one thing is this going to

2679
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:19,199
work for this condition for people who

2680
02:07:16,279 --> 02:07:22,198
have this set of genes it's not

2681
02:07:19,198 --> 02:07:22,198
sufficient

2682
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:29,158
you know uh in in this Clinic you know

2683
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:31,559
where there is kabin Clinic you know

2684
02:07:29,158 --> 02:07:33,519
they uh for example have this protocol

2685
02:07:31,559 --> 02:07:36,920
where the patient that comes inside of

2686
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:39,520
the clinic is presented by 20 or I don't

2687
02:07:36,920 --> 02:07:43,920
know 15 samples of different Canabis

2688
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:46,679
flowers at first he he's touching it and

2689
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:49,359
smelling it and he can touch and smell

2690
02:07:46,679 --> 02:07:50,639
it that's the first Contact you know

2691
02:07:49,359 --> 02:07:52,880
normally you have to understand that

2692
02:07:50,639 --> 02:07:54,960
patients uh come into the clean and they

2693
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:57,599
never seen kobis before in their lives

2694
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:58,880
yeah so they see Canabis for the first

2695
02:07:57,599 --> 02:08:02,800
time in their life they touch it they

2696
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:07,078
smell it and based on their decision

2697
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:10,719
which one is suiting them best the whole

2698
02:08:07,078 --> 02:08:12,639
medicine is in behind already made you

2699
02:08:10,719 --> 02:08:15,480
know you have everything behind you know

2700
02:08:12,639 --> 02:08:18,520
all the tinctures all the isolate all

2701
02:08:15,479 --> 02:08:21,078
the all the different kind of oils

2702
02:08:18,520 --> 02:08:21,960
different kind that's how they and they

2703
02:08:21,078 --> 02:08:25,920
realize

2704
02:08:21,960 --> 02:08:29,198
that each person reacts differently you

2705
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:32,199
know for also for for the same sickness

2706
02:08:29,198 --> 02:08:37,118
they have you know for example some man

2707
02:08:32,198 --> 02:08:40,719
has a uh cancer in uh you know the

2708
02:08:37,118 --> 02:08:43,078
cancer prostata you know and he chooses

2709
02:08:40,719 --> 02:08:44,920
prostate cancer yeah so he choose

2710
02:08:43,078 --> 02:08:48,639
different than other that also have

2711
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:52,000
prostate cancer you know but it's uh the

2712
02:08:48,639 --> 02:08:55,480
it's because uh the patient is is like

2713
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:57,599
turned on by the the sheer uh

2714
02:08:55,479 --> 02:08:59,678
information that is on the plant

2715
02:08:57,599 --> 02:09:01,800
material you know and this is what you

2716
02:08:59,679 --> 02:09:05,599
talked before this is the volatiles the

2717
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:07,599
tpin the the alcohols and the you know

2718
02:09:05,599 --> 02:09:09,520
that that thing and then the whole

2719
02:09:07,599 --> 02:09:12,039
medicine is already made because this is

2720
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:14,639
standardized product they have the Clone

2721
02:09:12,039 --> 02:09:16,519
for that particular strain there that

2722
02:09:14,639 --> 02:09:19,279
they are showing them you know so the

2723
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:23,360
all the system is already made for that

2724
02:09:19,279 --> 02:09:23,359
uh and they have good results you know

2725
02:09:23,880 --> 02:09:32,039
I think valid I just think that it

2726
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:34,000
doesn't reach to the same extent that

2727
02:09:32,039 --> 02:09:36,920
there there's this thing patient

2728
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:38,840
individuation right two people with an

2729
02:09:36,920 --> 02:09:41,880
identical

2730
02:09:38,840 --> 02:09:44,360
disease can need different medications

2731
02:09:41,880 --> 02:09:49,159
to achieve the same effect and the only

2732
02:09:44,359 --> 02:09:52,598
way that we can find all of what's

2733
02:09:49,158 --> 02:09:56,719
needed is by thousand thousands of

2734
02:09:52,599 --> 02:09:59,199
sources and varieties going to tens of

2735
02:09:56,719 --> 02:10:03,559
thousands of patients so that we can

2736
02:09:59,198 --> 02:10:05,479
find the whole range because it is

2737
02:10:03,559 --> 02:10:08,159
multimolecular rather than Isom

2738
02:10:05,479 --> 02:10:11,399
molecular and in order to both account

2739
02:10:08,158 --> 02:10:12,960
for patient individuation and the multim

2740
02:10:11,399 --> 02:10:16,078
molecularity of

2741
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:18,319
it we we really have to this is that's

2742
02:10:16,078 --> 02:10:20,880
why I'm saying you start out with the

2743
02:10:18,319 --> 02:10:23,759
doctor saying according to the database

2744
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:26,400
people with your makeup people with your

2745
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:28,559
condition are reporting this one seems

2746
02:10:26,399 --> 02:10:31,158
to be what they have the best results

2747
02:10:28,559 --> 02:10:34,639
with so start out

2748
02:10:31,158 --> 02:10:36,558
here and if this one doesn't do it then

2749
02:10:34,639 --> 02:10:40,319
this is the group that the second

2750
02:10:36,559 --> 02:10:43,520
largest group with your condition

2751
02:10:40,319 --> 02:10:45,920
report and as we fine-tune it as we get

2752
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:47,920
tens and or hundreds of thousands of

2753
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:52,559
results it will get to the point where

2754
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:55,279
we can say okay you have AB 97 365 at

2755
02:10:52,559 --> 02:10:58,400
this Locus therefore this is what you

2756
02:10:55,279 --> 02:11:01,960
need but that's never going to happen

2757
02:10:58,399 --> 02:11:05,319
without really enormous efforts to

2758
02:11:01,960 --> 02:11:07,118
collect that huge that almost infinite I

2759
02:11:05,319 --> 02:11:09,880
mean so large that it's for all

2760
02:11:07,118 --> 02:11:13,078
practical purposes infinite number of

2761
02:11:09,880 --> 02:11:14,920
combinations of substances and patient

2762
02:11:13,078 --> 02:11:17,000
make patient

2763
02:11:14,920 --> 02:11:19,000
physiologies well it's like the process

2764
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:21,359
of elimination that would go on there is

2765
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:23,479
immense after you have those first test

2766
02:11:21,359 --> 02:11:25,679
samples and you start with the hey start

2767
02:11:23,479 --> 02:11:27,638
here and then we'll work our way from

2768
02:11:25,679 --> 02:11:29,719
there because you can almost start to

2769
02:11:27,639 --> 02:11:33,118
then compare those different cannaboid

2770
02:11:29,719 --> 02:11:35,599
tpine uh other oo Factor profiles to

2771
02:11:33,118 --> 02:11:38,198
each other and and then start to drop

2772
02:11:35,599 --> 02:11:41,480
out the ones that don't overlap and and

2773
02:11:38,198 --> 02:11:43,919
then pick up the other ones that do um

2774
02:11:41,479 --> 02:11:46,000
that's that that's really fascinating I

2775
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:48,679
can see how fast that could eventually

2776
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:51,880
work to be able to create very unique

2777
02:11:48,679 --> 02:11:53,440
cannaboid and uh endocannabinoid uh

2778
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:56,639
compatible

2779
02:11:53,439 --> 02:11:59,558
profiles right and and in doing that

2780
02:11:56,639 --> 02:12:01,960
figuring out how to grow them because

2781
02:11:59,559 --> 02:12:04,279
we're starting out here with this is

2782
02:12:01,960 --> 02:12:06,840
what this cannabis is it seems to be

2783
02:12:04,279 --> 02:12:09,238
very close in profile to this other one

2784
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:11,639
that you tried that worked pretty well

2785
02:12:09,238 --> 02:12:13,759
for you this is very similar you want to

2786
02:12:11,639 --> 02:12:16,039
try this no one has reported on this one

2787
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:20,280
yet but it's very close does this work

2788
02:12:16,039 --> 02:12:24,078
as well or not as well y we can get

2789
02:12:20,279 --> 02:12:27,880
there but it requires that they let

2790
02:12:24,078 --> 02:12:30,039
us that's that's definitely the problem

2791
02:12:27,880 --> 02:12:33,760
excuse

2792
02:12:30,039 --> 02:12:35,319
me one story that uh I wanted to make

2793
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:37,880
sure that you told that I don't think

2794
02:12:35,319 --> 02:12:40,399
that you haven't yet was how you were

2795
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:45,159
the last post person to smoke cannabis

2796
02:12:40,399 --> 02:12:46,879
with Jack Herrera okay um Jack and I met

2797
02:12:45,158 --> 02:12:49,399
at the

2798
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:52,800
1985 National normal conference in

2799
02:12:49,399 --> 02:12:56,839
Washington and we hit it off pretty well

2800
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:58,520
it's ironic that we met there because

2801
02:12:56,840 --> 02:12:59,440
both of us were living in Portland at

2802
02:12:58,520 --> 02:13:02,800
the

2803
02:12:59,439 --> 02:13:06,319
time and we have this mutual friend Paul

2804
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:08,440
Stanford who used to run or used to be

2805
02:13:06,319 --> 02:13:11,238
used to have and run the hemp and

2806
02:13:08,439 --> 02:13:13,879
cannabis Foundation Paul is one of the

2807
02:13:11,238 --> 02:13:17,279
most active hemp activists in the world

2808
02:13:13,880 --> 02:13:19,118
right now um he's also a pretty good

2809
02:13:17,279 --> 02:13:21,519
grower

2810
02:13:19,118 --> 02:13:22,960
uh well I mean not every not all

2811
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:28,079
activists are Growers not All Growers

2812
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:30,840
are activists but um so Jack is there to

2813
02:13:28,078 --> 02:13:32,880
sell to introduce the emperor I'm there

2814
02:13:30,840 --> 02:13:36,880
to introduce growing indors for Fun and

2815
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:40,760
Profit we start talking and we begin

2816
02:13:36,880 --> 02:13:45,319
having what would turn out to be a 24

2817
02:13:40,760 --> 02:13:48,639
year long really fun argument with him

2818
02:13:45,319 --> 02:13:52,158
saying that the Burning Bush

2819
02:13:48,639 --> 02:13:54,559
was the was the Ammon carry a

2820
02:13:52,158 --> 02:13:59,519
mushroom and me saying that the Burning

2821
02:13:54,559 --> 02:13:59,520
Bush was actually a burning bush

2822
02:14:01,479 --> 02:14:07,198
cannabis that's a good debate to have oh

2823
02:14:05,078 --> 02:14:08,880
it was wonderful and we continued this

2824
02:14:07,198 --> 02:14:12,719
debate at

2825
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:15,920
conferences at festivals every time that

2826
02:14:12,719 --> 02:14:18,719
Jack and I were at festivals together

2827
02:14:15,920 --> 02:14:21,279
and he would be tired of being hero

2828
02:14:18,719 --> 02:14:23,319
woried we would go someplace and just

2829
02:14:21,279 --> 02:14:26,519
get high in [ __ ] and just be

2830
02:14:23,319 --> 02:14:30,158
friends and so we were you know that was

2831
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:33,559
our relationship for 24 years as it

2832
02:14:30,158 --> 02:14:36,118
happens I was I was very involved with

2833
02:14:33,559 --> 02:14:38,880
hempstock which was Portland Oregon's

2834
02:14:36,118 --> 02:14:41,839
version of Hempfest and hemstock was put

2835
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:44,880
on by the hemp and cannabis Foundation I

2836
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:47,360
was uh for its first five years well

2837
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:49,880
first year I was one of the Bands but

2838
02:14:47,359 --> 02:14:53,679
after that for the next six years seven

2839
02:14:49,880 --> 02:14:59,960
years I was part of the hierarchy the

2840
02:14:53,679 --> 02:15:07,199
the core staff if you will and um so in

2841
02:14:59,960 --> 02:15:10,800
2009 Jack uh came to speak at hamst and

2842
02:15:07,198 --> 02:15:14,000
he came down off stage he gave the he

2843
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:17,559
gave the healthiest most coherent speech

2844
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:20,399
he had given since his stroke and it was

2845
02:15:17,559 --> 02:15:23,599
so cool I was like my heart was singing

2846
02:15:20,399 --> 02:15:25,439
to see my my friend doing so well after

2847
02:15:23,599 --> 02:15:29,760
being so messed up from the stroke I was

2848
02:15:25,439 --> 02:15:31,919
gone most of his stroke years but um to

2849
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:34,840
see him doing so well and I said hey

2850
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:37,158
Jack let's smoke some pot I've got this

2851
02:15:34,840 --> 02:15:40,400
vaporizer here I had a volcano plugged

2852
02:15:37,158 --> 02:15:44,439
into a really long extension cord back

2853
02:15:40,399 --> 02:15:47,118
room and uh I mean really like 150 foot

2854
02:15:44,439 --> 02:15:50,439
extension cord to run my volcano so we

2855
02:15:47,118 --> 02:15:54,558
do this bag of vape and Jack starts

2856
02:15:50,439 --> 02:16:00,158
coughing and I had never prior to then

2857
02:15:54,559 --> 02:16:02,719
really understood what a paroxysm p o x

2858
02:16:00,158 --> 02:16:05,519
ysm of coughing

2859
02:16:02,719 --> 02:16:08,719
is they look like they're freaking dying

2860
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:11,480
they they turn beat freaking red they

2861
02:16:08,719 --> 02:16:13,520
turn you know they they're gasping and I

2862
02:16:11,479 --> 02:16:16,479
asked Jack Jack are you okay cuz I was

2863
02:16:13,520 --> 02:16:18,119
really worried and he says oh no no no

2864
02:16:16,479 --> 02:16:20,319
what I said was are you okay I finally

2865
02:16:18,118 --> 02:16:22,799
made you laugh made you cough huh and he

2866
02:16:20,319 --> 02:16:26,118
laughs and says now I cough all the

2867
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:30,639
time so the bag it was you know a good

2868
02:16:26,118 --> 02:16:32,359
size Vape bag the bag runs out and um I

2869
02:16:30,639 --> 02:16:34,799
forget why I wandered off from and I

2870
02:16:32,359 --> 02:16:36,479
come back Jack has wandered off I fill

2871
02:16:34,799 --> 02:16:39,159
another bag and go looking for someone

2872
02:16:36,478 --> 02:16:41,519
else to vape with and

2873
02:16:39,159 --> 02:16:43,599
um there's a cir there's a bunch of

2874
02:16:41,519 --> 02:16:47,200
people standing

2875
02:16:43,599 --> 02:16:50,079
around and I go over there someone's

2876
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:51,840
videoing and I look and Jack is on the

2877
02:16:50,079 --> 02:16:53,318
ground

2878
02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:54,920
and the first thing I do is I take the

2879
02:16:53,318 --> 02:16:57,478
camera away from the guy that's videoing

2880
02:16:54,920 --> 02:16:59,200
I say no you don't get to do this you

2881
02:16:57,478 --> 02:17:01,558
can have your camera back after Jack's

2882
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:03,639
been taken care of you know it was I did

2883
02:17:01,558 --> 02:17:06,039
not I felt it was inappropriate to be

2884
02:17:03,638 --> 02:17:10,199
filming him having a heart attack you

2885
02:17:06,040 --> 02:17:14,880
know it just sorry no

2886
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:17,479
um and about 45 minutes later an

2887
02:17:14,879 --> 02:17:18,679
ambulance arrives we were out at Kelly

2888
02:17:17,478 --> 02:17:22,239
point which is quite a ways from

2889
02:17:18,679 --> 02:17:25,079
downtown Portland about 45 minutes later

2890
02:17:22,239 --> 02:17:28,478
an ambulance arrives and they take Jack

2891
02:17:25,079 --> 02:17:32,159
to the hospital um the obviously the

2892
02:17:28,478 --> 02:17:35,318
festival doesn't stop but I felt that as

2893
02:17:32,159 --> 02:17:39,398
a member of the hierarchy that someone

2894
02:17:35,318 --> 02:17:44,039
needed to be at the hospital for Jack

2895
02:17:39,398 --> 02:17:47,358
so Jack well so Jack's um personal

2896
02:17:44,040 --> 02:17:50,359
assistant a guy named Chuck myself and I

2897
02:17:47,359 --> 02:17:53,000
forget the lady's name waited in the

2898
02:17:50,359 --> 02:17:54,960
parking lot lot at the hospital uh Chuck

2899
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:58,079
didn't wait I was waiting out there and

2900
02:17:54,959 --> 02:18:00,518
about 5:00 in the morning I left um

2901
02:17:58,079 --> 02:18:02,879
checked on how he was when I woke up

2902
02:18:00,519 --> 02:18:05,439
went back cuz I had work to do I had to

2903
02:18:02,879 --> 02:18:08,119
do out at the festival and that was the

2904
02:18:05,439 --> 02:18:10,760
last time I saw Jack but that was also

2905
02:18:08,120 --> 02:18:12,679
from everything I've been told the last

2906
02:18:10,760 --> 02:18:15,318
time Jack ever consciously consumed

2907
02:18:12,679 --> 02:18:17,679
cannabis with anyone and the variety

2908
02:18:15,318 --> 02:18:20,519
which had been called PDX

2909
02:18:17,679 --> 02:18:22,478
lollipop when gotten for me became Jack

2910
02:18:20,519 --> 02:18:23,960
J

2911
02:18:22,478 --> 02:18:27,239
because it did

2912
02:18:23,959 --> 02:18:30,919
eventually Gabby you're you're

2913
02:18:27,239 --> 02:18:34,519
muted say again sorry about that I said

2914
02:18:30,920 --> 02:18:36,799
we don't think that um that cannabis was

2915
02:18:34,519 --> 02:18:38,800
what caused his heart attack oh no no

2916
02:18:36,799 --> 02:18:41,159
what caused his heart attack was he

2917
02:18:38,799 --> 02:18:43,679
actually no I've got to be honest when

2918
02:18:41,159 --> 02:18:45,638
you consume cannabis immediately

2919
02:18:43,679 --> 02:18:48,439
afterwards there is a spike in heart

2920
02:18:45,638 --> 02:18:51,318
rate and then it's mellow but there is a

2921
02:18:48,439 --> 02:18:53,000
spike so it's unlikely that it was that

2922
02:18:51,318 --> 02:18:54,239
because from what I've I mean I looked

2923
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,679
into it a little more I didn't want my

2924
02:18:54,239 --> 02:18:58,159
pot to have killed

2925
02:18:55,679 --> 02:19:01,239
Jack um I you know that's sort of a

2926
02:18:58,159 --> 02:19:03,079
horrible claim to end up with and it

2927
02:19:01,239 --> 02:19:05,318
turned out he had been up partying all

2928
02:19:03,079 --> 02:19:08,439
the night before the lady who was

2929
02:19:05,318 --> 02:19:12,318
waiting in the parking lot um had been

2930
02:19:08,439 --> 02:19:15,200
his company that evening so

2931
02:19:12,318 --> 02:19:17,959
he he was maybe a little worn out

2932
02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:22,399
already and may or may not have consumed

2933
02:19:17,959 --> 02:19:24,718
some other things um so no it wasn't pot

2934
02:19:22,398 --> 02:19:26,760
that killed him but the last pot that I

2935
02:19:24,718 --> 02:19:29,159
know of that he consciously consumed and

2936
02:19:26,760 --> 02:19:32,880
I've asked family members of his I I

2937
02:19:29,159 --> 02:19:35,200
know his son Mark pretty well and as far

2938
02:19:32,879 --> 02:19:37,039
as I know that I was the last person

2939
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:38,760
that ever consumed cannabis with Jack

2940
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:42,439
was the Jack ever consciously consumed

2941
02:19:38,760 --> 02:19:46,880
cannabis with wow what a that's that's a

2942
02:19:42,439 --> 02:19:49,120
crazy story it is you know and with that

2943
02:19:46,879 --> 02:19:50,879
story I I think it might be a good place

2944
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:53,920
to start to wrap it up because I think

2945
02:19:50,879 --> 02:19:57,559
that's a great story and what I want to

2946
02:19:53,920 --> 02:20:00,600
do is tell you that you know I I know we

2947
02:19:57,559 --> 02:20:04,920
stayed away from getting too technical

2948
02:20:00,600 --> 02:20:06,880
about um lighting science and you know

2949
02:20:04,920 --> 02:20:09,079
other technical stuff that you can

2950
02:20:06,879 --> 02:20:11,398
discuss and we want to invite you back

2951
02:20:09,079 --> 02:20:14,799
so this time we talked mostly about your

2952
02:20:11,398 --> 02:20:18,079
story and your stories and next time we

2953
02:20:14,799 --> 02:20:21,279
can talk more about um you know

2954
02:20:18,079 --> 02:20:23,280
different growing methods and

2955
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:25,280
you know and about lighting and then we

2956
02:20:23,280 --> 02:20:27,920
can sprinkle in some of your stories

2957
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:30,040
with those okay you know so cuz we know

2958
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:33,000
you you got some some stories still to

2959
02:20:30,040 --> 02:20:35,800
tell and course also about strains you

2960
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:37,680
know which strains you been working with

2961
02:20:35,799 --> 02:20:39,279
after because you have a long history

2962
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:41,840
there there's something called Grandma's

2963
02:20:39,280 --> 02:20:45,720
peach pie that right now is my absolute

2964
02:20:41,840 --> 02:20:50,639
favorite I'm told it peach rings cross

2965
02:20:45,719 --> 02:20:53,079
Granddaddy Purple um it tops itself into

2966
02:20:50,639 --> 02:20:57,439
each branch goes up and becomes three

2967
02:20:53,079 --> 02:20:58,520
branches uh outside it be it goes pre

2968
02:20:57,439 --> 02:21:01,800
floral

2969
02:20:58,520 --> 02:21:06,600
outside on on let's see the first time I

2970
02:21:01,799 --> 02:21:10,599
grew it it it was fully into pre-flow on

2971
02:21:06,600 --> 02:21:14,800
the 21st of July outside and fully into

2972
02:21:10,600 --> 02:21:18,840
Flow by the 1st of September it's not an

2973
02:21:14,799 --> 02:21:22,239
auto it's fast to go into flower but

2974
02:21:18,840 --> 02:21:25,920
then has a nice if you want basically it

2975
02:21:22,239 --> 02:21:29,719
will flower as long as you want like a

2976
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:33,200
haze very good and one thing before we

2977
02:21:29,719 --> 02:21:35,559
let you go is the farmer in the sky is

2978
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:37,560
is this something that's still available

2979
02:21:35,559 --> 02:21:39,559
and is is there any other thing that you

2980
02:21:37,559 --> 02:21:41,879
want to discuss as far as

2981
02:21:39,559 --> 02:21:43,119
like okay things that you're doing you

2982
02:21:41,879 --> 02:21:45,159
know want to make sure I'm giving you a

2983
02:21:43,120 --> 02:21:49,800
little time to plug yourself if anyone

2984
02:21:45,159 --> 02:21:51,840
out there wants to see the American

2985
02:21:49,799 --> 02:21:55,000
Consumer let's see the American College

2986
02:21:51,840 --> 02:21:56,159
of canaba culture the Canada sunmer

2987
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:59,478
Research

2988
02:21:56,159 --> 02:22:01,879
Institute uh happen they would happen up

2989
02:21:59,478 --> 02:22:04,760
in Maine there's a place up there I can

2990
02:22:01,879 --> 02:22:07,039
get into for a down payment of $100 to

2991
02:22:04,760 --> 02:22:09,880
$200,000 and the owner will carry

2992
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:13,120
contract I'm willing to sell good siiz

2993
02:22:09,879 --> 02:22:15,239
chunk of equity for it uh you would be

2994
02:22:13,120 --> 02:22:18,000
advancing the state of cannabis because

2995
02:22:15,239 --> 02:22:20,959
we will be doing research we will be a

2996
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:23,680
real vocational College teaching people

2997
02:22:20,959 --> 02:22:27,239
what they need to know to grow cannabis

2998
02:22:23,680 --> 02:22:29,840
properly for medicinal use um I think

2999
02:22:27,239 --> 02:22:31,799
all use you know I I do believe all use

3000
02:22:29,840 --> 02:22:33,359
is medicinal does it make you feel

3001
02:22:31,799 --> 02:22:36,519
better it's

3002
02:22:33,359 --> 02:22:39,120
medicinal it's that simple re read the

3003
02:22:36,520 --> 02:22:41,800
definition of medicinal and all cannabis

3004
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:44,840
meets that

3005
02:22:41,799 --> 02:22:47,799
definition um nice nice one but yeah I'm

3006
02:22:44,840 --> 02:22:49,760
looking forward to us doing more oh this

3007
02:22:47,799 --> 02:22:51,639
was fun I I I think I think we're going

3008
02:22:49,760 --> 02:22:53,478
to have to do at at least a few more I

3009
02:22:51,639 --> 02:22:56,358
know you also want to talk about uh

3010
02:22:53,478 --> 02:22:58,199
cannabis activism oh yeah and you know

3011
02:22:56,359 --> 02:22:59,880
so there's a ton that we want to talk

3012
02:22:58,200 --> 02:23:02,760
about I just wanted to make sure that we

3013
02:22:59,879 --> 02:23:05,159
had enough time to tell your story and

3014
02:23:02,760 --> 02:23:07,478
to hear some stories and but like I said

3015
02:23:05,159 --> 02:23:10,359
next time we'll get more in depth into

3016
02:23:07,478 --> 02:23:15,000
lighting science we'll make people's

3017
02:23:10,359 --> 02:23:18,600
heads and and um sort of just really

3018
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:22,239
quickly as far as books goes I am

3019
02:23:18,600 --> 02:23:25,079
currently working on what will be I

3020
02:23:22,239 --> 02:23:28,159
think probably my last book it's called

3021
02:23:25,079 --> 02:23:31,719
how to grow wiser a cultivator handbook

3022
02:23:28,159 --> 02:23:33,639
for growing cannabis sustainably and it

3023
02:23:31,719 --> 02:23:37,519
is all

3024
02:23:33,639 --> 02:23:41,879
about maximizing yields while minimizing

3025
02:23:37,520 --> 02:23:44,800
Eco damage and just it's full of little

3026
02:23:41,879 --> 02:23:46,278
stuff and and a lot of it is like most

3027
02:23:44,799 --> 02:23:48,719
of the most important discoveries in

3028
02:23:46,279 --> 02:23:52,079
growing have been well does things that

3029
02:23:48,719 --> 02:23:54,318
are there just really easy to see but no

3030
02:23:52,079 --> 02:23:56,760
one seems to notice them until someone

3031
02:23:54,318 --> 02:23:58,719
goes hey look at that and then everyone

3032
02:23:56,760 --> 02:24:01,680
else goes well

3033
02:23:58,719 --> 02:24:04,478
duh but it didn't get mentioned until

3034
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:07,439
that point and there's a lot of those

3035
02:24:04,478 --> 02:24:10,398
um well I I'm I'm just going to put it

3036
02:24:07,439 --> 02:24:13,200
on the record here right now I'm betting

3037
02:24:10,398 --> 02:24:16,318
it's not the last book you publish or Le

3038
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:18,479
your last literally you know I just just

3039
02:24:16,318 --> 02:24:19,840
knowing who you are a little bit I know

3040
02:24:18,478 --> 02:24:22,799
you're going to realize you got more to

3041
02:24:19,840 --> 02:24:25,200
say okay I should rephrase it my last my

3042
02:24:22,799 --> 02:24:28,119
last growing book I'm also working on my

3043
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:32,159
autobiography the title of which is if

3044
02:24:28,120 --> 02:24:32,160
you don't like my roller coaster

3045
02:24:33,879 --> 02:24:39,599
jump all righty wolf well I really

3046
02:24:36,879 --> 02:24:42,839
appreciate you joining us for the show

3047
02:24:39,600 --> 02:24:45,239
uh it you know and one thing I want to

3048
02:24:42,840 --> 02:24:48,439
say is Before I Let You

3049
02:24:45,239 --> 02:24:50,680
Go um a few months ago or actually was

3050
02:24:48,439 --> 02:24:53,479
actually a few years ago at this point I

3051
02:24:50,680 --> 02:24:56,479
got called an OG for the first time and

3052
02:24:53,478 --> 02:24:58,920
it was by capulator and I was like huh

3053
02:24:56,478 --> 02:25:01,760
you know and he said right but you know

3054
02:24:58,920 --> 02:25:03,719
what you and the people that you were

3055
02:25:01,760 --> 02:25:06,398
around back in the day you're the real

3056
02:25:03,719 --> 02:25:08,879
ogs and that's why that's why I never

3057
02:25:06,398 --> 02:25:11,318
thought of myself as an OG I always knew

3058
02:25:08,879 --> 02:25:14,199
about the people that you know came

3059
02:25:11,318 --> 02:25:18,119
before me I break it out into classes

3060
02:25:14,200 --> 02:25:20,720
and cohorts anyone that grew before 1970

3061
02:25:18,120 --> 02:25:22,359
like 1970 or before whether they were

3062
02:25:20,719 --> 02:25:25,760
here in the United States or an

3063
02:25:22,359 --> 02:25:28,880
indigenous grower elsewhere that's a

3064
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:32,600
Pioneer first wave is the people who

3065
02:25:28,879 --> 02:25:35,000
were growing prior to a lot of books

3066
02:25:32,600 --> 02:25:38,120
coming out on it and I would call that

3067
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:39,840
starting the the age of indoor growing

3068
02:25:38,120 --> 02:25:42,040
even though it really started a little

3069
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:45,719
before Steve Murphy's first book I

3070
02:25:42,040 --> 02:25:49,120
called those people from then until

3071
02:25:45,719 --> 02:25:51,519
green Merchant those are second

3072
02:25:49,120 --> 02:25:53,920
wave what year was the oh until green

3073
02:25:51,520 --> 02:25:57,680
Merchant until green Merchant so I came

3074
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:58,520
right after green Merchant 70 to 79 79

3075
02:25:57,680 --> 02:26:03,439
to

3076
02:25:58,520 --> 02:26:08,520
89 and then third wave are still ogs

3077
02:26:03,439 --> 02:26:11,720
anyone who grew before it was legal is

3078
02:26:08,520 --> 02:26:13,960
an OG they earned that right to think

3079
02:26:11,719 --> 02:26:16,159
they risked their freedom to do it they

3080
02:26:13,959 --> 02:26:19,000
earned that even if they weren't major

3081
02:26:16,159 --> 02:26:22,200
league or like that if you risk your

3082
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:24,040
freedom to grow cannabis you are an OG

3083
02:26:22,200 --> 02:26:26,800
