excited to continue the story with Kevin

21
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:08,478
JRE today um we had a great talk I think

22
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,759
it was a week ago and uh we weren't able

23
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,000
to complete it so we're doing this again

24
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:16,840
anyway here we

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,799
go what is that your smoking Kev uh some

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,880
cherry

27
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:22,320
pie cherry pie is one of my favorites

28
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:23,959
yeah know I love it too man it's just

29
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,438
it's just got it's it's a beautiful

30
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:30,199
plant it really is the

31
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:32,398
years you still have the cut obviously

32
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,960
no actually no I shared it out I I did a

33
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:36,519
bunch of breeding with it so I have it

34
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:38,639
in that form I'm just trying to you know

35
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:41,679
I mean I'm somebody that's collected

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,680
forever and there's a point in your life

37
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,520
where you just want less plants to have

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,439
to deal with in your own home yeah I get

39
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,199
it unfortunately that's how we uh I mean

40
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:55,319
you got to spread it out enough when you

41
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,039
do that because that's how we lose stuff

42
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:59,279
right oh totally totally and then you're

43
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:00,960
also at at the same time too put it into

44
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,680
put it into projects and then you can go

45
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,078
play around and go play with the tool

46
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,840
try to find it again through the hunt

47
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:12,598
yeah and like I said I I I if if I have

48
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,200
the ability to move the plant I move it

49
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,318
if you gave it to me and said Kev this

50
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:18,119
is for you you can't share it nobody can

51
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:22,479
breed with it I don't want it in the

52
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,120
system then I I I protect it and I've

53
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:27,479
always historically done that which is

54
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,120
what's let me access so much [ __ ] people

55
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,759
being able to trust you yeah I'm not

56
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,319
going to [ __ ] you on the plant it it

57
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:34,079
because at the at the end of the day I

58
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,560
can probably go around you and get it

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,360
from someone else too so it's just it's

60
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,120
just

61
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,440
this gentleman's agreement of if if it's

62
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,400
if I get it from you and you don't want

63
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:48,560
to touch then that's where it stays but

64
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,319
I always my entire career in in the game

65
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,920
I've always shared jeans and it's funny

66
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:55,439
but a long time ago that [ __ ] wasn't

67
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:57,759
popular people get pissed off because it

68
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,479
was um I want I almost want to call it

69
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,158
cultural elitism this idea a that only

70
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,878
the special people have the special

71
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,560
plants and I'm

72
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:08,959
like you don't have to be balling to be

73
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,319
special and once you got the right plant

74
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,959
it UPS your quality of life dramatically

75
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:17,119
if you know what to do with it and so

76
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,598
for me you know moving really valuable

77
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,640
plants into the

78
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:24,839
public it always pays off because one

79
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:27,158
you're doing something that's human and

80
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,120
second people that you give plants to

81
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:30,598
that are dependent on the plant and have

82
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,438
a different relation ship they're the

83
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:36,238
ones that actually hold it for 15

84
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:38,239
years so can I tell you a little story

85
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,599
yeah go back go big while you finish

86
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,719
rolling your joint I can roll it and

87
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:48,359
talk yeah um so I don't know how much

88
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:51,919
you know about my story but I had a

89
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:55,280
small little piece of the chem dog story

90
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:58,078
is I brought it out West I was the one

91
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,438
that got it from Greg and I drove it out

92
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,840
west and

93
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:05,359
at the time Greg had told me not to

94
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:09,000
really pass it around totally and the

95
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:13,799
only person that I gave it to was Jason

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,839
you know VA skunk yeah and he gave it to

97
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:21,759
one of his Partners Ben from IC

98
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:22,918
Collective yep and somehow after that it

99
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,639
really got

100
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:30,399
out and at the time not being as mature

101
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:33,240
as I am today and think thinking about

102
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,560
consequences like you you know you just

103
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,879
spoke about and also the advantages of

104
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,199
of giving out genetics I was kind of

105
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:42,959
pissed you know that it got out because

106
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:48,639
you know I was selling the chem dog for

107
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:50,000
6,400 a pound oh totally and so like out

108
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,960
right but but what I wanted to tell you

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,079
is so it got out I don't know exactly

110
00:04:52,959 --> 00:05:00,439
how it got out but it got out to the

111
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:04,599
world and you know with maturity

112
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:05,680
I realized that Not only was it good

113
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,639
that it got

114
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,959
out but that it was responsible for the

115
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:15,000
creation of so many new strains that

116
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,918
wouldn't have happened if it didn't get

117
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,439
out so at the time I was pissed and you

118
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:24,799
know had regrets that had had gotten out

119
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:28,439
but now I realized that was a great

120
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,720
thing that happened and it really it

121
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:32,879
increased the Legacy of the

122
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,319
plant you know so at a point there's a

123
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,719
there's a time and place where it just

124
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,800
needs to get out to

125
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,440
everybody you you because we like we

126
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,038
like we know we got the grateful Head

127
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:46,120
Right which is the idea a

128
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:48,199
repository and people don't catch that

129
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,120
like if you're in in in professional

130
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,280
plant

131
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,959
breeding most professional plant

132
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:56,559
breeders can go into a genan bank and

133
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:58,318
get true F1 stock right they can get

134
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,600
they can get true inbred lines they can

135
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,680
get a stock that's deriv from two M

136
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,080
brand lines which is a true F1 so they

137
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,079
can work on

138
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,240
projects and we don't have that in

139
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,120
cannabis what we have is like really you

140
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,840
know these loose collections which which

141
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,160
I love because they keep things alive

142
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:18,079
during the the dark ages of uh law

143
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:21,240
enforcement raid and so for me some of

144
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:23,240
the stuff that I lost I lost because it

145
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,680
wasn't just one raid it was like a raid

146
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,000
on us and then then uh another room

147
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,199
another house gets hit and so you you

148
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,120
end up having things lost

149
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:38,280
and the ability to be able to keep these

150
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:40,759
plants alive just and a lot of it

151
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:42,598
is I just want to say it's a mark in

152
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:46,160
time it's like a memory

153
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:49,399
stamp and so when you when even if it's

154
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,880
no longer what it once was to you it's

155
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:54,359
something you know like I I connect the

156
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:56,759
plants to like that

157
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:01,038
AK-47 bought my

158
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:03,479
house that OG bought my [ __ ] Farm

159
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:06,478
like it was that single plant that I

160
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:08,000
multiplied into money that that did it

161
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:11,038
and so I always have this you know this

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,720
relationship mentally and it's it's it's

163
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,000
it's stuff like that that it's not even

164
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,479
about today's commercial usage it's just

165
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,680
that these things we touched and and

166
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:24,360
historically had relationships with and

167
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,240
so I think that the idea of like as many

168
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,919
people possible touching the plant as

169
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,960
many PE people possible moving it around

170
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:34,120
as long as somebody holds it in its

171
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,799
original form right and and what we know

172
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,160
now too is that when we hold plants in

173
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,240
original form I don't give a [ __ ] you

174
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,000
scrub and they don't you take a plant

175
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,800
and you expose it to 30 years of

176
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,038
impact that impact changes the plant the

177
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,759
plant picks that up and even though when

178
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:51,759
we use the word like genetic drift

179
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,919
genetic drift implies breeding and it

180
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,120
implies you're losing track of the

181
00:07:54,918 --> 00:08:00,359
traits of interest that originally were

182
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,879
in your lens and so you're breeding a

183
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,000
plant or you're breeding a dog and

184
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:05,360
you're moving slowly away from the

185
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,598
traits that you were originally

186
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,879
interested in until they're no longer

187
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:12,598
present so yes you're breeding the same

188
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:13,639
line without the same traits that's

189
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:15,800
genetic

190
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:18,439
drift I'm just talking about like

191
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,840
epigenetic influence change where every

192
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:22,959
time you clone the plant every every

193
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:25,519
time it's it's sprayed with a product

194
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:29,878
every time it's going through some cycle

195
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:31,839
subtle change and degre it yeah and and

196
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,800
and modifies itself and like a really

197
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:36,038
good example is and I did this years ago

198
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,158
and I was talking to somebody about it

199
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:41,120
but I had a you know whole OG collection

200
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:43,559
right and so and I'm running all of them

201
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,000
so I know exactly they are not the same

202
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:48,079
plant right they are definitely

203
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,159
flowering time profile uh just all the

204
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,000
different factors that you would say hey

205
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:55,600
side by side the shit's not the same but

206
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,440
when we DNA them they all came out as

207
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,159
Josh do OG ghost OG right so they all

208
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,760
came out as this original and so the the

209
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,159
theory was that's all S1 right they're

210
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,639
all s1's but the truth of it was that

211
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:10,519
when we really went into the DNA

212
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:12,278
analysis they were all ghost OG and me

213
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:13,360
and the science team arguing about it

214
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:14,958
because they're like they're all the

215
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,560
same we're just calling them different

216
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,119
things and I'm like yeah but as a grower

217
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,599
they're definitely not the same thing

218
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,519
because the traits are radically

219
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,040
different but the ne but the DNA doesn't

220
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:26,440
lie and and someone online I was talking

221
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,679
to the other day a scientist out of

222
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,680
Europe was like DNA doesn't lie but it

223
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:33,159
also sometimes it's hard to get the

224
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:34,399
truth out of it because we have to

225
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:38,759
understand how to really look at what

226
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:41,240
we're seeing and it was this it was this

227
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:44,200
theory that when we talk about why

228
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:47,600
plants have changed over time and so

229
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,040
many of them have it's who held it and

230
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,200
how was it held and that's why you have

231
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:55,000
so many variations of all the similar

232
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,800
same plants it's this cut of that plant

233
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,879
and the truth of it is is it's the exact

234
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:03,479
same plant but it slowly mock ified

235
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:06,200
after two three four 500 colonal Cycles

236
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:10,120
can I respond to that yeah how about

237
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:13,600
like this as an example let's say we

238
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:16,959
could clone a human mhm and so let's say

239
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,879
there was a clone of Gabby Staten Island

240
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,399
or Kevin JRE and it was completely

241
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:24,919
identical

242
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:26,120
but one of these clones took care of

243
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:28,879
himself

244
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,759
differently okay maybe one Gabby Staten

245
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:33,958
Island eats nothing but

246
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:37,759
McDonald's and and Coca-Cola and and

247
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:42,119
fast food and and doesn't exercise and

248
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:46,399
then there's another one that um eats a

249
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,600
healthy meal you know healthy diet and

250
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,480
exercises when they're both

251
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,399
90 they're both going to look

252
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,800
dramatically different totally say oh

253
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:58,879
this this is these aren't the same

254
00:10:54,799 --> 00:11:01,000
people but actually the DNA is the same

255
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:03,600
yeah when you look at DNA the DNA is not

256
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,839
going to tell devation right DNA is not

257
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,000
going to tell you how you were cared for

258
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,120
as you know as you you know go through

259
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,919
your years and that's going to have an

260
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,399
effect on the body of a human or the

261
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,039
body of a plant correct totally and we

262
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,879
we we were also you know the the

263
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:22,639
conversation was about where did a lot

264
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,519
of these profiles why have they

265
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,120
diminished why they no longer

266
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,560
so

267
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,320
extraordinary and I take a look at I'm

268
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:32,958
just like you know I said it I don't

269
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,839
think that it's so much any kind of

270
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,679
procedural change because that would be

271
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:40,079
easy to fix if you

272
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:42,319
were if you working with your plant and

273
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,879
you notice the change in the quality of

274
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,600
it from crop to crop you'd be like wait

275
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,240
a second I'm going the wrong way with my

276
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,360
process you typically wouldn't improve

277
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,919
it and so if your drying method becomes

278
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,639
more scientific and your quality

279
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:57,719
decreases you go back to War by field

280
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:01,159
right as a grower you're flexible with

281
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,839
what you do but when you and I think

282
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:06,439
it's the the age of chemical uh

283
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,959
cannabis that when we really started to

284
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,320
focus on pesticides and

285
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:13,479
insecticides and growth Regulators you

286
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,240
started to change the metabolic pathways

287
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,079
of the plant because the plant no longer

288
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,839
had the need to produce those

289
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:22,599
metabolites so it started to slowly shut

290
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,760
off that production route and over the

291
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,278
course of 2030 years and all the fuels

292
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:28,600
are the ones that you really see a lot

293
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:30,919
of this in in terms of they were so

294
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,720
heavily covered in

295
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:35,439
these

296
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,759
adulterant that over the course of 30

297
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,320
years of doing it they just stop

298
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,720
producing what's not needed and then the

299
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,480
issue is then someone's like you know

300
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,560
you scrub it right so I I thought if we

301
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,120
scrub it we go back to zero but no we go

302
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,719
back to the zero of that day we don't go

303
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,919
back to when it came out of the seed

304
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,560
right it's a nice idea but all you're

305
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:56,958
doing is cleaning up the plant but

306
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:59,879
you're not cleaning up the epigenetic

307
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:02,638
change TC doesn't [ __ ] scrub the

308
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:06,120
genes it it allows you to outgrow a

309
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:09,079
pathogen it but it doesn't undo what

310
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,159
we've done so I mean I and I love TC I

311
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:11,719
think it's probably the you know one of

312
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,480
the best tools you could possibly have

313
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,480
for you know modern day

314
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,199
cannabis because we have so many

315
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,278
different issues that are spread through

316
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:22,919
conventional propagation now because we

317
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:25,799
have all these different a forms

318
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:27,679
touching us and so for the first time

319
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:29,759
ever herb is touching everything because

320
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,479
its location spread from from a closet

321
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,720
to a field to the Central Valley and now

322
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,079
you're in the middle of some of the you

323
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,040
know largest a production Zone on

324
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:42,799
Earth the cross-contamination is

325
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:44,319
unreal but regardless you still have to

326
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:45,879
you still have to do the best you can to

327
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,839
hold the stock and it's the same thing

328
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:48,919
with like land race preservation where

329
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,320
the minute you take it out of the

330
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:52,679
country origin you're not really doing

331
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,639
land race preservation but you're

332
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:56,879
preserving what you can so I don't think

333
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:58,198
cuz someone said you know when when

334
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,559
you're trying to do what you're doing

335
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:02,078
Kev you're not doing anything and I said

336
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:03,799
well I kind of am though because really

337
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:06,679
what the goal is is to get people to be

338
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:07,758
aware of stock that's not what we would

339
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,159
call

340
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:12,360
domesticated to get people to be aware

341
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,319
of other cultures that produce cannabis

342
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,680
in other

343
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,399
forms and to be able to get access to

344
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:20,319
that material and that's the part of the

345
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,559
preservation that's really occurring but

346
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,480
the idea of preserving that material in

347
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:27,159
its true form can only be done in its

348
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,278
true form so like Colombia would have to

349
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:33,399
do its own preservation

350
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:35,439
you know um Gene protection California

351
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:38,480
we don't have any native stock we would

352
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:42,880
just work with what we have but Pakistan

353
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,759
Afghanistan India Lebanon you know Place

354
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:47,278
Colombia that's had you know four 500

355
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,600
years of cannabis in

356
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,720
place that's where I think that the

357
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,199
preservation has to occur but since you

358
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,320
we don't have control of that we do the

359
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:58,359
best we can so we work limited

360
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,839
populations ideally you know it'd be

361
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,800
like like Sam was saying you know 10,000

362
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,399
is the population you want where you

363
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:07,919
have full open po population of 10,000

364
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,399
into bread that gives you enough genetic

365
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,679
capture to say that you've captured the

366
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,078
the the qualities of a gene pool for

367
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:17,958
future preservation nobody's doing

368
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:20,000
10,000 [ __ ] plants on a preservation

369
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:22,599
it's just it's just impractical you know

370
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,759
we don't have that ability most people

371
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,519
are doing 10 or 20 seeds and think that

372
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:28,120
that's getting and they're and they're

373
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,560
picking breeding a lot and sometimes it

374
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,480
works if you you know the outliers

375
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:36,078
always emerge I think that the a good

376
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,839
story for people is uh uh super boo

377
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:40,599
right where the guy that does Super boo

378
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,440
came out of two 10 packs right so he

379
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,278
buys a pack of seeds of one buys a pack

380
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,399
of seeds of the other selects out a male

381
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:47,958
and a female puts him together he gets

382
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,559
Leafly strain of the

383
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:54,039
air and that's just phenomenal but now

384
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:57,119
people will see that and say I too can

385
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:59,599
do this and you're like maybe right

386
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,120
maybe maybe you know it's doesn't always

387
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,120
work and sometimes you can go through

388
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,440
100,000 seeds and if the if the the

389
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,679
alals aren't present that contain that

390
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,160
that that information that [ __ ] isn't

391
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,879
moving forward if you don't get to if

392
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,519
you know you can have one copy and then

393
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:16,078
a mutated copy if you're not the copy is

394
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:17,959
not present or they're both mutant

395
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:21,919
that's done you just don't have that

396
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:24,838
that information to move forward so I

397
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:28,120
think that we do the best we can but a

398
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,880
lot of it is is private people that do

399
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,318
Banking and you know you're one of them

400
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:35,399
I'm one of them you are you you you uh

401
00:16:32,318 --> 00:16:37,838
you save plants too sash of course I

402
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:40,240
have a I'm a librarian you know I have a

403
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,279
facility in Austria where we have 35

404
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,879
different

405
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:46,399
cultivar uh in preservation form you

406
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:48,278
know we cloning moms traditionally we

407
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,839
going to do tissue culture in the future

408
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:53,360
so that is our perspective of it you

409
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:55,680
know I'm following you since many years

410
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,800
since you did uh Wonderland Nursery I

411
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:59,439
saw the videos where you are in the

412
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:01,919
nursery you know

413
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,319
uh and before I wanted to ask you

414
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,000
because you were talking about this

415
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:08,480
genetic drift I remember very clearly

416
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,078
that you were talking about Lou the 30

417
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,759
no jush in one video and you were

418
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:15,399
showing the plant and you were talking

419
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:17,279
about that you were doing uh Bashi and

420
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,559
gashi techniques to bring it back

421
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,798
because it was kind of sick because

422
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:24,160
these people that brought you this plant

423
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:27,000
uh brought you a sick plant actually so

424
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,640
you tried to actually how is it still

425
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,679
alive I mean do you still alive and it

426
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,840
got moved into the system the thing with

427
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,880
the Louie was the Louie came out of a a

428
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:39,879
group of Armenian Brothers in Los

429
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,799
Angeles and out of some crazy

430
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,720
coincidence I help out their

431
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:45,679
mother-in-law right like she's just an

432
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,960
older lady she's nice and I'm just nice

433
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:53,200
to her one day and I help her out with

434
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:56,360
the problem and she um uh gives my phone

435
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,880
number to her son-in-law and he hits me

436
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:03,479
up and he's like hey I'm I'm this dude

437
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:06,080
and so he rolls up in a in a a a Range

438
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,240
Rover with uh his crew they all hop out

439
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:10,599
in suits and they hand me a couple

440
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,640
clones and say this will change your

441
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:14,279
life and I was laughing cuz I already

442
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,840
had a whole OG collection right so it

443
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:18,759
just one more OG yeah but it was this

444
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:20,639
beautiful thought and it was a thanks

445
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:23,319
and I app I was just grateful because it

446
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,799
was like so pure where you helped out

447
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:28,200
our mother-in-law we're going to help

448
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:32,639
you with um the ability to make money

449
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:35,919
and the the issue was what we we we had

450
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,520
discovered with um like hop Leighton

451
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,000
because like remember I've been doing

452
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:40,960
this [ __ ] for a long time so like when h

453
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,319
l pops up we're all getting [ __ ]

454
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,759
hammered by it because none of us really

455
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:45,519
know we we know there's some kind of

456
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:50,000
mutation but we don't understand what it

457
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:53,079
is but I get lucky in that I get uh a

458
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,919
team of scientists that come to me and

459
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:58,759
out of SoCal Central Cal and and humble

460
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,320
and this this cat named Rick Crum a PhD

461
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:02,879
unist named Rick

462
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,558
crumb says hey what we have is we've

463
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,039
discovered some kind of pathogenic

464
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,720
problem we don't understand it we don't

465
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:10,720
have a name for it right now but we know

466
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,440
what it's doing we understand what it's

467
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:17,360
doing to the plant but we just don't

468
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:19,120
know what it is and we wanted to uh see

469
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,519
if you wanted to play around with the

470
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:23,319
project and I was like I'm down I said

471
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:24,798
because I was having a conversation with

472
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:27,720
this guy named Allan

473
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:29,319
Atkinson who's from um the probiotic

474
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,839
Farmers Alliance right right him and him

475
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:33,678
and Mike had created the

476
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:36,959
alliance and and Allen's background was

477
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:40,880
in um silage fermentation Anor

478
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:44,240
robics and so he had this belief that if

479
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:47,120
we return the system back to this

480
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,919
anerobic driven low oxygen environment

481
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,798
which is really what Earth is right

482
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:52,240
there it's very low O2 and when I had

483
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:54,119
this discussion with elain inam because

484
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,079
elain inam came to visit me after she

485
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:59,719
saw this so we could kind of understand

486
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:01,720
how do you define low oxygen

487
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,759
and it's really like this just line of

488
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:07,798
PPM how many parts per million a present

489
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:10,319
so she she was like if you don't have

490
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:13,519
you know oxygen driven compost tea it

491
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,720
won't work and I showed her Allen's sub

492
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:17,038
irrigation

493
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,558
system and she realized that there's

494
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:22,200
like this gray area that's in between

495
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:24,678
anerobic and aerobics and it just

496
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,120
becomes this determination of what do

497
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:30,759
you define as low or no

498
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:32,599
oxygen and what Allen's deal was that he

499
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:36,640
believed that if you put a plant back

500
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:39,240
into this sub irrigation system and you

501
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,440
allowed it to naturally you know Drive

502
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:45,880
its function we should see a return to

503
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,400
homostasis so he has a hypothesis right

504
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,000
and I said all right let's let's let's

505
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,759
see if we can turn it into a theory

506
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,558
let's try to prove the

507
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:57,279
hypothesis and I end up getting that

508
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:58,798
that plant from the lab and it's

509
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,839
infected and we know it so we put it

510
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:04,759
into isolation I put it into that system

511
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:06,519
and over the course of like 45 days it

512
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:08,319
basically just sat still I mean because

513
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:10,798
it was heavily impacted and impacted

514
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:12,918
would imply in this case it was a Girl

515
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:15,038
Scout cookie cut it came from an

516
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:17,960
operation that used to have 100% strike

517
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:19,640
rate it went down to like 3% strike rate

518
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,480
so out of the Thousand clones you know

519
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,640
they were getting 30 no way like I mean

520
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,360
yeah just low and so they said hey we

521
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,640
know this is impacted this is what the

522
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:30,079
impact is let's see if we can do it so I

523
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,880
take it and I put it in the system and I

524
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:35,639
sit it in this in this this chamber and

525
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,360
it just sits and all of a sudden I

526
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:41,720
started to see like the the the surface

527
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:44,399
cracking and you could see new cambial

528
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:47,558
material forming like these lines coming

529
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,240
up and as this new Cambio material was

530
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:53,759
creating it was shedding all its old

531
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,919
leaves and new leaves were appearing mhm

532
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:58,640
and once I had this new formation I cut

533
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,600
those clones and they all rooted and and

534
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,600
then I put him under uh light to grow

535
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:06,199
them up but I stressed one side of a

536
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:08,199
tray because it was getting too much

537
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,000
light exposure for its age and it

538
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,278
retriggered the Hop Laten and because I

539
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,798
had the lab constantly testing

540
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:18,079
everything we were like whoa so that was

541
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:20,798
when we discovered that if you can keep

542
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:21,879
a plant in in some form of homostasis a

543
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:24,519
Natural

544
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,559
Balance the The Hop L doesn't seem to be

545
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:29,079
an issue it can work with it doesn't

546
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:30,879
mean it won't transmit it but it didn't

547
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:33,000
affect its secondary metabolite

548
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,000
production doesn't that also depend on

549
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,119
the viral production by

550
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,440
weight doesn't that also depend on the

551
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:42,319
viral load like if there's a low viral

552
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,400
load impct it very much it does it does

553
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,079
but this PL these plants were covered so

554
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,960
they had high high load they were

555
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:51,000
absolutely falling apart which was let's

556
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,840
let's try because there was they didn't

557
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,319
understand that the degree of in they

558
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:58,519
the brilliant guys but you got remember

559
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:59,839
it's the dawn of this problem right same

560
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:01,079
with like russet mites and [ __ ] like

561
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:02,199
that where people be like had russet

562
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:04,240
mites I'm like well who the [ __ ] didn't

563
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,798
nobody knew we had them we we had to go

564
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,960
buy a microscope to identify the problem

565
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:13,200
because there was no predecessor before

566
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,600
us to identify it so when you're when

567
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,200
you're in an industry and you're like

568
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:18,879
you're first right you're you're you're

569
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,759
doing this at speed you're going to

570
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,720
catch all the problems and it's it's

571
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:25,640
it's interesting because when you get

572
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,038
into science it's the same for them just

573
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,880
because they're brilliant and they have

574
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,640
every tool known to mankind doesn't mean

575
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,240
they understand the problem they just

576
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,720
discovered so we're trying to figure out

577
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,679
is this something you can work with and

578
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,440
when I stressed those plants the ones

579
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:44,720
that got stressed reverted and the ones

580
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,720
that didn't didn't and I was like woo I

581
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,240
got you all we have to do is add some

582
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:53,038
stress load to the organism and the the

583
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,159
vroid reemerges so we knew that you

584
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:58,558
could have plants that that appeared

585
00:23:55,159 --> 00:24:00,600
completely clean but without testing you

586
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,839
weren't aware you were passing the vroid

587
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:05,519
forward because your operation wasn't

588
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:07,678
overly stressing the plant and on the

589
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,558
ones that were

590
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,519
undressed meaning they were you know

591
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:14,960
kept with with the balance the the the

592
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:16,720
strike rate went right back up to a 100%

593
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,720
so we went right back up to a th000 out

594
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,480
of a thousand on the plug so it worked

595
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:26,519
well for them but it let me understand

596
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:31,159
how plants respond and how we impact

597
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:33,240
these issues so when I cut that um box

598
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:35,600
in and I already had the cut from from

599
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,319
on the Louie I put it in that system to

600
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:40,519
see if I could do the same thing could I

601
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:43,119
get it to return back to like an

602
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:47,119
original state and it kind of did the

603
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:49,639
same thing it it it it it changed and it

604
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:51,639
became a beautiful plant again and then

605
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,120
I shared that out into the public and so

606
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,320
a bunch of different people have it

607
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:57,759
Allen still runs it a couple local farms

608
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:59,839
still use it as their um component if

609
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,319
you got a copy of that you probably had

610
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:04,158
to have got it from me because it was

611
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:07,119
nobody that was it was an in-house OG

612
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,679
held by a group that did not share the

613
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:13,000
cut because it was super valuable at the

614
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:15,080
time I have a cross you know in my

615
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,720
facility we have a cross with it's

616
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:22,519
called zoft I don't know how you

617
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:24,480
Americans call it but it's Z A W uh TZ

618
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:27,079
it's from compound you know it's a

619
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,679
breeder cut from from Chris and it's

620
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:32,158
Louis the 1 G cross to Skittles totally

621
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:35,360
and you might they might have they might

622
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:39,120
have got that like when when node first

623
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:40,959
started note and conception basically

624
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:42,879
the majority of the plants that they put

625
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,159
into the system came from

626
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,480
me so like when when node lit up as an

627
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,640
operation it was through my collection

628
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,759
that they mined the majority of that

629
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,480
original stock before they before they

630
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:57,839
built the relationship with with Chris

631
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:01,278
right so you got you got Chris Lynch who

632
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:03,278
was compound who then merges with node

633
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:05,839
that becomes compound then they have a

634
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:08,440
Fallout but before all that took place

635
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:10,158
when node first lit up we were all going

636
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,798
to work together and they came over and

637
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:16,000
harvested a tremendous amount of

638
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:17,480
material from us to begin the project so

639
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,798
I'm not saying he definitely got it from

640
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,720
me but there's some plants that I know

641
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:24,240
without a question that [ __ ] was not in

642
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:27,839
the system till I put it in the system

643
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,240
MH and but it's a nice feeling it's

644
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:31,720
critical

645
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,079
you have yeah you got to you got to put

646
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,360
the genes in so that people can play and

647
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:39,119
at the end of the day it it it's just

648
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:42,959
about interest right if you can spark

649
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:44,398
interest in people and you know what

650
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,720
there's always a plant that's like

651
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:48,278
mythological unicorn in your mind that

652
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,519
if you could get your hands on this your

653
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:52,640
whole world would be better right that's

654
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:54,158
a beautiful thing and sometimes when you

655
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,720
get the plant you know the hype is

656
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,520
bigger than the reality and you're like

657
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,720
it's plant then other times you get a

658
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,918
hold of something and you're like wow

659
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,360
this is gorgeous I would love to smoke

660
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,840
this every day for the next 10

661
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:09,240
years and you don't know you just don't

662
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:12,319
and so the idea though is to create the

663
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:15,480
excitement and to get people to be

664
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:17,759
curious and then a lot of it is you know

665
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,880
for the for the older crowd which I'm

666
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,798
one of them it's this idea of like

667
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,720
trying to go back in time and touch

668
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:26,879
things from our youth because so much of

669
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,759
it's gone but it like I said it's it

670
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,520
changes that's this discussion about

671
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:36,200
Sour about Sour Diesel and all the you

672
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:38,278
know which one is yours and I'm like the

673
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,880
good one because when I ran 20 different

674
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:41,558
ones side by side that's the one that

675
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:45,080
stood out do I really give a [ __ ] what

676
00:27:41,558 --> 00:27:47,480
the name is at this point no because

677
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:49,759
unless you're un and even from the dudes

678
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,599
that held the [ __ ] half of them lost the

679
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,599
[ __ ] you've been in the game long enough

680
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,719
you got raided you got raided your

681
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:57,519
[ __ ] plants vanished then you got to

682
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,839
get plants back from someone else the

683
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,319
minute that [ __ ] leaves your hand and

684
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:04,678
goes to anybody

685
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:06,960
else maybe it comes back the

686
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:08,840
same sometimes sometimes comes back

687
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,159
better some people actually you know

688
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:12,918
they're they're holding them in in

689
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,519
naturally lit spaces you got them in

690
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:16,919
supplementally lit green houses you're

691
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:19,679
running them under biological drive to

692
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:20,480
keep them healthy but the plants that

693
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,159
you

694
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,240
selected originally were under light and

695
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:27,840
chemical and rock wool and that's why

696
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:30,079
you selected the plant so like the idea

697
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:32,000
that every plant is better biologically

698
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:33,918
sungrown is not true because the

699
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,720
selection was done under artificial

700
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,038
light with chemical right so I'm like

701
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,880
it's it's the impact of everything

702
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:43,278
together that creates that

703
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,080
equation and people have to understand

704
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:46,679
it that you know I mean some of the I I

705
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:48,119
swear to God some of the best OG I ever

706
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,840
smoked in my life came out of Todd

707
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:52,719
McCormick's Rockwall block so you know

708
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:54,319
he's got the original OG but when we

709
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,679
were smoking it at his house I was like

710
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:59,599
goddamn Todd that's really good OG

711
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:02,840
cush and you couldn't deny it I had some

712
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:06,359
sun grown sfv that was cracking

713
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:09,199
but it had an influence that was a

714
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:11,639
little different than what my memory was

715
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,200
of OG because OG was all originally

716
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,120
indoor

717
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:19,640
driven yeah true I wanted to respond to

718
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:22,398
that by uh mentioning a comment that

719
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:25,080
Michael wolf seagull made in the last

720
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:28,639
podcast we recorded and he talked about

721
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:31,639
how there's I believe he said eight

722
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:35,799
Tarpin or six Tarpin that will never be

723
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:37,880
found on indoor cannabis because the UV

724
00:29:35,798 --> 00:29:39,398
light isn't there unless you're

725
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,278
supplementing I believe he said with

726
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:45,479
like UVB which most people aren't going

727
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:48,038
to do so when you talk about the way

728
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:51,038
certain stuff taste if it was Su

729
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:52,599
grown or or indoor grown you're not

730
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:55,558
going to have that UV and then you might

731
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:58,959
not have those Tarpin which is what you

732
00:29:55,558 --> 00:30:01,720
remember as you know the the flavor

733
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,880
profile of that and the lack the lack of

734
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,600
because remember they're they're all

735
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,519
you're you're you're making something

736
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:07,719
right you're going to use it like

737
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:10,640
cooking right you're going to you're

738
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:14,200
going to make a dish sometimes what you

739
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:17,840
added or what you didn't add creates the

740
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:19,880
quality and so when you're talking about

741
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:22,278
anything to do with secondary metabolite

742
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,880
profile and influence when you're

743
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:27,159
looking at like hop hop testing is

744
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,440
pretty comprehensive more comprehensive

745
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,519
than cannabis because there was no

746
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,278
illegality to it right but when you're

747
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:35,960
looking at Hop testing you can take two

748
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:38,599
identical hop cultivars that have a

749
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,079
single ppb difference in one metabolite

750
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:42,480
part per billion and you swear to God

751
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:44,639
they were two radically different

752
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,640
animals and we're talking everything

753
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:51,320
lines up flawlessly except one

754
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:54,440
metabolite at part per billion and so

755
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:56,000
our ideas of like looking at a COA is

756
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,519
like this is telling me something it's

757
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,440
not telling you [ __ ] it's telling you

758
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:02,399
what they want you to know but that

759
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,480
doesn't mean that that's what you need

760
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:06,918
to know it's good that we're Gathering

761
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,038
some information but it doesn't tell us

762
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:10,840
the whole picture no no because at the

763
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:13,519
end of the day right what about

764
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:17,480
Moonlight because moonlight's it's

765
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:20,200
reflection it how does that bent

766
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,079
Spectrum influence it and so when I I

767
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,759
got to do I got to I got lucky that I'm

768
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:25,158
not a [ __ ] scientist my mother was

769
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,599
right and so I'm always really clear

770
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:30,919
about what a scientist is it's extremely

771
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:34,278
f focused prove it multiple multiple

772
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:38,080
locations kind of thing but it lets you

773
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:39,720
understand that science is as powerful a

774
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:41,398
tool as there ever was but it's not

775
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,278
omnipotent it doesn't understand

776
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:44,759
everything until until it's able to

777
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:47,880
really kind of rip it into

778
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:50,440
pieces and I got brought in to do the

779
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:52,200
led development for Helio Spectra when

780
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,278
they first lit up as a business and they

781
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,038
came into North America I got selected

782
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:58,359
as the person with the operation they

783
00:31:56,038 --> 00:31:59,960
wanted to do the the trials with which

784
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:02,759
was unbelievable because it was the

785
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,000
first really tunable LED plates you

786
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:06,798
could do anything with them they were

787
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,240
like 15 16 Grand a plate at the time

788
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:12,679
right full iPad control I mean [ __ ] that

789
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,359
they're talking about now that [ __ ] was

790
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:16,840
in

791
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:18,398
208 right so in 208 the company flies in

792
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:21,599
the president flies in team of

793
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:25,439
scientists fly in we set up the the test

794
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:27,398
operation I'm running the same Cult of

795
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,919
art but under their system and then

796
00:32:27,398 --> 00:32:32,678
under my system side by

797
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,840
side and the the the part that was

798
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:36,840
fascinating was that the level of light

799
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:38,359
Engineers they brought in were brilliant

800
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:41,119
and there was a woman out of the UK

801
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:42,798
named Tessa Babcock that she she worked

802
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:44,398
for the Bill Gates

803
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:47,960
Institute

804
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:50,959
and she she was making sure that I

805
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,399
understood that it's the information

806
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,319
that the sun

807
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:58,839
provides via these frequencies that we

808
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:00,678
don't understand so she's just like look

809
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:01,720
she goes I don't she goes like like she

810
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,639
go I'm working for the Bill Gates

811
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,480
Institute she goes it's [ __ ]

812
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:06,599
unlimited money she goes there's nothing

813
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,880
but super Geniuses in the room she goes

814
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:12,558
I'm telling you we barely understand

815
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,440
what's taking place from sunlight we

816
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:16,918
really don't understand so what we do is

817
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:20,399
we do the best we can to create an

818
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:22,519
effect and by using steered tuning it

819
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:23,918
allows us to do some interesting stuff

820
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:26,399
and for the like and it was the and the

821
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:29,639
example was it was on on basil right the

822
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:32,719
plant and it was pertaining to certain

823
00:33:29,638 --> 00:33:35,240
countries like

824
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,720
different Leaf shape they like different

825
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:40,200
length and elongation all they do is

826
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,720
dial in the Spectra to make that occur

827
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,319
she says all of these that you're

828
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,038
looking at she says I'm showing you all

829
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:48,158
these basle samples she goes it's all

830
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:50,960
the same [ __ ] she goes we adjust the

831
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,278
morphology through spectral tuning which

832
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,480
makes the country happy it's kind of

833
00:33:53,278 --> 00:34:01,159
like like motor oil the the Americans

834
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:03,038
like golden oil Japanese like green oil

835
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:04,399
right so when you buy motor oil in Japan

836
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:06,558
and you pour it into your car that [ __ ]

837
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:08,480
comes out green when you pour when you

838
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:10,358
pour motor oil into your car in America

839
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,280
it [ __ ] comes out gold it's because

840
00:34:10,358 --> 00:34:16,239
Americans believe that golden oil is

841
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:18,560
clean oil and it's good oil and Japanese

842
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,358
believe that green oil is good oil

843
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:22,759
that's it's an additive right has zero

844
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:24,598
to do with with viscosity or any of

845
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,879
those Shear factors anything that

846
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:29,679
implies fluid dynamics under tension

847
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:31,118
right when under pressure and heat it's

848
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,720
purely about what people like and what

849
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,320
they don't like and that's what was so

850
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,918
fascinating with you know the indoor

851
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:39,200
world to me and the tuning and the

852
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:41,398
adjustment and the and the focus it's

853
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,519
just that if we if you're if you're

854
00:34:41,398 --> 00:34:46,598
using these things to hold things long

855
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:51,000
term over the course of 15 20 years you

856
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:54,200
have to have change and so it's it's

857
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
it's this reality that it it helped me

858
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:58,239
understand that like I was chasing skunk

859
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,920
for [ __ ] ever because had this

860
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:02,639
massive collection of it so I I for

861
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,880
whatever reason I was just really about

862
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:06,920
it so I had acquired a collection of

863
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,480
plants that all had a really really

864
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,280
similar Aroma profile but very different

865
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:14,639
morphological

866
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,880
traits and so I said you know and I lost

867
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,799
him in a raid in like early 2000 and

868
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,920
then the the mom room that we had as a

869
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,320
redundant mom room it got hit in an arm

870
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,720
robbery and the idiots that robbed the

871
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,240
spot thought it was a grow house they

872
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:29,759
didn't realize it was a mom bank so when

873
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:32,078
they came there was no flower so they

874
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,800
you arm robbery [ __ ] family gets held

875
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:38,440
at gunpoint they take the moms and

876
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,960
[ __ ] and it was done right we lose that

877
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,280
stock so I go back into the world to see

878
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,240
if I can find it and I'm digging and I'm

879
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,480
digging and I'm digging and and it

880
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:50,078
wasn't that like I'm going to be the

881
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:53,480
Discover of it it it wasn't about a

882
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:55,680
public like it has to be C it was that I

883
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:59,119
was excited about looking for something

884
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:02,078
that used to exist and when you when you

885
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,800
share hunts with people in a lot of

886
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,200
regards it inspires people to hunt their

887
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,920
own [ __ ] not just the chase that but the

888
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:10,159
chase what you wanted you wanted you

889
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,639
know I want the old piff cut I got way

890
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:13,759
back in the day because none of these

891
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:15,480
have that that what do you call it the

892
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,839
bathroom the bathroom test where you

893
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,599
walk in the bathroom and the shit's

894
00:36:16,838 --> 00:36:20,119
still hanging in the air 10 minutes

895
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:22,720
after you burn a

896
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:24,920
joint it's that it's doing it's the it's

897
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:27,159
the Chase and I don't care what

898
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,240
population I went through and and this

899
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:30,838
created this whole online [ __ ] storm

900
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:32,199
about people saying I got the real [ __ ]

901
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:36,039
I'm like well if somebody's got the real

902
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:40,799
one break the [ __ ] thing out so that

903
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:44,318
somebody can at least enjoy it

904
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,519
and we haven't seen it so there's stunky

905
00:36:44,318 --> 00:36:48,000
and there's things but it's just I

906
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:50,920
couldn't find it and I got to a point

907
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,960
where I just stopped looking because I

908
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,358
got tired of digging in the Jean Pool

909
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,280
like I mean someone said did you find it

910
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:57,920
I said no I said I dug for years I went

911
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,400
through all these populations from out

912
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,880
of the country I went through old

913
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,519
populations that I was digging through I

914
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:07,280
couldn't find it I I found stuff that

915
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:08,920
was really aromatic and I had I had a

916
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,920
skunk out of like

917
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:14,639
1981 like old old skunk out of the hills

918
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:18,720
of humble ancient held forever but it

919
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:21,279
didn't have that that we would say skunk

920
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:23,239
piss profile but its th all level was

921
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,200
insane and when you cut a clone off of

922
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:28,318
it it would basically fill a building

923
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:30,039
with that musky deep Arrow dramatic make

924
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:32,119
you kind of almost sweat when you when

925
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:33,960
you experienced it but a different

926
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:37,480
direction that I was seeking I wanted

927
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:39,559
that noxious you know skunk urine and I

928
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:42,318
couldn't do it and then the one day I

929
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:44,039
just realized it was okay that maybe

930
00:37:42,318 --> 00:37:47,279
that was just what it was and that it

931
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:50,039
was a memory that I had an experience

932
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,680
once long ago that I enjoyed for a long

933
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:54,838
time and when it was done it was done

934
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:56,759
and I I started to see plants almost

935
00:37:54,838 --> 00:37:58,358
like people that you hung out with that

936
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,720
you really enjoy hanging out with and

937
00:37:58,358 --> 00:38:02,358
they passed away you're not going to go

938
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:05,239
and replace that person you're not going

939
00:38:02,358 --> 00:38:09,519
to go find a new buddy new new family

940
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:10,919
member a new new anything that is that

941
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:12,119
you're going to you're going to get

942
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,680
different things and you need to learn

943
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:15,119
to appreciate different things and just

944
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:17,318
be grateful you got to experience it

945
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,559
when it was in your

946
00:38:17,318 --> 00:38:23,920
hands Kevin is this uh the the videos

947
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:25,719
that show you uh uh drawing uh like a

948
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,000
line and then you say this is the' 60s

949
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:29,919
7s ' 80s '90s

950
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,599
make these circles right you make these

951
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,079
C yes it's it's it's spheres of

952
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,960
influence it's if we can get back far

953
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:39,960
enough and open up the population what

954
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:42,880
do we get into because every time we we

955
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,639
hybridize or move the plant

956
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,240
forward did and that's genetic drift did

957
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:51,199
we lose the traits of interest that we

958
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:54,519
originally were so attracted to and you

959
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:55,919
see it in in in in I'm fascinated by

960
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:58,800
dogs

961
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,240
because I I am I'm a dog freak at Heart

962
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,440
Right but it's it's it's doing

963
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:05,399
development on a dog and then there's

964
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,079
specific things of interest and as you

965
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:11,160
bred you lost track of the

966
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:13,560
traits and you weren't doing the job you

967
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:15,480
needed to do with evaluating the progyny

968
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:17,960
the children to make sure that those

969
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,719
things were being carried forward and

970
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:23,000
what happens is we do they call it like

971
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:25,000
paper breeding where you're looking at

972
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,480
the animals via a chart or you're

973
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,079
looking at plants via a chart and the

974
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,440
chart lets you understand where it came

975
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:36,400
from but it doesn't necessarily tell you

976
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,639
what is imparted from that plant or that

977
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,240
dog in its subsequent breeding

978
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:42,960
application so just because it came from

979
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:45,479
something doesn't mean it contains the

980
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,079
[ __ ] you want so yeah it's super skunk

981
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:50,599
from sensey but that profile you wanted

982
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,880
isn't in that pack so you can run that

983
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:54,720
[ __ ] because people that's that's the

984
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,800
illusion that you open up a population

985
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:59,078
everything's present you can go back you

986
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,880
can't if the if those genes aren't

987
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:03,079
present that [ __ ] isn't there you're not

988
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:07,559
going to have them just appear from

989
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:09,720
nowhere so I think that it's the and the

990
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:11,239
people of today will experience it in

991
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:13,159
the same way with the things that were

992
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:14,838
really prevalent and popular for them I

993
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:18,000
was making a joke about you know the

994
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:19,838
Legacy gelato cut because people love

995
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,199
gelato if they didn't love it it

996
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:23,480
wouldn't have been every it's kind of

997
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:26,318
like Skittle right it's a profile that

998
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,159
people really really like give it 30

999
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:31,480
years and people want to go back to that

1000
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:35,000
Legacy Skittle cut and after 30 years is

1001
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:37,639
it still tasting like powdered Tang you

1002
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,960
know the astronaut drink right and if it

1003
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:42,598
it might not and then people will say oh

1004
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,079
it was way better and they'll be like oh

1005
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:46,920
you're old you're reminiscing your

1006
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:49,720
memories off you don't you're you're

1007
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:52,358
incorrect and they'll be screaming no no

1008
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:54,159
I know and that's that that's us we're

1009
00:40:52,358 --> 00:40:56,000
screaming no no it was better and people

1010
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:59,118
like you're old and your memories fail

1011
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,639
and well it was it that rendition from

1012
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,720
that time was better than today even

1013
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:06,960
though we have the most grow

1014
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:08,439
knowledge like you know the amount of

1015
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,400
information we have about how to

1016
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:13,519
cultivate cannabis right now is

1017
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,039
insane you couldn't have any more

1018
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:17,318
[ __ ] knowledge because you had so

1019
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:19,440
much money in interior development so

1020
00:41:17,318 --> 00:41:21,079
much money in exterior development and

1021
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,838
then now you have science that can

1022
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:26,760
access it via hemp holy [ __ ] like we've

1023
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:27,799
never been smarter but it doesn't change

1024
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,800
the fact that you're not going to

1025
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:33,000
resurrect [ __ ] that isn't

1026
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:36,599
there it's just

1027
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,679
done you made a comment um the last time

1028
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:42,240
we talked about how the US and Australia

1029
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:45,480
had um the least amount of experience

1030
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:47,639
growing cannabis in comparison to you

1031
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,639
know like Pakistan and these other

1032
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:53,159
countries that they've been growing it

1033
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:56,400
for thousands of years but it it made me

1034
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:59,159
think of something and does that mean

1035
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,838
that because you have less experience in

1036
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:06,078
years that you have less knowledge right

1037
00:42:02,838 --> 00:42:09,559
because you know I used to own a grow

1038
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:11,039
shop in uh in Willets and there'd be you

1039
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:13,279
know Old-Timers that would come up and

1040
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:15,838
say well we've been doing it like this

1041
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,519
for 20 years right but if you've been

1042
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:20,719
doing it wrong for 20 years or if you've

1043
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:22,880
if you haven't continued to learn for

1044
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:25,039
those 20 years that doesn't actually

1045
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,880
mean that you have more knowledge so I

1046
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:29,000
guess my question for you was do you

1047
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,720
think that even though we have the less

1048
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,400
the least experience here in the US that

1049
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:35,838
we have the least knowledge because I

1050
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,240
think a lot of people would certainly

1051
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:39,639
think that we've got the most knowledge

1052
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:41,439
when it comes to cannabis uh I don't

1053
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:42,799
know about that one I don't know I mean

1054
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,240
if we're talking about indoor

1055
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,800
development you you're definitely not

1056
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:50,118
talking uh anything against Holland

1057
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,839
right I mean there's when I when I study

1058
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:54,838
Greenhouse work that's all plant

1059
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:59,078
empowerment that's all Dr wheel that's

1060
00:42:54,838 --> 00:43:00,759
all that's all dut abis specifically but

1061
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:03,079
that's pretty much is a very small

1062
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:05,559
country it is it is

1063
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:07,119
cultural their agricultural approaches

1064
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:09,559
if you're not following that approach

1065
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:11,640
you're basically going the wrong route

1066
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:13,599
like I mean they're the ones that really

1067
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:15,519
determine like you know Leaf temperature

1068
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,960
is what drives the whole process right

1069
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:20,800
so like so much of the information we

1070
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:22,800
have came out of that area so do do I

1071
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,039
think Americans aren't aren't talented

1072
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,559
oh hell no and do I think that just

1073
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:30,039
because you've done something for long

1074
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:31,680
time does it make you smarter than

1075
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:34,599
someone else not

1076
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:36,719
necessarily but if you have a population

1077
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:39,640
of plants that are present that have

1078
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:42,399
been naturally selected through

1079
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:47,000
environmental pressure then that means

1080
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:49,920
you got 2,000 years of data in the plant

1081
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,318
where for us our whole world has been so

1082
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:56,760
erratic that it it broke these custodial

1083
00:43:53,318 --> 00:43:58,679
chains and it truncated the populations

1084
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,839
we got down into very bottleneck

1085
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:04,279
populations very specific so I think

1086
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:05,838
what we did is when I say that we have

1087
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,359
the least amount of time it means we

1088
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:08,639
have the least amount of time for the

1089
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:11,880
plant to

1090
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:13,519
acclimate so us cannabis especially

1091
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,960
because the the waren drugs and I used

1092
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:17,358
Australia too it's the same thing it's

1093
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:21,079
these two places seem to have the last

1094
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:24,119
on the Cannabis food chain

1095
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:27,280
and it it it's not a knock to either

1096
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:29,640
place I mean it it really isn't but it's

1097
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:33,280
just a statement of fact that if if your

1098
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:35,920
family lived in an area for 50 years and

1099
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,000
their family lived in an area for 2,000

1100
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,680
years I would assume your

1101
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,039
relatives and you should have higher

1102
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:45,519
adaptation to that

1103
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:47,800
specific I just know that my family is

1104
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:50,400
all like eastern northern Europeans

1105
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:55,119
right then we live in New England on the

1106
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:56,639
coast for same house for like 320 years

1107
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:59,519
what I know is that when I hang out with

1108
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:02,358
my friends friends there's not one of

1109
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,759
them that I'm not warmer than right

1110
00:45:02,358 --> 00:45:04,679
where like I'm wearing a t-shirt in the

1111
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,000
winter everybody else is wearing a

1112
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:10,440
[ __ ] down coat I seem to do really

1113
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,119
well in cold weather and I don't even

1114
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,119
necessarily like it it's just that I

1115
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:17,559
seem to be able to handle it different

1116
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:20,680
right so I just know that I've adapted

1117
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:23,280
to that cold ass Eastern European

1118
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:24,799
climate then my family moves in to New

1119
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,359
England where we're on the coast of

1120
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:32,440
Maine for [ __ ] three centuries

1121
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:34,358
um I think that I my I've adapted subtly

1122
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:37,400
to be able to deal with that temperature

1123
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:38,880
better you know it it I don't get suntan

1124
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,480
I have to wear like you know and I work

1125
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,200
in the Sun but I have to wear a hat and

1126
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,920
I got to wear you know some sun clothes

1127
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:47,358
or otherwise I'll still get a a good

1128
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:49,599
burn even at 60 years old my my my body

1129
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:52,119
hasn't had enough adaptation but if I

1130
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:53,760
lived in Africa and I and I breed and I

1131
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:55,920
breed my children bread and bread and

1132
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,640
bread and bread and you go 2,000 years

1133
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,159
some of them are going to have melon and

1134
00:45:57,639 --> 00:46:02,118
content and that they're going to

1135
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:03,519
definitely have an adaptation to it so I

1136
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:05,559
think that that's what occurred it's not

1137
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:08,519
that we're not bright or the Australians

1138
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:10,200
aren't bright it's not to say that you

1139
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:11,719
know anybody's I I always give the Dutch

1140
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:13,598
credit because almost every single thing

1141
00:46:11,719 --> 00:46:15,118
you touch is Dutch you know like wolf

1142
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:18,200
may have came out with the sea of green

1143
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:20,559
with cannabis but the the idea stacking

1144
00:46:18,199 --> 00:46:22,919
plants in density was not foreign to

1145
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:25,559
agriculture before that and and it's and

1146
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,920
it's not to knock wolf because I know

1147
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:32,079
wolf and I respect him he's brilliant

1148
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:34,079
guy but the reality is so much of these

1149
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,200
things that we do come from you know

1150
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:39,599
other methodologies for me like you know

1151
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:42,318
I I went heavy into sub irrigation right

1152
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:44,119
and sub irrigation was how I ran all the

1153
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:46,599
operations because it allowed you to be

1154
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:49,920
able to flood beds and control the the

1155
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:52,960
soak and then the the the Reflow back

1156
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,838
that was all taken right out of Dutch a

1157
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,240
but I would just do it in large diesel

1158
00:46:54,838 --> 00:46:59,159
driven buildings you know I would create

1159
00:46:57,239 --> 00:47:01,399
we would custom build the tables cuz

1160
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:04,719
[ __ ] a tables didn't exist you

1161
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:07,519
couldn't buy a pre-made table so I had a

1162
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:10,239
carpenter I I worked with and we drew up

1163
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:11,920
a blueprint and then I would fiberglass

1164
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:13,799
the tables and then when I wanted to do

1165
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,200
a project I just let him know hey I need

1166
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:18,359
22 tables and then he would be able to

1167
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:21,000
go get the cut list go purchase the

1168
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:22,480
material assemble the tables glass them

1169
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,000
and I would go pick them up in trucks

1170
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:28,639
and bring them up to the operation so

1171
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,119
you know we would we we would using

1172
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:33,118
tools from other countries because those

1173
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:36,440
things weren't readily applied at that

1174
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,720
time you could get like a a 3X3 table

1175
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,838
because that was all that was like the

1176
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:43,239
original plastic table was like the sun

1177
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:45,358
systems and the American Hydroponics up

1178
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:48,558
not far so I knew Janeiro he's passed

1179
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:51,719
away but I and I knew his kids and

1180
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:53,319
Michael was the other uh guy um Christ

1181
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:55,318
Christensen right and so I knew him from

1182
00:47:53,318 --> 00:47:56,960
the store but we weren't friendly jaro

1183
00:47:55,318 --> 00:48:00,920
was a little a little cooler in some

1184
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:03,318
guards and I knew Jar's kids and but the

1185
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:05,519
3X3 tables just didn't grit out right

1186
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:08,079
because those were designed for solar

1187
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:10,480
systems spins lower lower intensity

1188
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:13,720
light where what I wanted was to stack

1189
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:15,400
thousands over 16 square feet so that I

1190
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:18,039
could I could get what I wanted which

1191
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:19,160
was quicker cyclical time heavier yield

1192
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:21,838
per square

1193
00:48:19,159 --> 00:48:24,039
meter and so we just custom built the

1194
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:25,960
tables but all that stuff was stuff that

1195
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:27,639
I was learning going to college for

1196
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,119
plant propagation

1197
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:33,519
so once I really started to you know dig

1198
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:35,838
into where the knowledge came from [ __ ]

1199
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:38,800
I mean between Israel has given you all

1200
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:41,119
your science on cannabis predominantly

1201
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,599
right most of the deep research on on

1202
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:46,000
profiles and molecular weights all

1203
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:48,079
coming out of Israel and the Dutch are

1204
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,039
given you pretty much you know almost

1205
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:52,200
every

1206
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:55,358
Greenhouse has some it has to they're

1207
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:57,439
the ones that did all the work but what

1208
00:48:55,358 --> 00:49:01,159
we did is we took cannabis and turned it

1209
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:03,000
into this this cult before it was a

1210
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:05,838
product that was in countries once it go

1211
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,798
to the US the US turns it into a cult

1212
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:10,318
and because the US and like it's my

1213
00:49:07,798 --> 00:49:11,960
opinion but the US has the ability to do

1214
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:13,679
something most countries don't which is

1215
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,480
project that [ __ ] into the world through

1216
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:17,679
the

1217
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:19,760
media so the US is what really hyped up

1218
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:21,358
so much of this stuff and then if you

1219
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,880
take a look at the

1220
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:27,598
internet the internet kind of goes along

1221
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:30,480
and you see like OG Kush was one of the

1222
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:32,440
first things spoke on the internet Girl

1223
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,960
Scout cookie was like to me the first

1224
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,760
plant that was really exploded through

1225
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,880
the

1226
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,520
internet because that was the only way

1227
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,720
people could still access and so I was

1228
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:43,798
never big on forums I was on a couple of

1229
00:49:41,719 --> 00:49:46,759
them and I check them out but for a lot

1230
00:49:43,798 --> 00:49:48,599
of the Forum cats it was a community

1231
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:50,319
that they needed because they didn't

1232
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:53,960
have one in their lives because they

1233
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:56,838
would they were too hidden but all those

1234
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:59,119
years from you know for me from 25 to 50

1235
00:49:56,838 --> 00:50:01,279
from a 60 I've been in Humble County

1236
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:03,000
where that [ __ ] wasn't hidden so every

1237
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,640
single one of your neighbors was sparked

1238
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,798
up everybody around you was sparked up

1239
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:10,598
so what it did is it allowed

1240
00:50:07,798 --> 00:50:12,039
you a different type of relationship way

1241
00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:15,039
you didn't feel like you were on your

1242
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:17,440
own you know living in a vacuum whereas

1243
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:21,318
if you were on the East Coast Midwest

1244
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:23,400
you know places like that you really you

1245
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:25,440
really didn't have an ability to ever

1246
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:28,480
kind of come out and talk about weed

1247
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,838
publicly you had to use the forums even

1248
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,280
living in Sona County it was like that

1249
00:50:30,838 --> 00:50:36,400
what's that I said even living in somoma

1250
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:38,920
County it was like that so totally yeah

1251
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,400
son is different son is you have yeah

1252
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:43,559
humbal humble's an out of control Outlaw

1253
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:45,798
County in terms of like [ __ ] you we're

1254
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:48,119
GNA go big radically different I would

1255
00:50:45,798 --> 00:50:51,000
say Mendo is way more craft same thing

1256
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:53,280
with somoma they're more craft

1257
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,960
orientated Mendo was more craft

1258
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:59,240
orientated Humbolt was go as big as you

1259
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:01,880
possibly can 10 that there was no

1260
00:50:59,239 --> 00:51:04,919
limit there was just no limit that

1261
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:07,200
bigger was better bigger was okay that

1262
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:10,079
that wrapping yourself in money was not

1263
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:11,358
a bad thing and so humble was different

1264
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,039
that but people talk about what's the

1265
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:15,279
Legacy strains Humble County and I'm

1266
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:17,440
like what everyone sold because the

1267
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,480
minute that [ __ ] was moving in velocity

1268
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,440
those cuts were here and being produced

1269
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:25,639
and that product was leaving and feeding

1270
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:28,280
the country so humbal was different but

1271
00:51:25,639 --> 00:51:30,598
it it allow just like right now I don't

1272
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:33,559
really I I'm online but not to the

1273
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:36,000
degree a lot of people are because I'm

1274
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:39,000
actually able to work in the world you

1275
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,679
have other resources oh totally for a

1276
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,920
lot of people the only resources they

1277
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:44,440
have is what they can find online yeah

1278
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,720
and and I think it's a lovely thing and

1279
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:49,880
I think what it's done is it's created

1280
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:52,279
it it's it has a duality you're living

1281
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:54,559
in on the online world that's your

1282
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:57,200
community that's what's right because

1283
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:59,599
it's you it's it's it's we get centered

1284
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:02,439
it's like you you you don't really

1285
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:06,160
have I would say

1286
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:07,519
um an open idea mentally because no

1287
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:10,078
matter what it's you're looking at it

1288
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:12,798
through your eyes so no matter what you

1289
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,839
do you're filtering information through

1290
00:52:12,798 --> 00:52:16,358
your

1291
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:19,199
biases and it's just what we naturally

1292
00:52:16,358 --> 00:52:21,759
do it's it's it's human anything

1293
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:24,838
different than you your sensors tell you

1294
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:27,440
be wary and that's a survival Instinct

1295
00:52:24,838 --> 00:52:30,239
right but when you develop it

1296
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,880
and that becomes true and real the and

1297
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:33,639
it's it's we had this discussion the

1298
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:35,760
other day it's the idea about like we

1299
00:52:33,639 --> 00:52:37,719
use the word craft I I gave a lecture on

1300
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,440
Craft so what I did is I interviewed a

1301
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:41,558
bunch of people on what is craft and

1302
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,240
their opinion so I asked them what's

1303
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:47,160
craft and then I ask them and how do you

1304
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:49,838
grow and each person their method fit

1305
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:50,719
their identity right like craft is what

1306
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:54,119
I

1307
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:56,199
do it it's it's it's only by hand and I

1308
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:58,440
said and how do you grow only by hand

1309
00:52:56,199 --> 00:53:01,719
and then person was craft is these

1310
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:05,679
things because they use drippers craft

1311
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:08,959
is only indoor in living soil no no

1312
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:11,239
craft is understanding how to dry back a

1313
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,280
block to get the best expression each

1314
00:53:11,239 --> 00:53:16,399
individual had

1315
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,559
identical reflection of their work into

1316
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,039
their

1317
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:22,000
identity and and that was my point of

1318
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:24,599
that lecture was the craft is Wild and

1319
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,798
Free it's anything you want it to be

1320
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:28,599
because and it's not your intent because

1321
00:53:26,798 --> 00:53:30,199
intent doesn't do [ __ ] in life because

1322
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:32,838
what they say uh the road to hell is

1323
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:35,159
paved with good intentions it's about

1324
00:53:32,838 --> 00:53:36,920
what happens from the intent it's the

1325
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:39,838
actual experience of the person you're

1326
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:42,200
trying to create so you can't Define

1327
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:45,078
that you're a craft operator if everyone

1328
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:47,639
who smokes your product says it

1329
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:49,200
sucks that's true not [ __ ] craft

1330
00:53:47,639 --> 00:53:52,519
right just leave you're really C craft

1331
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:56,639
is a dramatic word right k r ft and it

1332
00:53:52,519 --> 00:53:59,599
really implies by hand and The Craft and

1333
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:02,598
that's like an 1850 word right it comes

1334
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:06,119
out at the same time the Arts and Crafts

1335
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:09,079
movement comes out which was this fight

1336
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:12,079
back against the industrial era so the

1337
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:14,720
industrial era is emerging all this

1338
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:17,559
cheap shit's being produced and this

1339
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:20,118
group emerges and says that's not what

1340
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:22,200
we want and what people didn't

1341
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:24,280
understand was that that arts and crafts

1342
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:26,598
craft movement wasn't about this really

1343
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:29,480
high-end [ __ ] you looked at at the wall

1344
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:32,200
it was a screwdriver that had a really

1345
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:34,358
beautiful handle it was a hammer that

1346
00:54:32,199 --> 00:54:37,558
when you held it you wanted to hold it

1347
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:40,960
it was Craftsman tools yes CRA it was

1348
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:42,798
about things you use daily frequently

1349
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,639
but at a higher level because those are

1350
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:47,119
the things that had gone through mass

1351
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:49,558
production had changed and the reason

1352
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:55,280
why that whole craft movement worked was

1353
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:57,960
they had a craft like Symposium that was

1354
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:01,119
that was held and it Expos people to it

1355
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:03,760
so from like you know 1850s 1860s all

1356
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:06,559
the way up until the Great Depression

1357
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:09,119
this craft moving kicked ass and I

1358
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:12,798
researched it originally because I used

1359
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:14,798
to do fine woodwor as a hobby and and I

1360
00:55:12,798 --> 00:55:17,599
started getting into architecture in

1361
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:21,599
terms of like studying periods and there

1362
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:25,519
was this Craftsman era in in Homes at

1363
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:27,559
that turn of the century that was about

1364
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:29,880
and and it return returned again later

1365
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:32,839
in in in time it returns again in the

1366
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:35,079
2000s where it was this change to go

1367
00:55:32,838 --> 00:55:38,480
back to smaller homes with higher

1368
00:55:35,079 --> 00:55:40,760
quality details where a bigger house

1369
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:45,039
wasn't more important than a Better Door

1370
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:47,160
Handle than a better sink than than the

1371
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:49,480
elevation of the rooms in terms of

1372
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:51,519
ceiling height to change the feel so

1373
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,280
taller Heights give you more expansive

1374
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:56,719
thinking shorter Heights make you feel

1375
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:59,599
more more secure and so it's a justing

1376
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:02,279
the ceiling Heights and spaces it's the

1377
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:05,798
lighting it's the the feel it's the

1378
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:08,839
detail it's you're doing wood workor and

1379
00:56:05,798 --> 00:56:11,318
highlighting this this this artistic

1380
00:56:08,838 --> 00:56:14,159
expression versus what became known as

1381
00:56:11,318 --> 00:56:16,719
the mcmansion which was these cardboard

1382
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:18,239
houses that were [ __ ] caverns and

1383
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:20,199
everybody's like look at my Cavern is

1384
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:21,838
house but you go to you you go to touch

1385
00:56:20,199 --> 00:56:23,439
the door handle and it's a cheap door

1386
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:25,639
handle and you feel it so the thing you

1387
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:29,079
touch every day is the door knob and the

1388
00:56:25,639 --> 00:56:31,318
door knob sucks so we kind of returned

1389
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:34,440
back into this craft world for people

1390
00:56:31,318 --> 00:56:37,480
who had the money to buy the mcmansion

1391
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:39,880
but wanted more of this internal

1392
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:42,760
stimulation from the things they touched

1393
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:44,838
and did and so when I was doing all this

1394
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:47,720
work on Craft and just trying to

1395
00:56:44,838 --> 00:56:49,440
understand the argument because each one

1396
00:56:47,719 --> 00:56:52,679
of us constantly says what's the

1397
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:55,358
definition of craft it's an acre tops

1398
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:58,038
it's no drip systems it has to be

1399
00:56:55,358 --> 00:57:01,159
sungrown by biologically driven to be

1400
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:03,200
craft and it drove me into really

1401
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:05,639
research and I I had done all this wine

1402
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:08,439
research for the appalation project that

1403
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:10,798
that I had helped work on and it was the

1404
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:15,200
same thing it comes down

1405
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:18,318
to how do you view a thing and do people

1406
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:20,399
view it the same and so you know there's

1407
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:22,119
going to always be this dissension and

1408
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,920
it's just kind of what it is and so I

1409
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:26,240
just say look if you're somebody that is

1410
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,200
living right now and you're 19 years old

1411
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:31,038
you're smoking your favorite [ __ ] you

1412
00:57:28,199 --> 00:57:33,480
might want to just hold on to that plant

1413
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:36,440
and hold on to it for emotional sake but

1414
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:38,318
just realize in 30 years the odds of it

1415
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:42,519
being the same plant you smoked when you

1416
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:45,519
were 19 is probably pretty low yes

1417
00:57:42,519 --> 00:57:48,519
similar but subtly

1418
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:51,199
different and even with TC scrub because

1419
00:57:48,519 --> 00:57:52,759
the thing is the plant if you wanted to

1420
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:54,838
return to the norm you'd have to go back

1421
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:56,839
to the parents and you'd have to have

1422
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:59,078
them in the same situation they were in

1423
00:57:56,838 --> 00:58:01,199
when they did the work because they're

1424
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:04,640
passing that information onto the

1425
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:07,639
progeny so there's always change in even

1426
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:10,038
in Pakistan when I went to all the

1427
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:12,279
villages I was like you know what's your

1428
00:58:10,039 --> 00:58:14,200
what's your like native stock and your

1429
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:16,920
at your village and they said we really

1430
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:18,919
don't have any Kev what we do is we

1431
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:22,079
constantly share material with other

1432
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:24,880
Villages around us and stock that'll

1433
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:28,079
come in from Afghanistan will move in I

1434
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:30,119
got partners that are Iranian that their

1435
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:32,359
my my partner's Iranian his family still

1436
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:34,480
lives in Iran they cross the border and

1437
00:58:32,358 --> 00:58:36,440
grow dope in Afghanistan and then bring

1438
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,920
the seeds back into Iran and then ship

1439
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:41,318
the seeds so I got a bunch of seed stock

1440
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:45,079
that got moved via that route to

1441
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:47,038
me but it's their selection what they

1442
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:48,440
wanted what the market wants and then

1443
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:52,440
they narrow the

1444
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:55,400
population that is a change so like what

1445
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:57,318
what I learned is that there's no way to

1446
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:59,559
preserve any of this unless you can

1447
00:58:57,318 --> 00:59:02,119
preserve like a good seed batch of that

1448
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:04,200
original material and you're able to

1449
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:06,119
preserve it in some kind of repository

1450
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:07,639
where it's held at the the right

1451
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:09,880
moisture it's held at the right

1452
00:59:07,639 --> 00:59:11,639
temperature you're doing germination

1453
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:15,480
testing and once you get to a certain

1454
00:59:11,639 --> 00:59:20,118
level of um germination failure you have

1455
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:21,519
to do another repopulation of it and so

1456
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:22,880
that's where really you know like

1457
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:26,960
Australia and the

1458
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:29,160
us we're we're the last in line

1459
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,519
we have some of the stricter laws on

1460
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:32,480
cannabis I mean [ __ ] you know how much a

1461
00:59:30,519 --> 00:59:35,480
pound in in New Zealand's going for

1462
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:37,240
right now almost nine grand so New

1463
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:40,639
Zealand and I started laughing I said

1464
00:59:37,239 --> 00:59:43,358
I'm flying to New Zealand um you know

1465
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:46,038
what I'm saying I'm like [ __ ] I think I

1466
00:59:43,358 --> 00:59:47,239
can hide a couple pounds in the tree so

1467
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:48,960
you know you get you know you three

1468
00:59:47,239 --> 00:59:51,279
pounds you're talking

1469
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:55,079
27k um that's pretty

1470
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:57,359
interesting so the the the the

1471
00:59:55,079 --> 00:59:59,559
restrictions of still so dominant in so

1472
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:01,199
many places it just change and I just

1473
00:59:59,559 --> 01:00:04,000
think that people just need to be be

1474
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:05,798
aware of that that's just kind of what

1475
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,559
it is and I don't think I'm I'm I have

1476
01:00:05,798 --> 01:00:10,960
some handle on this I just know that no

1477
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:13,359
matter where I go and what I dig into

1478
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:16,798
you see shift

1479
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:18,279
and it's okay it's okay that you know

1480
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:20,519
the things are different than they once

1481
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:21,880
were they they can't be the same as they

1482
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:24,639
always

1483
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:27,119
were you know Lobster is small when I

1484
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:29,279
was a kid a lobster would lay across

1485
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:31,400
your table I was from my my whole town

1486
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,319
that I lived in the The Village right

1487
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:35,880
was all commercial fishermen right there

1488
01:00:33,318 --> 01:00:38,119
be the dragon either doing

1489
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,640
shellfish uh which is you know cogs and

1490
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:41,960
clams or you're doing are you doing

1491
01:00:39,639 --> 01:00:44,159
lobster and crab right so I grew up

1492
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:45,720
eatting Lobster so much that it was a

1493
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:48,639
normal food

1494
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:51,038
item this [ __ ] was huge you used to have

1495
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:52,798
to get these giant Channel loock pliers

1496
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:54,200
you you weren't using hand crackers you

1497
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:56,838
couldn't get it around the goddamn

1498
01:00:54,199 --> 01:00:58,719
bottom of the claw had these huge

1499
01:00:56,838 --> 01:01:00,318
channel locks You' use and as a kid you

1500
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:03,519
weren't even strong enough to break it

1501
01:01:00,318 --> 01:01:05,639
you have to use a freaking Hammer [ __ ]

1502
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:08,239
um you don't see that anymore swordfish

1503
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:11,440
used to come in different colors it was

1504
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:13,798
like yellow swordfish pink swordfish and

1505
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:17,838
and it was all basically you know uh you

1506
01:01:13,798 --> 01:01:19,759
know big blue but you don't see those

1507
01:01:17,838 --> 01:01:22,318
variations when you buy swordfish

1508
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:25,599
anymore you don't see the subtleties in

1509
01:01:22,318 --> 01:01:27,199
the species you get this and so I just

1510
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:29,720
realiz realiz that those things that I

1511
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:31,960
once had as a kid we probably just

1512
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:34,078
overfished it wiped it out it's just no

1513
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:36,838
longer

1514
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:40,280
present yeah and that's how it the gy

1515
01:01:36,838 --> 01:01:43,519
pool also goes now in modern kobis uh

1516
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:46,519
industry right yeah the the it's it's

1517
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:49,239
it's so brother with sister with cousin

1518
01:01:46,519 --> 01:01:51,278
with uh grandmother again with uh

1519
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:53,558
grandfather again you know all the time

1520
01:01:51,278 --> 01:01:55,599
the same families Collide each other

1521
01:01:53,559 --> 01:01:58,319
it's they sexy and it makes it easy and

1522
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:59,920
so you know but the problem is it was I

1523
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:01,278
got into this the other day right and

1524
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,278
and I I I don't know if I said it right

1525
01:02:01,278 --> 01:02:05,960
but we would piss some people off but it

1526
01:02:03,278 --> 01:02:07,920
was about big a doesn't pheno hunt and

1527
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:09,679
everyone started screaming they do but

1528
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:12,798
the thing was I got to work with the guy

1529
01:02:09,679 --> 01:02:14,358
that developed GMO corn for Monsanto

1530
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:16,480
right so I don't know if it gets any

1531
01:02:14,358 --> 01:02:19,358
[ __ ] higher than that in the food

1532
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:22,079
chain and right and so he was you know

1533
01:02:19,358 --> 01:02:23,880
he's brilliant PhD but like he he when

1534
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:26,160
you people don't catch it when you get

1535
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:27,920
to a certain level in breathing there's

1536
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:30,558
only so many companies you can actually

1537
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:33,720
go work for and get make any money and

1538
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:36,400
that's basically you know uh a bear

1539
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:40,358
which is now Monsanto

1540
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:42,480
senta um BASF there's only there's only

1541
01:02:40,358 --> 01:02:43,679
so many companies where you're skill

1542
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,519
just like when you're a brilliant

1543
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:48,759
neurosurgeon you're not working at the

1544
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:50,639
local [ __ ] emergency room no you

1545
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:52,160
can't you can't pay back your doctor

1546
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:54,318
your doctor debt right you got to go

1547
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:56,719
where the money is right so you go 400

1548
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:58,558
500 Grand into school debt you got to go

1549
01:02:56,719 --> 01:03:02,480
make the cash and you

1550
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:04,519
also need to be able to use the tools or

1551
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,318
otherwise you're not really satisfying

1552
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:08,759
your

1553
01:03:05,318 --> 01:03:11,838
desires so I get lucky in that in life I

1554
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:13,720
get to bump into these guys and and and

1555
01:03:11,838 --> 01:03:15,119
they were astounded that cannabis was

1556
01:03:13,719 --> 01:03:17,798
you know pheno hunting and that there

1557
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:19,200
was no no inbred populations to pull

1558
01:03:17,798 --> 01:03:21,159
from and he was like Kev he goes we go

1559
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:24,159
to the corn bank and we basically go

1560
01:03:21,159 --> 01:03:26,879
grab inbred lines that we work with he

1561
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:30,719
goes that's what took so long in

1562
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:32,358
cannabis was for science teams to iMed

1563
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:34,598
the populations that they were going to

1564
01:03:32,358 --> 01:03:35,759
use for their hybridizations and I was

1565
01:03:34,599 --> 01:03:37,200
trying to tell somebody because people

1566
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,640
were saying you know science guys can't

1567
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:40,598
do [ __ ] and I'm like all right so you're

1568
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:44,159
still riding a [ __ ]

1569
01:03:40,599 --> 01:03:46,318
horse right so you're I got you still I

1570
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:48,759
got you you you sa across the [ __ ]

1571
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:51,000
ocean in a rowboat if it wasn't for

1572
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:54,559
Science and hold D no air conditioning

1573
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:57,119
no ice you know what I'm saying so like

1574
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:59,079
I don't worship at the alterous science

1575
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:00,680
but I know damn well what it can do when

1576
01:03:59,079 --> 01:04:04,798
you give it time and

1577
01:04:00,679 --> 01:04:07,558
money MH and it was the idea that lines

1578
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:09,798
are what they work with they try to work

1579
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:11,880
so even if it's a [ __ ] tomato where

1580
01:04:09,798 --> 01:04:13,599
you have a A variation of a tomato

1581
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:15,519
you're not doing it by clone when I go

1582
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:17,480
buy tomatoes when I buy some of these

1583
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:19,239
old anti Antiquity Tomatoes they're from

1584
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:22,000
seed because when I take the seed out of

1585
01:04:19,239 --> 01:04:23,959
the Tomato we recreate it my girl holds

1586
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,679
those seeds and does it is it a [ __ ]

1587
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:28,838
exact copy of each one no there's subtle

1588
01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:30,199
shifts but the majority of the traits

1589
01:04:28,838 --> 01:04:32,599
pretty much breed

1590
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:35,679
true that allows you to have enough

1591
01:04:32,599 --> 01:04:38,318
genetic variation to hopefully ward off

1592
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:40,278
future pathogens which is the issue with

1593
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:41,759
the inbreeding [ __ ] is that when you

1594
01:04:40,278 --> 01:04:45,400
take a look it's the problem with the

1595
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:47,480
fuels is that when we got into doing you

1596
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:51,639
know work in the United States so much

1597
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:54,559
of the Afghan work um because you don't

1598
01:04:51,639 --> 01:04:56,960
have any humidity in Afghanistan and

1599
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:59,798
Pakistan I'm talking so low it blows

1600
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:01,760
your mind you dry up in the winter I

1601
01:04:59,798 --> 01:05:03,880
mean I'm talking like your you your the

1602
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,880
the skin on your lips cracks off it's so

1603
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:08,720
dry so you're drinking gallons of water

1604
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:11,920
when you are not even warm because

1605
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:13,798
you're so dry you can hang herb and it's

1606
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:16,358
drying in the room as you're as you're

1607
01:05:13,798 --> 01:05:19,318
looking at it it's crazy how bone dry it

1608
01:05:16,358 --> 01:05:23,000
is and I really didn't understand how

1609
01:05:19,318 --> 01:05:25,038
the [ __ ] you could get such agricultural

1610
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,719
like quality with so little water and I

1611
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:31,319
I I realiz I got you it's glacial flow

1612
01:05:28,719 --> 01:05:35,639
so atmospherically bone dry but because

1613
01:05:31,318 --> 01:05:37,920
you have a you know 27,000 ft cap of of

1614
01:05:35,639 --> 01:05:40,480
of you know historic ice that's

1615
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:42,680
constantly moving and flowing down as

1616
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:45,920
Glacier that's where the water comes

1617
01:05:42,679 --> 01:05:48,318
from they don't worry about betrus and

1618
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:50,760
they don't worry about PM but when you

1619
01:05:48,318 --> 01:05:53,358
move those materials into the

1620
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:55,200
us all of a sudden you now had these

1621
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:59,358
pathogens and the the material that we

1622
01:05:55,199 --> 01:06:01,318
bred and and use inherently had that

1623
01:05:59,358 --> 01:06:04,960
trait of

1624
01:06:01,318 --> 01:06:06,480
susceptibility it it it spawned like I

1625
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,440
always tell people I said don't tell me

1626
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,079
any fuel that you're touching didn't get

1627
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:11,358
covered with some Eagle at some point in

1628
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:13,760
your

1629
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:15,278
life I'll tell you the amount the amount

1630
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,839
of that [ __ ] that got used well the

1631
01:06:15,278 --> 01:06:20,278
thing was I got lucky that I knew how to

1632
01:06:16,838 --> 01:06:23,318
read an MSDS sheet and so wasn't willing

1633
01:06:20,278 --> 01:06:26,358
to use it and my mother my mother wasn't

1634
01:06:23,318 --> 01:06:28,558
about what I did at all my mother was

1635
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:31,440
somebody that I could I could call on

1636
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:33,319
the phone and say hey ma um what do I

1637
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:35,599
need to be aware of with these products

1638
01:06:33,318 --> 01:06:36,759
and she would send me the information

1639
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:38,440
right and she would just send it from

1640
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:42,920
her office and say here this is what

1641
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:45,358
this is wow so it helped me understand

1642
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:49,838
that all the stuff that we were

1643
01:06:45,358 --> 01:06:51,639
using was absolutely cumulative in its

1644
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:54,920
response and that at some point in time

1645
01:06:51,639 --> 01:06:56,798
you would saturate with this [ __ ] and

1646
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:58,960
the ability to be able to get it out of

1647
01:06:56,798 --> 01:07:01,519
the system and so and it caused problems

1648
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:04,960
too because like for us at the nursery

1649
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:06,960
we we we ran a bio nursery and so we

1650
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:08,679
were getting hammered at times trying to

1651
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:11,639
understand how do you really use

1652
01:07:08,679 --> 01:07:13,278
biological Pest Control at scale so I

1653
01:07:11,639 --> 01:07:15,159
always get some people talking [ __ ] but

1654
01:07:13,278 --> 01:07:17,599
what what no one can talk [ __ ] on was

1655
01:07:15,159 --> 01:07:19,239
the extraction companies that I worked

1656
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:21,760
with I was the only [ __ ] vendor they

1657
01:07:19,239 --> 01:07:24,078
could get clones from and make product

1658
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:26,160
that could go into a system that was

1659
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:27,880
tested so

1660
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:30,480
you're you have to go through these

1661
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:33,480
evolutions of how do you take tools that

1662
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,559
are effective and replace them with

1663
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:37,318
natural

1664
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:39,000
systems and it's what really helped me

1665
01:07:37,318 --> 01:07:42,278
understand the the issues we were going

1666
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:44,960
to face with Organic agot scale because

1667
01:07:42,278 --> 01:07:49,119
there is no other crop that's run at

1668
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:51,679
that density level they want herb run at

1669
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:54,440
biologically right you don't you just

1670
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:56,838
don't have that level of of density in a

1671
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:59,358
in a house and the the plant count and

1672
01:07:56,838 --> 01:08:03,759
the No No ability to use

1673
01:07:59,358 --> 01:08:05,679
tools so it's just everyone relied on

1674
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:08,278
these things but those things changed

1675
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:10,639
the plants and they they allowed us to

1676
01:08:08,278 --> 01:08:12,119
use plants in projects that we really

1677
01:08:10,639 --> 01:08:13,960
shouldn't have used and it's the same

1678
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:16,480
issue with like feminization people are

1679
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:19,560
anti- feminization and I used to be

1680
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:21,838
anti- feminization too because we notice

1681
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:24,000
micro seeds in the lab right so when the

1682
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:25,880
when the product came in the the lab

1683
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,238
that I worked with brilliant lab

1684
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:29,079
scientist were like keev they always we

1685
01:08:27,238 --> 01:08:31,119
always notice these microscopic seeds

1686
01:08:29,079 --> 01:08:34,479
that come in a lot of this feminized

1687
01:08:31,119 --> 01:08:36,679
work and so I started to have a a

1688
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:38,479
disbelief in feminization as a tool but

1689
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:41,960
what I learned was that it's it's

1690
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:44,519
incredibly powerful tool to isolate and

1691
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:45,759
trap traits of interest it's just that

1692
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:48,279
when you do

1693
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:50,960
reversals the plants that reverse the

1694
01:08:48,279 --> 01:08:52,319
quickest are also the ones most prone to

1695
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,079
intersex

1696
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:57,839
Tendencies so you're trying to chase the

1697
01:08:55,079 --> 01:09:00,079
money but you're also weaving in then so

1698
01:08:57,838 --> 01:09:01,880
the idea then is you go through the line

1699
01:09:00,079 --> 01:09:04,119
and you got to go select out and I'm

1700
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:05,838
just like that's my whole point with

1701
01:09:04,119 --> 01:09:08,679
this fenal hunting [ __ ] is

1702
01:09:05,838 --> 01:09:10,519
that cannabis was a seed line that you

1703
01:09:08,679 --> 01:09:12,440
ran and there was enough diversity

1704
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:14,799
within it to give you some protection so

1705
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:18,039
the part that's so interesting

1706
01:09:14,798 --> 01:09:20,039
is they they they they have identified

1707
01:09:18,039 --> 01:09:22,119
you know on the chromosome where this

1708
01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:25,880
marker is that says this is the gene

1709
01:09:22,119 --> 01:09:27,599
that that controls your your PM but

1710
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:28,798
what we know is that you have all these

1711
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:31,960
Interlink

1712
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:35,079
genes that that many genes combined

1713
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:37,880
cause an expression so as we start to go

1714
01:09:35,079 --> 01:09:40,318
in and start to work with cannabis and

1715
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:44,159
start to you know crisper it a little

1716
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:46,159
which is remove it shorten it or you

1717
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:49,358
start to identify traits and you only

1718
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:52,000
select for those we don't know the big

1719
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:55,440
picture impact of what that

1720
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:58,158
does because we've never done it so it's

1721
01:09:55,439 --> 01:10:00,238
the beginning of like what are we doing

1722
01:09:58,158 --> 01:10:02,759
to the actual plant itself and because

1723
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:03,678
cannabis is so unbelievably complicated

1724
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:05,239
as a

1725
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:08,880
plant

1726
01:10:05,238 --> 01:10:13,479
and almost every other AD crop is

1727
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:15,679
basically evaluated by tons per acre

1728
01:10:13,479 --> 01:10:18,000
right bushels per acre right so like

1729
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:19,039
when you breeding corn which someone was

1730
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,039
like you know breeding corn I'm like

1731
01:10:19,039 --> 01:10:22,760
[ __ ] your feed in the world um I don't

1732
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:24,600
think you quite understand the impact of

1733
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:28,039
that where like you're you're feeding

1734
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:31,840
countries with a product the impact is

1735
01:10:28,039 --> 01:10:35,800
massive it's only viewed as a success if

1736
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:37,920
you're getting more in that field and

1737
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:40,239
that would imply that it had it had

1738
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:42,399
protections installed into it to make it

1739
01:10:40,238 --> 01:10:46,119
happen but whatever it is what matters

1740
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:48,879
is you get more with cannabis that's not

1741
01:10:46,119 --> 01:10:51,640
how we evaluate it it's not about more

1742
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:53,600
it's about that you enjoy it and because

1743
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:56,840
you have this human

1744
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:59,120
evaluation it's very different it makes

1745
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:00,800
it tough and so for me the question is

1746
01:10:59,119 --> 01:11:05,679
you know are we going to be able to use

1747
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:07,760
science and humans together to steer

1748
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:08,880
true breeding populations that can be

1749
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:11,400
used in

1750
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:14,279
hybridization access to Gene Banks to

1751
01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:16,279
bring interesting material into projects

1752
01:11:14,279 --> 01:11:18,079
and the ability for science to look at

1753
01:11:16,279 --> 01:11:20,319
stuff in a way to help us that aren't

1754
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:22,640
scientists understand how do we how do

1755
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:26,039
we use scientific principles in our

1756
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:29,560
breeding but steering the end product to

1757
01:11:26,039 --> 01:11:31,319
be consumptive quality not just measure

1758
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:33,640
because analytics and coas and all the

1759
01:11:31,319 --> 01:11:36,439
other [ __ ] it it gets you to a

1760
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:37,800
Target but we don't know the the riddle

1761
01:11:36,439 --> 01:11:42,000
I always call them The Riddles they're

1762
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:44,800
they're many things together create the

1763
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,639
answer we don't know what we don't know

1764
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:49,360
totally and and I think that that's

1765
01:11:46,639 --> 01:11:51,000
important to say and and I don't think

1766
01:11:49,359 --> 01:11:53,439
and and I and I know that there are some

1767
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,399
people that are absolutely you know

1768
01:11:53,439 --> 01:11:58,238
drowning in weed like we're talking you

1769
01:11:55,399 --> 01:12:00,439
know Sam I was on a a podcast with with

1770
01:11:58,238 --> 01:12:03,519
uh Dave Watson the other day right Sam

1771
01:12:00,439 --> 01:12:06,399
skunkman and [ __ ] gu spent his whole

1772
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:07,840
life drowning in weed I mean drowning in

1773
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:10,839
it like I don't know if anybody went

1774
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:12,880
that damn deep he's he's like the hash

1775
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:15,560
makers I met in Pakistan where when I'm

1776
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:17,800
talking to an old guy and I'm like when

1777
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:20,199
did you do this he goes oh he goes my

1778
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:22,320
first memories are being like three

1779
01:12:20,198 --> 01:12:25,759
working with my father in the hash room

1780
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:27,599
beating hash and he goes I I I know any

1781
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:30,000
other life and he said and neither did

1782
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,199
my father and neither did my father's

1783
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,279
father he goes we've been there for

1784
01:12:31,198 --> 01:12:35,759
1,800 years making hash and he goes and

1785
01:12:34,279 --> 01:12:37,319
the techniques have evolved because

1786
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:40,440
we've got different material to work

1787
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:43,119
with the quality of the fabric basically

1788
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:45,479
they beat on and the understanding of

1789
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:47,119
how to work with it but it was when he

1790
01:12:45,479 --> 01:12:48,638
was holding a piece of hash and he was

1791
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:51,279
rolling it in his fingers and it was

1792
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:54,359
moving through his hand I just was kind

1793
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:58,599
of mystified by it because it was like

1794
01:12:54,359 --> 01:13:00,639
2000 years of hash touching was being I

1795
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:03,280
was seeing it he you know he was

1796
01:13:00,639 --> 01:13:05,000
probably in his 40s but and looking like

1797
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:07,840
he in the 70s man living in the

1798
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:11,560
mountains is rough but the way the hash

1799
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:13,719
moved in his fingers I just was like wow

1800
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:15,000
just forever it's it's almost like you

1801
01:13:13,719 --> 01:13:18,439
know you're

1802
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:21,439
born uh a a a Roth child and Rothchild

1803
01:13:18,439 --> 01:13:24,919
wasn't the original name right they they

1804
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:28,279
had it that's a name they took but your

1805
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:31,480
your your you have a a a genius father

1806
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:33,639
who has sons that kick ass and every kid

1807
01:13:31,479 --> 01:13:35,879
after them was shaped and groomed by the

1808
01:13:33,639 --> 01:13:40,639
time you get to right

1809
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:43,279
now how smart are they in in money if if

1810
01:13:40,639 --> 01:13:45,520
all you've done is instill information

1811
01:13:43,279 --> 01:13:48,039
every generation and you're only

1812
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:50,719
selecting and and doing that route at

1813
01:13:48,039 --> 01:13:54,560
what point are you really really

1814
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:58,198
talented at something you know so I

1815
01:13:54,560 --> 01:14:00,120
don't see myself in that route I I I I

1816
01:13:58,198 --> 01:14:02,119
I'm lucky that I got the experience so

1817
01:14:00,119 --> 01:14:03,840
much and I have some opinions and

1818
01:14:02,119 --> 01:14:05,920
there's some [ __ ] I know is fact but a

1819
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:08,000
lot of it is to be just still

1820
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:10,279
mystery and I think that that's why I

1821
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,399
like herbs so much is that it's what I

1822
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:15,198
don't know that's cool the the know one

1823
01:14:13,399 --> 01:14:18,039
[ __ ] gets dry you're like yeah [ __ ] I

1824
01:14:15,198 --> 01:14:20,238
know no but it's the mystery is the fun

1825
01:14:18,039 --> 01:14:22,760
part you know it's funny that you say

1826
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:25,959
that because I don't know if we talked

1827
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:29,000
about it the last time but I have strong

1828
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:32,000
opinions on certain subjects right but

1829
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:34,960
it would be exciting and amazing if I

1830
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:37,359
was proven wrong mhm like I don't have

1831
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:40,158
this ego where like I Want to Be Right

1832
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:42,479
I'd rather learn something new you know

1833
01:14:40,158 --> 01:14:44,638
so I I think I mentioned it the last

1834
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:47,279
time we spoke about like the debate

1835
01:14:44,639 --> 01:14:50,800
between organic and inorganic in a

1836
01:14:47,279 --> 01:14:53,119
container grown indoors and I just think

1837
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:56,000
that if you try to do it in a container

1838
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:58,238
indoors in 2 months

1839
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,639
you're going to have a hard time doing

1840
01:14:58,238 --> 01:15:03,839
it organic in comparison to using

1841
01:15:00,639 --> 01:15:07,440
minerals but if someone were to show me

1842
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:10,520
oh look how easy it is to do it organic

1843
01:15:07,439 --> 01:15:13,399
and you're going to get a higher quality

1844
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:16,520
product I would be so glad that I that I

1845
01:15:13,399 --> 01:15:18,799
was wrong you know so and what's about

1846
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:21,560
Labor too man it's I know you need

1847
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:23,600
basically you know like we kind of have

1848
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:26,320
some ideas that you need at least 15 to

1849
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:28,360
20 gallons of soil as a sink for a plant

1850
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:30,519
in order to get enough material to

1851
01:15:28,359 --> 01:15:33,000
access to work in what we would call

1852
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:34,719
like a a living indoor system but when

1853
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:37,238
you get into two and three gallon pots

1854
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:38,319
that shit's tough and it just requires

1855
01:15:37,238 --> 01:15:40,439
very

1856
01:15:38,319 --> 01:15:43,319
frequent supplementation where you're

1857
01:15:40,439 --> 01:15:45,919
adding more material and a lot of it

1858
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:47,119
just comes down to work it's it's it's

1859
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:50,760
the same thing

1860
01:15:47,119 --> 01:15:54,760
with if you're running a blue mat is

1861
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:56,639
that cheating where the plants the the

1862
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:59,239
the the moisture level in the media is

1863
01:15:56,639 --> 01:16:02,520
telling it when it needs to be wet

1864
01:15:59,238 --> 01:16:05,718
versus by hand when you feel the plant's

1865
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:09,120
needs and I just think think cheating we

1866
01:16:05,719 --> 01:16:10,960
we fight over this [ __ ] all the time and

1867
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:13,880
what matters is that the method that

1868
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:15,880
you're using works for you and it

1869
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:19,319
produces good quality

1870
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:21,600
cannabis because I I consume I consume

1871
01:16:19,319 --> 01:16:23,238
salt pot that is excellent and then I

1872
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:26,000
consume some salt pot that's pretty damn

1873
01:16:23,238 --> 01:16:29,279
Bland where it looks with Organic though

1874
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,039
right yeah remember back day organic

1875
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:32,519
because it's carbon based but we're

1876
01:16:31,039 --> 01:16:35,319
saying that you're using chemical

1877
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:37,159
delivery as your nutrient source as long

1878
01:16:35,319 --> 01:16:39,920
as we're not using chemistry on the top

1879
01:16:37,158 --> 01:16:42,839
end of the plant I agree I I'm not

1880
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:44,880
having I'm not I'm not so picky where I

1881
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:47,840
won't consume anything that salt based

1882
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:50,159
grown I will it's just that what I

1883
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:52,880
notice is that some things that are

1884
01:16:50,158 --> 01:16:54,920
salt-based grown just don't have the

1885
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:56,520
same quality as things that are

1886
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:58,359
organically produced and organically

1887
01:16:56,520 --> 01:17:00,960
we're going to we're going to say is as

1888
01:16:58,359 --> 01:17:03,279
biologically driven or I call it exate

1889
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:05,039
driven the plant sugars are Drive in the

1890
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:08,439
[ __ ] process right plants driv in the

1891
01:17:05,039 --> 01:17:10,960
process I use the word organic with it

1892
01:17:08,439 --> 01:17:12,960
and just so that that we have a context

1893
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:15,319
because the words get used so

1894
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:17,679
interchangeably but chemically driven

1895
01:17:15,319 --> 01:17:20,119
meaning you're using you're using a salt

1896
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:22,840
solution to you know do the

1897
01:17:20,119 --> 01:17:24,198
uptake um I see some incredible cannabis

1898
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:25,600
that comes out of that as well and I

1899
01:17:24,198 --> 01:17:28,799
think that some of the

1900
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:30,360
mixes um give better results than others

1901
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:33,000
depending on what cultiv are depending

1902
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:35,920
on what person so you kind of you got to

1903
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:39,960
be able to say best is a very specific

1904
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:41,800
phrase that implies a thing not all herb

1905
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:42,560
grown outdoor is better than all herb

1906
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:44,560
grown

1907
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:47,440
indoor I hear it all the time and I'm

1908
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:51,600
like it's not true and I was talking

1909
01:17:47,439 --> 01:17:55,279
about you know uh the concept of

1910
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:59,360
appalachi and valuations

1911
01:17:55,279 --> 01:18:01,599
and I said if we utilize the same say hi

1912
01:17:59,359 --> 01:18:04,238
you want to say hi hi hi hi that's my

1913
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:07,560
son Wilder want to wave his name is

1914
01:18:04,238 --> 01:18:12,399
Wilder okay hi Wilder all right you'll

1915
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:15,280
be good I love you so it was it was this

1916
01:18:12,399 --> 01:18:17,599
idea that that the French had this

1917
01:18:15,279 --> 01:18:18,599
incredible appreciation for the land and

1918
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,320
all these

1919
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:23,239
details and that's what created you know

1920
01:18:21,319 --> 01:18:25,000
the wine industry was this incredible

1921
01:18:23,238 --> 01:18:26,919
appreciation for all this [ __ ] the

1922
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,719
[ __ ] truth of it was and you get into

1923
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:31,319
that 1850 Zone there was three kinds of

1924
01:18:29,719 --> 01:18:34,920
wine red white and

1925
01:18:31,319 --> 01:18:37,920
Ros and it was the world's fair that was

1926
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:39,760
in Paris that prompted the French to

1927
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:42,239
realize that they had the world in their

1928
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:45,639
neighborhood we might as well highlight

1929
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:48,799
a region and bring forth appreciation

1930
01:18:45,639 --> 01:18:52,800
for wine and how did they do it they did

1931
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:54,760
it off the two metrics the the price

1932
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:56,039
point current market price point and

1933
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:59,920
utation of the

1934
01:18:56,039 --> 01:19:03,560
brand and then 70 years later they

1935
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:05,239
Define the AOC which is your this this

1936
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:06,560
appalation of origin where' the product

1937
01:19:05,238 --> 01:19:09,158
come from what's the impact of the

1938
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:11,320
product and this is most definitely real

1939
01:19:09,158 --> 01:19:14,079
regions without question have impact on

1940
01:19:11,319 --> 01:19:16,479
products you can't you can't deny that

1941
01:19:14,079 --> 01:19:18,600
and and my my point of contention on

1942
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:22,519
this this this lecture I gave though was

1943
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:25,440
that if we follow that convention today

1944
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:29,239
right we follow the French's convention

1945
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:31,759
today then jungle boys and cookies would

1946
01:19:29,238 --> 01:19:34,839
be grand crew because their [ __ ] sells

1947
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:37,119
for the most money in La alien too right

1948
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:39,480
most money in Los Angeles most

1949
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:41,119
well-known brands people lost their

1950
01:19:39,479 --> 01:19:43,519
minds and they were like Kev you've lost

1951
01:19:41,119 --> 01:19:45,479
your way you you're like a you're an

1952
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:47,360
outdoor turn coat and I'm like I only

1953
01:19:45,479 --> 01:19:50,559
have an outdoor farm that I produce

1954
01:19:47,359 --> 01:19:52,359
product from I'm just telling you that

1955
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:55,480
these beliefs that we're holding so

1956
01:19:52,359 --> 01:19:56,839
firmly today if we back they said but if

1957
01:19:55,479 --> 01:19:58,759
we went back I said if we went back

1958
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:00,520
they'd have electricity too so they

1959
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:03,560
didn't have the ability to light

1960
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:07,320
anything up in 1850 or you wouldn't

1961
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:10,520
call operating in a greenhouse gas lamp

1962
01:20:07,319 --> 01:20:13,960
technology right so like using lighting

1963
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:16,199
to change the photo period which is all

1964
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:18,719
based off the scoto biology which is

1965
01:20:16,198 --> 01:20:20,960
chicken production so chicken production

1966
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:23,359
educates people on agricultural

1967
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:26,079
production what did they use to change

1968
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:29,399
the lighting black out cloths and what

1969
01:20:26,079 --> 01:20:31,000
[ __ ] gas lamp not electricity well if

1970
01:20:29,399 --> 01:20:33,039
they didn't have a gas lamp you wouldn't

1971
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,520
have gas lamp technology right you still

1972
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:38,000
wouldn't be doing any kind of flower

1973
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:40,159
forcing so they obviously used the

1974
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,439
technology they had which was a goddamn

1975
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:44,960
candle can can you explain this a little

1976
01:20:42,439 --> 01:20:45,960
bit better to me as far as how cuz I

1977
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,359
don't know anything about chicken

1978
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:51,198
breeding or oh

1979
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:54,000
totally what what Farmers noticed was

1980
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:55,919
that hens laid better under certain

1981
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,079
light conditions

1982
01:20:55,920 --> 01:21:00,800
durational Light breaking up light

1983
01:20:58,079 --> 01:21:03,960
patterns and so they call that scoto

1984
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:06,440
biology and it's it's almost it's it's a

1985
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:10,439
very similar parallel to me as the

1986
01:21:06,439 --> 01:21:13,879
parallel to Bricks so BRX right so so

1987
01:21:10,439 --> 01:21:16,960
the idea of measuring sugar as a means

1988
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:20,000
of determining when a crop should be

1989
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:22,639
harvested was developed for grape so

1990
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:25,158
this individual develops the science to

1991
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:27,199
determine when is a grape

1992
01:21:25,158 --> 01:21:29,799
when do we Harvest we because remember

1993
01:21:27,198 --> 01:21:31,519
we're just we Harvest off all this [ __ ]

1994
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:33,279
there's no science it just has to be

1995
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:35,600
empirical it has to be through our eyes

1996
01:21:33,279 --> 01:21:37,599
only so they said there must be a way to

1997
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,000
do this and so they come up with an idea

1998
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,920
hey we can measure

1999
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:43,719
sugars they they they they run a strip

2000
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:46,440
through a refractometer you see the

2001
01:21:43,719 --> 01:21:49,198
level and they say okay this sugar level

2002
01:21:46,439 --> 01:21:50,879
is higher than it was a week ago we have

2003
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:52,559
a greater sugar in the product this

2004
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:53,880
sugar should give us a better end

2005
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,400
product because that sugar is going to

2006
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:57,800
convert into

2007
01:21:55,399 --> 01:22:01,279
MH once you apply the fermentation

2008
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:04,440
process well the next question was can

2009
01:22:01,279 --> 01:22:07,599
we apply it to all foods and all of a

2010
01:22:04,439 --> 01:22:09,879
sudden bricks based agriculture is born

2011
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:13,360
but it's based off of first when do you

2012
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:16,639
pick a grape and then it became how do

2013
01:22:13,359 --> 01:22:20,279
we drive nutrient density into all these

2014
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:22,480
crops so scoto biology is the first step

2015
01:22:20,279 --> 01:22:24,880
in light manipulation with plants

2016
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:28,000
because it's it's Farmers being a W that

2017
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:31,079
if we manipulate lighting we can impact

2018
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:33,719
chicken production well someone said

2019
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:36,000
what else does it do and do I know who's

2020
01:22:33,719 --> 01:22:37,760
who did that no I don't need to I just

2021
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,840
need to know where it came from where

2022
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:43,520
the idea was it B was it born and then

2023
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:45,079
how did it evolve and so then they it

2024
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:46,560
evolves into glass house and they used

2025
01:22:45,079 --> 01:22:48,238
to call them green houses were called

2026
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:50,600
glad glass hous they also called

2027
01:22:48,238 --> 01:22:54,039
conservatories and that's all 18 that's

2028
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:56,239
all you know London east Europe people

2029
01:22:54,039 --> 01:22:58,158
withone had conservatories which let

2030
01:22:56,238 --> 01:23:00,959
them grow tropical plants and cold

2031
01:22:58,158 --> 01:23:03,920
environments because it was a

2032
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:06,880
flex the whole the the the wealthy

2033
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:08,960
always flex and the flex at that time

2034
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,639
was these was these beautiful mazike

2035
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,960
gardens and

2036
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:16,039
conservatories and it it even continued

2037
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:17,760
in the US all the way up into the 70s

2038
01:23:16,039 --> 01:23:20,920
with like when Silicone Valley wealth

2039
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:23,880
started to explode in the 70s early 80s

2040
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:25,920
all the wealthy went big on landscaping

2041
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:28,560
and then real realized that the next

2042
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,679
step was Winer reacquisition and so

2043
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:31,800
that's when you started to see

2044
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:34,119
California wine being touched by all the

2045
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:36,920
mega wealthy as wine owners wine

2046
01:23:34,119 --> 01:23:39,679
investors because it it allowed them to

2047
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:43,399
flex on something that allowed them to

2048
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:46,840
lose money on the investment but reduce

2049
01:23:43,399 --> 01:23:48,879
capital gains on their income so like

2050
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:52,639
all these things that we see have all

2051
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:54,639
these impacts that shape and change so

2052
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:56,079
Glass House technology they they weren't

2053
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:59,000
growing that [ __ ] till they figured out

2054
01:23:56,079 --> 01:24:02,399
how to [ __ ] trap you you know um heat

2055
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:04,800
and UV inside a structure you weren't

2056
01:24:02,399 --> 01:24:07,439
getting flowering to occur or not

2057
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:11,320
getting it to occur without that gas

2058
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:13,359
lamp technology so if we call you know

2059
01:24:11,319 --> 01:24:15,198
the original Green Houses glass houses

2060
01:24:13,359 --> 01:24:17,679
and we call it gas lamp that means they

2061
01:24:15,198 --> 01:24:23,439
were using technology they were using

2062
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:25,480
science so what we do is we we we hold

2063
01:24:23,439 --> 01:24:27,960
these things in our mind mind is the

2064
01:24:25,479 --> 01:24:31,599
purity of what they did but when the

2065
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:33,480
French created the system this was the

2066
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:35,360
foundation and so me and a bunch of

2067
01:24:33,479 --> 01:24:36,919
these cats from that that that are wine

2068
01:24:35,359 --> 01:24:38,158
based got into this argument and then a

2069
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:40,359
bunch of people that know me from

2070
01:24:38,158 --> 01:24:42,000
cultivation got into it saying oh my God

2071
01:24:40,359 --> 01:24:45,238
you're destroying the world of organic

2072
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:48,760
outdoor and I'm like I'm not I'm simply

2073
01:24:45,238 --> 01:24:52,158
stating that when they created these

2074
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:55,520
systems it was using the information

2075
01:24:52,158 --> 01:24:58,039
they had at that time and so we have to

2076
01:24:55,520 --> 01:25:01,600
look at it that same situation

2077
01:24:58,039 --> 01:25:04,760
today wherein Kevin have you ever heard

2078
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:06,920
about Rudolf Steiner he was an yeah

2079
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:10,960
Austrian architect and also very

2080
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:16,520
esoteric at that time he he was born in

2081
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:18,719
1861 and died in 1922 25 but he actually

2082
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:21,239
is a marker in European times he lived

2083
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:24,399
in Switzerland uh most of his time I

2084
01:25:21,238 --> 01:25:27,158
think uh and he has a center of esoteric

2085
01:25:24,399 --> 01:25:30,759
you know he's a and he's like somebody

2086
01:25:27,158 --> 01:25:33,920
that uh this hippie generation that was

2087
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:37,000
then you know like in the 60s or 70s

2088
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:39,560
here in in Europe in Eastern Europe also

2089
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,800
was looking up to like building your own

2090
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:44,280
your own house you look for

2091
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:47,600
architectural like Rudolf Steiner or

2092
01:25:44,279 --> 01:25:50,639
Fred hund vaser you know the the other

2093
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:52,639
Austrian they have no uh sharp edges you

2094
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:56,000
know they all all everything is from

2095
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:59,039
nature everything is like with waves and

2096
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:01,279
uh it's like everything like even in USA

2097
01:25:59,039 --> 01:26:04,560
I think guys did few years ago this

2098
01:26:01,279 --> 01:26:07,238
Earth ships in New Mexico the desert

2099
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:10,119
yeah that kind of philosophy to to

2100
01:26:07,238 --> 01:26:12,638
involve to go into the nature to to you

2101
01:26:10,118 --> 01:26:15,198
know that that is us actually that kind

2102
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:18,600
of people we are always interested uh we

2103
01:26:15,198 --> 01:26:20,000
will be working until we die you know oh

2104
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:22,280
yeah there's no there's no end of it

2105
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:25,000
there's no no there is no pension you

2106
01:26:22,279 --> 01:26:26,840
know it's like there is no I mean

2107
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,000
pension in the sense that you would stop

2108
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:32,119
working on something you know cuz you

2109
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:34,840
you you you seem to me like a guy that

2110
01:26:32,118 --> 01:26:38,039
will be like written in history books

2111
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:40,920
you know like uh something you do know

2112
01:26:38,039 --> 01:26:43,479
yeah yeah man you're infected you are

2113
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:46,319
infected with the virus you know of uh

2114
01:26:43,479 --> 01:26:48,198
researching Canabis until you until you

2115
01:26:46,319 --> 01:26:50,439
die you know yeah there's no there's no

2116
01:26:48,198 --> 01:26:52,919
way it's it's really it's funny but like

2117
01:26:50,439 --> 01:26:55,799
when I started growing in the 70s it was

2118
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:57,480
outdoor in my grand mother's Garden yeah

2119
01:26:55,800 --> 01:27:01,560
and then I you know in the in the in the

2120
01:26:57,479 --> 01:27:04,638
80s I get into doing indoor and then in

2121
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:06,840
the the mid 2000s when we're allowed to

2122
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:09,359
really go back outside because there was

2123
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:11,560
some loopholes in the

2124
01:27:09,359 --> 01:27:13,799
law you know you returned to your

2125
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:17,480
outdoor cultivation and as I started to

2126
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:19,679
get older I started to realize that with

2127
01:27:17,479 --> 01:27:21,238
legalization if I had the ability to

2128
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:24,359
spend the rest of my life legally

2129
01:27:21,238 --> 01:27:27,559
cultivating I wanted to do it outside in

2130
01:27:24,359 --> 01:27:29,319
a biological system and it was just

2131
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:33,039
purely

2132
01:27:29,319 --> 01:27:36,079
because there was so much mystery that

2133
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:38,960
remained that it let me be in wonder

2134
01:27:36,079 --> 01:27:41,679
where when I'm in technological systems

2135
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:43,920
I'm amazed at the complexity of the

2136
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:47,039
technology but there's a disconnect

2137
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:49,560
that's different and I'd spent so many

2138
01:27:47,039 --> 01:27:50,960
years [ __ ] decades you know grinding out

2139
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:53,840
indoor

2140
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:56,840
operations that I wanted to finish my

2141
01:27:53,840 --> 01:28:01,520
career Under the Sun and it's almost

2142
01:27:56,840 --> 01:28:04,920
like a complete reversal of no Tech and

2143
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:07,000
I call it like you know natural Tech

2144
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:09,600
where you're you're using natural

2145
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,560
systems and you're forced to bend to

2146
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:14,280
that

2147
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:17,719
constraint and you may only get you know

2148
01:28:14,279 --> 01:28:21,039
a a a a true vintage year you know every

2149
01:28:17,719 --> 01:28:24,158
just like wine 20 20 you know two out of

2150
01:28:21,039 --> 01:28:25,679
10 four out of 10 tops so out of 10 year

2151
01:28:24,158 --> 01:28:27,439
period only two to four of those are

2152
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:30,440
going to be what we consider a vintage

2153
01:28:27,439 --> 01:28:33,079
year where phenomenal conditions but at

2154
01:28:30,439 --> 01:28:34,759
that moment in time the product's

2155
01:28:33,079 --> 01:28:36,880
unbelievable and like coincidentally

2156
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:38,400
this was one of those years this was one

2157
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,520
of those vintage years where this is

2158
01:28:38,399 --> 01:28:41,238
probably one of the best years of

2159
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:44,800
cultivation we had in in the Triangle

2160
01:28:41,238 --> 01:28:46,519
probably the last decade minimum and to

2161
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:49,440
be able to be part of it was incredible

2162
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:51,199
to be able to watch this this climate

2163
01:28:49,439 --> 01:28:53,638
just bring out these

2164
01:28:51,198 --> 01:28:56,238
qualities I dig and but does that mean

2165
01:28:53,639 --> 01:28:58,079
that I think it's the only way no and

2166
01:28:56,238 --> 01:29:00,959
just because I like it and I think that

2167
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:02,319
it has a a low impact on the environment

2168
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:06,239
does that mean that everyone has to

2169
01:29:02,319 --> 01:29:07,880
follow what I do know I'm I'm that's the

2170
01:29:06,238 --> 01:29:09,678
whole point of me being Buck Wild my

2171
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:10,880
whole life and and and running around

2172
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:13,039
was I don't want to get told what the

2173
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:15,159
[ __ ] to do I'm not I don't want to get

2174
01:29:13,039 --> 01:29:17,600
told the [ __ ] what to do kind of guy so

2175
01:29:15,158 --> 01:29:20,559
I don't usually try to tell other people

2176
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:22,520
what to do it's just what we try to do

2177
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:24,159
is put information on the table so

2178
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:26,440
people can take from it from the open

2179
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:28,599
and plate as they choose and if they

2180
01:29:26,439 --> 01:29:31,039
want to refute it they refute it if they

2181
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:33,960
want to use it they can use it but it

2182
01:29:31,039 --> 01:29:35,519
allows us to be able to work I think

2183
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:37,600
more

2184
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:39,760
cohesively and I think that that's what

2185
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:42,800
I really wanted out of the experience of

2186
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:44,800
like public cannabis was being able to

2187
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:47,079
look at a thousand different things and

2188
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:48,760
get a thousand different viewpoints and

2189
01:29:47,079 --> 01:29:51,639
we're all able to kind of come together

2190
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:53,079
on some generalizations we all agree on

2191
01:29:51,639 --> 01:29:55,600
and then there's some [ __ ] that nobody

2192
01:29:53,079 --> 01:29:58,760
agrees on and that's what lets us stay

2193
01:29:55,600 --> 01:30:01,079
hungry until we find out I think I said

2194
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:03,440
this before but we don't want to be

2195
01:30:01,079 --> 01:30:06,639
influencers we want to be people that

2196
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:08,879
Inspire yeah totally right you know like

2197
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:12,639
I'll tell you how I do it and if you're

2198
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:14,319
inspired by it then that's awesome um

2199
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:16,760
one thing I wanted to ask you is do you

2200
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:20,399
know a guy he's a uh teacher here in

2201
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:22,480
Soma County Bob Canard I don't know Bob

2202
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:24,319
I'll I'll send you an uh a video to

2203
01:30:22,479 --> 01:30:27,959
watch from him but I I like to talk

2204
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:30,960
about him because he was my organic

2205
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:34,039
gardening teacher at the Sona County uh

2206
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:37,800
at the Canta Rosa JC and it was so

2207
01:30:34,039 --> 01:30:40,719
inspiring um what he told us was that we

2208
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:43,520
had to grow two plants for the Earth for

2209
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:46,520
every plant that we gr for ourself so

2210
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:49,239
that we're never depleting it and holy

2211
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:50,400
no no that I love it when you went to

2212
01:30:49,238 --> 01:30:52,959
his

2213
01:30:50,399 --> 01:30:54,679
farm at First Sight all you saw was

2214
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:56,600
Weeds

2215
01:30:54,679 --> 01:30:58,319
right it's just like weeds everywhere

2216
01:30:56,600 --> 01:31:01,000
and then as you walk through the field

2217
01:30:58,319 --> 01:31:03,399
of weeds you see the plants that are

2218
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:07,079
growing you know basically almost

2219
01:31:03,399 --> 01:31:08,839
covered in Weeds um and the food that we

2220
01:31:07,079 --> 01:31:12,359
ate there was it was like from the

2221
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:16,159
Garden of Eden it was it was incredible

2222
01:31:12,359 --> 01:31:17,639
and while I loved growing organic he was

2223
01:31:16,158 --> 01:31:19,879
the one that made me

2224
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:22,800
realize can't really do this in a short

2225
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:25,079
period of time in a pot no it's it's you

2226
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:29,320
know it's like it's the

2227
01:31:25,079 --> 01:31:31,960
IND yeah yeah and and so you know people

2228
01:31:29,319 --> 01:31:35,399
think when I talk about how I don't

2229
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:37,520
think you can grow organic in a pot in a

2230
01:31:35,399 --> 01:31:41,279
couple of months they think that I'm a

2231
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:44,760
hater of Organics but no I I just feel

2232
01:31:41,279 --> 01:31:46,800
like it's a longterm thing like he

2233
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:50,280
bought a piece of land that was in

2234
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:52,679
really bad shape and he didn't go and

2235
01:31:50,279 --> 01:31:56,439
dump truckloads of compost to grow in

2236
01:31:52,679 --> 01:31:59,199
there you know because that's right he

2237
01:31:56,439 --> 01:32:01,359
built it you know using the biology and

2238
01:31:59,198 --> 01:32:04,319
by using plants to feed the

2239
01:32:01,359 --> 01:32:05,479
soil and uh like I said I just wanted to

2240
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:07,519
ask you if you knew about him because

2241
01:32:05,479 --> 01:32:10,439
he's really inspiring and I'm going to

2242
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:11,960
just send you a link um on some YouTube

2243
01:32:10,439 --> 01:32:13,638
videos from him because I think you'd

2244
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:16,198
enjoy them I would I would cuz that's

2245
01:32:13,639 --> 01:32:19,520
what what got me really fascinated with

2246
01:32:16,198 --> 01:32:22,399
Simplicity was the one straw

2247
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:25,520
Revolution and the idea that this this

2248
01:32:22,399 --> 01:32:28,039
Japanese gentleman Chang the entire

2249
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:30,560
country's approach to

2250
01:32:28,039 --> 01:32:35,639
agriculture through the the simple fact

2251
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:38,159
of putting straw on the ground and then

2252
01:32:35,639 --> 01:32:39,960
having chickens [ __ ] on it or ducks and

2253
01:32:38,158 --> 01:32:41,759
so you only you and he he knew you only

2254
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:43,000
need to have you know like 10 ducks for

2255
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:46,079
every quarter

2256
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:47,800
acre and so over the course of you know

2257
01:32:46,079 --> 01:32:51,198
20 30

2258
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:54,840
years he ends up adding you know two

2259
01:32:51,198 --> 01:32:57,559
inches of top soil and he's just like

2260
01:32:54,840 --> 01:33:01,159
that and it it was

2261
01:32:57,560 --> 01:33:03,480
this forever View and it helped and when

2262
01:33:01,158 --> 01:33:05,879
I got lucky that I got to do a I spent a

2263
01:33:03,479 --> 01:33:09,799
lot of time with the regenerative

2264
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:11,679
groups and it was this same thing it was

2265
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:13,199
that it's a forever process it's not a

2266
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:15,560
race it isn't like you build this thing

2267
01:33:13,198 --> 01:33:18,319
and it's done and it just works it's

2268
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:20,280
it's forever and it allows you to

2269
01:33:18,319 --> 01:33:22,079
understand that it if you just work

2270
01:33:20,279 --> 01:33:24,599
towards your goal you'll get to it at

2271
01:33:22,079 --> 01:33:26,439
some point and it's the process of

2272
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:28,600
working towards the goal like everything

2273
01:33:26,439 --> 01:33:31,399
it's like whatever we do the work is

2274
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:34,079
what really defines the outcome I mean

2275
01:33:31,399 --> 01:33:35,479
you you win a lotto ticket it's easy you

2276
01:33:34,079 --> 01:33:37,118
scratch a ticket but the odds of that

2277
01:33:35,479 --> 01:33:39,919
are like you know one in 400

2278
01:33:37,118 --> 01:33:43,399
million so very limited chance of

2279
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:46,239
success but if we work towards a goal

2280
01:33:43,399 --> 01:33:48,839
and you chip away you'll get closer to

2281
01:33:46,238 --> 01:33:51,799
it and even if you don't get the exact

2282
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:54,039
goal the process alerted you to many

2283
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:56,480
Pathways to where you want to go and end

2284
01:33:54,039 --> 01:34:00,238
up having alternative routes that

2285
01:33:56,479 --> 01:34:02,919
work and I just think that we as a

2286
01:34:00,238 --> 01:34:04,319
culture have become so instantaneous in

2287
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:06,359
what we

2288
01:34:04,319 --> 01:34:08,759
demand we don't ever want to put the

2289
01:34:06,359 --> 01:34:12,719
time in and we don't understand that

2290
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:14,719
it's the actual time that's the gift

2291
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:17,439
it's not the end product as much as you

2292
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:21,840
think it's the work

2293
01:34:17,439 --> 01:34:24,839
the the process changes you it it Sands

2294
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:27,560
off your rough edges it's kind of like

2295
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:30,800
being out in the desert the the wind and

2296
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:31,760
the sand just slowly start to round off

2297
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:37,039
all the

2298
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:39,039
lines and that that worn smooth look is

2299
01:34:37,039 --> 01:34:43,960
is comfortable to the

2300
01:34:39,039 --> 01:34:45,600
eye there's a there's a a feel and I

2301
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:47,920
just think that we've we've become so

2302
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:52,119
instantaneous that we don't really

2303
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:54,319
understand that you know you're you like

2304
01:34:52,118 --> 01:34:55,679
to me you never get to the end

2305
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:56,719
because then when you get to where your

2306
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:59,679
goal

2307
01:34:56,719 --> 01:35:02,239
was it allows you to be able to see

2308
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:03,880
other goals from that vantage point that

2309
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:06,000
you couldn't see prior because you

2310
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:08,319
didn't have the skills or the experience

2311
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,760
or the wisdom to understand but once you

2312
01:35:08,319 --> 01:35:10,840
spend five years trying to figure

2313
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:13,719
something out and you get to a point

2314
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:15,639
you're like okay this is how much I know

2315
01:35:13,719 --> 01:35:17,000
this is how much I don't know and you're

2316
01:35:15,639 --> 01:35:18,440
able to kind of figure do you want to

2317
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:21,600
continue down that road or you want to

2318
01:35:18,439 --> 01:35:24,839
start a new path and and to me that is

2319
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:26,520
the the world of Agriculture and pl and

2320
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:28,800
there's just Mysteries we don't

2321
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:31,000
understand because maybe we're not meant

2322
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:34,159
to you know I don't I don't think I want

2323
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:36,399
to know every detail I don't I don't the

2324
01:35:34,158 --> 01:35:38,000
idea of engineering humans sounds great

2325
01:35:36,399 --> 01:35:39,719
because you'll you'll get rid of all

2326
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,639
these diseases and you'll get rid of all

2327
01:35:39,719 --> 01:35:43,880
these

2328
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:46,199
issues and you also take away the very

2329
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:49,440
thing that makes human life valuable is

2330
01:35:46,198 --> 01:35:52,079
that it's limited if you live forever

2331
01:35:49,439 --> 01:35:55,198
would you appreciate things the same

2332
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:56,679
way you know I me you don't so what you

2333
01:35:55,198 --> 01:35:58,198
what you and as you grow older you

2334
01:35:56,679 --> 01:36:00,600
realize it because you know I got a lot

2335
01:35:58,198 --> 01:36:04,279
of friends of mine that are dead you

2336
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:07,320
make sure that you you you are a little

2337
01:36:04,279 --> 01:36:09,399
bit more thoughtful in the in

2338
01:36:07,319 --> 01:36:11,319
interactions and you make sure that you

2339
01:36:09,399 --> 01:36:15,079
enjoy these little moments a little bit

2340
01:36:11,319 --> 01:36:16,799
more profound because they could end and

2341
01:36:15,079 --> 01:36:17,960
I I think that when you start to have

2342
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:21,800
you know no

2343
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:21,800
risk what's the reward

2344
01:36:22,039 --> 01:36:25,319
worth and that's an opinion so I mean

2345
01:36:24,158 --> 01:36:28,479
I'm not saying everybody's going to live

2346
01:36:25,319 --> 01:36:30,759
that life but you know the the the

2347
01:36:28,479 --> 01:36:32,638
strugg philosophy strugg a philosophy

2348
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:35,400
it's it's not an opinion it's a

2349
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:38,159
philosophy and uh it reminds me of uh

2350
01:36:35,399 --> 01:36:41,519
the conversation that we had before we

2351
01:36:38,158 --> 01:36:44,198
ever recorded together and I laugh about

2352
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:46,639
this now and I I actually brag about it

2353
01:36:44,198 --> 01:36:49,198
is that we're talking about Master

2354
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:50,960
Gardeners you said oh you said you're a

2355
01:36:49,198 --> 01:36:54,759
master gardener and so what I did was

2356
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:58,198
now in my bio I write Gabby bronstein or

2357
01:36:54,760 --> 01:37:01,800
Gabby Staten Island open quotes Master

2358
01:36:58,198 --> 01:37:03,799
Garder close quotes by Kevin jrey

2359
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:06,920
totally cuz Kevin JRE called me a Master

2360
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:09,199
Gardener it was like one of the I

2361
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:11,840
blushed but it's genuine what I wanted

2362
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:13,960
to say is that what I say is I don't

2363
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:15,560
want to master anything this is what I

2364
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:18,198
said to you and I'd like you to repeat

2365
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:20,119
what you know what your response was I

2366
01:37:18,198 --> 01:37:22,599
thought the Master Gardener term was

2367
01:37:20,118 --> 01:37:24,439
kind of like well this means I've got

2368
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:26,440
nothing left to learn I know everything

2369
01:37:24,439 --> 01:37:30,118
and I'm not going to learn from you

2370
01:37:26,439 --> 01:37:34,599
because I'm your master and and you gave

2371
01:37:30,118 --> 01:37:36,238
me a different um definition of it and

2372
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:38,119
not only did it make me feel good that

2373
01:37:36,238 --> 01:37:39,759
you said I'm a master but it also made

2374
01:37:38,118 --> 01:37:41,439
made me think about things differently

2375
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:43,079
just like you did when we had the

2376
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:45,799
conversation about you know what is

2377
01:37:43,079 --> 01:37:48,319
craft cannabis because honestly after

2378
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:49,920
talking to you I think I was wrong which

2379
01:37:48,319 --> 01:37:51,759
like I said I like being wrong but like

2380
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:54,359
what I thought about craft cannabis

2381
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:55,400
today is different than what I did

2382
01:37:54,359 --> 01:37:59,598
after our

2383
01:37:55,399 --> 01:38:02,799
conversation totally the what people do

2384
01:37:59,599 --> 01:38:04,639
is they they they they put titles on

2385
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:06,719
themselves because it makes them feel

2386
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:07,880
good and and and that's okay we all we

2387
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:10,399
all need some

2388
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:11,639
self-affirmation but when you're talking

2389
01:38:10,399 --> 01:38:15,479
about a

2390
01:38:11,639 --> 01:38:18,039
craft something done by hand then we can

2391
01:38:15,479 --> 01:38:20,919
say that there's Craftsman Crafts

2392
01:38:18,039 --> 01:38:23,560
People and almost all crafts have an

2393
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:28,279
evolution of development we start out

2394
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:31,159
out as as apprentice you're you're

2395
01:38:28,279 --> 01:38:33,639
unskilled and you need to be

2396
01:38:31,158 --> 01:38:35,158
supervised as you develop that ability

2397
01:38:33,639 --> 01:38:37,079
you become a journeyman you're somebody

2398
01:38:35,158 --> 01:38:39,198
that can work independently but you're

2399
01:38:37,079 --> 01:38:41,840
not qualified to run a project you don't

2400
01:38:39,198 --> 01:38:43,799
have big picture perspective when you

2401
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:46,400
become a master at a craft you have an

2402
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:49,279
ability to run a project and educate

2403
01:38:46,399 --> 01:38:52,439
Journeymen who then supervise

2404
01:38:49,279 --> 01:38:55,359
apprentices so my family was filled with

2405
01:38:52,439 --> 01:38:58,000
master welder Master Carpenters master

2406
01:38:55,359 --> 01:39:00,639
plumbers Master electricians when I was

2407
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:03,198
in the military I worked for master

2408
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:05,560
diver does that mean that that Master

2409
01:39:03,198 --> 01:39:08,079
diver and and and the first Master diver

2410
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:10,320
I worked for was a guy named Payne Bosa

2411
01:39:08,079 --> 01:39:12,760
mate Master Chief Payne what a what an

2412
01:39:10,319 --> 01:39:16,479
appropriate name this guy was hard as

2413
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:18,599
[ __ ] but brilliant but at no Moment In

2414
01:39:16,479 --> 01:39:21,799
Time the any of these people at the

2415
01:39:18,599 --> 01:39:24,119
Master Level ever think that there's not

2416
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:26,079
more for them to learn

2417
01:39:24,118 --> 01:39:28,039
but what they know is that they're

2418
01:39:26,079 --> 01:39:30,118
probably the most qualified in the room

2419
01:39:28,039 --> 01:39:31,198
at that moment and that their job is to

2420
01:39:30,118 --> 01:39:33,920
run the

2421
01:39:31,198 --> 01:39:36,559
project and so when you're a master

2422
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:38,719
cultivator you're able to do that I'm a

2423
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:40,039
Master Gardener and I said that to

2424
01:39:38,719 --> 01:39:41,639
somebody and someone said and what makes

2425
01:39:40,039 --> 01:39:43,800
you think so I said University of

2426
01:39:41,639 --> 01:39:46,079
California Berkeley so it's really

2427
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:49,480
simple that they I I [ __ ] took a

2428
01:39:46,079 --> 01:39:52,198
program and I passed the test and it

2429
01:39:49,479 --> 01:39:55,198
allows me now to do one very specific

2430
01:39:52,198 --> 01:39:58,198
thing it lets me communicate

2431
01:39:55,198 --> 01:40:01,198
agricultural principles based off of the

2432
01:39:58,198 --> 01:40:04,479
database of UC Berkeley so that way what

2433
01:40:01,198 --> 01:40:06,519
we have is we have consistent

2434
01:40:04,479 --> 01:40:08,598
information but do I think that that's

2435
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:11,080
the end or be all of all things no it's

2436
01:40:08,599 --> 01:40:12,880
just that they know that we can say this

2437
01:40:11,079 --> 01:40:16,519
because there's

2438
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:18,039
proof but that's why footnotes there are

2439
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:20,280
there are footnotes you know when you

2440
01:40:18,039 --> 01:40:23,079
read literature there is footnotes and

2441
01:40:20,279 --> 01:40:25,279
footnotes means that you go and search

2442
01:40:23,079 --> 01:40:27,960
for or in because this information that

2443
01:40:25,279 --> 01:40:29,880
somebody writes down has to be valid you

2444
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:33,639
know it has to come from

2445
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:35,560
somewhere what your hypothesis you know

2446
01:40:33,639 --> 01:40:37,719
people today don't even know what

2447
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:40,400
footnotes are and why they are standing

2448
01:40:37,719 --> 01:40:42,719
for you know if sometimes one book can

2449
01:40:40,399 --> 01:40:46,118
be I mean for example here is a a book

2450
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:48,560
of bamboo it's called the big book the

2451
01:40:46,118 --> 01:40:51,639
book of bamboo by David F you know it's

2452
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:53,880
American guy and it's a it's a

2453
01:40:51,639 --> 01:40:56,719
encyclopedia where you have uh after

2454
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:58,960
each chapter you have uh footnote you

2455
01:40:56,719 --> 01:41:01,439
have like the secondary literature where

2456
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:04,599
you can search for more books and this

2457
01:41:01,439 --> 01:41:07,519
book is actually the gateway to like 500

2458
01:41:04,599 --> 01:41:10,360
books oh totally yeah which is really

2459
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:11,679
specific really really specific you know

2460
01:41:10,359 --> 01:41:15,118
and because they're taking they're

2461
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:18,279
saying that this does this based off of

2462
01:41:15,118 --> 01:41:21,639
the work that this person did prior and

2463
01:41:18,279 --> 01:41:24,039
it it's a respect for others work and

2464
01:41:21,639 --> 01:41:27,400
you're not trying to say you invented it

2465
01:41:24,039 --> 01:41:30,238
you're just saying hey I I endorse it I

2466
01:41:27,399 --> 01:41:32,359
use it I'm letting you be aware of it

2467
01:41:30,238 --> 01:41:33,158
but this is the person who came up with

2468
01:41:32,359 --> 01:41:35,079
the

2469
01:41:33,158 --> 01:41:37,279
idea and

2470
01:41:35,079 --> 01:41:38,960
so otherwise it becomes this you know

2471
01:41:37,279 --> 01:41:40,439
everyone's like you know your master

2472
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:43,520
it's just like people use the word

2473
01:41:40,439 --> 01:41:45,719
improperly but if you're in trades the

2474
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:47,840
master plumber who's running the project

2475
01:41:45,719 --> 01:41:51,039
doesn't say I'm not a master Plummer I'm

2476
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:52,599
I'm just a like it's a [ __ ] title

2477
01:41:51,039 --> 01:41:54,399
it's kind of like saying you know when

2478
01:41:52,599 --> 01:41:57,199
you're CEO of the company or you're the

2479
01:41:54,399 --> 01:41:59,598
COO or the CFO or the CTO or whatever

2480
01:41:57,198 --> 01:42:02,598
the [ __ ] SE Suite you are you just say

2481
01:41:59,599 --> 01:42:04,119
it it's your title it's just what it is

2482
01:42:02,599 --> 01:42:05,719
does that mean that you're the only one

2483
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:08,559
on earth no does it mean you're the best

2484
01:42:05,719 --> 01:42:10,279
one on earth no it could be you know if

2485
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:12,119
you're if you're talking about you know

2486
01:42:10,279 --> 01:42:13,519
somebody running one of these uh Venture

2487
01:42:12,118 --> 01:42:15,319
Capital firms and they're carrying a

2488
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:19,360
trillion in value I would say that's

2489
01:42:15,319 --> 01:42:20,960
probably a pretty intelligent CEO but in

2490
01:42:19,359 --> 01:42:24,439
general it just

2491
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:27,719
States a a fact and in cannabis to me if

2492
01:42:24,439 --> 01:42:29,839
you're a master at it you're you're so I

2493
01:42:27,719 --> 01:42:33,960
wouldn't consider myself a master indoor

2494
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:37,639
grower because I no long like I I study

2495
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:41,359
and I research and I work but that's not

2496
01:42:37,639 --> 01:42:43,359
where I put my time I shift it over to

2497
01:42:41,359 --> 01:42:44,920
how to plants work with operations how

2498
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:47,839
to plants work with

2499
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:49,880
people and it lets me lets me work on

2500
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:51,880
what I like which is biologically driven

2501
01:42:49,880 --> 01:42:54,480
Sun grown that's where I want to spend

2502
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:56,760
my time as a cultivator but I research

2503
01:42:54,479 --> 01:42:59,598
indoor and outdoor and mix light

2504
01:42:56,760 --> 01:43:03,199
operations continuously so I can

2505
01:42:59,599 --> 01:43:06,119
understand impact on cultivar selection

2506
01:43:03,198 --> 01:43:09,519
and on cultiv our performance so I kind

2507
01:43:06,118 --> 01:43:12,079
of figured out where I really enjoy what

2508
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:15,400
I do so I have to understand how your

2509
01:43:12,079 --> 01:43:17,359
operation works but I know rippers of

2510
01:43:15,399 --> 01:43:19,559
people that are far smarter than I am

2511
01:43:17,359 --> 01:43:23,118
and in in all these different areas that

2512
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:25,119
I'm involved in I just try to be in

2513
01:43:23,118 --> 01:43:26,439
intelligent in integrating all these

2514
01:43:25,118 --> 01:43:28,359
things

2515
01:43:26,439 --> 01:43:30,198
simultaneously that's kind of like my

2516
01:43:28,359 --> 01:43:32,359
skill set is that I can pull out of a

2517
01:43:30,198 --> 01:43:33,879
giant bag and put it together into a

2518
01:43:32,359 --> 01:43:36,598
ball

2519
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:38,760
but the ability for me to say hey I know

2520
01:43:36,599 --> 01:43:40,920
someone better in every room is

2521
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:42,679
critical because then what it does it

2522
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:46,679
always makes sure that you're crystal

2523
01:43:42,679 --> 01:43:49,079
clear about your level and rank and and

2524
01:43:46,679 --> 01:43:51,158
that isn't something that most people

2525
01:43:49,079 --> 01:43:53,639
want to do because you you have to be

2526
01:43:51,158 --> 01:43:55,598
comfortable with yourself to do it and

2527
01:43:53,639 --> 01:43:58,440
what we have is I think a society of

2528
01:43:55,599 --> 01:44:00,800
people that unfortunately been beat down

2529
01:43:58,439 --> 01:44:02,839
because you're living in the media so if

2530
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:04,800
you're not if you're not rocking really

2531
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:06,800
nice [ __ ] you don't have all these

2532
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:09,079
things all this stuff you're not

2533
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:10,639
somebody and so you need you need

2534
01:44:09,079 --> 01:44:12,399
validation I think that's like with

2535
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:15,440
cannabis that was like the big issue

2536
01:44:12,399 --> 01:44:17,759
where when the world of legality was

2537
01:44:15,439 --> 01:44:19,839
coming in everyone in cannabis said well

2538
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:22,119
they don't have our skills well yeah

2539
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:25,159
they [ __ ] do and well they don't have

2540
01:44:22,118 --> 01:44:28,519
our genes yeah they do they do so what

2541
01:44:25,158 --> 01:44:30,799
is it that you have what do you have if

2542
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:32,800
everyone has all your secret [ __ ] you

2543
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:35,560
don't have anything except pissed off in

2544
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:37,039
anger and rage and what needs to happen

2545
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:39,159
is you need to say I got you I need to

2546
01:44:37,039 --> 01:44:41,960
go and tighten up my [ __ ] and continue

2547
01:44:39,158 --> 01:44:45,319
my educational process but who wants to

2548
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:48,399
do that when you're making lawyer money

2549
01:44:45,319 --> 01:44:50,920
out of your closet right so like it's

2550
01:44:48,399 --> 01:44:52,039
tough when you when you incentivize

2551
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:54,118
things

2552
01:44:52,039 --> 01:44:56,238
financially it makes you think you're

2553
01:44:54,118 --> 01:44:59,238
smart because we measure everything in

2554
01:44:56,238 --> 01:45:02,039
money money is the only thing that can

2555
01:44:59,238 --> 01:45:04,118
be anything and everything is measured

2556
01:45:02,039 --> 01:45:07,800
against like I tried to figure this out

2557
01:45:04,118 --> 01:45:10,880
a long time ago but cash has a really

2558
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:12,920
unique position in the world because

2559
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:16,800
everything we do is measured by that

2560
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:19,239
pretty much and it can become anything

2561
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:21,960
so money is this is this flexible bill

2562
01:45:19,238 --> 01:45:24,839
of exchange that that doesn't rely on

2563
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:26,760
coincidence a why

2564
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:28,159
and so we use that as this thing so when

2565
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:30,480
you're making a lot of money you don't

2566
01:45:28,158 --> 01:45:31,879
think you're making any mistakes you're

2567
01:45:30,479 --> 01:45:34,198
like look how much I'm making look how

2568
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:36,199
well I'm doing you don't really

2569
01:45:34,198 --> 01:45:38,479
understand that it sometimes a lot of

2570
01:45:36,198 --> 01:45:39,319
times it's just straight luck so even

2571
01:45:38,479 --> 01:45:41,799
with

2572
01:45:39,319 --> 01:45:43,960
investment you get into something early

2573
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:45,440
you blow up you're brilliant do that

2574
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:47,118
[ __ ] again and you're going to find out

2575
01:45:45,439 --> 01:45:48,638
that you're not necessarily so good at

2576
01:45:47,118 --> 01:45:51,559
that is what you thought but you got

2577
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:55,520
lucky and that's herb to me so many of

2578
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:58,000
us got lucky and I got lucky in that I

2579
01:45:55,520 --> 01:46:00,679
realized in my late

2580
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:03,359
30s that we were going to get the living

2581
01:46:00,679 --> 01:46:06,239
[ __ ] kicked out of us when this went

2582
01:46:03,359 --> 01:46:07,639
legal I had no question I had no

2583
01:46:06,238 --> 01:46:09,439
question because I was researching

2584
01:46:07,639 --> 01:46:12,239
commercial a I went to school for it and

2585
01:46:09,439 --> 01:46:13,759
then I go into uh you know like

2586
01:46:12,238 --> 01:46:16,638
floriculture you know development of

2587
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:18,760
potted plants flowers and I start to

2588
01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:21,199
really look at those operations cuz I

2589
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:23,400
got access to them and I'm like oh we're

2590
01:46:21,198 --> 01:46:25,319
going to get murdered they're going to

2591
01:46:23,399 --> 01:46:27,839
kick the [ __ ] out of us because their

2592
01:46:25,319 --> 01:46:29,198
level of efficiency is crazy and the

2593
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:31,400
public in

2594
01:46:29,198 --> 01:46:33,479
America as much as people don't want to

2595
01:46:31,399 --> 01:46:37,079
admit it we're mids country we would

2596
01:46:33,479 --> 01:46:40,000
rather have schas board all you can eat

2597
01:46:37,079 --> 01:46:41,880
than 9.99 yeah yeah cheap that's that's

2598
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,599
America man we rely on it right we've

2599
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:47,239
been we've been taught to be bulk

2600
01:46:43,599 --> 01:46:49,920
consumers since birth for Generations

2601
01:46:47,238 --> 01:46:53,158
now we've been shaped to purchase

2602
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:55,560
indiscriminately bye bye bye so I just

2603
01:46:53,158 --> 01:46:58,679
said oh we're going to get murdered and

2604
01:46:55,560 --> 01:47:00,760
so I'm like whoa and it it forced me to

2605
01:46:58,679 --> 01:47:03,039
start to really relook at what I did and

2606
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:06,000
re look at my Approach and and try to

2607
01:47:03,039 --> 01:47:07,679
understand where is my pathway forward

2608
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:10,238
when I know I'm not going to get to

2609
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:12,118
compete with infrastructure you can't

2610
01:47:10,238 --> 01:47:14,638
compete with people that can raise $200

2611
01:47:12,118 --> 01:47:15,920
million and just because you raised 200

2612
01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:18,880
million doesn't mean you're going to

2613
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:20,920
exist either but while that money is in

2614
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:23,920
play everyone around you that's

2615
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:25,880
competing against you is getting blood

2616
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:28,399
because they're able to use the money as

2617
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:30,599
the beating tool and then if if they

2618
01:47:28,399 --> 01:47:32,439
succeed they continue if they fail they

2619
01:47:30,599 --> 01:47:33,800
go away but if you're trying to if

2620
01:47:32,439 --> 01:47:36,439
you're trying to compete with somebody

2621
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:40,440
that's operating at below margin and

2622
01:47:36,439 --> 01:47:41,839
they're dumping and you can't and the

2623
01:47:40,439 --> 01:47:44,960
market doesn't give a [ __ ] the Market's

2624
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:46,480
like what $6 weed even better nobody

2625
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:48,079
wants to you know like people talk about

2626
01:47:46,479 --> 01:47:50,279
I don't want the Primo [ __ ] and I'm like

2627
01:47:48,079 --> 01:47:52,158
no America's pretty much low-end [ __ ] or

2628
01:47:50,279 --> 01:47:54,399
we wouldn't have a proliferation of fast

2629
01:47:52,158 --> 01:47:58,039
food the way we we

2630
01:47:54,399 --> 01:48:01,598
do we we love we love bought cheap

2631
01:47:58,039 --> 01:48:03,639
[ __ ] do you think the the the what is

2632
01:48:01,599 --> 01:48:05,920
happening now in Europe in Germany for

2633
01:48:03,639 --> 01:48:08,118
example uh that it will change a little

2634
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:10,719
bit the game also in USA because you

2635
01:48:08,118 --> 01:48:13,598
know like you're not federal yet right

2636
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:16,158
you have certain states have legal

2637
01:48:13,599 --> 01:48:19,239
legalized but now for example Germany

2638
01:48:16,158 --> 01:48:20,920
started in Europe like a like a first

2639
01:48:19,238 --> 01:48:22,839
move you know in the direction of

2640
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:24,440
legalization so many countries will

2641
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:26,920
follow actually I

2642
01:48:24,439 --> 01:48:28,079
think I work in Germany like well I

2643
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:30,679
worked I

2644
01:48:28,079 --> 01:48:33,359
worked I don't say I work in Germany but

2645
01:48:30,679 --> 01:48:34,199
I work in other countries that provide

2646
01:48:33,359 --> 01:48:36,198
to

2647
01:48:34,198 --> 01:48:39,399
Germany and

2648
01:48:36,198 --> 01:48:41,279
so we we we we still have our position

2649
01:48:39,399 --> 01:48:43,759
and at some point in time when the

2650
01:48:41,279 --> 01:48:45,158
United States when the United States

2651
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:48,119
goes federally

2652
01:48:45,158 --> 01:48:50,759
legal when the US turns on its machine

2653
01:48:48,118 --> 01:48:52,960
it's hard to compete against I mean

2654
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:55,079
we're not China

2655
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:58,118
China can basically out compete anybody

2656
01:48:55,079 --> 01:49:00,079
but a lot of it is because and China the

2657
01:48:58,118 --> 01:49:03,079
you know the the Chinese are brilliant

2658
01:49:00,079 --> 01:49:05,800
historically for you know [ __ ] Millennia

2659
01:49:03,079 --> 01:49:08,399
but they also have very low restrictions

2660
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:10,400
on on OSHA right know job safety and

2661
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:13,719
environmental EPA and OSHA is a little

2662
01:49:10,399 --> 01:49:15,479
off so it it allows them to be able to

2663
01:49:13,719 --> 01:49:16,920
have you know competitive Advantage but

2664
01:49:15,479 --> 01:49:19,678
when you get into cannabis that's going

2665
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:21,158
to be going through the level of

2666
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:22,760
scrutiny that they're looking at and

2667
01:49:21,158 --> 01:49:25,359
right now they're talking like category

2668
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:26,320
for you know more and more stringency on

2669
01:49:25,359 --> 01:49:29,039
the

2670
01:49:26,319 --> 01:49:32,679
stuff the United States has an ability

2671
01:49:29,039 --> 01:49:35,439
to absolutely turn on a factory but

2672
01:49:32,679 --> 01:49:38,158
we're we're so caught up in our own

2673
01:49:35,439 --> 01:49:40,359
[ __ ] and we made so much money for

2674
01:49:38,158 --> 01:49:42,479
the government off the drug war that

2675
01:49:40,359 --> 01:49:44,399
they don't ever want to get rid of it

2676
01:49:42,479 --> 01:49:47,638
like it we can't get rid of it we're

2677
01:49:44,399 --> 01:49:49,399
addicted to that drug war money or you

2678
01:49:47,639 --> 01:49:51,000
wouldn't see if you kind of look at it

2679
01:49:49,399 --> 01:49:52,839
like look at it historically in the US

2680
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,800
right methamphetamines

2681
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:57,800
in the the 70s legal you get them

2682
01:49:55,800 --> 01:50:00,279
prescribed to you when I was a kid right

2683
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:02,039
when I was like 12 13 you go to a party

2684
01:50:00,279 --> 01:50:04,238
they would be all this methamphetamine

2685
01:50:02,039 --> 01:50:06,039
in pill form at the party so you'd have

2686
01:50:04,238 --> 01:50:07,359
a couple beers and and grab some of

2687
01:50:06,039 --> 01:50:08,800
these things you be wired out of your

2688
01:50:07,359 --> 01:50:10,598
mind right that [ __ ] was coming out of

2689
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:12,719
your grandmother's medicine cabinet this

2690
01:50:10,599 --> 01:50:14,039
[ __ ] wasn't on the street well they they

2691
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:16,198
get rid of the

2692
01:50:14,039 --> 01:50:18,519
prescriptions they do the analoges that

2693
01:50:16,198 --> 01:50:20,919
goes into like diet pills and then it

2694
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:24,199
just Begins the whole meth Revolution

2695
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:27,000
you go into opiates right we we schedule

2696
01:50:24,198 --> 01:50:28,799
all these uh synthetic opiates we

2697
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:31,639
schedule as schedule three which means

2698
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:33,480
they're easily accessed we saturate the

2699
01:50:31,639 --> 01:50:36,279
country to the Limit Beyond

2700
01:50:33,479 --> 01:50:39,039
Comprehension then we restrict same with

2701
01:50:36,279 --> 01:50:41,359
meth we saturate restrict create an

2702
01:50:39,039 --> 01:50:44,399
illegal industry now we have a drug wall

2703
01:50:41,359 --> 01:50:47,118
we can fcking wage since the 70s against

2704
01:50:44,399 --> 01:50:49,238
meth it it's been the last so many years

2705
01:50:47,118 --> 01:50:52,039
against an opiates but you take a look

2706
01:50:49,238 --> 01:50:53,519
in the fenel crisises across the country

2707
01:50:52,039 --> 01:50:58,158
because people can't access

2708
01:50:53,520 --> 01:51:00,599
pharmaceutical oxy like they once did so

2709
01:50:58,158 --> 01:51:05,439
the the drug war is we have drugs that

2710
01:51:00,599 --> 01:51:07,800
we create we saturate we remove we

2711
01:51:05,439 --> 01:51:09,279
penalize and it's this system if you

2712
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:10,920
look at it you I mean I can point to a

2713
01:51:09,279 --> 01:51:13,359
whole variety of different products that

2714
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:15,480
that's been done with that we're

2715
01:51:13,359 --> 01:51:18,759
addicted to that duality of money we

2716
01:51:15,479 --> 01:51:21,759
want to make the money on people using

2717
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:24,239
the cash to influence the system to add

2718
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:26,360
that money into into the world and then

2719
01:51:24,238 --> 01:51:28,118
we want to punish the [ __ ] out of him so

2720
01:51:26,359 --> 01:51:30,839
that we can keep the prison system

2721
01:51:28,118 --> 01:51:32,960
moving you know I mean like I don't

2722
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:35,279
think people catch the American system

2723
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:37,399
where I and I didn't catch it either but

2724
01:51:35,279 --> 01:51:41,800
I got a a dude I was in the military

2725
01:51:37,399 --> 01:51:44,319
with and he went on and got into uh

2726
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:47,279

2727
01:51:44,319 --> 01:51:48,920
the into the prison guard world and it

2728
01:51:47,279 --> 01:51:50,800
was a good it was a good world for him

2729
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:53,239
he did you know did well financially and

2730
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:54,880
had a good life so he and I maintain our

2731
01:51:53,238 --> 01:51:57,919
relationship but he was saying you know

2732
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:59,920
I I run a cabinet shop and I'm like what

2733
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:02,039
for rehab he goes no we sell the

2734
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:05,000
products and I said how much you make he

2735
01:52:02,039 --> 01:52:07,078
goes my division in this prison does 180

2736
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:08,359
million a year and I said let me get

2737
01:52:07,078 --> 01:52:11,198
this straight out of the [ __ ] prison

2738
01:52:08,359 --> 01:52:13,158
in Pennsylvania One Division of of your

2739
01:52:11,198 --> 01:52:15,559
of this little prison is doing 180

2740
01:52:13,158 --> 01:52:17,439
million in [ __ ] woodwork sales I said

2741
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:20,239
how the [ __ ] is that possible and he

2742
01:52:17,439 --> 01:52:21,638
goes we create the GSA products we

2743
01:52:20,238 --> 01:52:23,638
create the products for the federal

2744
01:52:21,639 --> 01:52:25,279
government he goes it's all contract Kev

2745
01:52:23,639 --> 01:52:26,679
he goes we make the metal desks or the

2746
01:52:25,279 --> 01:52:30,479
wood desk that they put in all the

2747
01:52:26,679 --> 01:52:33,359
offices he says so the desk is like 25

2748
01:52:30,479 --> 01:52:35,879
$30,000 desk he goes it's costing us

2749
01:52:33,359 --> 01:52:37,238
[ __ ] 200 bucks to make it and I said

2750
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:38,960
where's all this money going he goes

2751
01:52:37,238 --> 01:52:40,759
into the investors that built the

2752
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:42,439
privatized prison industry and I started

2753
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:45,599
laughing because it made me realize just

2754
01:52:42,439 --> 01:52:50,158
how [ __ ] undereducated I am about

2755
01:52:45,599 --> 01:52:52,840
this reality that the American system of

2756
01:52:50,158 --> 01:52:55,238
of of drug enforcement is really eing

2757
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:57,560
prison systems that create products that

2758
01:52:55,238 --> 01:52:59,598
get sold at the federal government and

2759
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:02,360
the money chain is so thick and deep

2760
01:52:59,599 --> 01:53:04,639
they'll never get rid of this [ __ ] so

2761
01:53:02,359 --> 01:53:06,799
the us we just just like we just kicked

2762
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:10,920
the farm bill down the road another year

2763
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:12,920
right on the thca hemp issue and and I

2764
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:15,199
don't I don't really care one way or

2765
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:17,880
another how it goes

2766
01:53:15,198 --> 01:53:20,319
because it's it's above my

2767
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:23,118
control but the idea of how they

2768
01:53:20,319 --> 01:53:26,279
manipulate and move this it depends on

2769
01:53:23,118 --> 01:53:28,719
how much money they're making and who

2770
01:53:26,279 --> 01:53:30,880
benefits and the ability to maintain

2771
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:32,840
that Duality it's the same with

2772
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:34,118
California when I talked to the I had

2773
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:35,560
the I had the governor of the [ __ ]

2774
01:53:34,118 --> 01:53:37,000
state in my office like so I don't

2775
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:39,280
really I don't know any of the dope

2776
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:41,599
Growers that had like every major

2777
01:53:39,279 --> 01:53:43,158
politician in their state come and have

2778
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:46,078
lunch with them in their

2779
01:53:43,158 --> 01:53:48,158
office and I asked them I said why do we

2780
01:53:46,078 --> 01:53:50,759
have all these you know cannabis deserts

2781
01:53:48,158 --> 01:53:52,638
in California like why are there so many

2782
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:55,079
places that we're not going to to be

2783
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:57,118
able to have cannabis and he said it's a

2784
01:53:55,078 --> 01:53:59,279
capitulation of the law enforcement and

2785
01:53:57,118 --> 01:54:01,799
I said I don't understand and he said

2786
01:53:59,279 --> 01:54:03,599
law enforcement won't approve legality

2787
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:06,279
of cannabis in California they won't

2788
01:54:03,599 --> 01:54:07,239
give us a go-ahead on it they'll fight

2789
01:54:06,279 --> 01:54:10,118
me

2790
01:54:07,238 --> 01:54:12,718
politically and that fight politically

2791
01:54:10,118 --> 01:54:15,920
will keep me from being reelected so he

2792
01:54:12,719 --> 01:54:18,719
goes so they use their Lobby to control

2793
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:21,359
what takes place because the money that

2794
01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:23,719
you make from drug interdiction isn't

2795
01:54:21,359 --> 01:54:25,118
part of your like disc every budget so

2796
01:54:23,719 --> 01:54:27,639
they don't get to keep all the money

2797
01:54:25,118 --> 01:54:29,359
they have to cut up the pie but the fact

2798
01:54:27,639 --> 01:54:31,039
is they're able to have a budget that

2799
01:54:29,359 --> 01:54:32,759
they use and then they're able to go and

2800
01:54:31,039 --> 01:54:35,279
steal as much money as they can get

2801
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:37,520
their hands on that they get to use to

2802
01:54:35,279 --> 01:54:40,359
do all their other [ __ ] and he said

2803
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:43,119
they're fundamentally addicted to the

2804
01:54:40,359 --> 01:54:47,399
money and so if Cali which Governor said

2805
01:54:43,118 --> 01:54:48,839
this uh Gavin Nome H so if that's

2806
01:54:47,399 --> 01:54:51,039
something that I'd like to see printed

2807
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:53,319
right there right I mean like it's it's

2808
01:54:51,039 --> 01:54:54,679
like he's admitting oh [ __ ] you can't

2809
01:54:53,319 --> 01:54:55,599
you can't say that [ __ ] out loud though

2810
01:54:54,679 --> 01:54:57,078
I mean I'm telling you because we had

2811
01:54:55,599 --> 01:54:58,800
the conversation in the office did he

2812
01:54:57,078 --> 01:55:00,359
said it out loud or it was privately to

2813
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:02,440
you well he said he said it out of his

2814
01:55:00,359 --> 01:55:04,039
mouth to my ear but we were in my office

2815
01:55:02,439 --> 01:55:05,439
oh so he's not going to get on a stage

2816
01:55:04,039 --> 01:55:06,840
and say that [ __ ] because I asked him I

2817
01:55:05,439 --> 01:55:08,399
said why do you guys got to you know

2818
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:10,159
what's the what's the power of law

2819
01:55:08,399 --> 01:55:11,879
enforcement in terms of political and he

2820
01:55:10,158 --> 01:55:15,839
goes they have the most powerful Lobby

2821
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:18,520
there is he said the number of times an

2822
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:21,520
election has been won by somebody who is

2823
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:24,239
not in favor of the political of the of

2824
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:26,960
the police group is almost negligible

2825
01:55:24,238 --> 01:55:28,399
there's almost none so it's this risk

2826
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:30,439
where you have to support law

2827
01:55:28,399 --> 01:55:32,920
enforcement so heavily or what they do

2828
01:55:30,439 --> 01:55:36,879
is they give you a vote of no

2829
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:39,359
confidence and it states to the public

2830
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:41,800
hey we have no faith in this person

2831
01:55:39,359 --> 01:55:44,839
keeping you safe and they've done such

2832
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:49,159
an effective job in creating that

2833
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:50,719
illusion that it's effective and so

2834
01:55:49,158 --> 01:55:52,559
that's the problem with the US is that

2835
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:55,319
we're making so much money off the drug

2836
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:57,920
war [ __ ] that there's no need it it's

2837
01:55:55,319 --> 01:56:00,719
the same argument that I I got to meet

2838
01:55:57,920 --> 01:56:03,319
one of the lead scientists from senta we

2839
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:05,399
met at an event and he actually had

2840
01:56:03,319 --> 01:56:07,118
followed me online right so he

2841
01:56:05,399 --> 01:56:09,158
approached me and said hey I follow your

2842
01:56:07,118 --> 01:56:11,238
[ __ ] and he said and I just wanted to

2843
01:56:09,158 --> 01:56:13,039
talk to you about weed so we're talking

2844
01:56:11,238 --> 01:56:16,559
about weed and I'm asking him I'm like

2845
01:56:13,039 --> 01:56:18,158
are you guys in weed and he goes no he

2846
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:21,239
goes and I said how come he goes we're

2847
01:56:18,158 --> 01:56:22,559
Global Food he said we feed the Earth he

2848
01:56:21,238 --> 01:56:25,759
goes we don't give a [ __ ] about weed

2849
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:27,760
money he goes when we get into weed you

2850
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:30,079
will know it he goes cuz we have a

2851
01:56:27,760 --> 01:56:32,520
couple million dollars a day in

2852
01:56:30,078 --> 01:56:36,319
disposable money we can spend just on

2853
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:38,520
R&amp;D he said so we when we enter weed

2854
01:56:36,319 --> 01:56:40,960
there is no question you will know sent

2855
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:44,199
is in the room because you're not going

2856
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:46,399
to [ __ ] with us and I was like whoa but

2857
01:56:44,198 --> 01:56:48,078
there was no need and I said so just not

2858
01:56:46,399 --> 01:56:50,399
the money and he goes no it's also the

2859
01:56:48,078 --> 01:56:53,679
risk he goes if we build infrastructure

2860
01:56:50,399 --> 01:56:55,719
in America in a country that's federally

2861
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:57,560
illegal he goes we could have

2862
01:56:55,719 --> 01:57:00,800
nationalization occur and they could

2863
01:56:57,560 --> 01:57:04,039
take our product and and a good example

2864
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:05,840
of that is years and years ago I had

2865
01:57:04,039 --> 01:57:08,760
remember Franco that used to work with

2866
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:11,800
uh the greenhouse yeah yes Franco he was

2867
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:13,840
a sweetheart of a guy St Hunter yeah he

2868
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:15,880
was he was a lovely guy too he was a he

2869
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:17,719
was a former military got into

2870
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:20,599
Hospitality management and then he

2871
01:57:17,719 --> 01:57:22,880
becomes um uh aon's partner and they

2872
01:57:20,599 --> 01:57:25,840
they do all that work but

2873
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:29,960
he comes into Humble County in like 207

2874
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:31,719
maybe 208 to um see if we want to

2875
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:33,960
contract to make seeds for the

2876
01:57:31,719 --> 01:57:36,000
greenhouse and it was hysterical because

2877
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:38,760
he comes to me and he's like we want to

2878
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:41,960
pay you

2879
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:43,199
$100,000 to make seed and we're laughing

2880
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:46,319
because at that time you know you're

2881
01:57:43,198 --> 01:57:49,839
making that [ __ ] a month and you're like

2882
01:57:46,319 --> 01:57:53,679
you he was going to make millions on it

2883
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:55,880
give you don't understand I'm talking

2884
01:57:53,679 --> 01:57:57,359
100,000 and I said look you got to go to

2885
01:57:55,880 --> 01:57:59,800
some other country and go [ __ ] those

2886
01:57:57,359 --> 01:58:01,479
people over because that doesn't work

2887
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:03,960
for us I said why didn't you go to

2888
01:58:01,479 --> 01:58:06,879
Africa and pull that [ __ ] there and he

2889
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:11,000
said we did but they nationalized our

2890
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:13,639
whole operation and took it from us so

2891
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:16,639
it's this risk of working in countries

2892
01:58:13,639 --> 01:58:19,159
that they'll take your stuff and so me

2893
01:58:16,639 --> 01:58:21,359
and me and Franco become friends and we

2894
01:58:19,158 --> 01:58:24,799
maintained a good friendship cuz he was

2895
01:58:21,359 --> 01:58:27,960
a good guy but I'll never forget that

2896
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:30,320
$100,000 cuz it was like [ __ ] Dr Evil

2897
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:32,639
you know a million dollars and they

2898
01:58:30,319 --> 01:58:36,759
laugh a billion

2899
01:58:32,639 --> 01:58:40,279
dollars but it was the same deal in

2900
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:43,520
that you don't really

2901
01:58:40,279 --> 01:58:45,279
understand what's at stake and how many

2902
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:48,760
people are making money off of this and

2903
01:58:45,279 --> 01:58:51,000
so we see it as it would be good for us

2904
01:58:48,760 --> 01:58:53,000
well we're not really if if if any

2905
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:55,198
American believes they have any value as

2906
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:57,840
a citizen you're you're [ __ ] deluding

2907
01:58:55,198 --> 01:58:59,439
yourself you're you're just a cog and a

2908
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:02,199
gear and a big

2909
01:58:59,439 --> 01:59:04,759
machine and so I think that at some

2910
01:59:02,198 --> 01:59:07,519
point when the US gets involved you'll

2911
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:10,159
see some changes globally because that's

2912
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:12,360
what we do AS Global [ __ ] business

2913
01:59:10,158 --> 01:59:14,279
and we'd be able to we'd be able to

2914
01:59:12,359 --> 01:59:16,880
utilize our tariffs we'd be able to

2915
01:59:14,279 --> 01:59:20,960
utilize blockages we will

2916
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:24,078
manipulate but until that happens with

2917
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:27,158
silo you know California Silo we can't

2918
01:59:24,078 --> 01:59:28,880
sell the Oregon Oregon can't sell to us

2919
01:59:27,158 --> 01:59:31,559
and the hemp is what got around it the

2920
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:34,118
hemp's what's letting everything move

2921
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:37,280
but if you were to build a business

2922
01:59:34,118 --> 01:59:38,880
today how much money would you risk if

2923
01:59:37,279 --> 01:59:41,840
you know that the farm bill is going to

2924
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:43,400
be Revisited in a year and if the farm

2925
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:44,400
bill is going to get Revisited in a year

2926
01:59:43,399 --> 01:59:48,359
does that mean that you have any

2927
01:59:44,399 --> 01:59:50,078
longevity after that so I just don't

2928
01:59:48,359 --> 01:59:51,719
worry about it as much what I what I

2929
01:59:50,078 --> 01:59:53,799
look at is I look at countries that can

2930
01:59:51,719 --> 01:59:58,520
produce product and sell so that would

2931
01:59:53,800 --> 02:00:01,119
be you know in my case Canada South

2932
01:59:58,520 --> 02:00:03,639
Africa those countries then I can work

2933
02:00:01,118 --> 02:00:05,279
with to get product moved into Israel

2934
02:00:03,639 --> 02:00:08,319
Australia

2935
02:00:05,279 --> 02:00:10,479
Germany and it's all legal it just lets

2936
02:00:08,319 --> 02:00:12,479
me come in and help them understand how

2937
02:00:10,479 --> 02:00:14,359
we would adjust the supply chain and how

2938
02:00:12,479 --> 02:00:15,919
do we find products that work in these

2939
02:00:14,359 --> 02:00:18,559
markets and how do we optimize a

2940
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:21,679
production of those products and if we

2941
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:23,560
can do all of that then then I'm doing

2942
02:00:21,679 --> 02:00:25,840
what I need to be doing so I can learn

2943
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:28,159
how to function when I get to that point

2944
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:30,319
where the US can because my whole game

2945
02:00:28,158 --> 02:00:32,799
with my farm was I figured at some point

2946
02:00:30,319 --> 02:00:35,359
we'd be able to sell our product in

2947
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:37,760
other countries and if I wasn't trying

2948
02:00:35,359 --> 02:00:40,238
to produce 10 million pounds of flour

2949
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:43,480
I'm only trying to produce you know a

2950
02:00:40,238 --> 02:00:45,959
th000 pounds half a ton I shouldn't have

2951
02:00:43,479 --> 02:00:48,198
such a brutal time getting rid of it

2952
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:50,800
globally and it would allow the farm to

2953
02:00:48,198 --> 02:00:52,638
have a good resonance and let the farm

2954
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:54,159
do what I wanted it to do which was

2955
02:00:52,639 --> 02:00:55,520
produce good herb because the Farm's

2956
02:00:54,158 --> 02:00:58,879
impact is

2957
02:00:55,520 --> 02:01:00,440
positive is this Farm still Port Royal

2958
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:02,480
yeah yeah that's yeah because that's

2959
02:01:00,439 --> 02:01:04,638
that's the that's like your brand name

2960
02:01:02,479 --> 02:01:06,839
it it has another name in terms of how

2961
02:01:04,639 --> 02:01:09,719
the county you know the state sees it

2962
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:12,159
but Port Royale Place yeah yeah it's

2963
02:01:09,719 --> 02:01:15,800
it's a stunning I'm on the the lip of a

2964
02:01:12,158 --> 02:01:18,000
Caldera of a dormant volcano so like the

2965
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:20,199
whole [ __ ] Caldera falls off behind

2966
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:23,679
me thousands of feet and I'm above the

2967
02:01:20,198 --> 02:01:26,039
fog and I get true South Exposure and I

2968
02:01:23,679 --> 02:01:28,359
have incredible water coming out of that

2969
02:01:26,039 --> 02:01:30,920
mountain so like I'm the Watershed for

2970
02:01:28,359 --> 02:01:32,719
bu Creek so I got some really

2971
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:34,560
interesting [ __ ] going on and and I just

2972
02:01:32,719 --> 02:01:35,599
spent the last eight years brawling it

2973
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:39,360
out with the

2974
02:01:35,599 --> 02:01:41,319
county over who owns the water so

2975
02:01:39,359 --> 02:01:43,359
California is obsessed with owning your

2976
02:01:41,319 --> 02:01:45,799
water so it took me eight years to win

2977
02:01:43,359 --> 02:01:48,359
this fight but then they said Hey in

2978
02:01:45,800 --> 02:01:52,079
2045 we're going to come back at you

2979
02:01:48,359 --> 02:01:54,279
again and see if you still own the water

2980
02:01:52,078 --> 02:01:56,880
because that's what they want is control

2981
02:01:54,279 --> 02:01:59,719
but that mountain just always produced

2982
02:01:56,880 --> 02:02:02,319
really good herb and I have an emotional

2983
02:01:59,719 --> 02:02:04,078
connection to it and that's kind of how

2984
02:02:02,319 --> 02:02:05,920
I wanted to finish my career was just

2985
02:02:04,078 --> 02:02:08,679
running that farm up on that edge of

2986
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:10,840
that Hill you know and and don't give up

2987
02:02:08,679 --> 02:02:13,639
yet part oh I'm not I I don't end your

2988
02:02:10,840 --> 02:02:15,719
career yet we still we still need your

2989
02:02:13,639 --> 02:02:18,039
contribution no no I'm done this is this

2990
02:02:15,719 --> 02:02:20,439
is I want to spend my life doing what I

2991
02:02:18,039 --> 02:02:21,920
do beautiful I'm not because someone

2992
02:02:20,439 --> 02:02:24,479
said you know when do you retire and I

2993
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:26,078
said what do you do when you retired die

2994
02:02:24,479 --> 02:02:29,479
yeah you get old and die and I'm like no

2995
02:02:26,078 --> 02:02:32,039
I want to continue with my life so it

2996
02:02:29,479 --> 02:02:34,198
just comes down to the what your desires

2997
02:02:32,039 --> 02:02:37,479
are and also to understand your

2998
02:02:34,198 --> 02:02:39,638
reality what is the reality of your

2999
02:02:37,479 --> 02:02:42,799
existence and you kind of got to be

3000
02:02:39,639 --> 02:02:46,400
comfortable with it and so the US the US

3001
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:48,440
is the us but if you're able to you know

3002
02:02:46,399 --> 02:02:51,039
work in any other country then you can

3003
02:02:48,439 --> 02:02:53,678
start to practice you can start to get

3004
02:02:51,039 --> 02:02:56,560
the experience you need to be able to

3005
02:02:53,679 --> 02:02:59,158
understand what's needed what is these

3006
02:02:56,560 --> 02:03:01,840
more highly regulated production

3007
02:02:59,158 --> 02:03:04,158
methodologies and distribution

3008
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:06,719
methodologies that are

3009
02:03:04,158 --> 02:03:09,399
required and what works in these markets

3010
02:03:06,719 --> 02:03:11,319
and what doesn't and how do you optimize

3011
02:03:09,399 --> 02:03:13,799
supply chain and so I mean I'm having a

3012
02:03:11,319 --> 02:03:15,880
great time learning and it's been really

3013
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:17,360
effective like it's it's worked for

3014
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:19,039
every company the companies that I did

3015
02:03:17,359 --> 02:03:20,559
the work for in Canada succeeded the

3016
02:03:19,039 --> 02:03:22,479
companies I did the work for in South

3017
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:25,920
Africa succeeded

3018
02:03:22,479 --> 02:03:29,000
so it it just lets you practice and Play

3019
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:30,880
and Learn and that way I I don't sit

3020
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:32,880
here wondering like what's going on in

3021
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:34,480
in California because I mean our whole

3022
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:36,760
our whole cannabis system basically

3023
02:03:34,479 --> 02:03:40,118
collapsed which is mindbending that

3024
02:03:36,760 --> 02:03:42,400
Michigan is making more tax revenue than

3025
02:03:40,118 --> 02:03:44,238
California right like that's it's almost

3026
02:03:42,399 --> 02:03:45,238
it's people like I'm talking no no I

3027
02:03:44,238 --> 02:03:46,919
don't think you understand nothing

3028
02:03:45,238 --> 02:03:48,039
against Michigan Michigan's a beautiful

3029
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:50,000
place and they grow some really good

3030
02:03:48,039 --> 02:03:52,639
weed but when we're talking about

3031
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:55,840
economy you're talking about California

3032
02:03:52,639 --> 02:03:59,199
the fifth largest economy on Earth LA

3033
02:03:55,840 --> 02:04:02,199
County by itself that six million people

3034
02:03:59,198 --> 02:04:04,519
cluster is like top seven top eight in

3035
02:04:02,198 --> 02:04:07,118
the world where if you just broke La

3036
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:09,520
free from the rest of the United States

3037
02:04:07,118 --> 02:04:11,558
it would be in the top 10 in terms of

3038
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:14,280
global performance

3039
02:04:11,559 --> 02:04:17,400
financially that shit's California and

3040
02:04:14,279 --> 02:04:19,800
we're we're over here down in like 187

3041
02:04:17,399 --> 02:04:22,198
200 million tax Zone when it should be

3042
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:25,480
in the billions and and it's just a

3043
02:04:22,198 --> 02:04:26,960
total mismanagement of a system and it's

3044
02:04:25,479 --> 02:04:29,238
it's just the nature of what we're where

3045
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:32,880
we're at today and I just think that I

3046
02:04:29,238 --> 02:04:35,558
just quit complaining about the the lack

3047
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:38,319
of fairness and I just said [ __ ] it man

3048
02:04:35,559 --> 02:04:41,039
it's I love growing I love what I do I'm

3049
02:04:38,319 --> 02:04:43,558
just going to work with it and that way

3050
02:04:41,039 --> 02:04:45,158
I can at least enjoy what we have which

3051
02:04:43,559 --> 02:04:47,599
is the ability to do what we're doing

3052
02:04:45,158 --> 02:04:49,679
right now we're on [ __ ] live we're

3053
02:04:47,599 --> 02:04:51,360
talking about dope gr like that's just

3054
02:04:49,679 --> 02:04:53,760
it blows my mind because you remember

3055
02:04:51,359 --> 02:04:56,000
when you we first started out like I

3056
02:04:53,760 --> 02:05:00,239
never wore a weed shirt I had no weed

3057
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:03,880
[ __ ] like I I changed clothes and cars

3058
02:05:00,238 --> 02:05:07,359
and spots all the time so I never looked

3059
02:05:03,880 --> 02:05:09,840
like anybody that would you know arouse

3060
02:05:07,359 --> 02:05:12,279
suspicion you were living undercover so

3061
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:14,840
much you didn't have a normal life

3062
02:05:12,279 --> 02:05:16,319
you're it's so funny you're only your

3063
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:17,880
only friends you hung out because if you

3064
02:05:16,319 --> 02:05:19,479
hung out with regular people and they

3065
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:22,400
found out what you did a lot of them

3066
02:05:19,479 --> 02:05:24,759
would get so [ __ ] mad and I realized

3067
02:05:22,399 --> 02:05:25,598
it wasn't cuz they were anti-drugs it

3068
02:05:24,760 --> 02:05:30,440
was

3069
02:05:25,599 --> 02:05:33,800
because you exemplified freedom and the

3070
02:05:30,439 --> 02:05:36,719
idea that me regular person could have a

3071
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:38,440
life better than you where like I don't

3072
02:05:36,719 --> 02:05:40,198
have to go put up with I call it patty

3073
02:05:38,439 --> 02:05:42,558
cake I I don't got to go play patty cake

3074
02:05:40,198 --> 02:05:44,960
at work every day I just got to do it

3075
02:05:42,559 --> 02:05:46,480
myself that's not bad and for most

3076
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:47,840
people they didn't really get that they

3077
02:05:46,479 --> 02:05:50,919
got to play

3078
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:53,159
the go to work put up in the boss's [ __ ]

3079
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:56,399
work with crazy ass co-workers get paid

3080
02:05:53,158 --> 02:05:58,238
minimal suck up 40 50 hours minimum of

3081
02:05:56,399 --> 02:06:00,399
your life a week you only have a weekend

3082
02:05:58,238 --> 02:06:03,959
off you can't afford to go anywhere

3083
02:06:00,399 --> 02:06:05,638
you're not going on vacation and and I'm

3084
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:07,078
over there flying to Hawaii during the

3085
02:06:05,639 --> 02:06:10,199
middle of the week just so I can get out

3086
02:06:07,078 --> 02:06:12,399
of the area and you're like we had a

3087
02:06:10,198 --> 02:06:15,158
pretty good life and it made people

3088
02:06:12,399 --> 02:06:16,879
upset that and to me it was they were

3089
02:06:15,158 --> 02:06:20,039
upset because I was just a regular guy

3090
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:22,440
so like you [ __ ] it was like they were

3091
02:06:20,039 --> 02:06:23,800
mad you know and and it's a between envy

3092
02:06:22,439 --> 02:06:26,279
and jealousy you know what I'm saying

3093
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:29,559
jealousy is boy that's a beautiful

3094
02:06:26,279 --> 02:06:32,198
jacket I wish I had one and envy is like

3095
02:06:29,559 --> 02:06:34,960
how come that prick has that

3096
02:06:32,198 --> 02:06:36,359
jacket one is you you want the thing and

3097
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:37,719
the other is you're mad at the person

3098
02:06:36,359 --> 02:06:41,000
who has the

3099
02:06:37,719 --> 02:06:43,480
thing and what we had was really Envy

3100
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:45,359
over our lifestyle because we didn't

3101
02:06:43,479 --> 02:06:47,359
have to do that we had the ability to

3102
02:06:45,359 --> 02:06:50,238
take a Tuesday off and go to the park

3103
02:06:47,359 --> 02:06:52,000
with your kid when I when I wanted to go

3104
02:06:50,238 --> 02:06:54,638
to Europe and travel around on Europe

3105
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:56,599
and do stuff I took my kid with me when

3106
02:06:54,639 --> 02:06:58,400
when my son got the opportunity to go

3107
02:06:56,599 --> 02:07:00,039
and get invited to Russia to train the

3108
02:06:58,399 --> 02:07:02,198
national team I could afford to [ __ ]

3109
02:07:00,039 --> 02:07:04,039
fly him when my brother got

3110
02:07:02,198 --> 02:07:06,598
opportunities to compete globally I

3111
02:07:04,039 --> 02:07:08,399
could afford to fly him and I like we

3112
02:07:06,599 --> 02:07:11,039
had privileges that regular people

3113
02:07:08,399 --> 02:07:13,158
didn't and they were angry because they

3114
02:07:11,039 --> 02:07:15,880
did everything they were told and they

3115
02:07:13,158 --> 02:07:19,158
followed the rules they did all the

3116
02:07:15,880 --> 02:07:22,760
right [ __ ] and it wasn't real it's the

3117
02:07:19,158 --> 02:07:27,039
same with medical cannabis people that

3118
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:30,079
are dying to this day still won't use

3119
02:07:27,039 --> 02:07:32,960
cannabis to help with the issue because

3120
02:07:30,078 --> 02:07:35,920
of the stigma that's been put on

3121
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:38,279
it so it's just what it is but I you

3122
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:40,559
know I just I can't I can't change the

3123
02:07:38,279 --> 02:07:42,639
world but I can I can try to be decent

3124
02:07:40,559 --> 02:07:46,119
to people in

3125
02:07:42,639 --> 02:07:48,000
person again you want to be an inspirer

3126
02:07:46,118 --> 02:07:50,598
yeah no I'm not an influencer the [ __ ]

3127
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:52,279
is that it if if I could influence

3128
02:07:50,599 --> 02:07:55,559
anybody it hopefully be influence your

3129
02:07:52,279 --> 02:07:57,880
children to be nice to other people like

3130
02:07:55,559 --> 02:08:00,000
if if when I see my kids being kind to

3131
02:07:57,880 --> 02:08:02,880
other people and when I get the report

3132
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:05,439
card and I see the good grade of nice to

3133
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:08,679
other children polite and respectful to

3134
02:08:05,439 --> 02:08:10,598
other people I know I did well but all

3135
02:08:08,679 --> 02:08:13,078
the other [ __ ] really

3136
02:08:10,599 --> 02:08:15,279
is just you if you're if you're bright

3137
02:08:13,078 --> 02:08:17,599
you're [ __ ] bright right

3138
02:08:15,279 --> 02:08:19,719
nobody I'm somebody that did well

3139
02:08:17,599 --> 02:08:21,199
academically or I do well in those

3140
02:08:19,719 --> 02:08:23,840
situations because my [ __ ] brain

3141
02:08:21,198 --> 02:08:25,799
works well that way so that's a gift

3142
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:27,920
right for me I got to struggle with

3143
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:29,719
other things those are the things that

3144
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:32,199
I'm really proud of is the [ __ ] that I

3145
02:08:29,719 --> 02:08:36,039
don't do that well but I had to work so

3146
02:08:32,198 --> 02:08:37,479
goddamn hard to get good at like that's

3147
02:08:36,039 --> 02:08:39,279
and you're laughing because you're like

3148
02:08:37,479 --> 02:08:41,439
to no one else is at anything high level

3149
02:08:39,279 --> 02:08:44,759
but to you you basically started out on

3150
02:08:41,439 --> 02:08:46,598
your hands and knees and now you can run

3151
02:08:44,760 --> 02:08:48,079
and know you're not the fastest runner

3152
02:08:46,599 --> 02:08:50,199
in the world and you're not trying to

3153
02:08:48,078 --> 02:08:52,519
say you are but to you you know damn

3154
02:08:50,198 --> 02:08:54,919
well it used to crawl on your hands and

3155
02:08:52,520 --> 02:08:59,520
knees and I think that it's those type

3156
02:08:54,920 --> 02:09:01,480
of uh internal victories that give us

3157
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:02,920
satisfaction and when you're fighting

3158
02:09:01,479 --> 02:09:05,198
this struggle on your own and you're

3159
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:07,440
doing things you're very different to

3160
02:09:05,198 --> 02:09:09,158
other people you don't attack them so

3161
02:09:07,439 --> 02:09:10,759
like for me when I look at like online

3162
02:09:09,158 --> 02:09:12,399
trolls and [ __ ] I laugh because if

3163
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:13,719
you're spending your time trolling I'm

3164
02:09:12,399 --> 02:09:16,519
like oh you're a miserable [ __ ]

3165
02:09:13,719 --> 02:09:18,760
in real life and and if I can see

3166
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:20,880
thousands of your prolific I'm just like

3167
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:22,880
you spend in your whole life online

3168
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:25,520
talking [ __ ] which means you're not

3169
02:09:22,880 --> 02:09:28,039
doing anything in your life and so it's

3170
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:30,040
a really good indicator of of the

3171
02:09:28,039 --> 02:09:32,198
quality of your life and I I just think

3172
02:09:30,039 --> 02:09:35,198
that unfortunately many don't

3173
02:09:32,198 --> 02:09:36,439
have they haven't found yet a place

3174
02:09:35,198 --> 02:09:37,799
where they're happy because once you're

3175
02:09:36,439 --> 02:09:38,919
happy you really don't give a [ __ ] about

3176
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:41,000
other people's

3177
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:42,440
lives you don't need to get in there

3178
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:46,639
[ __ ] and [ __ ]

3179
02:09:42,439 --> 02:09:48,519
ah yeah for sure I love trolls some of

3180
02:09:46,639 --> 02:09:50,078
the fun and I and I like it when they

3181
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:51,079
troll me sometimes I even help them

3182
02:09:50,078 --> 02:09:52,479
because I'm like you're not trolling

3183
02:09:51,078 --> 02:09:55,519
hard enough let me give you some more

3184
02:09:52,479 --> 02:09:56,839
info yeah for real you got to let me

3185
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:59,559
laugh because I'm just like I ain't

3186
02:09:56,840 --> 02:10:00,880
woring about you um and this [ __ ]

3187
02:09:59,559 --> 02:10:04,159
doesn't matter to me if the internet

3188
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:06,880
[ __ ] blew apart today I'd still be me

3189
02:10:04,158 --> 02:10:08,759

3190
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:11,559
plants I yeah I'm still doing what I'm

3191
02:10:08,760 --> 02:10:13,239
doing I'm I'm I'm I'm working and if the

3192
02:10:11,559 --> 02:10:15,960
electricity went out then I'm cracking

3193
02:10:13,238 --> 02:10:18,359
seed and I'm doing it only in the summer

3194
02:10:15,960 --> 02:10:21,000
it'll work it it's no matter what it'll

3195
02:10:18,359 --> 02:10:22,439
work and it's just really bending to

3196
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:25,039
that

3197
02:10:22,439 --> 02:10:27,960
reality it's such a beautiful attitude

3198
02:10:25,039 --> 02:10:30,399
you have man you know I like

3199
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:33,118
that power out we'd still be cracking

3200
02:10:30,399 --> 02:10:34,558
seeds in the summer period no matter

3201
02:10:33,118 --> 02:10:37,839
what I'm doing what I'm doing I don't

3202
02:10:34,559 --> 02:10:40,279
give a [ __ ] it's G to happen but I don't

3203
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:43,039
I don't get so caught up in it and I I

3204
02:10:40,279 --> 02:10:47,359
just know that if I spend my time in

3205
02:10:43,039 --> 02:10:50,078
Rage I can't turn that off and be with

3206
02:10:47,359 --> 02:10:54,679
my kids and my gal and my animals and my

3207
02:10:50,078 --> 02:10:56,078
friends and be positive right and and

3208
02:10:54,679 --> 02:10:57,599
positive just means you're just not

3209
02:10:56,078 --> 02:10:59,359
bringing negative [ __ ] with you I don't

3210
02:10:57,599 --> 02:11:02,599
have to do a thing say a thing be a

3211
02:10:59,359 --> 02:11:05,479
thing I just be that you enjoy the small

3212
02:11:02,599 --> 02:11:07,760
small things the small moments the the

3213
02:11:05,479 --> 02:11:10,718
the real moments the that's the what's

3214
02:11:07,760 --> 02:11:12,239
life is all about actually 100% it's

3215
02:11:10,719 --> 02:11:14,078
it's the Nuance that's what we talked

3216
02:11:12,238 --> 02:11:16,718
earlier about you know this forever life

3217
02:11:14,078 --> 02:11:19,039
where the thing was forever it just even

3218
02:11:16,719 --> 02:11:20,840
with cannabis it made me realize just be

3219
02:11:19,039 --> 02:11:23,719
grateful you experienced it when it was

3220
02:11:20,840 --> 02:11:25,800
at its Peak and be aware that the things

3221
02:11:23,719 --> 02:11:28,000
you see today are gorgeous also and that

3222
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:30,800
you're seeing them at their Peak and

3223
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:32,559
that when they change over time it's not

3224
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:34,239
that our memory is faulty it's just that

3225
02:11:32,559 --> 02:11:36,079
there's change it's like going back to

3226
02:11:34,238 --> 02:11:39,399
your neighborhood where you know you

3227
02:11:36,078 --> 02:11:41,359
lived in a place that was it was bad you

3228
02:11:39,399 --> 02:11:43,679
come back and now it's good it's been

3229
02:11:41,359 --> 02:11:47,439
clean it's been gentrified you go to

3230
02:11:43,679 --> 02:11:49,480
places that were were good and then

3231
02:11:47,439 --> 02:11:51,359
they've become bad in the way where the

3232
02:11:49,479 --> 02:11:53,879
they've been gentrified right so like

3233
02:11:51,359 --> 02:11:55,639
the cleansing of gentrification helps

3234
02:11:53,880 --> 02:11:57,920
bad areas but it also removes all the

3235
02:11:55,639 --> 02:12:00,199
[ __ ] flavor

3236
02:11:57,920 --> 02:12:02,880
so it's just enjoy it while you're in

3237
02:12:00,198 --> 02:12:05,319
the room there is one thing I wanted to

3238
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:07,440
to to say is like you know Rashon you

3239
02:12:05,319 --> 02:12:09,078
know the the perspective you know we see

3240
02:12:07,439 --> 02:12:11,919
every everybody sees the same thing but

3241
02:12:09,078 --> 02:12:13,639
Rashon you have your own for example I

3242
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:15,760
live in Europe right we have these

3243
02:12:13,639 --> 02:12:18,359
grapes here because I live in a Vine

3244
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:21,480
Vine producing area I told about it in

3245
02:12:18,359 --> 02:12:23,960
the last podcast a few podcast ago where

3246
02:12:21,479 --> 02:12:26,279

3247
02:12:23,960 --> 02:12:29,198

3249
02:12:29,198 --> 02:12:34,359
white grapes and they have a really

3250
02:12:31,039 --> 02:12:36,519
certain certain Aroma and we have a cut

3251
02:12:34,359 --> 02:12:40,158
which is like the vapa cut

3252
02:12:36,520 --> 02:12:41,840
from from Paradise seats and it has this

3253
02:12:40,158 --> 02:12:44,359
this Aroma you know like the grape the

3254
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:47,599
Isabella grape and last time I listened

3255
02:12:44,359 --> 02:12:50,198
to the podcast with Noto do and crybaby

3256
02:12:47,599 --> 02:12:52,319
and crybaby told like in one moment you

3257
02:12:50,198 --> 02:12:54,960
know the European they don't know how

3258
02:12:52,319 --> 02:12:56,599
skon smells because they don't have you

3259
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:59,239
know we have skunks here but we don't

3260
02:12:56,599 --> 02:13:01,880
have your skunks M you know what I mean

3261
02:12:59,238 --> 02:13:06,238
in USA you have those skunks that you

3262
02:13:01,880 --> 02:13:09,400
you call skunk and we don't have them so

3263
02:13:06,238 --> 02:13:12,279
I actually realized that I never smelled

3264
02:13:09,399 --> 02:13:15,558
skunk like you would say it's skunk you

3265
02:13:12,279 --> 02:13:18,238
know but I I I don't know that what this

3266
02:13:15,559 --> 02:13:20,880
smell is skunk for you something else is

3267
02:13:18,238 --> 02:13:21,718
skunk for me you know like it's it's a

3268
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:24,440
different

3269
02:13:21,719 --> 02:13:26,840
you know it's uh because for example in

3270
02:13:24,439 --> 02:13:29,799
my area everybody that smelled in the

3271
02:13:26,840 --> 02:13:32,279
'90s that's that started uh the wheat

3272
02:13:29,800 --> 02:13:34,639
indor wheat started to to be present in

3273
02:13:32,279 --> 02:13:37,679
the market everybody that smelled indor

3274
02:13:34,639 --> 02:13:40,800
wheat said it's conk it doesn't matter

3275
02:13:37,679 --> 02:13:43,158
if it's Haze or if it's uh it's if not

3276
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:46,559
Haze or it does not matter with the type

3277
02:13:43,158 --> 02:13:49,439
of uh genetic but everybody says indoor

3278
02:13:46,559 --> 02:13:52,039
wheed is skunk you know that is still

3279
02:13:49,439 --> 02:13:54,558
today the the slang word punk you know

3280
02:13:52,039 --> 02:13:56,599
or like the the word amnesia for the

3281
02:13:54,559 --> 02:13:58,039
haze in Amsterdam where everybody forget

3282
02:13:56,599 --> 02:14:00,400
the wallets and they don't know where

3283
02:13:58,039 --> 02:14:02,479
the hotel is and you know that's why

3284
02:14:00,399 --> 02:14:04,158
it's Amnesia actually it's Haze it's

3285
02:14:02,479 --> 02:14:05,759
super silver haze interesting that's how

3286
02:14:04,158 --> 02:14:09,118
that's where that word came from it's

3287
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:12,320
kind of like right now gas gas to us

3288
02:14:09,118 --> 02:14:15,198
implies petroleum right it it implies

3289
02:14:12,319 --> 02:14:18,880
this this petroleum like Aroma but to

3290
02:14:15,198 --> 02:14:21,598
kids today gas just means heat SO gas

3291
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:22,880
could be anything where we say gas

3292
02:14:21,599 --> 02:14:23,960
someone goes yeah this is gas and you're

3293
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:26,279
like that's not gas and they're like

3294
02:14:23,960 --> 02:14:27,840
yeah no it's gas because they're using

3295
02:14:26,279 --> 02:14:30,039
it it's connotation

3296
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:32,480
denotation it's what the word means and

3297
02:14:30,039 --> 02:14:34,599
what we believe it means and a lot of

3298
02:14:32,479 --> 02:14:36,718
these arguments are that because at the

3299
02:14:34,599 --> 02:14:39,239
end of the day everybody gets triggered

3300
02:14:36,719 --> 02:14:40,840
and the internet it it's funny but the

3301
02:14:39,238 --> 02:14:42,879
internet creates a situation where

3302
02:14:40,840 --> 02:14:46,039
people can get triggered quick and then

3303
02:14:42,880 --> 02:14:48,199
instantly call you a name they call your

3304
02:14:46,039 --> 02:14:49,559
name right away you're a [ __ ] idiot

3305
02:14:48,198 --> 02:14:51,479
and I was laughing I'm like this is so

3306
02:14:49,559 --> 02:14:53,840
interesting I said I wonder what you're

3307
02:14:51,479 --> 02:14:55,598
like in real life you know what I mean

3308
02:14:53,840 --> 02:14:57,960
because like oh

3309
02:14:55,599 --> 02:15:00,599
damn I think we can guess what he's like

3310
02:14:57,960 --> 02:15:04,800
in real life it's it's interesting but

3311
02:15:00,599 --> 02:15:07,960
it it doesn't allow there to be real

3312
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:10,239
conversation and for me the the problem

3313
02:15:07,960 --> 02:15:13,319
with that is that there's so many people

3314
02:15:10,238 --> 02:15:15,359
that lurk that they're online but they

3315
02:15:13,319 --> 02:15:17,238
lurk they never get involved in the

3316
02:15:15,359 --> 02:15:18,439
discussion because they don't want it's

3317
02:15:17,238 --> 02:15:20,000
not that they're they don't know what

3318
02:15:18,439 --> 02:15:22,039
they're doing either they're they're

3319
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:23,920
probably the smartest people in the room

3320
02:15:22,039 --> 02:15:26,760
they just don't want to get caught up in

3321
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:28,679
the dispute they don't want to get

3322
02:15:26,760 --> 02:15:31,719
engaged in more

3323
02:15:28,679 --> 02:15:37,319
drama and for

3324
02:15:31,719 --> 02:15:41,158
me I I do my best to not get engaged in

3325
02:15:37,319 --> 02:15:44,679
drama where I just don't like we can we

3326
02:15:41,158 --> 02:15:46,078
can go at me all day long but ignoring

3327
02:15:44,679 --> 02:15:47,359
yeah but when you Happ to attack me

3328
02:15:46,078 --> 02:15:48,519
personally on [ __ ] especially if you

3329
02:15:47,359 --> 02:15:50,158
don't know me right you don't know me

3330
02:15:48,520 --> 02:15:51,599
but you're attacking me I'm just like

3331
02:15:50,158 --> 02:15:53,679
you just looking

3332
02:15:51,599 --> 02:15:55,960
and the best thing that anybody can do

3333
02:15:53,679 --> 02:15:57,639
is basically ignore that person because

3334
02:15:55,960 --> 02:15:59,319
it destroys them because all they want's

3335
02:15:57,639 --> 02:16:03,679
attention because if they post on their

3336
02:15:59,319 --> 02:16:06,799
own platform nobody looks at them but if

3337
02:16:03,679 --> 02:16:10,520
they [ __ ] around on yours they get

3338
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:12,079
engagement right it's be able to feel

3339
02:16:10,520 --> 02:16:13,320
good and and and and it's just it's all

3340
02:16:12,078 --> 02:16:15,599
good everybody needs to feel good in the

3341
02:16:13,319 --> 02:16:18,158
way they do and it's just the problem is

3342
02:16:15,599 --> 02:16:19,920
what we do is we dissuade people that

3343
02:16:18,158 --> 02:16:23,679
don't like

3344
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:25,000
drama from entering our space and I

3345
02:16:23,679 --> 02:16:26,480
think that that's like the issue with

3346
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:29,158
cannabis and you look at cannabis and

3347
02:16:26,479 --> 02:16:31,358
it's the same thing where you know

3348
02:16:29,158 --> 02:16:33,879
cannabis was this extremely diverse

3349
02:16:31,359 --> 02:16:36,719
industry incredible amount of diversity

3350
02:16:33,879 --> 02:16:38,839
in every aspect and now when you take a

3351
02:16:36,718 --> 02:16:39,959
look at it it's almost no diversity and

3352
02:16:38,840 --> 02:16:41,558
I mean there there's no I don't care

3353
02:16:39,959 --> 02:16:43,718
what Equity program they create it's

3354
02:16:41,558 --> 02:16:47,398
still run by basically a bunch of white

3355
02:16:43,718 --> 02:16:49,318
guys like me and and even though I fall

3356
02:16:47,398 --> 02:16:52,039
under the equity guideline meaning

3357
02:16:49,318 --> 02:16:55,359
multi-time [ __ ] fon

3358
02:16:52,040 --> 02:16:56,760
um it's just not fair and then you take

3359
02:16:55,359 --> 02:17:00,399
a look at the number of women that are

3360
02:16:56,760 --> 02:17:02,559
in the industry and it's minuscule and

3361
02:17:00,398 --> 02:17:05,159
so what you have is you have this filter

3362
02:17:02,558 --> 02:17:07,358
that basically filters out people who

3363
02:17:05,159 --> 02:17:09,478
want to get in who don't want to deal

3364
02:17:07,359 --> 02:17:11,120
with all your [ __ ] and they just

3365
02:17:09,478 --> 02:17:12,599
want to get into a new career they

3366
02:17:11,120 --> 02:17:14,760
thought that being in cannabis would be

3367
02:17:12,599 --> 02:17:17,079
something positive being around people

3368
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:18,079
in can be positive but that's not the

3369
02:17:17,079 --> 02:17:20,159
Cannabis

3370
02:17:18,079 --> 02:17:22,840
industry that's that's cannabis

3371
02:17:20,159 --> 02:17:25,039
consumption and cultivation meaning that

3372
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:26,478
you're your own cultivator so if you're

3373
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:29,000
growing at your house and I'm growing at

3374
02:17:26,478 --> 02:17:30,519
my house and Slava is doing at his house

3375
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:33,439
we can all have a conversation about

3376
02:17:30,519 --> 02:17:35,960
growing and and feel the goodness of it

3377
02:17:33,439 --> 02:17:37,398
because we're not trying to monetize

3378
02:17:35,959 --> 02:17:39,759
that situation but the minute you

3379
02:17:37,398 --> 02:17:41,519
monetize it all of a sudden it changes

3380
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:45,280
it dramatically and the canvas industry

3381
02:17:41,519 --> 02:17:47,079
is a [ __ ] mess no diversity it's it's

3382
02:17:45,280 --> 02:17:50,280
and it's not healthy and you can see it

3383
02:17:47,079 --> 02:17:51,558
because it's so narrow band in its its

3384
02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:53,040
overall

3385
02:17:51,558 --> 02:17:54,840
wh we have a million different

3386
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:59,359
categories but at the end of the day

3387
02:17:54,840 --> 02:18:02,719
that it's some very limited selection be

3388
02:17:59,359 --> 02:18:05,239
honest Kevin very simple question next

3389
02:18:02,718 --> 02:18:07,239
season what what you're going to grow

3390
02:18:05,239 --> 02:18:10,199
next season you know genetic wise you

3391
02:18:07,239 --> 02:18:12,119
know cuz you obvious obviously are high

3392
02:18:10,200 --> 02:18:13,920
profile guy for that I'm really

3393
02:18:12,120 --> 02:18:16,479
interested what you will say now like

3394
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:20,200
what you are going to grow next season

3395
02:18:16,478 --> 02:18:23,519
let's see well um it it depends if I I

3396
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:27,800
know what I'm do on my own meaning like

3397
02:18:23,519 --> 02:18:30,439
I have a a an Afghan cherry pie that I

3398
02:18:27,799 --> 02:18:33,799
did some work on and went through and

3399
02:18:30,439 --> 02:18:36,439
selected out a a stunner and I would

3400
02:18:33,799 --> 02:18:38,799
love to see that as a rosin product hit

3401
02:18:36,439 --> 02:18:40,479
the market because it just threw down

3402
02:18:38,799 --> 02:18:44,039
but it threw down a product that just

3403
02:18:40,478 --> 02:18:46,519
shakes you like almost almost unpleasant

3404
02:18:44,040 --> 02:18:48,160
level strength so I'd love to see that

3405
02:18:46,519 --> 02:18:50,439
get out into the public because the the

3406
02:18:48,159 --> 02:18:52,039
people I smoked it with just loved it

3407
02:18:50,439 --> 02:18:55,679
but Lucky in

3408
02:18:52,040 --> 02:18:59,479
that I can produce product without white

3409
02:18:55,679 --> 02:19:00,558
label so I can produce product that um I

3410
02:18:59,478 --> 02:19:04,199
don't have

3411
02:19:00,558 --> 02:19:07,279
to uh sell I can produce it for a

3412
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:09,840
company but I get my name on the bag

3413
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:12,519
right so I'm I'm I'm I work with cookies

3414
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:14,439
on that and I produce varieties that

3415
02:19:12,519 --> 02:19:18,000
come out of the R&amp;D

3416
02:19:14,439 --> 02:19:19,760
facility and then the team tells me what

3417
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:21,519
they would like to see produced and I

3418
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:23,318
produce those products and we turn those

3419
02:19:21,519 --> 02:19:26,280
into fresh frozen and they they go into

3420
02:19:23,318 --> 02:19:28,199
the cookie world as a cart but it's a

3421
02:19:26,280 --> 02:19:32,359
great relationship because it's my label

3422
02:19:28,200 --> 02:19:33,840
on B so it's not it's not like I'm white

3423
02:19:32,359 --> 02:19:35,960
label and I'm actually getting the full

3424
02:19:33,840 --> 02:19:40,599
credit for the product and the ability

3425
02:19:35,959 --> 02:19:44,518
to do that is pretty good for sure I

3426
02:19:40,599 --> 02:19:47,079
think um only the most

3427
02:19:44,519 --> 02:19:49,478
respected breeders and cultivators will

3428
02:19:47,079 --> 02:19:51,159
will get that honor right like because

3429
02:19:49,478 --> 02:19:53,760
also putting your name on the bag is

3430
02:19:51,159 --> 02:19:55,639
bringing up the brand at this point it's

3431
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:58,040
good for both parties I me at the end of

3432
02:19:55,639 --> 02:20:00,318
the day you know the farmers have a hard

3433
02:19:58,040 --> 02:20:03,120
time getting their product into the into

3434
02:20:00,318 --> 02:20:06,279
the store

3435
02:20:03,120 --> 02:20:09,439
and when I can produce a product and get

3436
02:20:06,280 --> 02:20:11,800
it into the store that's a success would

3437
02:20:09,439 --> 02:20:14,680
I like to be able to just do what I want

3438
02:20:11,799 --> 02:20:17,438
yeah but at the end of the day I'm a

3439
02:20:14,680 --> 02:20:20,000
grower so I grow what sells and then I

3440
02:20:17,439 --> 02:20:22,439
can work on some stuff that that doesn't

3441
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:23,920
uh I I have one question I want to ask

3442
02:20:22,439 --> 02:20:28,680
you before we go and then we do a wrap

3443
02:20:23,920 --> 02:20:32,040
up okay um so one question I wanted to

3444
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:36,120
ask you was your thoughts on breeding

3445
02:20:32,040 --> 02:20:38,439
and selection of males yeah because and

3446
02:20:36,120 --> 02:20:40,840
I'll just give you my quick feeling on

3447
02:20:38,439 --> 02:20:45,760
it I don't feel like I have the

3448
02:20:40,840 --> 02:20:48,359
experience to choose a male I think

3449
02:20:45,760 --> 02:20:51,960
that in many for many people I think

3450
02:20:48,359 --> 02:20:53,600
it's a bit of undo arrogance that they

3451
02:20:51,959 --> 02:20:55,159
have that saying that they can select

3452
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:58,520
the male

3453
02:20:55,159 --> 02:21:00,318
because how do we really know when like

3454
02:20:58,520 --> 02:21:03,200
a female you can see it you can smoke it

3455
02:21:00,318 --> 02:21:06,799
in advance you know what you got a male

3456
02:21:03,200 --> 02:21:09,359
you you're making your best guess so for

3457
02:21:06,799 --> 02:21:12,239
me the best way to do

3458
02:21:09,359 --> 02:21:14,600
breeding and it's difficult is you know

3459
02:21:12,239 --> 02:21:17,559
if you have many males you cross your

3460
02:21:14,600 --> 02:21:20,800
females with them one at a time and then

3461
02:21:17,559 --> 02:21:23,159
you see what comes out from male one 2

3462
02:21:20,799 --> 02:21:25,478
three four as many as you can do and

3463
02:21:23,159 --> 02:21:29,119
then you know but you know people are

3464
02:21:25,478 --> 02:21:31,039
like well I did a stem rub or I reversed

3465
02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:33,200
this male and made it FL but it's like

3466
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:35,280
how can that actually tell you what

3467
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:37,760
you're going to get I I feel like

3468
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:40,040
choosing one male is arrogance it it

3469
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:41,840
well it it it is if you you're going to

3470
02:21:40,040 --> 02:21:43,520
select down to one though because

3471
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:45,520
sometimes one male is the only male that

3472
02:21:43,520 --> 02:21:47,800
carries the traits that moves on in but

3473
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:51,239
that's after testing all of them many of

3474
02:21:47,799 --> 02:21:53,639
them right so for me what I do is I I

3475
02:21:51,239 --> 02:21:56,280
look through the population of males and

3476
02:21:53,639 --> 02:21:59,318
if it's going to be open population

3477
02:21:56,280 --> 02:22:01,720
preservation I'm using every male I can

3478
02:21:59,318 --> 02:22:03,199
right but if it's trying to be selective

3479
02:22:01,719 --> 02:22:04,679
then I need to choose the males that

3480
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:07,079
have the traits of interest that I'm

3481
02:22:04,680 --> 02:22:10,280
attracted to mostly and then see that

3482
02:22:07,079 --> 02:22:12,600
they pass that forward so sometimes you

3483
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:14,120
know you go to do that's the problem is

3484
02:22:12,600 --> 02:22:16,840
that when you go to do breeding work

3485
02:22:14,120 --> 02:22:18,240
what we do is we Chase current money

3486
02:22:16,840 --> 02:22:21,200
where we're like oh it's hot right now

3487
02:22:18,239 --> 02:22:23,760
let's do this and the truth of it is is

3488
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:25,359
that what we want is we want to be able

3489
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:29,000
to say look the thing that I'm working

3490
02:22:25,359 --> 02:22:31,880
on has real value period because now it

3491
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:33,359
takes away the time frame and it lets

3492
02:22:31,879 --> 02:22:35,438
you say okay it's going to take me a

3493
02:22:33,359 --> 02:22:38,399
year and a half to really figure out

3494
02:22:35,439 --> 02:22:40,600
what do I want to work with and and once

3495
02:22:38,398 --> 02:22:42,799
you start to work with a line you can

3496
02:22:40,600 --> 02:22:45,079
start to notice that certain traits come

3497
02:22:42,799 --> 02:22:47,159
along with it where the plants that have

3498
02:22:45,079 --> 02:22:50,039
these profiles seem to have this odd

3499
02:22:47,159 --> 02:22:53,520
Leaf anomaly the plants that have this

3500
02:22:50,040 --> 02:22:56,840
trait seem to also pass this trait on so

3501
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:59,200
you'll start to see odds a propensity

3502
02:22:56,840 --> 02:23:00,880
for things to occur but the only way you

3503
02:22:59,200 --> 02:23:04,079
can determine anything at the end of the

3504
02:23:00,879 --> 02:23:05,478
day is is through testing the progeny

3505
02:23:04,079 --> 02:23:07,719
and that's where you know working on

3506
02:23:05,478 --> 02:23:09,358
marker assisted stuff is that they're

3507
02:23:07,719 --> 02:23:11,719
going to say look this plant we've

3508
02:23:09,359 --> 02:23:14,159
identified the trade of Interest this is

3509
02:23:11,719 --> 02:23:15,920
where it exists if we can find it on

3510
02:23:14,159 --> 02:23:18,079
this plant that means that plant has the

3511
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:20,040
potential to pass it on but if that

3512
02:23:18,079 --> 02:23:21,959
trait doesn't exist in the plant there's

3513
02:23:20,040 --> 02:23:25,399
no to pass it

3514
02:23:21,959 --> 02:23:27,000
on and so most most breeding is kind of

3515
02:23:25,398 --> 02:23:29,519
that's why I say it's kind of half ass

3516
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:32,120
because we don't we don't go at it from

3517
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:33,439
this comprehensive view but it doesn't

3518
02:23:32,120 --> 02:23:35,359
mean that we haven't created some

3519
02:23:33,439 --> 02:23:39,318
beautiful stuff it's just we don't have

3520
02:23:35,359 --> 02:23:41,920
a line we have a cluster that we select

3521
02:23:39,318 --> 02:23:44,159
from and the goal is to be able to put

3522
02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:46,318
as much into this line as possible so

3523
02:23:44,159 --> 02:23:51,639
that when you [ __ ] with the line you get

3524
02:23:46,318 --> 02:23:55,239
a large portion of that pretty desirable

3525
02:23:51,639 --> 02:23:58,920
right well nice one I I appreciate that

3526
02:23:55,239 --> 02:24:02,639
response and uh with that I think we

3527
02:23:58,920 --> 02:24:06,478
will wrap it up and let Kevin get to his

3528
02:24:02,639 --> 02:24:08,840
family and and to his plants but um I

3529
02:24:06,478 --> 02:24:10,559
did want to I did want to say again I

3530
02:24:08,840 --> 02:24:14,000
don't feel like we've even scratched the

3531
02:24:10,559 --> 02:24:15,680
surface of your story so I got some guys

3532
