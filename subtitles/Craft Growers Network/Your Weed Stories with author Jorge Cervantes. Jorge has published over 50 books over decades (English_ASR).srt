Welcome oh gee gee Gabby thank you thank

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,159
you so much you know I mean we've known

22
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,759
each other for a heck of a long time

23
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,880
yeah it's been 20 years yeah I know I

24
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:25,200
know we used I I I used to have a house

25
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:27,478
in California in somoma which is pretty

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,118
close to Willets it's is not that far

27
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:33,879
away yeah and it's and I was just

28
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:37,599
watching the um the interview with Kevin

29
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:40,280
jodrey and he told me to say hello yeah

30
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,839
yeah yeah yeah I love Kevin he's great

31
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,960
he's done so much good stuff man I mean

32
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,920
when he started that Wonderland Nursery

33
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:51,879
dang that I mean that was that was great

34
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,240
but see he's one of the guys and one of

35
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:57,839
the things he said in his interview was

36
00:01:54,239 --> 00:02:02,399
was his timing was good because he got

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:07,600
into it publicly at the perfect time you

38
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:11,800
know and for me my timing was horrible I

39
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:14,598
mean I got into it when when it was like

40
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,719
about as illegal as you could get you

41
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:20,639
know I figured it was going to be legal

42
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:24,159
but yeah I mean I I would I I wrote the

43
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:26,799
first book there in uh

44
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:29,439
1983 and you know there's a full-blown

45
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,640
drug war going on or War on Drugs going

46
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:36,000
on but that might have added to the

47
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:40,318
popularity of the book uh no [ __ ] I was

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,400
I see uh the problem is you couldn't get

49
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:45,719
into the the big Distributors didn't

50
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,519
want to hit didn't want to carry it and

51
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:54,000
then within no time I got on the theft

52
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:56,840
list because what theft theft steal as

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,639
in take away something that's not yours

54
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,920
MH and the reason PE because then they'd

55
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,798
have to lock the books up they'd have to

56
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:08,439
lock them up and so people were

57
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:11,480
intimidated they were afraid to go buy

58
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:14,199
books so they stole them yeah so they'd

59
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:16,238
steal them it was it was faster easier

60
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:19,119
and you know they risk getting caught

61
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:22,560
there yeah but I was on the St the the

62
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,480
theft list for for Barnes and Noble and

63
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:30,319
and borders and God all of the big

64
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:32,399
stores yeah and um yeah so that was

65
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:35,079
pretty tough and then you know I I mean

66
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,080
I had a lot of trouble people didn't

67
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:42,159
want to um well printers just didn't

68
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:46,439
want to print it I I I had a heck of a

69
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:50,039
hard time finding a printer and um the

70
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:52,078
first book actually I printed it myself

71
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:54,120
I printed with these hands I didn't have

72
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,879
any money either you know nobody want

73
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,319
take any chances and I remember uh what

74
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:02,438
was it Andor press that was one of the

75
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:05,958
one of the the uh companies I sended uh

76
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:08,120
submitted a manuscript to he they said

77
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,878
over there that everything that

78
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,120
is everything that needs to be written

79
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:16,478
about cannabis has already been written

80
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,199
and that was yeah yeah yeah yeah that

81
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:22,319
was pretty funny that's still not true

82
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,639
no not even close I mean we're we're

83
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:28,399
just scratching the surface

84
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:31,478
now um yeah so anyway I I mean the book

85
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:34,159
was rejected reject Ed nobody wanted it

86
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:37,719
they said it was a dumb idea and all of

87
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,600
that and uh so I printed it myself and

88
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,919
self-published it in that way I was I

89
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:47,000
was good for timing because that's when

90
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:50,758
self-publishing started I bought a kpro

91

if you willing to um humor Us is I

111
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,038
wanted to start off as early as we can

112
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,720
so for instance like your first

113
00:05:54,038 --> 00:06:00,159
experiences with

114
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,919
cannabis okay yeah yeah I and

115
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,080
you you may have to ask you know

116
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,639
qualifying questions and stuff because

117
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,839
well so when when was the first time you

118
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,478
saw cannabis when was the first time you

119
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:13,198
smoked cannabis and you know eventually

120
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:14,639
we'll get to the first time you grew it

121
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,639
well I

122
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:21,879
saw I saw the leaf and stuff cuz see I

123
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:25,478
grew up in a small town uh small

124
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:29,719
agricultural Town Ontario Oregon and

125
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:33,240
it's right on the border with Idaho

126
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,199
and everybody lives out there I mean

127
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,759
they're they're all Farmers everybody's

128
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:43,759
a farmer you know uh that's the main

129
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:48,439
main occupation and or having to do with

130
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:52,720
farming and um so it's very very

131
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:55,079
conservative and uh you know there was

132
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,440
all of those gosh I graduated high

133
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:00,279
school in

134
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:04,478
1972 And I think the first the first

135
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:07,878
time I smoked it cannabis was 71 when I

136
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:10,240
was a junior in high school cuz it

137
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:13,720
number one it was hard to get uh it

138
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,079
wasn't real common to to see yeah

139
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:20,039
1971 and

140
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:23,079
um uh we you know I'd heard all kinds of

141
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:24,598
Horrid things about it everybody was uh

142
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:28,318

bricks inside from from roofs uh you to

166
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:34,799
make it heavier like it smelled like

167
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,599
fuel gas I mean real because they

168
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:40,759
transported it in the trucks you know in

169
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:44,320
fuel we didn't have so much fuel smell

170
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:47,278
but we had uh uh but we we put rocks in

171
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:51,080
the kilos you put rocks in there and

172
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:54,200
also uh rocks and I remember I found all

173
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,360
kinds of my favorite was uh lizards

174
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,920
lizards there was always lizards you'd

175
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,959
always find lizards oh my gosh yeah they

176
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:08,078
be always be running uh

177
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:11,159
sh and um yeah yeah yeah uh but we

178
00:09:08,078 --> 00:09:16,120
bought uh an ounce of that it was like

179
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:17,639
$10 us you know cheap and uh half of it

180
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:22,278
was stems and

181
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:26,159
seeds and so we all went out in my car

182
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:29,519
there was four of us we taken a a pipe

183
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,838
from my a tobacco pipe from my father

184
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,240
and because there's no head shops

185
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,800
nothing you know and so we we all get in

186
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,519
the car and start smoking cannabis you

187
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:41,559
know start passing this around and

188
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:46,320
finally toward the end of the end of the

189
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:49,799
uh the ounce I Got High I mean seriously

190
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,000
high and it was great it was nothing

191
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:54,278
like anybody had ever explained to me or

192
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,039
anything I mean it was it was [ __ ]

193
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:58,838
wonderful I couldn't get enough I was

194
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:02,278
and I was driving the car and it was

195
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:04,600
like I was in the movie I was in a movie

196
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:07,480
watching myself drive a car it was the

197
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:11,240
first major hallucination I had and it

198
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:14,519
was I I loved it I loved it and uh yeah

199
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:18,600
that was well that that's what hooked me

200
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:20,679
right there um and then there was there

201
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:25,240
was a lot of things that happened then

202
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:27,319
too because for example people adults

203
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,759
that I

204
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:35,120
respected they would just buy into the

205
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:38,919
drug war or War on Drugs

206
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,839
and and they wouldn't ask any questions

207
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:44,039
they just believe everything they just

208
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:47,000
swallow everything and so what happens

209
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:48,958
was I thought now look if you guys are

210
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,639
dumb enough to just believe something

211
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:55,638
that somebody tells you well I I can't

212
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,680
really uh go along with that and I like

213
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:00,159
to do my own homework and so I do my

214
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:02,078
homework and I find out that all the

215
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:07,278
information comes from you know like the

216
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:10,519
anti-drug agencies so I think huh okay

217
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:13,320
so what's the truth what's what's going

218
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:16,959
on and so I figured the people that were

219
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:19,920
that were um saying the same things as

220
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:23,838
as everybody else you know the um what

221
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:26,319
do you call them the anti-drug guys

222
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,639
um those guys were just sheep and

223
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,000
they'll follow anybody so heck with them

224
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:35,159
uh I can't really trust them and then

225
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,799
the people that don't that uh do their

226
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:39,639
homework

227
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:42,000
um they're only reading one thing you

228
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:44,200
got to read everybody you got to look at

229
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,759
everything and so I've just figured I

230
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,759
was getting bad news bad bad bad

231
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:51,480
information straight away and so I never

232
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:54,078
bought into that drug war and I never

233
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:57,360
believed any of it I just I mean cuz it

234
00:11:54,078 --> 00:12:00,919
was pretty straightforward is a a way to

235
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:06,480
control people and that's it it um yeah

236
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:10,278
so I um yeah and then after that that

237
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:14,320
was in high school and then for

238
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:17,639
University I went um I well I I spent a

239
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:21,079
year here in Spain and and uh a couple

240
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:25,320
other places but it but the SEC but I

241
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:28,638
spent another year in Mexico I went to

242
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,360
Mexico and that's when we got really I

243
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,600
really do

244
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,919
it because the first thing happens was

245
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,959
uh oh the

246
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:43,000
theor the the director of the University

247
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:45,198
gives us a big speech and everything

248
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,399
about cannabis and how bad it is and

249
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:51,838
stuff and then this guy says I'm gonna

250
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:54,799
go smoke a joint uh and he walks right

251
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,320
through like right in front of everybody

252
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:59,519
I thought well that sounds like a good

253
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,879
idea I'm going to go go with him and the

254
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,799
next I mean I I I've been in I've been

255
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:07,838
in Mexico like 48 Hours you

256
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:11,198
know and then the next day uh that's

257
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,199
when I got my bought my first kilo uh

258
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:16,319
kilo there yeah I thought you were going

259
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:18,759
to say the next day I got thrown out of

260
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,600
school no no they wouldn't throw you out

261
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:24,198
of school you had to get uh uh you had

262
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:30,879
to get you had to be really bad to get

263
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:33,559
thrown out of school um yeah yeah I mean

264
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:36,879
maybe uh no I don't know anybody that

265
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:39,159
was thrown out nobody's thrown out they

266
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:42,240
just look at things differently there

267
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:45,719
yeah and so I got really into it there

268
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:49,240
and uh stayed with it and then when I

269
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:52,720
got I graduated

270
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,480
University and I I mean I'll be darn I

271
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,360
didn't know what the hell else to do

272
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,680
except to start growing so that's what I

273
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,639
did I just that's what I did for living

274
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,599
I well actually I had a garden business

275
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:06,320
I moved to Santa Barbara

276
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:10,159
California and had a garden

277
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,759
business and then I grew part-time up in

278
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:16,759
the hills and stuff and then did really

279
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:18,839
well I was uh first year that was

280
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:24,519
the uh let's

281
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:27,199
see still in the 70s mid 7s yeah mid 70s

282
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:30,320
but I grew for a couple years made a

283
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:34,240
made quite a bit of money and um then I

284
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:37,519
got in the bought a Volkswagen van and

285
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:41,360
uh moved and then took a road trip went

286
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:45,078
to uh South America in the in the

287
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,079
Volkswagen and that was um well that was

288
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:48,278
it was okay until you got to Central

289
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:50,879
America

290
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:55,000
because oh [ __ ] that's that's when the

291
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:59,039
Lo Sistas the Sistas from uh El Salvador

292
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:04,320
was it Sistas or Sistas sanist Sistas

293
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:07,759
sista as sista aswi yeah sista one uh

294
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,639
but when they uh they were around and I

295
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,800
met these guys that

296
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:16,079
said um they were driving through

297
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:20,439
driving through their Central America

298
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:22,758
and the Sanita stop them and they

299
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,600
requisitioned their

300
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,839
vehicle uh they just took it off of them

301
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,480
basically and they gave him a receipt

302
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,160
they a receipt

303
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:36,639
you can have it back after the war

304
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:39,000
yes pretty yeah exactly that's what

305
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:44,879
happened so I thought that was kind of a

306
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,480
bad idea to continue there and um so I I

307
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:50,439
I sold the car in America and then went

308
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,319
to uh got on the airplane and went to

309
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,480
Chile because my partner my business

310
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:59,679
partner had already already gone down

311
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:04,600
there but my goal was to um

312
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:06,278
well to do a lot of traveling but um to

313
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,720
learn more about cannabis in South

314
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:12,720
America and I was just I I don't know I

315
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,639
was gone about six months and we just

316
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,959
just there's so much other stuff to do

317
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,879
that's all I mean just kind of goofed

318
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:22,439
off for for the better part of six

319
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:24,519
months no I guess no actually I think I

320
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,319
made it more close closer to a year

321
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:30,159
that's right yeah cuz I wound up in the

322
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:31,000
Amazon that's right yeah but um anyway

323
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:36,240
when

324
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,159
I when I got back um back to the United

325
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,720
States before you talk about the United

326
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:43,000
States did you make it to

man I'll tell you um it everything

340
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:29,360
changed it was it was rough that I mean

341
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,160
that's what you remember camp

342
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:35,959
campaign against marijuana planting in

343
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,480
Northern California mhm where see the

344
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,558
big problem was with this it was

345
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,400
freaking drug war or when camp

346
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:46,558
start oh I don't remember the year I'm

347
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,400
bad with all CU because I thought Camp

348
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:51,798
was a little bit later than like some of

349
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,320
your story oh yeah yeah definitely later

350
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:58,240
it was quite a bit later yeah was like

351
00:17:54,319 --> 00:18:00,918
late 80s think because that that's uh

352
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,558
Tom Alex Ander used to I I didn't want

353
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:04,400
to skip over the Tom Alexander part so

354
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:07,839
that's

355
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:14,080
why but anyway go ahead talk about

356
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:14,079
Camp yeah um no anyway I moved

357
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:19,360
uh no I started I started growing there

358
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:23,079
and then let's see but yeah basically

359
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:26,879
and then um gosh I moved to

360
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:29,439
um yeah moved to Portland Oregon and

361
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,600
that's where I wrote the first

362
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,759
uh marijuana horiculture book so so was

363
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:37,798
this was this before or after you were

364
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:41,200
involved in sensia

365
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:44,918
tips um no that that was uh before what

366
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,000
I did is I I uh I wrote the marijuana

367
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:50,038
hor or the indoor marijuana horiculture

368
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I called it then because the only thing

369
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:56,279
you could get a hold of was Steve

370
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:00,159
Murphy's or Murphy Stevens's book um

371
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:01,798
yeah and there was a couple of yeah a

372
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:03,720
couple others but they were pretty

373
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:08,720
lightweight and because there wasn't

374
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:11,880
much information so um yeah this one

375
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,360
this one that's and and then the Halli

376
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:17,600
lights were all new and they' gone from

377
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:19,599
ver Mercury lamps to highight lights and

378
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:22,038
that was in the early 70s and that's

379
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:24,639
when all of this started and there was

380
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:28,480
just tons of really bad

381
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,840
information people just they didn't they

382
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,038
didn't have a [ __ ] clue of what was

383
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:35,959
going on uh most the time something

384
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:38,200
never change right well yeah you know I

385
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,679
mean there's so many there's so much

386
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,440
information

387
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:47,080
now and that well there's just not that

388
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:50,600
much or there wasn't that much at all um

389
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:53,879
so that's when I decided to to do the um

390
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:56,119
do the research and see i' I've been

391
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,400
gardening my whole life and I had the

392
00:19:56,119 --> 00:20:00,359
Garden business for a couple of years

393
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,080
and even though I don't have a degree in

394
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:05,119
in horiculture or or a hard science even

395
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,240
soil

396
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,918
biology

397
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:13,759
uh I know a lot about gardening I mean

398
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,840
I'm just you know handson so uh what I

399
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:18,200
did is I I went to all of the the

400
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:21,199
lighting companies uh let's see there

401
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,558
was uh Sylvania and Phillips were the

402
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,440
two big

403
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:27,918
ones and got all of their literature and

404
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,240
found out everything I could and then I

405
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:34,120
put the two things together information

406
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:37,480
about lights and then information about

407
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:40,759
uh uh gardening and then you know I'd

408
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:44,919
been grow I i' grown for by that time

409
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:48,400
about about five years and so I put all

410
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:51,038
of that information together and then

411
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:55,600
for me I'll tell you the smartest thing

412
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:59,960
I did back then was this was

413
00:20:55,599 --> 00:21:02,759
to put a survey in there a 10-word

414
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:05,720
survey or I mean a 10 question survey

415
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:08,919
and ask ask people what they wanted to

416
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:11,278
know you know I mean it and and then so

417
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:12,360
I was able to tailor the book for the

418
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:15,440
for the

419
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:17,079
Growers um yeah but where that survey

420
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,159
where was that survey published how did

421
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:21,678

you so much for joining us nice yeah no

440
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:12,079
worries no anyway you asked in your book

441
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,200
you put a survey in yeah um to ask

442
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:19,079
people what they wanted yeah and I

443
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:21,558
remember uh let's see well to the the

444
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:24,720
survey served a couple of purposes one

445
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:27,200
is to find out what the audience wanted

446
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,120
and uh two to find out how what their

447
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,798
knowledge level is

448
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:34,239
and they're you know I

449
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:37,240
mean like when you give a lecture when

450
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,400
you uh talk to talk to people you just

451
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:42,319
generally ask them what they know so you

452
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,600
know how to speak to them so you can

453
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:49,558
speak at this level proper level and um

454
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:54,079
yeah I remember the last question on the

455
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:58,879
survey was did you uh a thief or a

456
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,879
policeman Harvest your crop

457
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,880
and you know there's quite a bit about

458
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:10,119
security and stuff uh there but yeah

459
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:13,960
yeah that was all old old times tough

460
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:16,158
times uh my family thought I was crazy

461
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,440
uh I had to have two sets of friends

462
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,880
people that knew people that

463
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:24,080
didn't um I I

464
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,760
felt yeah I mean it it was pretty hard

465
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:29,720

466
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:33,720

467
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:35,880
um I kept people on my side or you know

468
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:40,880

491
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:46,240

492
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:50,480
figure out what to do with it was it all

493
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:52,640
wet still yeah it was all wet and it w

494
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:56,200
it it was like parked right in front of

495
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:58,159
my house you anyway so this guy showed

496
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,200
up to your house with a truckload full

497
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,080
of

498
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,840
of fresh cannabis that he didn't know

499
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:06,678
what to do with yeah about a ton and he

500
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:08,678
says well where can I sell this stuff I

501
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:10,120
didn't even want to look at it yet now I

502
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:12,759
looked at it through the window and it

503
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:15,398
was like hanging out the tarp and stuff

504
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:17,000
and that I mean that that's pretty uh

505
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:19,319
that would have been a big deal the

506
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,880
whole town would have known about

507
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:24,200
Portland's about half a million people

508
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,720
uh that would have been that that would

509
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:30,919
have been bad news uh God just all

510
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,759
little little little things you know um

511
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:35,880
what was another one there was this

512
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:39,558
other guy that came over and I'm sure he

513
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:41,559
was a narc cuz he wanted me he wanted me

514
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:45,278
to sell him some

515
00:25:41,558 --> 00:25:47,639
cannabis or tell him where he could find

516
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:51,798
some uh but those were the those were

517
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:53,919
the two ones that I recall um yeah but a

518
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:56,038
lot a lot of PE a lot of other things

519
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,520
too like I was a member of the the

520
00:25:56,038 --> 00:26:01,480
Publishers Association

521
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:03,319

Northwest

523
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:09,798
and people just hated me like some

524
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:12,918
people like me but about half of them

525
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:15,240
just [ __ ] hated me ju before they'd

526
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:18,919
seen me or anything and they would blame

527
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:23,399
me blame me for their children's

528
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:25,320
problems and and you know you got to be

529
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:26,759
careful when they're they're like that

530
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:29,079
you're in public you know because

531
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:33,359
they're pretty upset

532
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:36,000
but one time I did say I ain't the kid's

533
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:39,639
dad you better look in the mirror

534
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,480
[ __ ] I just had it I just had it

535
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,480
you know I'm still curious how did they

536
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,880
like find you like on the street did you

537
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,000
have a photo of yourself in your

538
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,679
original book were you not Incognito

539
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,079
like in the later ones no no no no they

540
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:54,440
they came to my house you said two

541
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:56,519
people showed up to your house but then

542
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,640
you said that like people on the street

543
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:01,599
would see you and blame you for their

544
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:04,520
kids oh no no no on the street not on

545
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:07,079
the street uh in the Publishers group in

546
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:09,599
the Publishers group yeah that's where

547
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:12,678
they cuz cuz I was very very careful

548
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:16,000
with the identity that was um now that's

549
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:18,200
a kiss of death man um you could you

550
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,200
couldn't travel anymore if you you know

551
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:23,038
you have a felony you start running into

552
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:26,200
trouble with uh traveling and especially

553
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:28,960
if you want to move and it comes up

554
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:31,558
every time well shows up every time you

555
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,319
cross a border that's the big problem so

556
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:36,918
you go into the little room and you have

557
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,879
the conversation about 10 different

558
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:42,720
times with the same with different

559
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:45,799
people and it's it's real

560
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,558
unpleasant yeah and then let's see after

561
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:51,839
that after

562
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:53,960
that hydrarm got a hold of me and they

563
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:57,319
wanted me to put a catalog in the back

564
00:27:53,960 --> 00:28:00,079
of the book so that's what I did I put a

565
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:02,000
catalog in the back of the book and we

566
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:04,558
sold indoor garden

567
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,278
equipment and that worked really

568
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:10,278
well um this is the same Hydra farm that

569
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:12,599
I know yes the one I didn't know that

570
00:28:10,278 --> 00:28:15,000
part of the story because later on they

571
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:17,639
beca well santell was Diamond lights

572
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,880
right no no that was they started oh

573
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,559
you're right hyro Farm was in sanell too

574
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:25,240
but um Francis great Boulevard that's

575
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:28,798
what they became so paranoid about weed

576
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:33,000
later on you know so interesting started

577
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:36,759
off they got popped in green Merchant H

578
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,319
yeah they were one of the what uh6

579
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:43,278
stores or something I don't I can't I've

580
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:45,960
got the stats here uh but one of the I

581
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:48,200
don't know 80 stores 40 stores I can't

582
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:51,079
remember that got they got po but 100

583
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,840
but 120 of my friends went to jail I

584
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:55,079
know that that's why they made the

585
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:58,119
change to to be a little bit more

586
00:28:55,079 --> 00:29:01,558
careful I guess yeah they were uh real

587
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:04,199
paranoid for a while but you know it's

588
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:07,639
understandable it's it's your livelihood

589
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,200
and you know you could go to jail that

590
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,240
Jail's not

591
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:16,440
fun like you said people did go to jail

592
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,599
yeah lots of them lots of them so there

593
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,840
was there was that and then after that

594
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:23,798
yeah and and

595
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:28,240
then about a year after that I opened a

596
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:32,558
uh a garden store in Portland Oregon

597
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:35,519
and that went that went pretty well um

598
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:39,558
but I was I'm really a shitty business

599
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:41,679
person when it comes down to it so um I

600
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:45,558
had a manager there that was quite

601
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,480
dishonest and uh he pretty much ran me

602
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:49,558
into

603
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,440
bankruptcy um by not paying attention to

604
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:54,519
this that and other thing blah blah blah

605
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,278
uh so that that was pretty rough but I

606
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:59,919
do remember

607
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:02,679
before uh before green Merchant I

608
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:05,519
remember on two separate well no three

609
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:08,759
four five five or six occasions two

610
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:11,519
different narcs came in I remember them

611
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:14,640
very well I could Pro well they're older

612
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:16,919
now but I could probably ID them still

613
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,799
because so you said you had a garden

614
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:21,840
store but it's just like what we would

615
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:24,158
call a grow shop that was a grow shop

616
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:26,119

00:32:19,558 --> 00:32:25,798
read it and know what to do uh know how

654
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:28,159
to help help clients and then clients

655
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:31,240
could read it and have a good idea and

656
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:34,240
it gave people something to talk about

657
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:37,120
you know different types of tomatoes

658
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,798
except you know that that the funny

659
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:43,879
thing is um you know cannabis has got

660
00:32:39,798 --> 00:32:48,638
some really unique characteristics like

661
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:53,120
some well yeah exactly it's uh yeah

662
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:58,558
dioses big deal big deal and it also uh

663
00:32:53,119 --> 00:33:01,319
it's a short day plant you know so it

664
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:05,038
flowers there's only a few okay like

665
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:08,638
poin poinas Napa cabbages you know

666
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:11,638
Chinese cabbage they call them also and

667
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:14,079
um let's see Christmas cactus those are

668
00:33:11,638 --> 00:33:16,959
and C cockal bur there's a bunch of

669
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:21,319
plants that are short day plants right

670
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:23,278
so um you kind of have to I'm I'm glad

671
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:25,918
the cops didn't read these things

672
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:28,398
because yeah I mean if you read

673
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,960
this if you read

674
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:32,038
yes I mean you be it'd be really the

675
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,399
thing is you'd have to know a little

676
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:36,480
something about marijuana to know that

677
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:37,678
in the first place right yeah yeah so

678
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,720
even if they read it they probably

679
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:44,519
wouldn't have a clue did it like talk

680
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,519
about flipping your tomatoes to 1212

681
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:51,919
oh no I have to change I you're that is

682
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:55,558
good though I have to change I have to

683
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:58,159
change plants for that but you know not

684
00:33:55,558 --> 00:34:01,200
a lot of people grow

685
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,919
poas I mean they'll get them they'll get

686
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:08,079
them in the winter and grow them for

687
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:10,760
Christmas but that's it but anyway

688
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,240
anyway so so this one did really well

689
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,520
did really well and but I get these

690
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:19,519
phone calls or not phone calls but

691
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:23,800
letters letters and uh later I would get

692
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:26,960
uh emails that would say

693
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:29,399
hey there's this guy named George Van

694
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,960

695
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:35,480
stuff you better you know I mean there's

696
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:37,599
a big copyright violation there and I

697
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,480
write back and say oh that's so bad blah

698
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,720

699
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,199

had a fun time with it you know what's

701
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:50,118
funny about

702
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:52,039
that is I was just talking to a friend

703
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:56,039
of mine the other day and we were

704
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:57,759
talking about you and you know he called

705
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:59,199
I don't know if he called you George

706
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,119
because we were actually talking about

707
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:03,319
Bill

708
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:05,838
Ross oh yeah yeah yeah Ross yeah and so

709
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,880
Ross always called you George yeah you

710
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:10,320
know and yeah you know I've known you

711
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:13,240
for over 20 years I still don't know

712
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,240
what your [ __ ] name

713
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:18,960
is uh you're still that guy with the

714
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:21,078
sunglasses and dreadlocks as far as I'm

715
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,720
concerned that's

716
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:25,119
uh we can keep it that way if you want I

717
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:28,279
just wanted you to know that I thought

718
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,358
it I thought it was funny

719
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,720
most people keep it that way that

720
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:35,559
because uh you know my given name George

721
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:38,598
Van Patton one of my is your given name

722
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:40,920
yes okay so now now now the facts are

723
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:43,079
out that your name is George van I kind

724
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,000
of thought santes might not be your last

725
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:50,720
name

726
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:53,318
but yeah well yeah I um yeah cantes

727
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:55,919
no um oh yeah I was talking about guard

728
00:35:53,318 --> 00:36:00,639
gardening indoors and then and then

729
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:03,039
later later became a green Merchant

730
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:05,879
green Merchant were you around for green

731
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:08,119
Merchant or did you was not I actually

732
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:11,519
started growing right after green mer

733
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:15,280
Merchant so like when I met when I met

734
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:18,079
Bill he was super paranoid because you

735
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,720
know they had just come to his place and

736
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,318
and give him a whole bunch of [ __ ] but

737
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:24,039
before we talk about green Merchant I

738
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:26,199
think one step like I said I don't want

739
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:28,199
to forget talking about somebody that I

740

752
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:09,358
time together we would go to uh the the

753

757
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:26,319
press back then uh they were growing

758
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:30,838
really fast and they were quite a quite

759
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:33,880
a uh a force to be reckoned with and we

760
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:36,960
had our own well you know small press

761
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:39,240
and it's just small smaller presses but

762
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,760
a lot of leftists and a lot of

763
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:44,799
alternative people and stuff that we

764
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:48,160
will hang out with and then we will also

765
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:51,000

uh do that we get a suite and then we'd

769
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:05,000
all always bring uh lots of

770
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:07,880

771
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,280
popular everybody everybody would show

772
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:15,960
up at the at the suite but we usually

773
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:19,560
get I don't know anywhere from 30 to 70

774
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:23,159
or 80 people um Ken key showed up one

775
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:27,838
time uh that was really good uh yeah was

776
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:34,440
that was nice that was a hit uh who but

777
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:37,960
yeah fun time and anyway um we spent all

778
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:41,519
kinds of time we went to to that to

779
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:45,000
trade shows probably for 20 years 20

780
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:46,880
years yeah and that it it was rough

781
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,679
times because there's a bunch of people

782
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,559
that hated us and and um but most of

783
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:55,759
people liked us because see book world

they're not at all conservative think

788
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:09,239
people should be able to express

789
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:12,599
themselves but yeah yeah we spent tons

790

816
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:32,759
years ago that you know I don't know

817
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,599
what happened if if he had to leave

818
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,920
because if they closed cuz he died or

819
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:41,359
something but they definitely existed 10

820
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:44,599
years ago cool cool cool yeah because I

821
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:47,078
knew I knew Stephen from um from The

822
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:50,480
High Times he would go to go to the high

823
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:53,400
times fair the Cannabis Cup that was the

824
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,719
biggest thing happening oh yeah and then

825
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:58,920
way back way back this was this was

826
00:40:55,719 --> 00:41:00,439
early on right after I published the

827
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:05,480
book

828
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:09,440
um or not within 6 months 6 months a

829
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:13,800
year uh Neville was selling seeds out of

830
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:17,960
uh the seed bank in out of uh the

831
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:21,760
Netherlands and he'd already set up the

832
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:23,920
um the Cannabis castle and stuff so I

833
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:28,720
spent a lot of time there I would I

834
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:32,680
would fly over to Netherlands regular L

835
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:35,439
um three or four times well yeah three

836
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:39,879
or four time four times a year probably

837
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:42,280
for about five or six years yeah that

838
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:46,599
was early on early

839
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:51,599
on um and I also helped

840
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:55,280
Neville uh get some different cannabis

841
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:58,240

842
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:02,599
him genetics from the US well I no I

843
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:05,479

844
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:08,000
not I was not making any money I will

845
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:10,800
put people together but I'm not going to

846
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,880
traffic anything because that's the way

847
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,240
you well you can't write you go to jail

848
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,400
you can't write you can't share any

849
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:23,318
information you got to stay able to

850
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:25,800
work um yeah so uh what did what did we

851
00:42:23,318 --> 00:42:29,000
get uh the

852
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:34,519
G13 uh and one of the afghanis because

853
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:39,199

00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:53,558
breeder now um and they changed all the

858
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:56,759
names and stuff uh yeah and uh that's

859
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:58,440
when I smoked the the uh Haze for the

860
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:02,400

862
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:11,240
I love Hayes it's the absolute best um

863
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:13,800
yeah but over there God and it was

864
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:16,558
really interesting the castle because

865
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:20,200

u well what he he he he made a lot of

871
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:38,000
money dealing hash and that's when he

872
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,358
got into the breeding because he knew

873
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,358
how to breed canaries he learned all

874
00:43:40,358 --> 00:43:46,279
about breeding in Australia when he and

875

00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:01,598
goes and buys

880
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:04,679
uh right on the wall river right on it

881
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:07,318
uh this great big old house and they

882
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:09,799
used to call it the the big the big

883
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:11,000
house by the dyke that's right across

884
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,359
the river from

885
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:17,199
Nan and then

886
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:23,159
uh and then because and the house was

887
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:25,318
from about 1820s 18 yeah 1810 1820 so

888
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:28,838
all those old houses have a big stable

889
00:44:25,318 --> 00:44:31,599
down below the the um the basement is

890
00:44:28,838 --> 00:44:35,358
usually a stable for the the horses to

891
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:36,920
stay so what he did is he made in the

892
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:40,039
different Stables he made different

893
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:43,119
breeding rooms and then he got a

894
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:45,838
jackhammer and and made uh ditches

895
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:49,760
everywhere in the floor jack hammered up

896
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:52,960
the the concrete so he made a a maze of

897
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:57,040
of ditches and then a a low place so he

898
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:59,240
put a sump pump so he would uh and then

899
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:02,679
then he then he got the the rock wool

900
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:05,719
the the slabs cut them into short pieces

901
00:45:02,679 --> 00:45:08,118
and then got a Camile he cover them with

902
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:10,799
plastic so it would have these little

903
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:16,440
pots like this this you know this this

904
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:18,160
high of Gro down uh rock wool and then

905
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,679
that way he could move his plants all

906
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:23,358
over the place but it was very very

907
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:26,358
efficient real simple you know very

908
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:29,880
quite quite Dutch yeah but actually

909
00:45:26,358 --> 00:45:32,838
Neville's from from Australia he left

910
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:35,800
Australia because he had

911
00:45:32,838 --> 00:45:39,960
a he had a a legal

912
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:43,640
problem legal problems seem like we all

913
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:46,039
get legal problems sometimes um yeah but

914
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:47,480
I spent T tons of time with him and that

915
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:51,159
was a real

916
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:53,679
education um great times great

917
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:55,598
times um we spent a lot of time in

918
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:57,960
Amsterdam back then that was the only

919
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:00,920
place you could go

920
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:03,400
and then I remember I went back to uh

921
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:05,760
went back to High Times there was one of

922

925
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:16,440
that he said that Neville wouldn't talk

926
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:20,519
to anybody but him I thought well this

927

00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:54,160
uh yeah that was God a real education up

979
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,599
there that's when everybody was growing

980
00:48:54,159 --> 00:49:00,000
up there that was when

981
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,039
uh was that the ' 90s I don't know it

982
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,079
all Blends together after a

983
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:07,880
while

984
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:10,519
um yeah I spent yeah but anyway we we

985
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:15,119
High Times wanted to do a video and so

986
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:19,679
we shot the first video up there uh

987
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:22,200
forant uh ultimate grow here we go I got

988
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:25,239
him right

989
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:29,239
here there was three of them look at

990
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:30,798
this one that's your photo from your

991
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:34,159
that's the book

992
00:49:30,798 --> 00:49:38,199
yeah but I did ultimately I did three

993
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:40,000
videos with High Times oh wow and yeah

994
00:49:38,199 --> 00:49:42,879
yeah but these were the only and and

995
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,838
then they pirated these all over

996
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:50,680
YouTube um and that was really a good

997
00:49:46,838 --> 00:49:52,440
deal because that's got me out or my

998
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:55,598
name out all over the

999
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:59,159
world um yeah but the the reason I I

1000
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:00,519
came up with that this guys was so I

1001
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:03,598
could shoot this

1002
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:06,719
video and people wouldn't see my

1003
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:10,160
face uh CU like I say it was still

1004
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:12,879
pretty spooky spooky times back then but

1005
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:17,558
Canada everything was wide open you know

1006
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:20,599
so that was um you quite quite different

1007
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:23,280
but yeah up there you know I I met met

1008
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:28,000
the went over and hung out one night at

1009
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:30,839
the Hells Angels hell angels

1010
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,318
Clubhouse yeah that was that was kind of

1011
00:50:30,838 --> 00:50:39,599
a trip and U the angels are real big up

1012
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:45,079
there and then um yeah did oh lots of

1013
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:48,760
stuff lots of stuff um I guess it's so

1014
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:51,240
long it it's not

1015
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:53,880
incriminating but anyway there just some

1016
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:56,159
stuff I just well I think you should

1017
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,960
tell the stor incriminating cuz I

1018
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:59,480
promise you that law enforcement doesn't

1019
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:03,159
care

1020
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:07,519
anymore they don't well that's that's

1021
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:10,159
good um now I'm trying not well now I

1022
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:11,400

1040
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,119
the cop came by to ask me if I was

1041
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,599
okay and that was that was pretty close

1042
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:12,358
how much how much do you think you had

1043
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:16,599
with you no I forgot about growing

1044
00:52:12,358 --> 00:52:20,000
another time when I was growing in in um

1045
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:23,400
when you in Santa Barbara up sanro

1046
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,400
Canyon um it's just south of Santa

1047
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,119
Barbara in

1048
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:32,000
monito um

1049
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:36,318
what had happened I I had a a cestine

1050
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,679
garden up there and was growing it was

1051
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:40,558
pretty good size I had a pump and

1052
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:43,399
everything I had to go up there early in

1053
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:46,680
the day and and

1054
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:49,838
uh pump water and stuff it because

1055
00:52:46,679 --> 00:52:51,679
nobody no nobody should be able to hear

1056
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:54,000
you know you don't want a punk going off

1057
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:56,759
in the out in the middle of

1058
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,559
nowhere and one time somebody the the

1059
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:02,359
forest service they'd lost somebody got

1060
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:04,760
lost up there and they were they were

1061
00:53:02,358 --> 00:53:06,679
reporting them and they thought I was

1062
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:10,000
the Lost

1063
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:13,719
guy yeah so I was coming back down I had

1064
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,880
a bunch of dope on me right so I'm I'm

1065
00:53:13,719 --> 00:53:18,159
I'm coming back down this Trail I think

1066
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:21,039
everything's cool and the next thing I

1067
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:23,920
know this this damn helicopter over me

1068
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:25,519
and they were following me and stuff so

1069
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,400
you know I mean I could see I could see

1070
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:31,039
a guy look at me

1071
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:31,039
I thought dang that's not

1072
00:53:32,199 --> 00:53:37,598
good probably know you know I mean cuz

1073
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:41,480
it's easy you know everybody's paranoid

1074
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:43,720
so uh or I was paranoid and anyway what

1075
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:47,798
happened was

1076
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:50,480
um I had I I I hid I went and hid under

1077
00:53:47,798 --> 00:53:53,358
a oh there was a big rock and I went and

1078
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:57,000
hid and I H all my dope and everything

1079
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:59,960
and stuff and then uh

1080
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,119
and then I come down and then I walk

1081
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:04,400
down and I meet these guys from the

1082
00:54:02,119 --> 00:54:07,000
forest service and I think okay well

1083
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:11,318
this is it you know I mean I

1084
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:13,960
better better be real casual here and um

1085
00:54:11,318 --> 00:54:17,079
they asked me if I'd seen anybody if I'd

1086
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:18,358
seen anybody else up there because and

1087
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:21,400
and that's when I figured out they were

1088
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:23,519
looking for somebody else not me and

1089
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,880
that was that was spooky though because

1090
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:27,039
I didn't know any different but they

1091
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,358
were going to go near your garden

1092
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:30,838
that's like like while they're looking

1093
00:54:29,358 --> 00:54:32,679
for this guy they could have stumbled

1094
00:54:30,838 --> 00:54:34,400
across where you were growing yeah it

1095
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:35,719
would have been hard it would have been

1096
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,639
yeah that's true it would have taken

1097
00:54:35,719 --> 00:54:40,159
some effort yeah it would have taken

1098
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:41,798
some effort yeah no I had several layers

1099
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:45,679
of security for

1100
00:54:41,798 --> 00:54:47,400
sure um yeah yeah several layers but

1101
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:50,159
anyway that that worked really well and

1102
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:52,039
that that actually the second crop was

1103
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:55,199
the second crop I pulled out of there

1104
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:59,960
was great because because that's when

1105
00:54:55,199 --> 00:55:01,919
the price went from $500 a pound to 12

1106
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:05,599
to $1,200 a

1107
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:07,400
pound and um yeah from one year to the

1108
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:10,680
next you know that's more than double

1109
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:13,440
right two and a half times as much so oh

1110
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:17,759
so I you know what year that was huh do

1111
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,760
you know what year that was

1112
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:27,798
708 78 79 79 what sort of what sort of

1113
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:32,838
layers of security were you using

1114
00:55:27,798 --> 00:55:35,000
uh one of the things I do is is uh it's

1115
00:55:32,838 --> 00:55:37,639
always you put uh duct tape on the

1116
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,838
bottom of your shoes so they can't match

1117
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:43,199
you with the shoes they can't match you

1118
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:45,119
with the footprints and they can't say

1119
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:46,719
it with you and you have to take it off

1120
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:50,480
every time so you got to have that duct

1121
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:53,679
tape on you which is kind of a it's a

1122
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:57,480
little iffy that and then

1123
00:55:53,679 --> 00:56:00,000
uh another thing is a would take the

1124
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:02,400
branches and well first you have to find

1125
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,440
a sunny location and then you have to

1126
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:08,039
find a place where you can pull the

1127
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:10,200
branches over the Cannabis so it doesn't

1128
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:15,920
look like there's a square cut out of

1129
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:19,558
the out of the brush there and um yeah

1130
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:22,680
that's and and and so you have to plant

1131
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:25,599
plant plants in several different places

1132
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:28,199
and in order to water it might take you

1133
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:31,039
know one 20 minutes to water just

1134
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:35,199
because you have to walk several

1135
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:37,559
places yeah so uh but that that was the

1136
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:39,558
security I tried setting up a camera

1137
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:43,760
they didn't have anything decent back

1138
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:46,960
then it would have been crazy and then I

1139
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:50,280
don't know you could only you'd had to

1140
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:51,679
develop the film uh but those those were

1141
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,960
the main things and then the other

1142
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:57,279
security thing was was doing doing

1143
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,639
everything I would have to go up there I

1144
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:02,880
had to I had to haul up their you know

1145
00:56:59,639 --> 00:57:07,519
uh PVC pipe you know cut it in 10t

1146
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:07,519
sections and you know you look pretty

1147
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:16,319
conspicuous with white pipes yeah and uh

1148
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:19,240
hose a pump a pump that was that was

1149
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:21,599
that was Heavy uh were you like pulling

1150
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:23,358
water from a a like a a nearby stream or

1151
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:28,200
something yeah there was a creek there

1152
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:30,719
was a Sedro Creek and fortunately it ran

1153
00:57:28,199 --> 00:57:32,919
it runs all year I don't know if it does

1154
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:37,919
still but it did back

1155
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:40,200
then yeah but anyway that's that's uh

1156
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,838
time passed time passed I think people

1157
00:57:40,199 --> 00:57:45,239
just don't don't

1158
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:49,400
realize how difficult things were back

1159
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:53,078
then um yeah and then where what what

1160
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:55,880
did we do what did I do next let me see

1161
00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:57,720
here well one one thing I can say while

1162
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:00,519
you looking for the next phase in your

1163
00:57:57,719 --> 00:58:02,798
life was I thought it was really funny

1164
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:05,199
that you said that you were really

1165
00:58:02,798 --> 00:58:09,679
paranoid and and you know something that

1166
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:11,399
I wanted to bring up is that paranoia is

1167
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:13,118
something that people always said yeah

1168
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:16,880
when

1169
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:20,160
I but I wonder if that's just because of

1170
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:21,798
the illegality of it right like people

1171
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:24,239
don't don't get paranoid when they're

1172
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:27,599
drinking a beer you know because it's

1173
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:29,479
not illegal you know so like 18 or 17

1174
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,640
and drinking a beer at a party and the

1175
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:34,880
cops show

1176
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:36,480
up right yeah yeah there there you go

1177
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,640
you know I don't think I I don't think

1178
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:41,719
weed makes you paranoid I think the

1179
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:43,239
illegality of it makes you paranoid well

1180
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:45,558
I don't know I'd argue that there's

1181
00:58:43,239 --> 00:58:46,598
social aspects to it too you know like

1182
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:47,798
there's been times where you know

1183
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:49,000
hanging out with friends get super

1184
00:58:47,798 --> 00:58:50,079
stoned and you're like oh my God like

1185
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,679
are they talking show you like what the

1186
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:54,119
hell they talking about like you start

1187
00:58:51,679 --> 00:58:55,118
spiraling out and yeah but I think I

1188
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:57,358
think you think that when you're

1189
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:59,440
straight I think you are you know what

1190
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:00,880
the deal is you're actually paranoid and

1191
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:03,960
it has nothing to do with the

1192
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:08,160
[Laughter]

1193
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:08,159
weed for like 20 years so you

1194
00:59:08,838 --> 00:59:14,318
know light of hallucinations and stuff

1195
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:17,280
you could it may have something to do

1196
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:19,318
with I so I remember one time uh well

1197
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:22,440
like for example those Dutch guys for

1198
00:59:19,318 --> 00:59:25,279
example they they never get paranoid

1199
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:27,200
they never get paranoid uh when they're

1200
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,359
growing when they're around it and stuff

1201
00:59:27,199 --> 00:59:34,000
because it doesn't have the same

1202
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:35,519
penalties that that it does in or didn't

1203
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,519
that had in

1204
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:39,559
America uh but nobody that I knew ever

1205
00:59:38,519 --> 00:59:42,358
got

1206
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:46,240
paranoid and then one time though I have

1207
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:49,639
to say uh who was it Allen Allan

1208
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:53,598
dronkers uh Ben son you know from ceny

1209
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:56,558
seeds um he said yeah I've heard about

1210
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:58,838
this paranoia and stuff and he says it

1211
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:01,920
almost happened to me one time I felt a

1212
00:59:58,838 --> 01:00:04,599
little bit and then

1213
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:07,559
um and then he said he goes I just smoke

1214
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:07,559
another joint and went

1215
01:00:09,079 --> 01:00:14,000
away next time Cosmic take that advice

1216
01:00:11,719 --> 01:00:16,199
if you get paranoid just smoke another

1217
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:19,440
joint actually you

1218
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:21,399
know the the thing is that in Slovenia

1219
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,838
for example now it's still illegal the

1220
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:26,720
the the Cannabis right but it's so much

1221
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:30,519
used now in it's so it's so much is is

1222
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:33,519
more I I said in one podcast uh that

1223
01:00:30,519 --> 01:00:36,239
it's the most tolerant country to

1224
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:38,759
Canabis in the world maybe right now you

1225
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:40,798
know because it's it's been yeah it's

1226
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:43,319
been used also for not only for

1227
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:45,159
recreational but also for medical well

1228
01:00:43,318 --> 01:00:47,719
people make this Rick Simpson Oil for

1229
01:00:45,159 --> 01:00:49,960
many years now you know so it doesn't

1230
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:52,439
matter what kind of perspective on life

1231
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:56,000
you have when you have a garden which

1232
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:57,920
many people do they grow Canabis and May

1233
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,798
they never smoked a joint you know but

1234
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,280
they grow it and they make oils from

1235
01:00:59,798 --> 01:01:04,798
that you know and you know it's like a

1236
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:07,000
movement it's like a big big part of it

1237
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:10,159
it's also why it will be legalized maybe

1238
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:13,480
soon maybe also because us will maybe go

1239
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:16,118
Federal maybe Germany now because it

1240
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:19,440
started to legalize or decriminalize it

1241
01:01:16,119 --> 01:01:21,519
you know so it's but you you hit the the

1242
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:25,440
point when you said that the Dutch guys

1243
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:29,239
never get so uh paranoid we because the

1244
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:32,679
penalty in Europe for this was not big

1245
01:01:29,239 --> 01:01:36,000
you don't go to jail uh just growing few

1246
01:01:32,679 --> 01:01:37,318
plants you know it's yeah it's never

1247
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,559
going to happen you know it's like no

1248
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:43,159
way you know it would be it would be but

1249
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:46,240
that's how actually my theory is that

1250
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:50,038
Canabis craft Canabis breeding uh is

1251
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:52,798
much more in USA uh developed because of

1252
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:55,920
you you did not have this access we

1253
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:57,880
could get seeds from Holland very very

1254
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,680
very easily you know because we're in

1255
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:03,200
Europe but you had this border you know

1256
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:06,239
between us and Europe had this really

1257
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:08,399
you know daa searched all the you know

1258
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:11,038
they they had a system I

1259
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:13,440
mean it's a very very very different

1260
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:16,359
perspective you know but we still have

1261
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:19,000
illegal illegal a lot of illegality you

1262
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:21,719
know many states are still illegal in

1263
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,599
and many countries in Europe are illegal

1264
01:02:21,719 --> 01:02:27,719
like I know uh you live in Spain right

1265
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:30,400
or can you tell a little bit how you

1266
01:02:27,719 --> 01:02:32,118
decided to to to move to Spain or when

1267
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:35,400
you know maybe if I'm not jumping too

1268
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:39,119
far you know um

1269
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:43,880
no just excuse

1270
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:46,400
me I want oh let's see um yeah I I I

1271
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:49,079
spent a year here when I was uh in in

1272
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:52,798
University I went to University in

1273
01:02:49,079 --> 01:02:56,680
Valencia and um uh which is the third

1274
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:59,278
largest city in in Spain so on the

1275
01:02:56,679 --> 01:03:04,440
Mediterranean and that was that was in

1276
01:02:59,278 --> 01:03:07,639
the early 70s and so I would uh uh I had

1277
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:10,838
more freedom here than I did in my own

1278
01:03:07,639 --> 01:03:13,519
Hometown um and it's always that always

1279
01:03:10,838 --> 01:03:17,519
stuck with me and when I moved here I've

1280
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:21,960
been here about 25 well yeah 25 years

1281
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:24,000
I've been here 25 years so back then uh

1282
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:29,440
California was the only place that was

1283
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:31,838
legal 98 right so um or 96 96 I can't

1284
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:33,400
remember anyway

1285
01:03:31,838 --> 01:03:37,278
um

1286
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:41,079
uh yeah here here

1287
01:03:37,278 --> 01:03:43,239
it's it's tolerated it it's tolerated

1288
01:03:41,079 --> 01:03:45,519
it's kind of like a little overwhelming

1289
01:03:43,239 --> 01:03:48,639
a lot of people moved here from all over

1290
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:52,440
Europe to start growing uh which is kind

1291
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:55,239
of a problem uh because the albanians

1292
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:58,440
are here that's a big problem because

1293
01:03:55,239 --> 01:04:01,318
they have like a pretty those guys are

1294
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:04,200
the roughest Mafia there is in the world

1295
01:04:01,318 --> 01:04:06,358
um I'm convinced but um yeah because I

1296
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:09,519

there there was another one these guys

1365
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:29,160
where in the heck were they from from

1366
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:32,799
Central Europe somewhere I never went

1367
01:07:29,159 --> 01:07:36,239
over there but they had like you know

1368
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:37,838
20,000 members because you have to sign

1369
01:07:36,239 --> 01:07:39,199
up and you know you're only supposed to

1370
01:07:37,838 --> 01:07:40,719
have like

1371
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:45,239
150

1372
01:07:40,719 --> 01:07:47,719
uh yeah so like 20,000 members and they

1373
01:07:45,239 --> 01:07:51,519
were they were moving some real poundage

1374
01:07:47,719 --> 01:07:54,399
out of there I mean some serious kilos

1375
01:07:51,519 --> 01:07:58,119
and um tourists everybody they have

1376
01:07:54,400 --> 01:08:00,838
people people would go to tourist areas

1377
01:07:58,119 --> 01:08:03,838
and recruit recruit tourists to go over

1378
01:08:00,838 --> 01:08:07,199
there um yeah that it was pretty wild

1379
01:08:03,838 --> 01:08:10,880
for a while um and that's when spannabis

1380
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:14,159
had started or well spannabis was going

1381
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:18,039
pretty good been going about 10 years 10

1382
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:21,479
12 years and somebody got the great idea

1383
01:08:18,039 --> 01:08:23,920
to you know because when um all all of

1384
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:28,639
the civs came out for separating making

1385
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:28,640
the ice hash uh they would

1386
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:35,559
uh at spanis you could go in there you

1387
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:38,640
could take in like 10 pounds of dope in

1388
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:41,759
the front door give it to some give it

1389
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:44,359
to these guys that wanted the the stands

1390
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:47,119
they would separate it they'd run the

1391
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:50,440
tumbler all night or had a bunch of it

1392
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:52,479
separate and and they would take 25% for

1393
01:08:50,439 --> 01:08:56,439
doing that and then they would give you

1394
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:58,959
just a chunk of hash back

1395
01:08:56,439 --> 01:09:01,238
and that that lasted that lasted one

1396
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:03,880
year and then

1397
01:09:01,238 --> 01:09:06,358
they that

1398
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:09,000
anymore but yeah here spannabis used to

1399
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:12,359
be the the biggest

1400
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:15,479
uh the biggest Trade Fair in in uh the

1401
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:17,798
world and then Las Vegas took it over

1402
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:20,119
now it's now it's uh

1403
01:09:17,798 --> 01:09:22,960
Germany uh but like I say it's uh

1404
01:09:20,119 --> 01:09:25,679
cannabis is tolerated here uh we've had

1405
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:28,838
a we've got a very old hash called

1406
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:31,000
culture um Morocco is just right across

1407
01:09:28,838 --> 01:09:34,399
the the straight of

1408
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:38,560
jalter so um yeah and I remember when I

1409
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:41,559
first got here that actually it was uh

1410
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:45,560
they have um well they sell several you

1411
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:47,839
know lots of different grades Ash but uh

1412

katama you know katama is just right

1413
01:09:47,838 --> 01:09:54,600
over there in in the Riff mountains of

1414
01:09:51,238 --> 01:10:00,238
Morocco um but they have you know they

1415
01:09:54,600 --> 01:10:03,280

01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:05,678
plates plas they call

1417
01:10:03,279 --> 01:10:08,679
plas and then they will Al and they will

1418
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:11,640
put a stamp on it and the double zero

1419
01:10:08,679 --> 01:10:14,158
double zero stamp which usually is the

1420
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:16,760
highest grade in general and you can go

1421
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:19,359
in like in in November oh that's the

1422
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:22,760
best month because they have uh the

1423
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:26,799
cream you can get yeah yeah I see I see

1424

1426
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,560
a lot and to Barcelona I go every year

1427
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:36,640
you know I have a lot of friends in

1428
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:39,159
Spain a lot you know so I really know

1429
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:41,880
what you're talking about you know you

1430
01:10:39,158 --> 01:10:43,879
know years ago I took bubble BS with me

1431
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:45,760
to Spain you know because we used to

1432
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:47,880
make hash for that you know the bubble

1433
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:50,840
hash this was in 2005 or something you

1434
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:53,199
know or four you know and uh these

1435
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:54,960
andalusians you know uh they were

1436
01:10:53,198 --> 01:10:56,799
showing me their inner Gardens you know

1437
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,880
in the houses because all of them were

1438
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:01,719
grow weed growers indoor outdoor

1439
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:04,800
everything you know so there was a lot

1440
01:11:01,719 --> 01:11:07,640
of cannabis but still they told me that

1441
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:09,440
there is so much hash but just flour is

1442
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:11,840
just in the season when they had a

1443
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:14,158
little bit of flour you know more or

1444
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:16,880
less it was all hash culture in the

1445
01:11:14,158 --> 01:11:21,799
third or fourth generation already right

1446
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:23,880
yeah exactly exactly no for for Trans to

1447
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:27,600
make the transition from hash to

1448
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:29,719
cannabis that took about 10 years uh

1449
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:32,360
because now cannabis is more more

1450
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:34,760
popular than hash here but it took a

1451
01:11:32,359 --> 01:11:37,880
long time because you know you could go

1452
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:40,199
get your your beot they call them they

1453
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:41,039
call 10 grams 10 grams they usually call

1454
01:11:40,198 --> 01:11:45,000
it an

1455
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:49,238

hang on a on a bar and and

1481
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:19,560
like down okay I think you've officially

1482
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:22,800

1483
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:25,239
show can you can you describe the what

1484
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:27,920
you were talking about the crema or uh

1485
01:13:25,238 --> 01:13:29,678
if you if you make it too the cream

1486
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:32,119
cream the cream the stuff that was like

1487
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:35,440
the the really nice stuff they call it

1488
01:13:32,119 --> 01:13:40,198
butter it's uh that's like the blonde

1489
01:13:35,439 --> 01:13:43,319
[ __ ] yeah not so not so um uh but it's

1490
01:13:40,198 --> 01:13:46,799
soft and pliable because it's it's it's

1491
01:13:43,319 --> 01:13:48,639
new it's new and you you don't but you

1492
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:51,760
you only get it right then because

1493
01:13:48,639 --> 01:13:54,400
otherwise it gets oxidized and stuff but

1494
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:55,920
this is more of a blonde color and it's

1495
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:59,879
pliable

1496
01:13:55,920 --> 01:14:01,800
it's pliable like that and uh a little

1497
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:04,319
bit it's not like you know a lot of

1498
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:08,679
times you figure the hash will be hard

1499
01:14:04,319 --> 01:14:08,679
like your phone you know

1500
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:14,800
um yeah and then it's got a

1501
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:16,480
consistency you use a knife to cut it

1502
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:20,560
always a hot

1503
01:14:16,479 --> 01:14:24,198
knife and um yeah it's

1504
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:26,400
uh it's it can be sticky it depends on

1505
01:14:24,198 --> 01:14:32,039
the quality as as far as the stickiness

1506
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:36,039
goes um and if you're lucky it won't it

1507
01:14:32,039 --> 01:14:39,039
won't have too much like U camel [ __ ]

1508
01:14:36,039 --> 01:14:41,880
smell because camel [ __ ] because they

1509
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:44,198
made the camels eat it too no I don't

1510
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:46,800
know about I don't think they'd waste it

1511
01:14:44,198 --> 01:14:50,319
like that I wouldn't

1512
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:52,560
uh I wouldn't give a camel my

1513
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:54,479
do what was I don't know I think I'd

1514
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:57,000
rather a camel do the smuggling for me

1515
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:57,000

01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:22,840
it yeah right yeah uh like you said

1584

1585
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:27,639
I was just was too Danger it uh like

1586
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,800
marketed how did you get it the in like

1587
01:18:27,639 --> 01:18:31,920
the word out that you had this book at

1588
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:35,520
that time with no one uh wanting to

1589
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:39,039
carry it I got my car drove around all

1590
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:41,280
the head shops and would sell them and

1591
01:18:39,039 --> 01:18:43,719
then I most usually had to leave them on

1592
01:18:41,279 --> 01:18:44,599
consignment because nobody believed that

1593
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:47,399
it would

1594
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:51,920
sell and because they didn't know what

1595
01:18:47,399 --> 01:18:55,039
the hell was going on and um yeah that's

1596
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:59,920
what I did and then so it took and then

1597
01:18:55,039 --> 01:19:02,039
also I had uh uh two Distributors on the

1598

1602
01:19:13,319 --> 01:19:19,519
last gasp of San Francisco Ron Turner

1603
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:22,440

1604
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:26,480
distribute to head shops and some

1605
01:19:22,439 --> 01:19:28,519

out after a while I mean people needed

1615
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:02,399
the needed the

1616
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:05,319
information how much of that information

1617
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:07,799
do you think is transferable to today's

1618
01:20:05,319 --> 01:20:07,799
growing

1619
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:14,800
culture except for the

1620
01:20:11,479 --> 01:20:17,759
life pretty much all of it I mean you

1621
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:21,480
know I mean PL plants been growing the

1622
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:23,280
same for the last you know um

1623
01:20:21,479 --> 01:20:26,198
Millennia

1624
01:20:23,279 --> 01:20:29,679
um some stuff doesn't change gravity is

1625
01:20:26,198 --> 01:20:31,960
still the same as it used to be you know

1626
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:35,239
but there's more more precise

1627
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:38,800
information now there's more specific

1628
01:20:35,238 --> 01:20:41,359
information on nutrients nutrients were

1629
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:43,800
the big thing everybody you know they've

1630
01:20:41,359 --> 01:20:46,439
got the best nutrients blah blah blah

1631
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:50,639
well that's where all the money was you

1632
01:20:46,439 --> 01:20:54,799
know it it it costs about a nickel or 5

1633
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:58,960
cents to to make a a gallon of fertili

1634
01:20:54,800 --> 01:21:04,279
izer that you can sell for $30 or $40 or

1635
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:04,279
more so that's a pretty good markup and

1636
01:21:04,479 --> 01:21:11,879
that's yeah and it's a consumable right

1637
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:13,279
yeah so Phil from kic when I told him

1638
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:16,079
you were going to join the show he said

1639
01:21:13,279 --> 01:21:17,800
oh that's exciting ask him for me if he

1640
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:21,119
could make a single revision to his

1641
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:23,159
famous nutrient chart what would it be

1642
01:21:21,119 --> 01:21:25,319
and I just think it's funny that you

1643
01:21:23,158 --> 01:21:26,679
know we asked the question and you said

1644
01:21:25,319 --> 01:21:29,279
that that's what had changed was

1645
01:21:26,679 --> 01:21:32,560
nutrients but uh would you make a

1646
01:21:29,279 --> 01:21:35,960
revision to your chart you mean the the

1647
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:39,880
um the excesses and deficiencies it

1648
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:43,639
could be um could be these here this is

1649
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:46,199
the older book and then I made a newer

1650
01:21:43,639 --> 01:21:50,039
one in the

1651
01:21:46,198 --> 01:21:50,039
encyclopedia which is

1652
01:21:51,079 --> 01:21:55,679
uh which is

1653
01:21:53,359 --> 01:21:59,639
here uh

1654
01:21:55,679 --> 01:22:02,480
and there's a series of drawings like

1655
01:21:59,639 --> 01:22:04,400
this right yeah I think he could be

1656
01:22:02,479 --> 01:22:05,919
referring to these the

1657
01:22:04,399 --> 01:22:09,279
new

1658
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:11,199
um I would I would just tighten them up

1659
01:22:09,279 --> 01:22:12,840
a little bit there's more information

1660
01:22:11,198 --> 01:22:16,559
I'd interview more

1661
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:20,079
people and but everything's correct this

1662
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:21,760
is all know funny those nutrient photos

1663
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:24,960
the the the photos that show

1664
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:28,520
deficiencies that was all we had as cul

1665
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:30,158
cators you know like back in the day you

1666
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:33,520
know when you couldn't talk to people

1667
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:33,519
about this there was no

1668
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:38,079
internet and with that book you know

1669
01:22:36,439 --> 01:22:40,000
we'd look at our plant and be like is

1670
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:41,279
that nitrogen deficiency or is it

1671
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,479
Calcium

1672
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:47,599
deficiency

1673
01:22:43,479 --> 01:22:49,439
and yeah like I said so many Growers

1674
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,880
would love to just chime in right now

1675
01:22:49,439 --> 01:22:53,319
and say thank you for that book it was

1676
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:57,920
just amazing and if you came out with a

1677
01:22:53,319 --> 01:22:59,719
new book we had a it just you know I I

1678
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:04,319
purchased every addition that you put

1679
01:22:59,719 --> 01:23:06,760
out during my growing growing career so

1680
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:10,119
yeah yeah there a lot of people have

1681
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:12,920
because just is the only place you could

1682
01:23:10,119 --> 01:23:16,238
find the information can I be so bold as

1683
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:19,600
to make a suggestion for your next book

1684
01:23:16,238 --> 01:23:21,439
sure so something that I learned you

1685
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:24,840
know I don't

1686
01:23:21,439 --> 01:23:27,319
know 5 10 years ago should have been a

1687
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:30,079
lot longer is because we've always been

1688
01:23:27,319 --> 01:23:33,599
using your book and those diagrams to

1689
01:23:30,079 --> 01:23:37,880
tell us what the nutrient

1690
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:40,560
defici what it doesn't address is what a

1691
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:43,520
combination of nutrient deficiencies

1692
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:45,880
would look like and so really hard

1693
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:49,840
that's really hard because right but the

1694
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:53,679
point is is that people too often look

1695
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:55,480
at the book and they say oh this is what

1696
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:57,560
it is

1697
01:23:55,479 --> 01:24:00,279
but now you can send Leafs out for

1698
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:01,560
analysis and the leaf analysis is going

1699
01:24:00,279 --> 01:24:03,238
to show you something very different

1700
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:06,280
than that book is going to show

1701
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:08,119
you oh yeah well because you've got

1702
01:24:06,279 --> 01:24:11,000
you've got a combination of different

1703
01:24:08,119 --> 01:24:13,559
nutrients right uh what you can what I

1704
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:16,600
can do here if you you know you read the

1705
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:19,239
text it's a lot of times this is

1706
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:21,360
confused uh calcium for example I'm

1707
01:24:19,238 --> 01:24:25,158
looking at that that entry now it's

1708
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:26,719
confused with lots of things so that's

1709
01:24:25,158 --> 01:24:29,198
that's quite important what it's

1710
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:31,880
confused with root disease excess

1711
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:35,678
nitrogen ammonium magnesium potassium

1712
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:39,880
there's not enough pages in a book to

1713
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:41,359
show pictures of all possible Comm no I

1714
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:44,118
I don't think you could I just want

1715
01:24:41,359 --> 01:24:47,039
people to know that like for instance

1716
01:24:44,118 --> 01:24:49,118
let's say you have nitrogen and Calcium

1717
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:53,118
deficiency okay because they're both

1718
01:24:49,118 --> 01:24:56,039
confused you could actually have both

1719
01:24:53,118 --> 01:24:57,519
defici when add calcium unless it's

1720
01:24:56,039 --> 01:24:59,079
calcium nitrate maybe that would solve

1721
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:02,440
the problem because you'd be giving it

1722
01:24:59,079 --> 01:25:05,118
calcium and and nitrogen um you know you

1723
01:25:02,439 --> 01:25:07,158
may not be addressing the problem so

1724
01:25:05,118 --> 01:25:09,759
particularly on a commercial scale when

1725
01:25:07,158 --> 01:25:11,158
the farmers can afford to do it I always

1726
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:15,159
tell people that they should be doing

1727
01:25:11,158 --> 01:25:17,319
Leaf analysis their entire crop at least

1728
01:25:15,158 --> 01:25:20,439
at least the first couple of times so

1729
01:25:17,319 --> 01:25:22,519
that they can figure out what's going on

1730
01:25:20,439 --> 01:25:24,799
and you know there's a lot of arrogance

1731
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:27,679
in Growers and they look at it and go oh

1732
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:30,000
that's a calcium

1733
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:33,000
deficient but that

1734
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,920
arrogance it slows them down and like I

1735
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,359
said luckily now we have testing we have

1736
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:39,960
tools available that we didn't

1737
01:25:37,359 --> 01:25:43,439
have that's right actually in America

1738
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:46,198
they don't test that much uh for uh

1739
01:25:43,439 --> 01:25:48,839
genetics is what I think uh they could

1740
01:25:46,198 --> 01:25:53,118
be testing a lot more uh when you talk

1741
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:56,239
about arog um and Growers or breeders

1742
01:25:53,118 --> 01:25:58,759
quote unquote does tell you that uh

1743
01:25:56,238 --> 01:26:01,118
before it goes into be before it goes

1744
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:04,600
into each one of the explanations of of

1745
01:26:01,118 --> 01:26:07,399
each one of the nutrients that 99% of

1746
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:09,440
the times these happen together these

1747
01:26:07,399 --> 01:26:11,319
nutrient I guess I haven't read the book

1748
01:26:09,439 --> 01:26:12,519
in long enough or I don't have the most

1749
01:26:11,319 --> 01:26:14,799
latest

1750
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:18,000
copy you know I could see the future of

1751
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:19,880
this too um utilizing AI um AI is being

1752
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,279
utiliz in a lot of medical testing you

1753
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:23,960
know for uh cancer screening especially

1754
01:26:22,279 --> 01:26:27,158
but um potentially someone could create

1755
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:29,279
an where utilize the phone's camera take

1756
01:26:27,158 --> 01:26:32,118
a picture of the leaf and then it can

1757
01:26:29,279 --> 01:26:34,079
analyze it using AI to you know say this

1758
01:26:32,118 --> 01:26:36,639
is the possible causes of whatever

1759
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:39,679
you're seeing on your Leaf you know

1760
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:44,359
Apple already has that on my Apple

1761
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:47,079
watch or I mean my Apple uh computer

1762
01:26:44,359 --> 01:26:50,198
let's see I'll find a plant picture but

1763
01:26:47,079 --> 01:26:52,559
it does it it'll identify plants the

1764
01:26:50,198 --> 01:26:55,439
thing is it needs the data first to

1765
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:58,719
input that thing I did is i' I've been

1766
01:26:55,439 --> 01:27:01,719
making books you know all kinds of books

1767
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:06,600
I got uh well 11 languages I had the

1768
01:27:01,719 --> 01:27:09,880
first good Dutch Marana benon is here I

1769
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:11,400
had the first one Marana benon first a

1770
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:16,600
good

1771
01:27:11,399 --> 01:27:18,519
uh yeah n van shik did a lot I did a lot

1772
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:20,840
of straight books

1773
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:24,520
vegetables

1774
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:28,239
Hydroponics um oh yeah here's another

1775
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:32,199
one the the the Hell's Angels you know

1776
01:27:28,238 --> 01:27:35,599
from um the the the really rough guys

1777
01:27:32,198 --> 01:27:38,399
they're the ones from Laval Laval uh

1778
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:41,320
Canada it's the suburb of

1779
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:43,519
Montreal and they're the generally

1780
01:27:41,319 --> 01:27:45,238
considered the roughest Bunch there is

1781
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:48,320
because they're they're tough guys

1782
01:27:45,238 --> 01:27:52,638
anyway they uh they pirated one of my

1783
01:27:48,319 --> 01:27:54,479
books they PIR the Bible yeah and so I

1784
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:58,480
called them up I got the phone number

1785
01:27:54,479 --> 01:28:01,839
and called him up and um the

1786
01:27:58,479 --> 01:28:03,799
conversation ended like [ __ ] you well

1787
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:07,679
[ __ ] you well [ __ ] you come over here

1788
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:10,679
and say that [ __ ] you and anyway that

1789
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:13,480
was pretty much the end of it I was I

1790
01:28:10,679 --> 01:28:16,359
tried to sue him but uh then you had to

1791
01:28:13,479 --> 01:28:18,839
collect the money and the lawyer wants

1792
01:28:16,359 --> 01:28:21,920
to get paid first so I couldn't do

1793
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:24,800
anything so this is this is what I did

1794
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:28,279
this was my my uh

1795
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:30,719
Revenge what I did is I went to China

1796
01:28:28,279 --> 01:28:34,800
and I made the book

1797
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:37,239
uh color full color and what that did is

1798
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:41,600
it made it too expensive for him to

1799
01:28:37,238 --> 01:28:43,559
steal and so I look at it as like yes it

1800
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:47,280
was really a good thing I'm so glad they

1801
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:49,600
took the book I'm very happy um yeah but

1802
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:51,158
I've done a lot of other other ones

1803
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:54,639
German

1804
01:28:51,158 --> 01:28:56,679

German no no it's it's a hard one to

1808
01:29:03,158 --> 01:29:08,079
learn it's a hard one if you don't learn

1809
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:10,080
it from when you're young you know and

1810
01:29:08,079 --> 01:29:15,118

1869
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:58,198
I got uh other friends that are quite

1870
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,479
productive

1871
01:31:58,198 --> 01:32:04,279
there

1872
01:32:00,479 --> 01:32:07,559
yeah yeah gosh so you know I just want

1873
01:32:04,279 --> 01:32:10,359
to make sure we did and you know it was

1874
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:12,199
totally cool but uh we skipped forward a

1875
01:32:10,359 --> 01:32:15,439
little bit and I wanted to find out if

8 um stories around we mentioned Tom

1878
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:23,560
Alexander a little bit but I wanted to

1879
01:32:22,158 --> 01:32:25,439
make sure that you mentioned your time

1880
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:29,119
at Samilia

1881
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:32,799
tips yeah well I mean I wrote for senia

1882
01:32:29,118 --> 01:32:37,079
tips I didn't uh it was Alex's magazine

1883
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:39,880
he started it and it was his 100

1884
01:32:37,079 --> 01:32:42,399
100% And they he was in business about

1885
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:46,000
10 years before uh green Merchant

1886
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:47,638
happened because green Merchants is uh

1887
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:51,399
well that's what shut him down because

1888
01:32:47,639 --> 01:32:54,159
all of his advertisers quit um they were

1889
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:57,158
out of business uh and that's when he

1890
01:32:54,158 --> 01:33:00,479
started uh growing

1891
01:32:57,158 --> 01:33:02,679
Edge yeah yeah growing Edge and that was

1892
01:33:00,479 --> 01:33:04,238
that was uh quite a good magazine when I

1893
01:33:02,679 --> 01:33:06,800
get him on the show it might be a good

1894
01:33:04,238 --> 01:33:08,759
idea to have you on too because then we

1895
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:10,279
got you know two old friends telling

1896
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:12,199
stories I'm sure you guys have a bunch

1897
01:33:10,279 --> 01:33:13,800
of stories together I got one quick

1898
01:33:12,198 --> 01:33:15,319
question before we wrap up and you know

1899
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:17,320
might be a pretty quick answer but I

1900
01:33:15,319 --> 01:33:20,279
mean you've seen the evolution of

1901
01:33:17,319 --> 01:33:22,039
cannabis throughout decades you know and

1902
01:33:20,279 --> 01:33:23,359
I'm sure you you had favorite strains

1903
01:33:22,039 --> 01:33:24,719
you mentioned Hayes as one of your

1904
01:33:23,359 --> 01:33:26,439
favorites

1905
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:28,800
um I guess this is kind of a two-part

1906
01:33:26,439 --> 01:33:31,198
question how does Modern cannabis you

1907
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:32,920
know compare in your opinion to kind of

1908
01:33:31,198 --> 01:33:35,479
what you grew up and what you saw evolve

1909
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:37,199
throughout the years and two you know

1910
01:33:35,479 --> 01:33:41,638
what would you say your favorite modern

1911
01:33:37,198 --> 01:33:45,479
strain is okay yeah modern strength um

1912
01:33:41,639 --> 01:33:48,960
let's see it's uh actually it was really

1913
01:33:45,479 --> 01:33:51,439
quite strong some time ago but I was a

1914
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:52,399
bit spoiled because I've been fortunate

1915
01:33:51,439 --> 01:33:54,279
to be

1916
01:33:52,399 --> 01:33:57,559
around um

1917
01:33:54,279 --> 01:34:01,319
expert Growers all the time

1918
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:03,239
um but it it it has improved it has

1919
01:34:01,319 --> 01:34:06,840
improved there's just much more

1920
01:34:03,238 --> 01:34:09,519
information now a much larger

1921
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:13,199
selection but I have to be honest I

1922
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:16,000
think the Jean Pool is pretty uh pretty

1923
01:34:13,198 --> 01:34:18,319
polluted uh there's not consistent

1924
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,520
breeding plants you know true breeding

1925
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:22,118
plants there's there's not so many of

1926
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:26,239
those

1927
01:34:22,118 --> 01:34:28,238
people that are quote unquote breeders

1928
01:34:26,238 --> 01:34:30,959
are not formally

1929
01:34:28,238 --> 01:34:34,279
educated uh because breeding is usually

1930
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:36,279
about numbers numbers lots of numbers

1931
01:34:34,279 --> 01:34:40,158
you got to be really good with

1932
01:34:36,279 --> 01:34:43,118
math um you know

1933
01:34:40,158 --> 01:34:44,879
uh that that part's

1934
01:34:43,118 --> 01:34:48,479
changed

1935
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:50,679
um the lower end cannabis is gotten tons

1936
01:34:48,479 --> 01:34:52,399
better lots better used to be the

1937
01:34:50,679 --> 01:34:54,600
Mexican dope you get here you know I me

1938
01:34:52,399 --> 01:34:56,359
you'd be lucky to get 8%

1939
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:58,600
or you'd get in America and it would

1940
01:34:56,359 --> 01:35:03,039
smell like

1941
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:05,600
ammonia right right yeah it did yeah

1942
01:35:03,039 --> 01:35:07,479
very well could yeah sometimes sometimes

1943
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:08,679
not but it depends on how wet it was

1944
01:35:07,479 --> 01:35:10,279
when they press yeah they'd press it

1945
01:35:08,679 --> 01:35:13,199
when it was fresh it would

1946
01:35:10,279 --> 01:35:15,279
mold yeah yeah well a lot of times

1947
01:35:13,198 --> 01:35:18,638
that's what they do they use those uh

1948
01:35:15,279 --> 01:35:24,039
those adobe brick

1949
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:28,039
presses jump off yeah

1950
01:35:24,039 --> 01:35:30,198
they do and then modern strs I I like

1951
01:35:28,039 --> 01:35:33,560
old stuff to be honest I mean you know

1952
01:35:30,198 --> 01:35:35,799
there's there's new stuff but and and

1953
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:37,880
and also I got to admit this I don't

1954
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:42,279
have the best palette I don't have the

1955
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:45,520
best uh tast buds uh I can't distinguish

1956
01:35:42,279 --> 01:35:49,319
things so well uh a lot of people say

1957
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:51,760
they do but I know enough about smell to

1958
01:35:49,319 --> 01:35:55,079
know that I am one of the many and

1959
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:59,400
there's very few maybe you

1960
01:35:55,079 --> 01:36:04,359
know the top end is 5% and then of those

1961
01:35:59,399 --> 01:36:06,799
there's 1% of that 5% it's a super taste

1962
01:36:04,359 --> 01:36:09,519
you know so most of the time when you

1963
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:12,920
hear things and people tell you they

1964
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:16,400
they experience stuff uh they're going

1965
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:18,199
on memory a lot of times I can grow CBD

1966
01:36:16,399 --> 01:36:19,719
here in fact I'm going to start that

1967
01:36:18,198 --> 01:36:23,238
pretty soon grow

1968
01:36:19,719 --> 01:36:24,560
CBD um I'll start that in the in the

1969
01:36:23,238 --> 01:36:28,198
base

1970
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:31,719
where I've got uh got a deal going with

1971
01:36:28,198 --> 01:36:33,118
uh AC Infinity AC Infinity theyve got

1972
01:36:31,719 --> 01:36:35,760
all kind well actually they've got

1973
01:36:33,118 --> 01:36:38,639
really cool equipment I'm pretty they do

1974
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:41,360
yeah I like their stuff yeah and it's a

1975
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:43,039
top end and it's also uh everything's

1976
01:36:41,359 --> 01:36:44,799
digitized a lot of people have been

1977
01:36:43,039 --> 01:36:45,960
mentioning to me that they like their

1978
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:49,279
that they like their

1979
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:52,239
gear yeah yeah it's well it's true

1980
01:36:49,279 --> 01:36:55,920
actually they uh I was over there

1981
01:36:52,238 --> 01:36:59,238
hanging out we went on a couple week uh

1982
01:36:55,920 --> 01:37:01,639
yeah twoe trip around the uh Northern

1983
01:36:59,238 --> 01:37:03,718
California we're in

1984
01:37:01,639 --> 01:37:07,560
Garberville uh didn't make it down to

1985
01:37:03,719 --> 01:37:09,480
Willis but down gar Garberville and and

1986
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:12,360
over to the other side of the mountain I

1987
01:37:09,479 --> 01:37:15,599
so you were at the Ridgeline Farms yes

1988
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:18,000
yeah those guys were great yeah great

1989
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:20,639
yeah I'm watching you partner yeah face

1990
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,639
I'm a Facebook

1991
01:37:21,479 --> 01:37:28,158
stalker I actually had one one question

1992
01:37:24,319 --> 01:37:30,359
also before we wrapped up um considering

1993
01:37:28,158 --> 01:37:32,719
as Cosmic said you've seen the evolution

1994
01:37:30,359 --> 01:37:34,559
of of not only uh the different strains

1995
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:37,118
over the years but the evolution of

1996
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:39,080
growing uh in both like a home growing

1997
01:37:37,118 --> 01:37:41,759
and a commercial aspect what do you

1998
01:37:39,079 --> 01:37:44,079
think is like the single biggest

1999
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:46,679
Improvement that you've witnessed take

2000
01:37:44,079 --> 01:37:48,960
place in the cultivation

2001
01:37:46,679 --> 01:37:53,000
space

2002
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:56,000
LEDs LED lights because they made I love

2003
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:58,639
that answer OBS everything else

2004
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:01,520
obsolete uh they had too there's just

2005
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:05,599
too much heat coming out of those uh

2006
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:08,080
allies they're uh sodiums there there

2007
01:38:05,599 --> 01:38:11,159
and there sodiums as well and the

2008
01:38:08,079 --> 01:38:14,559
combination lights uh well you know they

2009
01:38:11,158 --> 01:38:17,879
go either sodium or Hy but you'd have to

2010
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:20,440
you know you could drive them with a

2011
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:22,000
bigger Transformer but they burn out

2012
01:38:20,439 --> 01:38:24,559
sooner

2013
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:28,198
um yeah that's that's got to be the

2014
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:31,039
biggest thing um yeah and also the

2015
01:38:28,198 --> 01:38:33,279
Spectrum on those lights is is just much

2016
01:38:31,039 --> 01:38:35,679
much more conducive to

2017
01:38:33,279 --> 01:38:39,238
growing one I want to add one thing to

2018
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:40,920
that so and and I also if if you have

2019
01:38:39,238 --> 01:38:42,359
one more moment I want to make sure that

2020
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:46,039
Sasha doesn't have any questions he

2021
01:38:42,359 --> 01:38:47,559
needs to ask too but um I think that

2022
01:38:46,039 --> 01:38:51,880
environmental

2023
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:55,400
control is actually had more of an

2024
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:56,920
impact than the lighting because High

2025
01:38:55,399 --> 01:39:01,679
Press sodiums and

2026
01:38:56,920 --> 01:39:04,800
Hy do a pretty good job you know but one

2027
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:08,158
a major issue that cultivators had had

2028
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:09,920
is lack of environmental control and so

2029
01:39:08,158 --> 01:39:12,920
now I believe that more people are

2030
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:15,359
trying to control their environment and

2031
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:18,520
that's having a really dramatic effect

2032
01:39:15,359 --> 01:39:21,079
on you know how the plant grows yeah

2033
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:25,119
it's interesting interesting to say that

2034
01:39:21,079 --> 01:39:29,319
because uh as as this industry developed

2035
01:39:25,118 --> 01:39:30,839
all the money was in um fertilizer

2036
01:39:29,319 --> 01:39:33,359
that's where you make the money

2037
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:35,599
fertilizer okay you sell the fertilizer

2038
01:39:33,359 --> 01:39:38,158
that's where the biggest markup was

2039
01:39:35,599 --> 01:39:40,319
that's where all the energy went was go

2040
01:39:38,158 --> 01:39:43,679
into the fertilizer my fertilizer is

2041
01:39:40,319 --> 01:39:46,559
better than yours it's consumable yeah

2042
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:49,760
and it's a consumable and thing and the

2043
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:53,560
air you can't see it you know you you

2044
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:57,039
look right through it uh people don't

2045
01:39:53,560 --> 01:40:01,560
realize just how much how how important

2046
01:39:57,039 --> 01:40:04,519
uh ventilation is or air circulation

2047
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:07,960
have no clue there's no way they and and

2048
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:11,119
uh before you couldn't measure measure

2049
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:13,079
the CO2 level really uh inexpensively

2050
01:40:11,118 --> 01:40:15,238
there was those tubes that you suck the

2051
01:40:13,079 --> 01:40:17,639
chemical through right and get a

2052
01:40:15,238 --> 01:40:20,638
chemical reaction and have to

2053
01:40:17,639 --> 01:40:23,760
read some color which is pretty

2054
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:26,520
difficult it's not a digital readout

2055
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:29,280
um now you've got CO2 monitors are

2056
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:32,760
really inexpensive or fairly

2057
01:40:29,279 --> 01:40:35,439
inexpensive um and also it can be

2058
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:39,079
integrated together too fairly easily

2059
01:40:35,439 --> 01:40:42,638
before you'd have to have oh oh relays

2060
01:40:39,079 --> 01:40:46,359
and set up your own system basically and

2061
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:49,960
have a basic knowledge of of electricity

2062
01:40:46,359 --> 01:40:54,000
and you know when the timer goes off the

2063
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:58,480
fan goes goes on and you know products

2064
01:40:54,000 --> 01:41:00,439
Harmon yeah he put out the first yeah

2065
01:40:58,479 --> 01:41:02,839
another OG maybe we can get him on one

2066
01:41:00,439 --> 01:41:06,000
day but he made a controller that would

2067
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:08,760
turn off your CO2 when your exhaust fan

2068
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:11,399
came on and it's just

2069
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:13,760
simple yeah I would just like to thank

2070
01:41:11,399 --> 01:41:16,559
you man because you you don't even know

2071

01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:21,880
at at the time where we were a new

2073

many people Growers you know having your

2078
01:41:33,639 --> 01:41:38,960
book on the Shelf in those places you

a really big contribution to the

2082
01:41:43,118 --> 01:41:47,559
community to the culture you know as

2083
01:41:45,198 --> 01:41:49,519
itself Global Community you're a real OG

2084
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:51,199
you know a legend

2085
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:54,400
you you

2086
01:41:51,198 --> 01:41:55,919
know he doesn't have a big ego that's

2087
01:41:54,399 --> 01:41:59,319
also what makes him such a beautiful

2088
01:41:55,920 --> 01:42:01,679
person okay well I just I did my part

2089
01:41:59,319 --> 01:42:03,840
you know the part that was different

2090
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:07,319
with me

2091
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:09,880
was with different with me was most

2092
01:42:07,319 --> 01:42:11,679
people would get information and they

2093
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:14,319
would take that information and make

2094
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:17,520
money with it and keep it to

2095
01:42:14,319 --> 01:42:22,079
themselves my goal was to go the other

2096
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:23,880
way to do the opposite of that and it it

2097
01:42:22,079 --> 01:42:27,118
it was a lot of hard work for a lot of

2098
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:29,760
years but it's finally it's you know

I want to leave you with

2102
01:42:35,359 --> 01:42:40,759
this one of my favorite musicians um I

2103

think you you might love him too was

2104
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:46,599
Jerry Garcia oh yeah and I used to have

2105
01:42:44,198 --> 01:42:49,919
friends that would leave the dead show

2106
01:42:46,599 --> 01:42:52,639
early to go wait at Jerry's hotel to get

2107
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:54,679
an autograph and say hello to him and I

2108
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:57,440
always I always thought they were crazy

2109
01:42:54,679 --> 01:42:58,800

about it is now that Jerry's passed one
