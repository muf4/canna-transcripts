00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,840
of Series Cultivation where he helps

9
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,799
growers optimize their cultivation

10
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:36,479
process and facilities. He's also an

11
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:38,640

provides his cultivation expertise

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,600
through the Groworld A platform. Uh

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,679
Liam, welcome to the show. How are you

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,359
today? Thanks, Nick. Appreciate it.

16
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,079
Thanks for the intro. I'm doing well.

17
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:52,878
I've just been, you know, uh traveling a

18
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,039
lot, trying to keep up and um you know,

19
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:57,599
just uh really excited to be here and

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,039
have a conversation and see what we can

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,159
uh get into. For sure. Uh well, you come

22
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,040
highly recommended for having a um an

23
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,040
educated cultivation discussion by a few

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,240
different sources. And so I was really

25
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,400
excited to get you on the podcast today.

26
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,640
Um what's new in your grow world? you

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,640
you do a lot of different things and uh

28
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,280
kind of wear a few different hats. Uh is

29
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,680
there anything that's kind of been uh at

30
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,719
the tip of your brain lately?

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,880
Uh you know you being that that I'm

32
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,599
working with Aoya and I I started in

33
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,679
September of last year uh I've gotten a

34
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,078
lot of exposure to a lot of facilities

35
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,118
around the country and I I kind of cover

36
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:42,319
from uh Michigan all the way over to

37
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:44,959
Oregon. So I get to see sort of every

38
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:48,398
every stretch of the indoor and

39
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:50,000
greenhouse industry in uh in each state

40
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,599
and and you know just get an idea for

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
what people are doing, how they're doing

42
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,438
it and uh and kind of understand you

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,359
know what's working for people, what's

44
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,359
not working, best practices, what people

45
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,840
are are interested in. So the exposure

46
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:04,399
to that many facilities has been uh

47
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,359
really invaluable. Um, you know,

48
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,679
obviously I've was working for ScienceL

49
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,598
before and got to see quite a bit of of

50
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,920
facilities there, but uh kind of

51
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,159
expanding outside of Colorado, uh, the

52
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,119
Michigan market, uh, you know, really

53
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:21,439
highly compressed legacy markets and,

54
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,959
um, you know, really the the whole

55
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:27,840
breadth of, uh, of, uh, performance

56
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,000
across the board. So nice. That's really

57
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,439
been the most interesting focus for me

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,239
lately.

59
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,239
Um if if you can divulge anything uh

60
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,840
along these lines, I would love to hear

61
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,800
what are some of the most innovative

62
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,560
solutions that you've seen people uh

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,959
integrating into their cultivation

64
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,360
facilities that maybe you hadn't seen

65
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,000
elsewhere or you know it was just a

66
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,160
really uh ingenious application of

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,280
something that normally may not be in

68
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:58,159
that uh style of application.

69
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,640
Oh man, that's tough. There's a lot uh

70
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,158
there's a there's a lot going on and a

71
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,559
lot to it. And I think you know being

72
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,719
able to walk into a facility and see hey

73
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,719
these guys are really uh you know making

74
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,878
do with what they've got um doing the

75
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,840
best they can with what they have the uh

76
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:15,280
the sort of maggyvering and and

77
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,360
ingenuity. Uh it's across the board. I

78
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,680
mean you know people between different

79
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,480
methods of collecting runoff to

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,760
different ways of dehumidification.

81
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:27,280
um you know, sort of what what the uh

82
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,199
there's a lot of people running under

83
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,878
canopy lights lately that I've seen

84
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:34,079
getting great results. Uh there's a lot

85
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:36,560
of different, you know, people playing

86
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,920
with different spectrums. I see a lot of

87
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,799
mixed mixed indoor lighting, so HPS LED

88
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:45,039
combo. Um still see a ton of HPS lights

89
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,080
in the in the market. Uh but the guys

90
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:49,719
that are really performing well seem to

91
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,040
have a really good understanding of

92
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:55,120
staff and workflow in the facility.

93
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,840
their cost of goods is low. And I think

94
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,200
that, you know, some of these, you know,

95
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,959
to kind of answer your question on

96
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,119
specific applications, there are I've

97
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,560
seen some people really

98
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,158
uh string together their

99
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,640
own sort of solution when they can't

100
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:15,598
necessarily afford something like Aoya

101
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:17,519
or, you know, uh like a Agonomic IQ. Uh

102
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:19,839
there's there's quite a bit of hot gas

103
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,918
reheat going around. I've seen a lot of

104
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,679
people like kind of modifying their HVAC

105
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:26,079
units to get reheat and getting really

106
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,879
good results with stability in their

107
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:31,839
humidity in their grow rooms. Um I think

108
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:34,560
the the combination of HPS and LED does

109
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:38,638
help a little bit with um mitigating

110
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,478
some of the uh sort of high increase in

111
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:45,040
transpiration that you get under LEDs uh

112
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:46,800
alone. I mean, you still see that guys,

113
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,240
you know, putting far red at the end of

114
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,400
the day and and, you know, early in the

115
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,079
morning. Um, but yeah, I mean, it it's

116
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,918
it kind of all blurs together. I mean,

117
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:58,639
I've seen some pretty creative things,

118
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:01,519
you know, as far as benching and and

119
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,120
drainage goes. Um, you know, sort of

120
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:07,038
running

121
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,840
uh pipe drains under the benches or, you

122
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,038
know, stringing together irrigation

123
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:12,319
zones. But yeah, I mean, you kind of put

124
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,038
me on the spot there. It's kind of hard

125
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:18,000
to to No, you you kind of touched on all

126
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:20,959
the hot topics um which is really great

127
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,839
because um of course seeing it in

128
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,159
application in these different um you

129
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,079
know commercial

130
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,600
facilities it it does show that this is

131
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,120
where the market is looking right now.

132
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,479
This is at least on the cultivation

133
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,399
side. Uh you know people are kind of uh

134
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:39,599
forging a path whether it be through

135
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:43,038
these uh like far red light applications

136
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,360
or the um reheat applications of their

137
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,800
pre-existing air conditioners so that

138
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,840
they can get that better uh

139
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,960
dehumidification capacity for the

140
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:52,959
facility. These are all the things that

141
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,638
it you see a lot of people talking about

142
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:58,079
and have been talking about at least for

143
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:01,280
the past couple years. Um, so I that's

144
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:03,758
it's very I mean telling to say that it

145
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:06,879
is being seen in the market right now.

146
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,960
Um, but you know, I I do like to bring

147
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,839
this podcast a little bit back to your

148
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,839
origins as a cultivator because it

149
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,599
sounds like you have a wealth of

150
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,959
knowledge that you're tapping into when

151
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,720
you're addressing these different

152
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:22,478
solutions and seeing these different um

153
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,199
uh either problems arise that you're

154
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:27,680
helping tackle and then finding the

155
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,879
solutions for. And so that all has to

156
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,319
come from somewhere. Um, so all the way

157
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,478
back, what are some of the first

158
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,879
experiences you had with plants in

159
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:39,439
general, whether it be cannabis or not?

160
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:42,079
And then did it start with cannabis and

161
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,918
go to perhaps some vegetable gardening

162
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,758
here and there, or did you do any

163
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,318
vegetable gardening with, you know, mom

164
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,439
and dad or an uncle or an aunt or

165
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,120
something like that and then transition

166
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,680
any of that like passion or knowledge

167
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,120
into cannabis?

168
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,280
It's a really interesting question.

169
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,478
there's a lot of uh there's a lot of

170
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:04,959
cross-pollination across both of those

171
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:08,159
things. So, I think you know to say like

172
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:10,318
my journey with cannabis um started in

173
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,240
one area and my journey with gardening

174
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,800
kind of started separately of that.

175
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,720
Although when I was a kid and and in in

176
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,120
high school, you know, first started

177
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,880
consuming cannabis, um you know, we'd

178
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,720
always get bag seeds and try to toss

179
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,800
them out and we had these abandoned lots

180
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,479
in our neighborhood that we try to grow

181
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,720
stuff. Never really turned into

182
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:31,360
anything. And then when I I I didn't

183
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,280
really grow plants. I wasn't super

184
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,919
interested in growing plants as like a a

185
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,598
business or anything like um you know

186
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,959
professionally until I got into college

187
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:46,399
and I changed my major to environmental

188
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:48,638
science and I got into a couple of

189
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:51,038
classes like ethnobbatney

190
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,199
um and you know kind of led me down

191
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:56,560
towards horiculture. We had a community

192
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:59,520
garden uh on campus and you could go

193
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,519
there and just volunteer and work in the

194
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,680
garden. It was a pretty pretty decent

195
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,120
sized uh garden and you could just go

196
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,639
there and first time you volunteer

197
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,598
you're probably spreading mulch around

198
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,478
or you know double digging plots or

199
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:14,478
whatever uh was needed to be done and

200
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:15,918
then as you kind of progressed through

201
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:17,839
and got a little bit more experience

202
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:19,279
they started assigning showed some level

203
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:21,679
of proficiency too. They'd start

204
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:24,638
assigning more complicated tasks like

205
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,478
transplanting or propagation things like

206
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,000
that. And I got really into it. I was I

207
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:29,758
was like that this is really exciting,

208
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,360
you know, starting to get a closer

209
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,158
understanding of where my food came from

210
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,240
and and how to how to cultivate it in

211
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:39,759
different environments. And then I got

212
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,240
into uh aeroponic growing cuz we had a

213
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:46,319
program on campus for the it was through

214
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,320
like the um the wellness uh initiative

215
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,720
uh where we had these aeroponic tower

216
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,640
gardens planted all over campus. And I

217
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,040
helped build them and clean them and

218
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:58,399
take them down. And I got involved in

219
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,919
this project uh you know as a volunteer

220
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,200
uh where I'd go harvest and then

221
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:04,399
eventually got to a point where I

222
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,560
started giving these presentations and

223
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,039
kind of sharing how it worked and

224
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,679
teaching people about vertical gardening

225
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:14,079
and things like that. So that's where I

226
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,559
sort of got really really into the more

227
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,240
uh into the soilless growing and then

228
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,039
did that for a long time. had a lot of

229
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,120
people ask me if I if I grew cannabis or

230
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:26,399
if I was interested in doing that or did

231
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,480
it in in those aeroponic gardens and I

232
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,919
kind of was very resistant to it. Kind

233
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,240
of pushed back a little bit on it cuz I

234
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,719
had gotten in trouble for cannabis in

235
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,959
college and just kind of you know tried

236
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,360
to move away from from that a little bit

237
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,439
at that time. But then I I ended up

238
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,800
living in a house where I was able to we

239
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,880
had like an area where we could

240
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:47,919
cultivate in in the house that was

241
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:52,159
secret. Um, so I started playing around

242
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:54,799
with with tent growing and then um

243
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:58,000
translated that into when I graduated

244
00:09:54,799 --> 00:10:01,079
college and I had kind of traveled I I

245
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,320
kind of left Orlando and I went to Costa

246
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,560
Rica, did my permaculture design course,

247
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,680
stayed there to work on the farm for a

248
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:11,359
couple months after that and then went

249
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:13,679
down to Ecuador and I did this like

250
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,120
indoor or it was um it was an urban

251
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:19,838
agriculture course And it was a once a

252
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,360
week class for a couple months. And I

253
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,160
got, you know, learned kind of like what

254
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,839
their strategies were for raised bed

255
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:30,799
gardening as well. And um yeah, once

256
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,440
once I kind of finished that and came

257
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:35,599
back to the the states, I was working

258
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,760
with a friend of mine who had a

259
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,519
business. He was starting a business

260
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,000
building garden beds for people in their

261
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,600
backyards and their front yards and

262
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,519
different kind of projects where he was

263
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,600
building vegetable gardens. And I got

264
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,000
really involved, you know, did a lot of

265
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,680
builds, did a lot of plantings, a lot of

266
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,360
workshops, things like that. And uh and

267
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:59,359
then I moved over to back to Orlando and

268
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,720
kind of helped build another similar

269
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,959
business up there that was a little bit

270
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,920
more high-profile, a little bit more

271
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:08,000
boutique for, you know, some of the more

272
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:10,319
uh upscale neighborhoods, community

273
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,159
gardens, things like that, living walls.

274
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,079
So, I got really deeply involved in

275
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,799
plants outside of cannabis for a while.

276
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:18,719
And eventually one of my friends started

277
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,958
working at Cur Leaf in Mount Dora in

278
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,800
Florida when they were opening kind of

279
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:25,039
before they brought plants in. And he

280
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,479
continually tried to convince me to to

281
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:27,919
join over there and I was a bit

282
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,519
resistant to it at first and finally

283
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:30,719
he's like, "All right, let's see what

284
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,120
this is all about. I'll get in the

285
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:38,920
commercial cannabis space." And about

286
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,919
what year was that? Uh that was 2018.

287
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,600
So cool. Yeah, it was it was uh it was

288
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,039
when Florida had gone medical. I think

289
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,519
True Leaf had already established a

290
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:52,559
couple facilities. Cure Leaf had a site

291
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,159
down in Homestead. Um but this was like

292
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:57,439
sort of their big project. It was about

293
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,879
6 acres of greenhouse and then they had

294
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,440
well by the time I left they had

295
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:03,759
expanded to building out about 250,000

296
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,680
ft of indoor. So went from a team of

297
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:09,439
like initially bringing on around 20

298
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:12,638
people. um ended up with over a hundred

299
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,160
in cultivation alone. Wow. And uh you

300
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,159
know probably even upwards of that. We

301
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,399
had to during co split into two shifts.

302
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,078
So half the cultivation team was on

303
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,559
three to four days a week and the other

304
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:25,759
half was split. But there were still you

305
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:27,919
know 100 people on each shift. So that's

306
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:30,879
crazy. Yeah, it was a massive operation.

307
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,479
Still still is uh really big and they're

308
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,240
still producing quite a lot of cannabis

309
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,039
over there. But that was my foray into

310
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,720
commercial cannabis outside of just tent

311
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:42,319
growing. And but I had so much

312
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,959
experience growing and gardening outside

313
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,040
of cannabis that I picked up a lot of

314
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,879
the the techniques and and the

315
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:51,039
procedures and practices quickly. But a

316
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,720
big focus was on operations and

317
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:55,120
efficiency and problem solving and

318
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,720
distribution of labor and staffing. That

319
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,720
was really where a tremendous amount of

320
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,480
value came because there was all of this

321
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,160
problem solving on a daily basis we had

322
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,639
to do to make the operations work and

323
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:07,278
keep the gears turning efficiently. Um,

324
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,839
and so kind of having to sequence like

325
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:11,200
dozens of different processes kind of

326
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,360
all happening at once and making sure

327
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,759
they all happened in a coordinated and

328
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,200
efficient effort was uh probably the

329
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,600
biggest part of the learning process

330
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,920
initially there. But then I got really

331
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,159
into the technology and the greenhouse

332
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,479
management and managing sort of the

333
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:28,480
climate in the greenhouse and using all

334
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,759
these different controls platforms like

335
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,720
Pa and Ritter. Um you know we had this

336
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:37,600
other old platform called UCOM which was

337
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,079
I guess micro grow. Um so we and then we

338
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,159
had a internal BAS system that was made

339
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,599
on site in house. Uh so there were all

340
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:45,360
these different programs I had to learn

341
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,079
and then had to help commission the

342
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,480
climate control system skid. So really

343
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:53,120
just got deep into uncovering how all

344
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,680
these controls and technologies worked

345
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,000
and figuring out how to optimize them to

346
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,599
get the best environment in that

347
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,799
greenhouse that we could cuz it was

348
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,120
really uh a lot of poor design decisions

349
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:08,000
went into that. So a lot of maggyvering

350
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,440
and problem solving. Do you mind uh

351
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,159
talking a little bit more about your

352
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,920
time at Curleaf? And um I feel like with

353
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,799
such a large facility, you could

354
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,958
probably see some of the um some of the

355
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:22,000
best aspects of the commercial

356
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:24,399
cultivation uh industry as well as some

357
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,720
of the the potentially the worst parts

358
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,519
of the commercial cultivation industry

359
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,839
just you know in terms of efficiencies

360
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:33,839
or discrepancies. Um you know there's a

361
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,839
lot there to probably unpack and

362
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,360
whatever you feel comfortable with.

363
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,959
Yeah. No, I mean there's definitely a

364
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,039
lot to unpack. I I you know I fully uh

365
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,278
acknowledged that there were there was a

366
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:48,000
lot of

367
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:49,919
um poor decisions that were made uh over

368
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,399
there and they they learned a lot the

369
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:55,198
the company as a whole learned a lot uh

370
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:58,000
in the process of retrofitting and then

371
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,838
building out on that property. So, you

372
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,839
know, they're they're they spent quite a

373
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,920
lot of money on trying to retrofit the

374
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,959
greenhouse and initially there was some

375
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:09,439
guidance to retrofit it to make it more

376
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:12,159
uh representative of an indoor space

377
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,000
within the greenhouse and you know with

378
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:16,240
the intention being that hey you know

379
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,120
maybe we can use AC to mitigate some of

380
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,320
the external heat coming from Florida

381
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,399
outdoor environment but the execution

382
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,839
was uh there were a lot of challenges

383
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:31,278
and a lot of um turnover on the dire

384
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:34,320
ctor side. Uh we had a lot of leaders in

385
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:36,000
that facility turn over every few months

386
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,639
and I think a lot of that just came down

387
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,278
to like you know playing a blame game or

388
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,198
or trying to

389
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:45,278
um trying to understand like why certain

390
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:46,879
decisions that were made that spent a

391
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,278
decent amount of capital weren't

392
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:52,159
yielding results or turning into

393
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:53,679
positive outcomes. Um, you know, that

394
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,519
was a big part of what I was trying to

395
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,838
to do there was, hey, we had, when I

396
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,159
came in there, they had taken a lot of

397
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,800
the aspects of the greenhouse that were

398
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:04,159
functioning and growing orchids

399
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:07,198
beforehand and sort of shut them off and

400
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,719
and tried to, you know, do what they

401
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:11,198
could to seal off the environment or

402
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,800
make it an indoor environment. And that

403
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:16,719
was um probably not the the best

404
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:17,919
decision in the long run, but I I kind

405
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,680
of understand where they were coming

406
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:24,000
from. I think they they you know quickly

407
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,838
realized that Florida greenhouse

408
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,919
conditions are not optimal for cannabis

409
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,839
of any variety. Although some like we

410
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:35,120
had Afghani that usually performed

411
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,800
pretty well um handled the tropical

412
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,320
climate much better than some of the

413
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:41,919
other cultivars that were brought over

414
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,079
from Colorado. Uh but yeah, I mean, you

415
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:45,838
know, just with that large of a site and

416
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:48,078
growing and expanding that quickly,

417
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,199
there's always going to be issues. I

418
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:51,838
mean, I don't think that there really

419
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:54,000
had been many facilities across the

420
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,480
country of that size and that scale up

421
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
until that point. So, nobody really knew

422
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:03,440
how to turn that into a um a proper

423
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,318
production site, uh you know, anywhere.

424
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,959
So, I mean, it sounds daunting. Yeah,

425
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,318
it's a huge learning curve and and

426
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,160
there's, you know, everyone's always

427
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,599
going to make bad decisions when, you

428
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,519
know, but as long as you learn from

429
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,958
them. I think building the indoor was a

430
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:21,359
good decision on their part. Um, just to

431
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,199
produce the volume and quality that they

432
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,838
kind of were anticipating out of the

433
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:31,120
greenhouse like just wasn't happening.

434
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:33,279
So um yeah I I I I think uh you know

435
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,519
without trying to look back from an

436
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:37,678
objective place of like hey you know

437
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,240
what were we trying to accomplish there

438
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,320
the team on site the the team on the

439
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,960
ground we really did well fending for

440
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:48,159
ourselves a lot and kind of as this

441
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,160
revolving door of of uh direction was

442
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,080
happening we figured out a way to kind

443
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,240
of stabilize and ground ourselves to be

444
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,399
able to manage all the people we had to

445
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,640
manage. I mean, I had over 40 people

446
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,960
that I had to be responsible for at one

447
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,280
point. Um, and then I kind of

448
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,759
transitioned more into just fully taking

449
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,839
on the responsibility of managing the

450
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,919
lights and the curtains and the, you

451
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:12,959
know, all of the uh mechanical aspects

452
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,960
and really kind of dived into to deeply

453
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,360
into learning the technology that was at

454
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,840
our disposal because they had, you know,

455
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:22,000
there were thousandgalon batch tanks for

456
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:24,399
each zone that were hand mixed every day

457
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,798
in that site. There were guys in this

458
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,600
the water room just mixing tanks all day

459
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:32,480
for a long time. They they didn't have

460
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:33,839
any sort of dosing system set up or not

461
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,599
until they commissioned the climate

462
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:39,399
control system skid which was towards

463
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:43,798
the end of my time there. Wow. I left in

464
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:48,320
uh end of summer of 2020 when COVID kind

465
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:49,558
of it was a there was a a big transition

466
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:53,918
during that

467
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:56,240
period and I had um I had to report to

468
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,679
somebody who came in very recently who I

469
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:04,319
had to coach and train and and educate

470
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:06,798
that um that was basically I I I would

471
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:10,480
say it it made me feel a little bit um

472
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:11,639
undervalued. dude on on site there. Um,

473
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,160
you know,

474
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,720
without saying too much, I just didn't

475
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,480
really uh I didn't feel appreciated or

476
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,640
respected for the amount of sacrifices

477
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,319
and time and effort I made. So, I

478
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,799
started looking for other opportunities

479
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,798
and got the chance to move to Colorado

480
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,879
to to to work on indoor craft

481
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,720
cultivation, which was a piece that I

482
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,320
was really interested in that I hadn't

483
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,079
had the chance to do up until that

484
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:38,319
point. For sure. I I I mean the um the

485
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:41,199
underappreciated and overworked aspect

486
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:43,678
is something um I I come from a culinary

487
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,319
background before I got into cultivation

488
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,000
and it was of of course it was like

489
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:51,678
taking people who were passionate about

490
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,440
something and um abusing that passion

491
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,880
for the gains of the company because

492
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,640
they were willing to put in all that

493
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,080
effort because they were searching for

494
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,679
knowledge themselves, right? And uh when

495
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,918
given an opportunity with, you know,

496
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,519
such a large facility, I would almost

497
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,600
look at that going in and be like, "Oh

498
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,000
my god, this playground that I've been

499
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:12,558
given, I can learn so much from what

500
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,720
they have to offer here." But then all

501
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:17,119
that effort and you then you have to

502
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,360
train the person who's taking over the

503
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:20,558
position that's going to lead you. Uh

504
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,798
that doesn't sound like a good

505
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:25,678
leadership decision. I can I can

506
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:27,918
understand that. Um and it does seem

507
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,679
like an underappreciation.

508
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,840
Yeah, I mean there's a lot that goes

509
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,519
into that sort of decision, right? Like

510
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:38,240
I understand there's a level of uh like

511
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:42,400
I think I preach this often, but

512
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:45,359
staffing, leadership, and culture are

513
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,440
really what drive performance in a lot

514
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,199
of ways because when you have a team

515
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,600
that's passionate, that feels

516
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,000
appreciated. um they continue to work

517
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,839
hard to continue to elevate that as

518
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,798
especially when they see upward mobility

519
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:00,839
or at least being treated well and being

520
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:03,519
being shown some

521
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:06,558
appreciation that goes a really long way

522
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:09,599
especially compounding over larger and

523
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:12,918
larger teams. Um I think I see the most

524
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:17,199
successful gardens have the most

525
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:18,799
cohesive and um cultural teams when I

526
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,080
when I visit facilities. kind of going

527
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:25,279
back to what I was saying before, but um

528
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:28,639
you know what I what I learned through

529
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:31,918
Cure Leaf, which subsequently translated

530
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:35,600
in into what I did briefly at Begood,

531
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,679
but um just finding just having uh

532
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,918
quality communication between people and

533
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,798
teams and feeling like we're humans

534
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,840
outside of of the garden. Uh you know,

535
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:50,480
that goes a really long way.

536
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:52,639
And there's there's often uh not a lot

537
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,200
of resources allocated towards, you

538
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,960
know, team appreciation. And I worked at

539
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,279
Whole Foods before I worked in the

540
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,000
cannabis industry. And they did a lot to

541
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,519
try to keep the culture before Amazon

542
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,640
got involved, but they did a lot to try

543
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:09,359
to like promote culture within the

544
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:13,679
company and, you know, team building

545
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:16,079
things like that. So there's there's a I

546
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,559
think with big companies, it's often

547
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:20,399
challenging to get that right because

548
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:22,000
there's so many different variabilities

549
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,519
from sight to sight and the type of

550
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,079
people that are available to work at

551
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:28,720
each place. It it is very hard and and

552
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:31,038
you often do have to bring people on

553
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,440
from outside, especially to higher

554
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:35,240
positions. But promoting from within. I

555
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,038
mean, there's some guys I I have a

556
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:41,279
friend out in Nevada who's very much a

557
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:43,200
uh very fond of promoting from within

558
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:46,319
and training and bringing people up. And

559
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,519
I think your greatest success comes from

560
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:52,839
having people that work that once worked

561
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:55,599
under you at a certain point um elevate

562
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:58,720
to that level of success to be able to

563
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:01,599
go out, you know, like like it's a it's

564
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,079
a compliment when you hire somebody and

565
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:06,639
then they get offered a position, you

566
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,720
know, at that director or manager level

567
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,960
outside. it it it feels good to know

568
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,798
that that person's skill set is is

569
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,840
evolved and competent enough to take on

570
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:19,279
that kind of role. Um, for sure. So, I I

571
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:21,599
I really think investing in your people

572
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:23,279
uh makes the big all the difference in

573
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:26,158
the world, especially in markets that

574
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:27,678
are really tight and very bleak and

575
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,880
people don't feel like it's nice when

576
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,320
everything's going well and everyone's

577
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,880
making money and you're all bonusing

578
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:34,558
out, you know, but when you're having

579
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,600
hard time paying the bills and paying

580
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:41,759
your team and all that, like it's uh

581
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:44,158
morale is very easily dropped and it's

582
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,319
very infectious when you have low morale

583
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,919
in both ways. is morale is a very

584
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:51,759
infectious aspect of the garden. So, I

585
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,280
couldn't agree more. I that's like some

586
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:55,839
of the biggest things that I feel like

587
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,678
the industry faces right now is um in

588
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:59,279
this downturn that we're all facing is

589
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,320
keeping the morale high enough so that

590
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:04,000
the there's still a continued strive for

591
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:06,000
excellence in the product that's being

592
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,759
produced because it can so easily fall

593
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,558
to the wayside if if you're feeling

594
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:12,720
underappreciated or if you don't feel as

595
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,158
though there is any hope for the future.

596
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,640
Basically, you know, when you look at

597
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,720
this and you go, man, over the past 5

598
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,520
years, we have not been necessarily

599
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,440
trending towards

600
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:27,278
uh uh you know, this high profit margin

601
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,440
that we were at at one point. Um and so

602
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:31,919
I I I think that investing in your team

603
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,720
is extremely important uh at all times,

604
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,400
but especially when times are tough. Um

605
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,319
yeah, I mean, if you're really good,

606
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:42,798
it's easy for you to get taken advantage

607
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:44,798
of uh as well. Um, you know, there was I

608
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:48,240
there was a point at in at my journey at

609
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:52,319
BEG Good that I was solely responsible

610
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,880
for about 150 light 140 light facility

611
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:56,599
and I didn't have any

612
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,360
full-time team members over on that

613
00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:01,519
site. And, you know, I just had to make

614
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,918
it work and kind of continue to keep the

615
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:06,000
operation going and turning crops and

616
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,159
turning cycles around. Even though the

617
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,079
facility was horribly inefficient, there

618
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,159
was no capital to be able to invest cuz

619
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:16,558
there was, you know, uh a previous

620
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:18,640
contract grower that had uh some

621
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:21,519
conflicts with the ownership and there

622
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:25,919
was just a lot of uh mismanagement of

623
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:27,960
resources and um leading to kind of a

624
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,400
zero sum game where you're driving your

625
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,360
cultivators to do more and more work,

626
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,038
you know, less and less people. Um

627
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:36,479
that's that seems to happen a lot where

628
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:38,319
you're you're like running down to a

629
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,240
skeleton crew. So there's a fine line

630
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:42,240
between operational efficiency with

631
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,558
minimum amount of labor required to get

632
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,880
each task done and there's a whole you

633
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:51,278
know between that and like just having

634
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:53,278
the absolute barest bones people on

635
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:55,038
staff to just keep the building open and

636
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:56,240
you just expect way too much of those

637
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:58,158
people. They have to come in on the

638
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,919
weekends all the time. That's just not

639
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,440
really fair and not sustainable long

640
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,200
term. And if somebody's really good and

641
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,038
they can do it, that doesn't necessarily

642
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:10,480
mean that you should make them uh Mhm.

643
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:12,480
you know, so especially with no stake in

644
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,038
the business or no and and that's a

645
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,000
tricky game, too, is like equity is not

646
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:21,200
usually the right move for like a

647
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,679
cultivator, but it can be. It's just a

648
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,960
matter of what is the capacity and what

649
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,759
is the potential future of this

650
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,240
business. I've seen so many cultivations

651
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:33,599
in Colorado alone just turn over and go

652
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,839
out of business or shut down. Uh it's uh

653
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:39,918
even some of the the what I thought

654
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:41,918
would be some of the more quality um

655
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,520
businesses, they just they can't get

656
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,600
their cost of goods down. They can't get

657
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,278
their price their selling price high

658
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:50,000
enough. They can't pump out enough

659
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:52,079
consistent crops regularly. I mean,

660
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,319
those are some of the key pain points

661
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:56,240
that you see a lot with compressing

662
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:58,558
markets that are built upon a high price

663
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,159
per pound initially. Like Colorado took

664
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:02,798
a while to compress, so people didn't

665
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,480
realize that $2,000 pounds were not

666
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:06,720
really reasonable anymore until it was

667
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,440
too late. They just kept holding on to

668
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:13,679
that. There's so many people using

669
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,600
products like BioBiz and um Mills or all

670
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:19,120
these different products that are crazy

671
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:21,439
high price point per gallon mixed. and

672
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:23,759
um still just you know running that

673
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,200
because they didn't want to accept the

674
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,119
truths as they were coming down the

675
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,400
pipeline of the prices continuously

676
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:33,678
falling. And then once you have to learn

677
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,919
how to run uh with a lower overhead and

678
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,400
input cost, you start to just see all of

679
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,320
these other problems arise because you

680
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,038
aren't transitioning in a holistic way.

681
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:46,399
You're kind of slamming the brakes and

682
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:48,079
pulling a U-turn. So, um, yeah, I mean,

683
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,400
I would say that the gravity of impact

684
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:52,639
of input costs changes at different

685
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,559
scales. Like, I still see guys that are

686
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,759
running house and garden, but they're

687
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:57,200
doing well cuz they're getting higher

688
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:58,960
price per pound and the quality and

689
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,640
flavor of their product is better, but

690
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,558
they're smaller. They're putting out,

691
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,399
you know, very, you know, like somewhere

692
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:06,558
around 100 to a couple hundred pounds a

693
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:08,319
month as opposed to large facilities. So

694
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:10,960
when you're talking to like the gravity

695
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:14,240
of those those quantifiable changes in

696
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,440
input costs, a couple cents per gallon

697
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,359
maybe makes more of a difference at um

698
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,080
at a facility that's selling commodity

699
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:23,599
product. So you have to use something

700
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:24,798
that's going to be way more cost

701
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,278
effective because now you're talking

702
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:29,278
tens of thousands of dollars a week or a

703
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:32,319
month as opposed to like a couple

704
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:34,079
hundred bucks per crop cycle. Um, sure.

705
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:37,200
You know, I think that's that you you

706
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:39,599
have to distinguish what what context

707
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,558
you're talking about because not always

708
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:44,119
is the change in lower fertilizer cost

709
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:46,879
can reflect in a better business

710
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:48,719
outcome. Uh, and that's something that I

711
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,520
think often is overlooked where we speak

712
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,839
in absolutes about I just need cheaper

713
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:56,079
cocoa. I just need cheaper nutrients. I

714
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:57,918
need what? Cheap lights. Like you know

715
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:00,000
all these factors are much more

716
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,600
complicated than just speaking from

717
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,759
directly a price point cuz if you're

718
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:05,759
talking economics you have to build out

719
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,839
the whole proforma on that equipment

720
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:10,158
almost every time. Otherwise you don't

721
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:13,439
really understand the the downstream

722
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,520
financial impacts of getting a $300 LED

723
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,679
that may go out in two years or that

724
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,918
degrades or the spectrum shifts over

725
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,840
time or whatever the problem might be.

726
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,440
or you know, you get cheap sensors to

727
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:25,599
monitor your substrate and then you have

728
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,120
to constantly calibrate them and there's

729
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:29,119
tons of labor going into that or

730
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:32,000
whatever the the case may be where

731
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:35,918
you're actually downstream causing you

732
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,880
know higher uh labor or um you know

733
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,880
costs to like let's say you know you get

734
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,799
I mean I'm not maybe don't need to use

735
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,039
the sensor thing but you get a cheap

736
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:47,839
piece of equipment and now you're not

737
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:49,359
trusting that what you're seeing is

738
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:51,359
accurate or real and you can't make

739
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:52,959
decisions off of it. Uh, you know,

740
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:56,240
there's things like that. Like cheap

741
00:29:52,960 --> 00:30:00,000
cocoa has inconsistencies in volume, in

742
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,440
salinity levels. Uh, rockwool, you know,

743
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,558
there's there's so many different

744
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:08,720
aspects to input cost. I often look

745
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:10,720
above consumables to just like, you

746
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,038
know, operating cost as a whole of like,

747
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,240
okay, are you renting the building? Are

748
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:18,640
you um, you know, what is your what are

749
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,399
your licensing fees on a regular basis?

750
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,600
And then how many pounds do you need to

751
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:26,319
produce to get uh to get to that point

752
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:28,798
uh to of what is profitable? And the

753
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:30,798
economies of scale are so market

754
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:33,119
subjective like Arizona has a lot of

755
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:34,639
massive facilities. Well, they're

756
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:36,879
limited license. So those massive

757
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,960
facilities don't have to produce premium

758
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,640
topshelf flower all the time to sell all

759
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,880
their product out, you know. But

760
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,640
Colorado, there's a way more there's a a

761
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,960
way higher

762
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:50,640
uh volume of producers to consumers. So

763
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,880
it's, you know, it's a bit more diluted

764
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,759
and saturated. So I I would say that you

765
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:58,240
have to have a high quality product and

766
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:00,398
check all the boxes in order to have a

767
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,480
good brand with with marketing that's

768
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:05,119
successful. That's and and that's where

769
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,798
you you maybe know producing a few

770
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:09,439
hundred pounds a month is probably too

771
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:11,359
much. Uh you want to have market

772
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,278
scarcity.

773
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:18,079
Yeah, we I think we only do produce

774
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:20,960
uh like around 60 pounds a month or so

775
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:23,558
at at our facility. I'm not 100% sure on

776
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:27,038
that, so don't quote me, but we

777
00:31:23,558 --> 00:31:29,798
um I mean it it seems to work better to

778
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:33,200
have a little bit of

779
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:35,519
uh underprouction or scarcity like you

780
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,278
said so that the market uh is just

781
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,240
continuously eating up whatever it is

782
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:42,880
that we put out. Um, but even still with

783
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,480
the downturned price, it's it's crazy. I

784
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:49,440
I uh I I I do hope that at some point

785
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,759
maybe that there is just like more uh

786
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,360
quality recognition for brands and stuff

787
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:55,440
because sometimes it feels as though the

788
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:59,038
the branding doesn't necessarily reflect

789
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,320
the quality and uh that can always be a

790
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:02,960
little bit of a hindrance for the

791
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:05,359
consumer when they go based off of what

792
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,240
they see through social media or

793
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:12,398
otherwise. Um

794
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:14,480
brand brand um transparency and like

795
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:18,079
having a brand that stands up for a

796
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,079
specific thing and and tries to do its

797
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,398
best to fulfill that is is key. I mean,

798
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,398
there have been brands here in Colorado

799
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:26,398
that have fallen because their quality

800
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:29,199
dropped off and they were a quality

801
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:30,959
brand and they lost all consumer trust

802
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,720
because their their quality started

803
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,399
dropping off and then they just fell off

804
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,720
and fell out of the market. So, you do

805
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:42,319
have to be consistent and honest and

806
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,759
transparent with your brands. Uh, a and

807
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:45,678
make sure that you're not overselling

808
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:47,440
your brands and saying, "Hey, this is a

809
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,159
super premium quality brand at a high

810
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,640
price point, but you look at the the

811
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,720
product quality on the shelf next to

812
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,960
another brand and it's it's there's a

813
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,440
huge difference. So what those quality

814
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:03,600
metrics are is so uh so variable uh and

815
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,038
and I would I would even venture to say

816
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:10,959
like subjective

817
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:15,839
um or sorry objective but the uh the end

818
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:17,278
of the day like what every consumer

819
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:19,359
shops for product for a different reason

820
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:22,000
but when you look at market trends a lot

821
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:24,158
of people are shopping still on potency.

822
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,880
Um, potency doesn't always directly

823
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:30,320
correlate to quality, but quality has a

824
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,399
lot of other metrics. I mean, your brand

825
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:33,678
has to be honest and representative of

826
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:35,119
the product you're putting into the

827
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,278
market and know what your target

828
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:40,479
customer base is and satisfy

829
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:42,558
them. Not everyone's going to be the

830
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,679
best quality producer in the state. You

831
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:47,678
know, not everybody wants that. So if

832
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,880
you're trying to sell to the top to 10%

833
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,278
of the of the market and there's a you

834
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,200
know 40% of the industry is trying to do

835
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:56,519
the same thing. I mean there's only so

836
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,519
much

837
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:02,558
room. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

838
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,480
Um it does seem to be this uh this

839
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:07,759
constant battle between quality and

840
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,519
quantity that you hear a lot but I mean

841
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:12,239
there are ways to achieve both

842
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:16,639
especially at the scale um that where

843
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:20,398
it's feasible for that scale and um yeah

844
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:23,280
it doesn't seem like it is even possible

845
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:25,118
to have all of you know if you say 40%

846
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,440
of the brands are trying to v for that

847
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:31,639
top 10% of the spots um it may just be

848
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,280
better to, you

849
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:37,039
know, take accept that maybe there's

850
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,519
brands that are better than yours and

851
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:42,320
just try to find your niche elsewhere

852
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:45,000
rather than be in that top 10%. That

853
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,760
seems like a very hard

854
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,918
uh uh that that almost seems like a

855
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,599
heavy crown to wear cuz then you have to

856
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:57,039
maintain it. Mhm. Absolutely. Yeah. And

857
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,960
every brand has changes in quality and

858
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:01,039
consistency over over the years. You

859
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,280
know, it's it's an unavoidable aspect,

860
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:05,838
but the tighter you can get your

861
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,320
operations and this goes beyond branding

862
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:09,440
10, you know, being in that top 10%.

863
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,119
Right.

864
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,800
So, I think uh you know it goes it goes

865
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,320
getting to that point of consistency to

866
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,160
be able to put out that product in that

867
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,400
top 10% goes a lot it goes far beyond

868
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:24,078
you know just your parameters in your

869
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,920
cultivation and being able to repeat

870
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,400
your processes whether it's irrigation

871
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,920
or environment genetic selection is a

872
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,320
huge piece of that. So like really

873
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,240
making sure that you're driving new

874
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,838
genetic material into the market and

875
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:39,358
bringing in quality cultivars that are

876
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:41,440
sort of setting the pace, right? Because

877
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:43,400
otherwise you're just chasing and you do

878
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,800
have to have a stable of

879
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,960
of you know your sort of staple

880
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,880
cultivars that people like to consume

881
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,119
and know how to maximize those and bring

882
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,480
those to consistency. But yeah, you

883
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:58,400
know, again, it's it's you I couldn't

884
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:02,000
tell you like, okay, you need 50% of

885
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,920
your garden to be these cultivars that

886
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,960
are always selling out that everybody

887
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,800
wants and 50% to be new. I think that's

888
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,280
just always going to be a product of

889
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,760
what your feedback is from the retail,

890
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,320
you know, from from your buyers. And and

891
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,960
so many of these markets are like uh

892
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,640
retail plus wholesale. So they're the

893
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,039
strains that the wholesale buyers want

894
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:24,719
are all often times much different than

895
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,400
what the retail buyers want, but the

896
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:29,358
retail buyers are only buying small

897
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,119
volumes. So you have to figure out how

898
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:33,000
to satisfy demand without distributing

899
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:38,960
resources too

900
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:40,880
far. Yeah, it is that is a great um

901
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,000
description of what we're facing here in

902
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,720
the Oregon market right now. um the the

903
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,079
wholesaler versus the retailer and and

904
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:49,759
just kind of what each of them are

905
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,359
looking for. And it's unfortunate

906
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,240
because the retailer is usually looking

907
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:56,719
for higher quality and are more willing

908
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:59,118
to pay a higher price for that quality

909
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:01,439
because they have the you know that

910
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,358
direct knowledge of their uh customers

911
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,838
and who's going to come in and buy you

912
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:07,920
know 2 ounces a month of that product

913
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:09,679
for the next month and they so they they

914
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,720
already know that they have that sold

915
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:14,000
basically. Um whereas wholesalers, you

916
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:16,480
know, you just go in and they say, "What

917
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,519
do you got for cheap? What's the buy one

918
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,639
uh get one half off?

919
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:25,119
Uh what's your deals of the week?" Um so

920
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:27,759
that that always is a a huge difference

921
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,519
in in what they're looking for. Yeah. So

922
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,440
you're probably prioritizing the

923
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:33,358
retailers, but then the retailers only

924
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,440
can buy so much at a time. And then you

925
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:37,440
have to have, you know, accounts

926
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,119
receivable for a lot of these guys,

927
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,960
these retailers, because they can't

928
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,280
necessarily pay cash on delivery. And

929
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,960
for you to get into all of these

930
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,000
retailers, you have to agree to some

931
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,358
kind of terms in some cases. Um, so

932
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,199
yeah, they're paying the higher price

933
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:52,159
point. It may take a little longer for

934
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:53,519
you to get the money, but you're going

935
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:56,159
to get more. But then you have to have

936
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:59,838
somebody fully dedicated to chasing down

937
00:37:56,159 --> 00:38:04,239
new orders and collecting and you know

938
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:08,239
that that game just becomes high labor.

939
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:10,078
Uh whereas with wholesalers if you can

940
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:12,399
you know just work with a few guys that

941
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:16,599
are purchasing a large volume at a time

942
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:19,119
and they're they maybe are paying lower

943
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:20,720
um you know lower price for your product

944
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:24,240
and are less discretionary on the

945
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:26,159
quality. uh that that still is a high

946
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:28,159
portion of your market. So maybe

947
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:30,239
allocating time and energy to satisfying

948
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:32,960
those customers if they're still driving

949
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:35,199
profits because they're much lower uh

950
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,800
labor cost. That's a that's that's

951
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:38,960
another whole decision. Everybody wants

952
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,599
to be in all the stores and have their

953
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,440
product brand be at the top and get all

954
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,119
that highest price point, but it just

955
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,440
takes so much because you have all the

956
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,519
packaging aspects, all the marketing.

957
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,159
you have to, you know, go to these

958
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:54,159
dispensaries sometimes, set up a table,

959
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:55,519
educate the consumers, you know, there

960
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:58,440
there's a lot that goes into that. And

961
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:01,838
that's not really my my

962
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,358
um sort of knowledge base. I'm not very

963
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:05,519
I mean, we had retails when I was

964
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:07,199
working at BG Good that we were so we

965
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:10,400
sold directly out of a lot of our

966
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:11,519
product out of our own retail and uh you

967
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,519
know, a lot of the strains that I was

968
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:14,800
cultivating either I was bringing in and

969
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:16,719
they would say, "Hey, this is really

970
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,240
great. We got great feedback. Grow more

971
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:19,439
of that." or they were like, "Hey, do

972
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:20,879
you have this? Can you grow this? Can

973
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,400
you do?" And it was like this constant

974
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,720
struggle between because when you're

975
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,559
vertical, you know, you have to balance

976
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:28,639
satisfying the customer demands with

977
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:32,000
what is actually production viable in

978
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:34,639
the facility. Everybody wants, you know,

979
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,559
I don't know what people I mean, a lot

980
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:37,920
of people

981
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:41,119
wanted very specific things like these

982
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,720
really old sativas or like a Durban or

983
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,720
something. And we had some stuff that

984
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:46,799
had it in it that was more production

985
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:48,879
viable. Um, but it was this constant

986
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,800
battle between like product quality

987
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,400
meeting different shelf demands. So we

988
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,800
were putting certain products on the top

989
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,960
shelf, other strains would go into the

990
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,000
middle shelf. And so we were trying to

991
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,599
cover all the bases with one cultivation

992
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,440
in a couple retails that were hitting

993
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,960
all the tiers in the shelves. And I

994
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,720
don't know that there was a lot there

995
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,400
there was a little bit of a still a

996
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:10,719
disconnect there. But from the

997
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,720
cultivation, our focus a lot was on like

998
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:14,159
what is revenue generating? And you

999
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:15,838
know, I learned a lot and you know, we

1000
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:18,159
made a lot of mistakes in terms of like

1001
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:20,078
chasing flavors and wanting to grow

1002
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:21,118
certain strains cuz we liked them cuz we

1003
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,560
thought they were good and we thought

1004
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,480
they would sell and people would want to

1005
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:26,159
buy them. Then we put it out and then

1006
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,838
they didn't. But then we had all these

1007
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:30,000
genetics and production. So we made a

1008
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:32,960
lot of uh a you know we made some

1009
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,599
oversight uh mistakes in terms of you

1010
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,240
know the business aspect of of producing

1011
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:41,519
cultivars for the the consumer. But

1012
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:43,519
often times, you know, the the

1013
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:46,559
cultivation would be backed up on

1014
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:47,920
certain flower cuz the retail couldn't

1015
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:49,519
sell at all cuz we didn't have a lot of

1016
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,119
customers coming in. And then it was

1017
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:53,358
just back and forth. And then sometimes

1018
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,440
they'd clear us out and then we'd be

1019
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:58,719
we'd be running behind and it was just a

1020
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,358
very much like a a roller coaster in

1021
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:03,039
some in some capacities. Sometimes we

1022
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:05,039
did better than others. So there was a

1023
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:07,119
bit of a disconnect and I think that you

1024
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:11,440
know having the operations that when you

1025
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:13,838
when you are vertical uh the that can be

1026
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,519
really uh insulating and and really

1027
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:18,799
positive for a lot of companies because

1028
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:20,880
you're not subject to wholesale bulk

1029
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,318
prices. You know you can if you can move

1030
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,160
your product. So you have to scale it

1031
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:25,599
properly. How much are we producing? How

1032
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:27,838
much are we selling out of the stores?

1033
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,680
we make sure that we if we overproduce,

1034
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:31,838
can we still get a wholesale price that

1035
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:34,399
makes this product worthwhile and viable

1036
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:35,920
and profitable? Um, and do we want our

1037
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,599
product in other people's stores? Like

1038
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,760
then maybe we do want to sell out some

1039
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,280
of our premium brands. You know, there's

1040
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,359
a lot of different things and and that's

1041
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,359
just Colorado. I mean, I'm not as

1042
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:47,119
familiar with the retail game in Oregon,

1043
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:50,000
but I know I can imagine from what I've

1044
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:52,400
heard it's challenging as well. Yeah,

1045
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,760
definitely. I don't I don't know. Um, I

1046
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,440
mean there's a couple vertically

1047
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:00,720
integrated uh cultivation and um retail

1048
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:04,240
spots, but you know, not a bunch of uh

1049
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:06,559
sort of the mom and pop style um

1050
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:10,318
vertically integrated spaces that were

1051
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:11,920
like in Colorado or uh Michigan. Uh you

1052
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:13,920
know, I I believe when Michigan first

1053
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,519
went recreational, everything had to be

1054
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,119
vertically integrated. Um and so things

1055
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:21,759
like that, it Yeah, I don't I don't see

1056
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,599
that much out here in Oregon. Um, but

1057
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,119
you know, when you first entered into

1058
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:30,079
the Colorado market after leaving

1059
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:32,559
um, uh, Florida, what were some of the,

1060
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:35,200
uh, facilities that you you were working

1061
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:37,119
with um, other than be good? And then

1062
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:39,439
tell us some more of the like what you

1063
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:42,800
saw and how you developed more of your

1064
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,280
um, like the key points in which you

1065
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,119
direct your cultivation knowledge. Now,

1066
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,880
um, what were some of those things that

1067
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,200
you saw?

1068
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,640
You know, I I tried to connect with as

1069
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:54,480
many people in the industry when I moved

1070
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:56,159
to Colorado as I could because I had a

1071
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,318
lot of guys that I'd worked with at

1072
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:59,838
Curleaf in Mount Dora that came from

1073
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:02,239
Colorado. They came from a bunch of

1074
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:04,639
different companies like Greenman and,

1075
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:06,479
you know, um, Native Roots and things

1076
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:08,400
like that. So, I tried to build my

1077
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,639
network out there and made some friends

1078
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,960
that were really knowledgeable. That was

1079
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:15,199
where I first really got introduced to

1080
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,800
precision irrigation or crop steering or

1081
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:21,598
kind of you know some of these more uh

1082
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,440
advanced and I guess more precise uh

1083
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,280
strategies. But it gave me the

1084
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,800
opportunity to like get out there, see

1085
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,720
what other people were doing, make some

1086
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,400
friends, and then kind of get some ideas

1087
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:32,239
and bounce feedback off some of my

1088
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,480
colleagues where I could really make all

1089
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:36,078
the decision a lot of the decisions.

1090
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,318
Financially, not so much, but at least

1091
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,560
like cultivation practices like

1092
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:43,599
substrate are we growing in? Uh, you

1093
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:45,759
know, h how are we watering? Um, you

1094
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,680
know, what nutrients are we using? uh

1095
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,079
you know some of these these less

1096
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:52,440
infrastructural more kind of subjective

1097
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,960
arbitrary kind of things that were based

1098
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,960
on per grower preference and grower

1099
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,119
style. So it was easy to pivot cuz the

1100
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,720
first grow that I was running was 125

1101
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,519
lights and then we had a ton of

1102
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:06,879
neighbors. It was in a it's in an area

1103
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:09,599
that uh was no was initially and when

1104
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,200
Colorado went went legal, a lot of

1105
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:14,640
people started building grows in this

1106
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:17,598
particular zone. And so there were uh

1107
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:19,358
there were tons of of facilities in that

1108
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:21,039
area. So there were tons of growers

1109
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:23,039
there. So it was easy to kind of

1110
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:24,880
connect. But then obviously through co

1111
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:26,599
people stopped hanging out and

1112
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,280
connecting. Uh there was a bit of

1113
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:31,280
isolation. Um, but yeah, I mean, you

1114
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,720
know, I got I kind of got to meet some

1115
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,280
of the bigger players and some people

1116
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:37,519
who were doing doing things well, but a

1117
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,880
lot of people and still to this day, but

1118
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:42,239
especially back then, a lot of people

1119
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:45,599
had not adopted drip irrigation even or

1120
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:48,239
um uh you know, LEDs were just everyone

1121
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,160
was very resistant to to upgrading

1122
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:53,199
technologies and getting new things and

1123
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:56,960
you know um it was it was it was

1124
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:59,279
definitely uh eye opening to see how

1125
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,800
many people were so committed to this

1126
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:05,800
like home grower style growing strategy

1127
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,560
and you know being able to like dive

1128
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:11,440
into you know I worked with EST Tech

1129
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:13,358
Lighting that's how I met David um and

1130
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:17,280
he introduced me to a lot of different

1131
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:19,759
technologies you know Aoya obviously was

1132
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,040
uh partially through him just as in he

1133
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,960
was one of the few people I knew

1134
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:25,838
actually had used at that point and I

1135
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,440
had done a demo with them but we we got

1136
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:29,599
priced out a little bit And so there

1137
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,559
were these like different

1138
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:34,000
uh different things like LEDs and how to

1139
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:35,759
use them properly cuz a lot of people

1140
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,119
struggled to get yield with LEDs in

1141
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,400
Colorado. And a lot of it was

1142
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,240
infrastructural like people with

1143
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,119
drywall. Everyone has mold problems

1144
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:45,919
here. Everybody's dealing with betritis

1145
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,039
or some kind of a aspiggillis

1146
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,559
contamination where they have to

1147
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:50,559
decontaminate flour and they don't have

1148
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:51,920
the facilities to drive clean

1149
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:53,920
infrastructure. That's one of the things

1150
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,079
that's really nice about Michigan is

1151
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:59,119
people built these grows with like DPS

1152
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:02,480
paneling and uh you know a lot of the

1153
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:07,119
right um not all I mean by by no means

1154
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:08,480
is it like overall kind of dialed but uh

1155
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,920
people did things a bit better because

1156
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,639
they learned from the mistakes of the

1157
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,639
Colorado guys and maybe Oregon. you see

1158
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:16,639
a lot of drywall, a lot of exposed wood,

1159
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:19,358
a lot of spray foam, a lot of things

1160
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:22,318
that are like uh potential surface area

1161
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:25,039
contamination risks. And you know, I

1162
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:27,119
think that's a a major thing I learned a

1163
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:30,480
lot about working there was how to

1164
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:33,680
manage uh microbial issues in the garden

1165
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,000
and how to manage pest issues as well.

1166
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:38,159
But uh because we had so many grows

1167
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,679
nearby, we had so many vectors for

1168
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:41,679
issues and guys working in the grow that

1169
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:43,598
home home grows or whatever. But yeah,

1170
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:45,919
dealing with betritis and mold and that

1171
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:49,280
sort of thing. Like I tried the reactive

1172
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,519
oxygen generators, hepoiltration, UV,

1173
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,680
PCO, whatever. You know, I tried all

1174
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:56,480
these different ways to passive and

1175
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:58,239
active sanitation, spraying, zero. I

1176
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,960
mean, everyone was doing tons of

1177
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:02,959
different things. No one really knew a

1178
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,920
good solution. Everyone's rad sourcing

1179
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,838
flowers. So,

1180
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,599
um, yeah, I mean, you know, to to touch

1181
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:12,400
back on your point of like what did I

1182
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:15,280
learn? What did I see? Being so close to

1183
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,280
so many different craft grows and being

1184
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,480
able to make a lot of those decisions.

1185
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,040
Obviously, I didn't get to choose the

1186
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,639
HVAC or the lighting or the racking or

1187
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:25,679
anything. So, we had a huge problem with

1188
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:27,199
runoff where we really weren't able to

1189
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:30,159
drive much runoff cuz we didn't have

1190
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:32,879
floor drains. Um, we had to learn how to

1191
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:35,920
steer our plants with the least amount

1192
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:38,079
of water and fertilizer we could

1193
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,599
um to get the the desired outcomes,

1194
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,200
which was very limiting and very

1195
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,720
challenging to get yield because we were

1196
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:46,719
having hard times bulking obviously uh

1197
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:48,639
and making sure that our pH and runoff

1198
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:50,399
was in balance. But, you know, that was

1199
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:52,078
some of the the stuff that was a little

1200
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,838
bit newer to me when I got there that I

1201
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,240
think I developed a really high level of

1202
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:58,000
proficiency in was just doing what I

1203
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:59,598
could with what I got. you know, like

1204
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,559
having to problem solve and troubleshoot

1205
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:04,800
and figure out a way around it around,

1206
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,318
you know, limitations.

1207
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:10,000
I feel like that builds such a great

1208
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:12,079
foundation though for um future

1209
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,400
knowledge application, right? So,

1210
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:16,400
because now you have um the

1211
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,800
understanding of how the parts work, you

1212
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,800
can take those parts and uh reassemble

1213
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,559
them in a way that works better for uh

1214
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,920
the scenario that you then have at hand

1215
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:27,599
in the future. Um, and I I always like

1216
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,880
to think of it as like a big puzzle,

1217
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,519
right? And you're you're building that

1218
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,599
border of the puzzle. And when you get

1219
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:35,519
that last corner piece in or side piece

1220
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:38,400
in, everything else starts to just kind

1221
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:40,159
of fall into place. Um, but it is a a

1222
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,240
puzzle at first trying to figure out

1223
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:43,920
where the different pieces go. Then once

1224
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:46,078
you see it, you get that bigger picture

1225
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,440
and you can kind of plug and play with

1226
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:51,039
all those different things that you've

1227
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:53,599
built your knowledge on over years of uh

1228
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:55,679
you know experiencing

1229
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,318
uh let's say like a water line fails or

1230
00:48:55,679 --> 00:49:01,679
you need a bypass on something or you

1231
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:03,519
need some redundancy in your airflow or

1232
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:05,358
your dehumidification or something

1233
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:07,358
because oh it went down this one time

1234
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:10,318
and the whole room turned into a giant

1235
00:49:07,358 --> 00:49:11,920
mold fest. Um so you you you see all

1236
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:15,358
these things over time and you start to

1237
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:18,159
build uh a bigger resilience for issues

1238
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:20,000
as they get thrown at you. Yeah,

1239
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:22,799
absolutely. I mean you know dealing with

1240
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,280
the well if this happens then we do this

1241
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,960
always as a result of having p you know

1242
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,200
real world experience with those things.

1243
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,559
It's very hard to solve problems that

1244
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:32,159
you've never dealt with without the

1245
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,319
right tools or at least some sort of

1246
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:36,159
reference. And not being afraid to ask

1247
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:38,239
experts for help or people that you know

1248
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:40,078
have a higher level of knowledge or

1249
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:41,838
experience on something. I did that a

1250
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,680
lot in the beginning. I relied a lot on

1251
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:45,759
my network and my people to be like,

1252
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:47,519
"Hey, what do I do about this? What this

1253
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,760
is going on? What would you do in this

1254
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:52,239
situation? Hey, we had this outbreak or

1255
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:54,480
we had this um or I had this person who

1256
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:56,159
was really challenging to work with." uh

1257
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,199
you know all these things like a water

1258
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:00,960
line busted, a pump went down, uh I had

1259
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:04,318
to handwater, you know, there were times

1260
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:08,559
when our fertigation skid. I won't say

1261
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:10,800
you know uh who it was, but yeah, like I

1262
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:12,720
went to go upgrade cuz we had to do this

1263
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:15,599
in order for the skid to function, we

1264
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:18,480
had to upgrade the firmware in the or

1265
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:20,640
the software and I had to replace this

1266
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,079
component and it was like over a weekend

1267
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:23,920
and the whole thing failed. So, I had to

1268
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,720
come in overnight and hand water

1269
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,960
rockwool like in two flower rooms just

1270
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:30,879
spent the whole night watering uh hand

1271
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,358
watering rockwool and like that was just

1272
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,119
like a really Yeah, it was like there

1273
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:38,239
was no other way to do it. I couldn't,

1274
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:39,680
you know, get my fertilizer to mix. So,

1275
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:41,439
there's little things like that happen

1276
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:44,078
where oh, we had a room flood cuz a

1277
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:46,159
solenoid valve stayed open. Um, how do

1278
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:48,640
you bounce the plants back from getting

1279
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:51,519
flooded like entirely flooded with RO

1280
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:53,759
water all night? you know, what do you

1281
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:55,920
do? You you you don't want to overwater

1282
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,440
them, you know, and fortunately at that

1283
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,838
time I was playing around with some

1284
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,079
dissolved oxygen bubblers and like

1285
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:04,719
little things like, okay, like I know if

1286
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,920
this this situation happens based on

1287
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:07,519
this situation that happened to me

1288
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,880
before, like this is what I I think

1289
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:11,679
would be the outcome and what I could

1290
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:14,800
see being being the outcome.

1291
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:17,039
Um but uh but I I you know I I even to

1292
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,359
this day I still rely a lot on on

1293
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:20,880
feedback and and ideas from my

1294
00:51:19,358 --> 00:51:22,558
colleagues and I think that's help

1295
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,200
what's helped me just in the

1296
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:26,960
resourcefulness aspect right like

1297
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:28,399
figuring out how to problem solve and

1298
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,480
troubleshoot things when like building

1299
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,720
my own env you know I worked with one of

1300
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,639
the guys at the company to build our own

1301
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:36,519
environmental controls platform because

1302
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:39,279
we didn't have one and we just had

1303
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:41,199
thermostats and it was like how are we

1304
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,680
managing our environment with wall

1305
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:45,679
thermostats and wall humidistats. So, we

1306
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:48,399
start we got some Ecobees, we got some

1307
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:50,078
relays, we took the home assistant

1308
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,400
program and we put it all up and built

1309
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:53,519
this dashboard, sent protocols and

1310
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,440
signals and we could look at our

1311
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:57,759
trending data over time and like, you

1312
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,000
know, that that worked like to an

1313
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,599
extent. It wasn't great, but it was

1314
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,239
better than not having anything, you

1315
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:07,838
know. Um, yeah. So, uh, so little things

1316
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:09,439
like that or like building out a full

1317
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:11,199
irrigation system in a grow that was

1318
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,880
handwatered without any resources. Like

1319
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:15,759
I had to figure out where to get tanks

1320
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,680
and pumps and solenoids and PVC piping

1321
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,319
and just scrap it from different places.

1322
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:22,239
The old grow, whatever it was, put it on

1323
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:24,400
my orders for nutrients. So, it wasn't

1324
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:26,558
like, you know, adding to the cost. Like

1325
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,079
little things like that. and and you

1326
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:31,359
know coming into a grow that had three

1327
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,800
bedrooms and they're all open to like

1328
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:34,159
whenever you walk into the grow you walk

1329
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,400
right into the mom room and there's

1330
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:39,279
spidermite webs and okay how do we fix

1331
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,680
this and consolidate the the amount of

1332
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,760
the education I got on solving problems

1333
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:46,078
in a highly dysfunctional environment

1334
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,559
and grow across many of the facilities

1335
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,480
that I've operated in is I think you

1336
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:52,359
know like there's there's an aspect to

1337
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,039
it that's like

1338
00:52:52,358 --> 00:52:56,960
um you know you learn a lot about what

1339
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:58,960
not to do and and design and build, but

1340
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,960
you also learn how to like make do with

1341
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,838
what you got and figure out how to get

1342
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,440
get to optimal, not ideal, you know, and

1343
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:09,119
that's a conversation I have with people

1344
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:11,679
often is, you know, we chase ideal and I

1345
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,119
chased ideal for a long time of like

1346
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:14,480
what is the ideal conditions? What are

1347
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,119
the what's the ideal environment? What's

1348
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:19,400
this ideal substrate look like? But if

1349
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:23,559
you don't have ideal conditions, like

1350
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:26,559
ideal like, you know, a setting that is

1351
00:53:23,559 --> 00:53:28,240
um sort of and nothing's really truly

1352
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:30,559
ideal, I guess, cuz you could always

1353
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:32,318
take it to the next step. But, you know,

1354
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:34,079
making the best out of the environment

1355
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:35,759
you have, which might mean, hey, at

1356
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,599
night time, we can't turn our nighttime

1357
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,839
temps down because we don't have enough

1358
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:44,240
dehumidification to pull out to keep

1359
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:46,558
that 1.2 or 3 VPD at 70°. So, we can't

1360
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:48,318
go down to 70. Um, but So, what do we do

1361
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:50,200
instead? How do we solve that problem?

1362
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:52,480
You know, we can't run the rooms as

1363
00:53:50,199 --> 00:53:55,439
cold, whatever the case may be. We can't

1364
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,880
buy more dehumidification. Um, that sort

1365
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,240
of thing, like, you know, you're like,

1366
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,760
okay, well, what's going to be the best

1367
00:53:58,239 --> 00:54:01,598
outcome with what we do have to work

1368
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,880
with? For sure. And, you know, if we

1369
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:05,200
can't run our plants off, how do we

1370
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:08,400
stack EC and then also drive EC down in

1371
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:11,199
the substrate later in flower? Um,

1372
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,039
right. I feel like it's um it's a common

1373
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:14,960
thread on this podcast that we end up

1374
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:16,880
bringing up Liebig's law and the

1375
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,880
different staves of the barrel and how

1376
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,400
if you have a limiting factor in one of

1377
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,318
those staves, then the water is just

1378
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,639
going to overflow before it hits the top

1379
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:26,159
of the barrel. But a lot of people look

1380
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:28,078
at that and they say, "Hey, I want to

1381
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:30,318
bring that stave all the way up so that

1382
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:32,160
you have a full barrel." But sometimes

1383
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:34,000
they need to think maybe I just need to

1384
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:36,879
cut the rest of the barrel off where

1385
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:40,960
that stave is so that I can get optimal

1386
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:42,400
performance at the um you know the you

1387
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,240
have your limiting factor bring

1388
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,400
everything else down to operate within

1389
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:48,799
the the best possible parameters for

1390
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:51,920
that limiting factor. Sometimes you end

1391
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:54,000
up uh doing much better than you would

1392
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:57,358
think you would be doing when you say oh

1393
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,679
I'm operating at 75%. how can I I'm not

1394
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:02,400
going to get 75% of my product.

1395
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:04,318
Sometimes you end up getting 85% or 90%

1396
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,880
of what you might have got at 100%

1397
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:11,119
because sometimes you have diminishing

1398
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:13,358
returns on yield um based on you know as

1399
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:15,680
you you can only give it so much before

1400
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:19,039
you start to see diminishing returns.

1401
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:20,639
And so um I that's a very very valid

1402
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,880
point. And I'm glad you brought that up

1403
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:24,639
because we tend to bring this up all the

1404
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,440
time on the podcast and I feel like

1405
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:31,279
especially for home growers or smaller

1406
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:33,519
commercial cultivators. Um you do get

1407
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,519
kind of lost in the sauce of I want the

1408
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:37,838
best. I want to have everything perfect.

1409
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:40,079
I I got to make sure that I I just

1410
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:42,000
optimize optimize. And then eventually

1411
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:44,000
you start to see a I can't really get

1412
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,280
past this one point. Ah it's okay. just

1413
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,159
bring everything back down there cuz you

1414
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:50,640
were probably producing some fire flour

1415
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:52,719
at that level or just consistent, you

1416
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:54,879
know, like you're not over you're not

1417
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:56,719
frying your plants by just over revving

1418
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:00,640
the engine. Yeah. And and I think

1419
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:04,000
there's some nuance to that too. Uh

1420
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:06,159
the um what I what I have noticed is

1421
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,960
like let's just take CO2 for example,

1422
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:10,879
right? like if

1423
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:13,039
you which other levers or which other

1424
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:18,000
staves in that barrel are more impacted

1425
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:19,920
by a limitation on CO2. Um like cuz and

1426
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,400
this I I bring this up cuz I've seen

1427
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:25,039
this in facilities recently here in

1428
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:27,280
Colorado there's like sometimes a uh a

1429
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:28,798
shortage and like you have CO2 and then

1430
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,640
the next day you don't and so you don't

1431
00:56:28,798 --> 00:56:32,159
have it for a certain period of time.

1432
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:35,039
you have to make real-time adjustments

1433
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:38,399
to your light intensity and you know

1434
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:40,000
even your nutrient inputs and uh your

1435
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,920
irrigation strategies because you're not

1436
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:46,159
assimilating as much carbon into that

1437
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:49,838
plant. Um so that CO2 uptake can maybe

1438
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:51,920
it has a heavier relationship on uh

1439
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:55,279
water demand but also your your light

1440
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,880
intensity has to be uh equally changed.

1441
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,880
So, you know, and and this is more

1442
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,599
open-ended, too, but to say like, you

1443
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:04,079
know, some of these limitations like how

1444
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:06,880
I can only do three irrigation events a

1445
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:09,200
day on my irrigation controller. Okay.

1446
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,200
Well, can we even is it even worth

1447
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:13,279
trying to do P2s if you're only getting

1448
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:15,838
three events? Like, maybe we can't bulk

1449
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,680
our plants properly and we don't want

1450
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:20,078
channeling. So, we're like, well, how do

1451
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:21,440
we first of all, the easy like obvious

1452
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:22,960
thing would be, hey, how do we get more

1453
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,639
events? Let's put an open sprinkler in

1454
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,079
or whatever it is. But maybe there's

1455
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:27,679
sometimes where you just don't have that

1456
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:29,920
option

1457
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:33,039
uh or don't have the capital, you know,

1458
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:35,280
and and maybe that's a bad uh a bad

1459
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:36,400
example, but you're like, well, you

1460
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,240
know, maybe it's a good thing we can't

1461
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,000
bulk because we actually can't pull that

1462
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:41,358
much moisture out of the room that, you

1463
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,639
know, we we don't have enough dehue to

1464
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:44,239
pull as much water that we're putting

1465
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:47,358
into the room out. And that's an

1466
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:49,118
infrastructural thing. Um or we just

1467
00:57:47,358 --> 00:57:51,039
have too many strains in one irrigation

1468
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:53,358
zone. We're trying to water too many

1469
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:54,558
different strains all the same way

1470
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:56,519
because we need to have this much

1471
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:58,960
variety, but we don't have that much

1472
00:57:56,519 --> 00:58:01,119
control, you know? I mean, and and you

1473
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,880
still see cultivations that have like

1474
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:04,798
multiple stages of flower in the same

1475
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:08,000
room. I mean, I've seen it recently, and

1476
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:11,119
it kind of shocks me still, but um to be

1477
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,719
able to to say, hey, we have one room,

1478
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:14,880
so we have to keep the environment the

1479
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:17,199
same for all the plants in all stages of

1480
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:19,920
growth. The only things we can change is

1481
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:21,838
irrigation strategy. uh and nutrient

1482
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,280
maybe even potentially nutrient inputs,

1483
00:58:21,838 --> 00:58:25,358
but if you have one or two batch tanks

1484
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:28,880
for the whole room, you know, there's

1485
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:30,798
little like nuances to this stave, you

1486
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:34,480
know, the the height of each stave in

1487
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:36,079
the barrel at at each time. Uh it would

1488
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,079
be really interesting to dive deeper

1489
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:40,720
into the specific dynamics of

1490
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:42,960
relationship between one one stave to

1491
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:45,439
another over leveling the whole

1492
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,519
equalizer. like, you know, we're we're

1493
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:50,960
looking at a sound board and we're

1494
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:53,358
trying to equalize everything, right? I

1495
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,358
I I like that a lot because yeah, just

1496
00:58:53,358 --> 00:58:58,400
cutting it all off at that one stave may

1497
00:58:55,358 --> 00:59:01,119
not actually be optimal. Um, and you

1498
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,798
know, if it is maybe that only two other

1499
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:06,480
staves need to be lowered in order for

1500
00:59:02,798 --> 00:59:10,400
you to continue to operate at an op uh

1501
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:12,000
an option optimal output, then um you

1502
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,880
should probably do that rather than

1503
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,400
limiting everything. especially if by

1504
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:20,079
limiting everything else, you're also

1505
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:23,358
either reducing quality or quantity or

1506
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:25,519
um potentially uh inviting other issues

1507
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:28,239
like mold or mildew or other things like

1508
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:31,039
that. And um so yeah, that's a very the

1509
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:33,439
nuances are are extremely important and

1510
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:35,838
uh those are also subjective for the

1511
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,440
facility that you're looking at or for

1512
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:38,798
the home growth situation that you're

1513
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,559
looking at. You know, like one of the

1514
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:42,000
biggest things that I see home growers

1515
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:45,519
struggle with if they're just growing in

1516
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,838
a tent is um their exhaust versus intake

1517
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:49,159
and the positioning for those two. If if

1518
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:52,480
the tent needs

1519
00:59:49,159 --> 00:59:54,399
to go hotter, then you need to make sure

1520
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,559
that you're pulling hot air in and

1521
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,079
putting it in at the bottom. And if it

1522
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:00,319
needs to go cooler, you need to pull

1523
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,839
cool air in and put it in at the top so

1524
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:04,159
that it can come down over the light.

1525
01:00:01,838 --> 01:00:07,759
And it's just like little tiny nuances

1526
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:10,078
that you um you can optimize but

1527
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:13,520
definitely need to know the situation

1528
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:17,200
that you're facing um in order to do so.

1529
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:20,079
Um so after Yeah. And so after uh you

1530
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:23,519
kind of went into the Colorado market uh

1531
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:25,599
have you uh remained in the Colorado

1532
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:29,199
market since you moved there from uh

1533
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:32,359
Cure Leaf? So I moved here in 2020, got

1534
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:36,798
involved in the commercial uh indoor

1535
01:00:32,358 --> 01:00:39,598
cultivation then and uh and I left the

1536
01:00:36,798 --> 01:00:42,639
last facility that I was operating in in

1537
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:45,920
January of last year. Uh so ever since

1538
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:49,519
so I the two facilities that I operated

1539
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:53,280
in that I ran here um one you know both

1540
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:55,039
in Denver both relatively small um very

1541
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:58,960
different environment between the two

1542
01:00:55,039 --> 01:01:01,199
but uh long story short is I left due to

1543
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:04,559
a variety of reasons. One was the

1544
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:07,598
company selling the facility um you know

1545
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:09,519
financial issues within the company um

1546
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:11,200
and then just other opportunities that

1547
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:14,559
presented themselves. I started working

1548
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:17,598
as the sort of uh technical adviser and

1549
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:18,760
and sales uh person at ScienceLED in

1550
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:22,160
September of

1551
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:23,520
2023 I want to say. Yeah. Um, so for

1552
01:01:22,159 --> 01:01:25,039
several months I was running the

1553
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:27,838
facility,

1554
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:32,480
uh, and I was working for, um, the

1555
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:34,239
lighting company and we had, you know,

1556
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,079
several different iterations of that,

1557
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:38,318
but part of that was I was able to bring

1558
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:40,720
on a couple guys part-time to help do

1559
01:01:38,318 --> 01:01:44,159
the day-to-day cultivation operations

1560
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:45,798
until the um, we were able to get kind

1561
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:49,279
of stabilized to an extent,

1562
01:01:45,798 --> 01:01:51,838
which led to uh, some complications or

1563
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:54,160
conflicts of interest within in money

1564
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:56,798
flowing in the company, money, you know,

1565
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:58,399
kind of moving and, you know, without

1566
01:01:56,798 --> 01:02:01,358
getting into too much detail, there was

1567
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:03,160
a big sort of conflict between the

1568
01:02:01,358 --> 01:02:05,519
current employer and, you know, both

1569
01:02:03,159 --> 01:02:08,399
employers and so I had to kind of step

1570
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:11,480
away from the garden and focus full-time

1571
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:13,838
on the the lighting company.

1572
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:15,519
So, yeah. So, then that's where I

1573
01:02:13,838 --> 01:02:18,880
transitioned out of full-time commercial

1574
01:02:15,519 --> 01:02:22,480
growing was about a year ago.

1575
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:25,519
Wow. And um since then uh it sounds like

1576
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:28,358
you worked at ScienceLED and then um

1577
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:32,079
have also now transitioned over to uh

1578
01:02:28,358 --> 01:02:34,719
Aoya um the the substrate and

1579
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:37,119
environmental monitoring and uh data

1580
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:39,358
platform. Uh can you talk a little bit

1581
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:41,519
about your time there and um sort of

1582
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:45,039
what your experience has been?

1583
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:49,119
Yeah, I mean um you know I also I

1584
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:52,199
started my consulting business in 2022

1585
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:54,960
uh just due to a variety of things that

1586
01:02:52,199 --> 01:02:57,279
were introduced to me as opportunities

1587
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,960
to generate more revenue, bring some

1588
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,559
more value, step out of the garden and

1589
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,318
into the bigger picture of the industry.

1590
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:04,559
And it was all opportunistic, right?

1591
01:03:02,318 --> 01:03:06,239
like referrals with certain companies

1592
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:08,240
that were like, "Hey, I know, you know,

1593
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:10,639
maybe you want to work with us in some

1594
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:13,399
capacity, but not, you know, fully, that

1595
01:03:10,639 --> 01:03:16,639
sort of thing. genetics opportunities to

1596
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:19,920
to potentially create some genetics

1597
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:22,000
licensing deals or work with certain

1598
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:24,480
providers that I trusted when other

1599
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:27,199
people asked, "Hey, do you have a a

1600
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:28,880
connection to a trusted nursery?" That

1601
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:31,919
once tissue culture started becoming

1602
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:34,079
more mainstream in the preservation and

1603
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:36,000
cleaning of genetics, I was able to

1604
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:37,599
establish some good relationships there.

1605
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,318
So, there was all these little pieces

1606
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:42,160
that kind of flew like fell together. uh

1607
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:44,159
and then you know sort of negotiating

1608
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:45,838
hey I have this entity I'm willing to

1609
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:48,798
have an employment contract with you

1610
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:50,960
full-time while I also have this entity

1611
01:03:48,798 --> 01:03:52,318
that I'm doing outside you know work in

1612
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,559
as long as there's no conflict of

1613
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:56,239
interest. Um you know working at science

1614
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:59,920
was really interesting. I learned a lot

1615
01:03:56,239 --> 01:04:02,719
about uh just the mechanics of of LED

1616
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:06,000
lighting and diode manufacturing

1617
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:08,719
uh spectrum drivers, the nuances on

1618
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,838
driver technology and and diode

1619
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:15,598
technology and lensing and optics. Uh,

1620
01:04:11,838 --> 01:04:17,920
you know, I had been using the um EST

1621
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:21,519
Tech fixtures, but I'd also ran we we

1622
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:24,559
had Fluence at um at Curleaf and I had

1623
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:26,798
gotten some GVAS and uh you know, so I'd

1624
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:28,640
used a variety of different LEDs and I

1625
01:04:26,798 --> 01:04:30,318
had science LEDs in the one of the

1626
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:32,239
facilities in one of my rooms cuz we got

1627
01:04:30,318 --> 01:04:34,639
a rebate. So, the rebates were really

1628
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:36,879
cool. Colorado was really, you know,

1629
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:39,118
doing well, giving out a lot of rebates

1630
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,880
to Excel Energy. So, I saw an

1631
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:42,880
opportunity there to leverage my network

1632
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:45,280
and my connections and say, "Hey, I can

1633
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:48,318
probably get these lights into more

1634
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:50,798
facilities and and uh you know, that

1635
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:52,639
sort of thing." So, I I did that. Um,

1636
01:04:50,798 --> 01:04:54,960
you know, got some cool projects in, but

1637
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:57,440
I really focused a lot on learning and

1638
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:59,280
advising and helping them with their

1639
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:01,760
growers because I had replaced the guy

1640
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:05,359
who had previously been doing that uh

1641
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:07,599
there. He'd moved on to another job. Um,

1642
01:05:05,358 --> 01:05:09,679
so yeah, there was a lot to learn from.

1643
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:12,160
So, we had a lot of home growers. We had

1644
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:14,318
a lot of uh living soil producers

1645
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:17,920
indoors and greenhouse. We had a lot of

1646
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:19,440
guys that were producing rosin. Um, you

1647
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,920
know, a lot of solvent lists that really

1648
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:24,000
like the dynamic spectrum, very small

1649
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:28,119
scale, small batch. And then we also had

1650
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:30,400
like planet 13 and we had um some bigger

1651
01:05:28,119 --> 01:05:33,519
facilities and and we were working with

1652
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:36,240
a greenhouse manufacturer with uh one of

1653
01:05:33,519 --> 01:05:38,798
the larger um se like breeding research

1654
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:40,879
facilities in commercial agriculture.

1655
01:05:38,798 --> 01:05:44,239
Um, so there was a lot of interesting

1656
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:47,119
distribution of uh of resources in that

1657
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:48,558
company towards different markets and uh

1658
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:50,559
and I really actually enjoyed and

1659
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:52,480
appreciated kind of taking a step

1660
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:54,240
outside of cannabis too and going to

1661
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:57,679
some of these research conferences cuz I

1662
01:05:54,239 --> 01:05:59,199
got to go to NC 101 which is a

1663
01:05:57,679 --> 01:06:00,719
conference which is a state of the

1664
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:04,078
industry conference for controlled

1665
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:06,199
environment agriculture from vendors to

1666
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:09,039
university professors to private

1667
01:06:06,199 --> 01:06:10,798
research all that. Wow. And that was

1668
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:13,839
really interesting. Um, and then, you

1669
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:16,159
know, a couple of, uh, non-cannabis

1670
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:17,838
related research conferences and just

1671
01:06:16,159 --> 01:06:19,920
general conferences, which was really

1672
01:06:17,838 --> 01:06:22,239
fun. Um, cuz I was also really

1673
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:26,079
interested and still am in kind of

1674
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:27,838
branching out outside of cannabis. Same

1675
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:30,720
with the decision to go to Roya. I mean,

1676
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:32,558
Aoya is working uh working with one of

1677
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:34,558
the largest raspberry producers in the

1678
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:37,200
world and using some of our technology

1679
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:39,680
to help grow raspberries and substrate

1680
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:42,000
uh to a much higher yield and and all

1681
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:44,399
that. So, there's a lot there. I'm not

1682
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,400
going to go too deep into that, but uh

1683
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:49,280
that was really fascinating to see sort

1684
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:52,240
of the cross-pollination of CA and

1685
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:54,559
cannabis. Cannabis can sometimes be for

1686
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:56,000
the CA guys a black box or like we don't

1687
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:58,720
want to get involved. there's legal

1688
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,719
issues with research, but then there's a

1689
01:06:58,719 --> 01:07:02,399
lot of innovations and ability to

1690
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:04,719
leverage new technology and cannabis

1691
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:07,039
that isn't accessible to the CA guys as

1692
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:08,798
much. So, it was interesting to watch

1693
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:14,079
those two worlds kind of collide and

1694
01:07:08,798 --> 01:07:18,400
walk in between them. For sure. Um I uh

1695
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:21,119
I believe it was uh uh Ramsay Nubani. uh

1696
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:24,160
I think he worked at Aoya for a while

1697
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:26,400
and um he's provided some excellent

1698
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:28,558
information kind of circa the era that

1699
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:31,280
you're talking about where there was

1700
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:33,920
this um this push for controlled

1701
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:36,559
environment agriculture knowledge and

1702
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:39,838
applications to start to be used within

1703
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:43,119
the cannabis industry and um kind of

1704
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:45,440
vice versa by taking you know this high

1705
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:48,318
ticket item uh commodity item like

1706
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:52,000
cannabis and using some of those extra

1707
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:54,639
funds that were um generated by its high

1708
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,358
ticket price to be put back into

1709
01:07:54,639 --> 01:08:00,078
internal research for some facilities.

1710
01:07:57,358 --> 01:08:02,078
And it does seem like um you know like

1711
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:04,559
tomato growers have been growing using

1712
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:08,160
generative and vegetative steering cues

1713
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:11,440
for vining tomatoes for decades and been

1714
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:16,278
using it successfully to produce um you

1715
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:21,759
know extremely highly productive and uh

1716
01:08:16,279 --> 01:08:23,199
nutriently um dense produce. Uh so it it

1717
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:25,279
only makes sense that something else

1718
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:29,678
like cannabis with such a high nutrient

1719
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:31,920
demand would benefit from the use of um

1720
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:35,039
different uh steering cues and just

1721
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:39,199
different um different horicultural

1722
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:40,198
practices that are typically kind of

1723
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:44,479
reserved

1724
01:08:40,198 --> 01:08:46,318
for food production or otherwise. Um and

1725
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:48,399
it it is really interesting to see these

1726
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:50,798
worlds sort of collide. Um, I always

1727
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:54,238
point people towards plant empowerment

1728
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:56,000
if they want to look into some of the

1729
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:59,039
more refined practices and

1730
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:01,039
understandings of how plants act and

1731
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:03,439
respond to their environment and their

1732
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:06,238
different inputs. Um, because cannabis

1733
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:07,919
is just another plant and it is going to

1734
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:10,399
do a lot of the things that other plants

1735
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:12,798
do and we typically put it up on this

1736
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:15,599
pedestal in the cannabis community as

1737
01:09:12,798 --> 01:09:18,158
saying that it's this magical uh special

1738
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:20,719
plant. Um, and it does have some really

1739
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:24,079
unique qualities, but in the end it it

1740
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:25,679
is just a uh a water pump, right? It's

1741
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:28,238
just putting water from the ground out

1742
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:30,640
into the air and uh assimilating

1743
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:32,479
nutrients in the process. So

1744
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:34,798
understanding that a lot of plants are

1745
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:37,278
like that is I feel it it kind of

1746
01:09:34,798 --> 01:09:40,399
demystifies but also opens up an avenue

1747
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:42,799
for people to look into different uh

1748
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:45,278
aspects of controlled environment

1749
01:09:42,798 --> 01:09:49,359
agriculture or other horicultural or

1750
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:51,520
agricultural research that is um it can

1751
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:53,600
be applied and it can be used for the

1752
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:56,640
benefit of the cannabis community uh

1753
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:59,520
especially as growers. Mhm. Yeah. I

1754
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:02,079
think a large amount of the resources to

1755
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:04,239
that end are being invested in lighting.

1756
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:08,079
uh from what I observed um in terms of

1757
01:10:04,238 --> 01:10:10,000
like you know uh research agg obviously

1758
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:12,158
breeding and genetics is a big part of

1759
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,840
it too but um but what I was mostly

1760
01:10:12,158 --> 01:10:16,399
interested at science was learning a bit

1761
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:18,400
about some of the uh spectrum research

1762
01:10:16,399 --> 01:10:21,839
on plant growth and sharing that cuz

1763
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:24,319
that was a very under uh not very well

1764
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,920
understood aspect of cannabis production

1765
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:28,079
specifically but just plant production

1766
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:31,199
in general fluence did a good job of

1767
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:32,719
doing a lot of research on far red uh

1768
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:35,519
there's been a lot of studies that have

1769
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:37,600
come out on different impacts of red at

1770
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:39,280
different times of the the day, whether

1771
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:42,239
that's actually effective or not. If

1772
01:10:39,279 --> 01:10:44,559
it's, you know, vers 640 nm versus 660

1773
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:46,238
nm. I mean, there's all these specific

1774
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,480
nuances that you can get into with

1775
01:10:46,238 --> 01:10:50,959
lighting and spectrum and timing and

1776
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:54,079
whether it actually helps or not, what

1777
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:55,920
cultivars, what varieties uh respond

1778
01:10:54,079 --> 01:10:57,198
better. Um, so that was one of the

1779
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,199
things that I was most interested in,

1780
01:10:57,198 --> 01:11:01,839
but I did see that was quite a big topic

1781
01:10:59,198 --> 01:11:03,799
of conversation. and irrigation still is

1782
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:06,319
a is a large, you know, nutrient

1783
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:09,239
assimilation. Bugby did a big study on

1784
01:11:06,319 --> 01:11:13,399
phosphorus. I mean, there's so many

1785
01:11:09,238 --> 01:11:16,158
um different approaches within the CA

1786
01:11:13,399 --> 01:11:17,679
space to what they're trying to do. So,

1787
01:11:16,158 --> 01:11:20,399
they're trying to do research to figure

1788
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:22,640
out how to get better produce, better

1789
01:11:20,399 --> 01:11:26,639
quality produce, better nutrient density

1790
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:28,960
in their produce, um uh more yield, uh

1791
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:30,800
more hearty plants. I mean, you know, as

1792
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:33,039
the climate changes and evolves, a lot

1793
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:35,279
of the CA guys are in green houses. So,

1794
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:37,920
they're figuring out like using tools

1795
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:41,519
like CDROA to manage the greenhouse like

1796
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:43,440
the autonomous um the the grower

1797
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,199
challenge that they they usually win.

1798
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:47,198
So, it's like, you know, there's a lot

1799
01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:49,439
of different facets to it, but it is

1800
01:11:47,198 --> 01:11:52,399
interesting to see, well, hey, AI and

1801
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:54,000
and and machine learning in general um

1802
01:11:52,399 --> 01:11:56,079
are making their way into cannabis

1803
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,760
production. And there's a bit of uh

1804
01:11:56,079 --> 01:11:59,600
gripping that's going on where people

1805
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:01,440
want to hold on to the reinss and and

1806
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,760
think that they can outperform the

1807
01:12:01,439 --> 01:12:06,319
machine and they probably can in in some

1808
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:08,239
cases and in other cases probably not.

1809
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:09,759
Uh but that's been a huge topic like I

1810
01:12:08,238 --> 01:12:12,000
was at Cultivate last year and that was

1811
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:14,560
a huge topic of conversation within

1812
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,880
flower producers and whatnot is like

1813
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:20,400
using these you know machine learning

1814
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:23,600
tools or these AI imaging devices like

1815
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:25,679
hyperspectral imaging or RGBs to predict

1816
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:27,920
plant growth and yield and plant health

1817
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:29,840
and pest problems. But there hasn't been

1818
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:32,319
enough of an assimilation of data to be

1819
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:34,400
able to cohesively make those decisions.

1820
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:36,000
So, it's learning on its own as it goes,

1821
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:37,599
which I think is really cool and shows

1822
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,960
promise. And you know, Aoya is working

1823
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:42,159
on that. There's some other companies

1824
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:45,679
working on that. Um, but you know,

1825
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:48,158
there's a there's a a huge difference in

1826
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:51,920
culture between CA and cannabis in terms

1827
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:54,079
of growers and who, you know, ego and

1828
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,840
value and and a lot of these aspects and

1829
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:57,679
and at least that's from what I've

1830
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:00,640
observed. You know, I could be wrong,

1831
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:03,279
but I've just noticed there's a um

1832
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:05,920
intellectual property is is huge in in

1833
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:08,359
cannabis, even though a lot of it's just

1834
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:11,760
around people chucking pollen, you know.

1835
01:13:08,359 --> 01:13:13,599
Um and uh it just things operate

1836
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:16,079
differently. Values are just different.

1837
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:18,480
Um but there's a lot to be learned on

1838
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:20,800
both sides. For sure. You you would say

1839
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:22,639
then that there's a lot more ego-driven

1840
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:24,719
decision-making in cannabis than there

1841
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:27,679
is uh in controlled environment

1842
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:29,760
agriculture. I take it. Uh yeah, I mean

1843
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:32,480
there's definitely still some on in in

1844
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:34,039
the CA space, but there's a there's a

1845
01:13:32,479 --> 01:13:36,799
lot of

1846
01:13:34,039 --> 01:13:38,960
uh university research that translates

1847
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:41,079
into relationships with farmers and

1848
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:44,000
producers there.

1849
01:13:41,079 --> 01:13:46,158
Um a lot of the cannabis research, I

1850
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,760
think people there's two sides. There

1851
01:13:46,158 --> 01:13:48,599
are people who really appreciate it and

1852
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:52,239
and

1853
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:53,600
and look to uh implement what they're

1854
01:13:52,238 --> 01:13:55,599
seeing in the research and there are

1855
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:59,199
people who don't believe it or don't

1856
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:01,679
like you know understand it maybe um and

1857
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:04,879
and don't don't see the value as much.

1858
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:07,679
There's still a huge impact from the uh

1859
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:12,880
legacy culture for lack of a better term

1860
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:14,520
of the sort of covert operations and uh

1861
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:19,920
you know the

1862
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:22,320
the quietness of the innovation and um

1863
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:24,960
proprietary nature to the you know

1864
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:27,599
cannabis growers that is still just

1865
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:30,800
prohibition behavior. But at the same

1866
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:33,360
time like there's a lot of conversation

1867
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:35,199
around hey we used to have much better

1868
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:37,039
chirps we used to have much louder weed

1869
01:14:35,198 --> 01:14:38,960
we used to have you know people say all

1870
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:40,880
kinds of things on that end which is

1871
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,279
probably true in a lot of cases but we

1872
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:47,039
have to understand like why exactly is

1873
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:49,439
that what do we have to what do we what

1874
01:14:47,039 --> 01:14:53,279
um bridge do we have to gap to be able

1875
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:56,719
to get is there fundamentally a conflict

1876
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:58,439
directly correlating between production

1877
01:14:56,719 --> 01:15:00,960
uh like

1878
01:14:58,439 --> 01:15:05,359
production strategy

1879
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:07,439
uh that is at a sort of a this is like

1880
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:10,559
an open-ended question too but at an

1881
01:15:07,439 --> 01:15:12,559
absolute between quality small batch

1882
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:14,080
craft and like volume production. I've

1883
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:18,320
seen some really good quality product

1884
01:15:14,079 --> 01:15:20,880
and really really uh really loud flower

1885
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:22,399
coming out of some larger facilities,

1886
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,319
you know. So, there's there I think

1887
01:15:22,399 --> 01:15:26,158
there's a it's a bit of a gray area, but

1888
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:28,238
I'm I'm I'm curious what you think on

1889
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:30,599
that as well.

1890
01:15:28,238 --> 01:15:35,198
For sure. I mean, I think that like with

1891
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:37,840
the like the legacy market and um you

1892
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:41,479
know, there because of the prohibition

1893
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:43,520
era mentality like you talked about and

1894
01:15:41,479 --> 01:15:46,158
the you know there's a lot of

1895
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:49,520
unwillingness to share information and a

1896
01:15:46,158 --> 01:15:51,519
lot of it I believe is due to um the

1897
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:53,520
penalties that would have been faced to

1898
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:56,640
share that information openly and

1899
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:58,480
potentially be tied to that information.

1900
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:01,600
um you know like people like Tom

1901
01:15:58,479 --> 01:16:05,359
Alexander who uh did Senseia tips way

1902
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:07,760
back in the 70s and 80s. He he was a

1903
01:16:05,359 --> 01:16:10,000
bold pioneer to be able to put that

1904
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:12,400
information out there and tie his name

1905
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,119
to it. That's uh you know it's almost

1906
01:16:12,399 --> 01:16:17,039
unheard of in that era. There was only

1907
01:16:14,119 --> 01:16:19,359
maybe five or six people that were doing

1908
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:21,840
that and openly admitting that it was

1909
01:16:19,359 --> 01:16:24,319
them putting that information out there.

1910
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:26,880
And um so when you get caught up in a

1911
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:30,158
mentality of this works for me and then

1912
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:32,400
you get pushed into a market that um you

1913
01:16:30,158 --> 01:16:34,319
know every last little resource counts

1914
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:37,599
because you are starting to see a loss

1915
01:16:34,319 --> 01:16:40,238
in price and uh an increase in overall

1916
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:42,640
production. Maybe you want to stay

1917
01:16:40,238 --> 01:16:45,678
unique in your ways and you don't really

1918
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:47,760
want to change because um I mean in

1919
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:49,199
general change is scary for a lot of

1920
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:51,760
people and especially if you've been

1921
01:16:49,198 --> 01:16:54,319
doing something for a really long time

1922
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:56,880
changing is going to be that much harder

1923
01:16:54,319 --> 01:16:59,198
and uh I I feel like that is one of the

1924
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:02,400
pitfalls of some of the legacy growers

1925
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:05,039
is not being willing to adopt uh not

1926
01:17:02,399 --> 01:17:06,799
necessarily wholesale change right but

1927
01:17:05,039 --> 01:17:08,319
little things that could imple that they

1928
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:11,600
could implement to make their lives that

1929
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:13,599
are, you know, precision irrigation, uh,

1930
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:15,600
environmental monitoring, things like

1931
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:17,600
that that don't necessarily change what

1932
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,880
you do or put into your plants or how

1933
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:20,159
you grow them or the environment that

1934
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:23,440
you're giving them. It just gives you

1935
01:17:20,158 --> 01:17:27,359
more tools and insights into the um

1936
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:30,079
applications of those tools. Uh so I it

1937
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:32,158
is a it's a very I feel like touchy

1938
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:34,399
subject especially within the

1939
01:17:32,158 --> 01:17:37,439
overarching cannabis community because

1940
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:39,599
there are a lot of legacy growers who

1941
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:43,039
were pulled into this market because of

1942
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:45,199
their expertise at the time and then

1943
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:46,960
basically be forced to change with the

1944
01:17:45,198 --> 01:17:50,000
market as it's changed. And sometimes

1945
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:55,359
that's through uh you know their own

1946
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:57,359
choice of wanting to stay vibrant and uh

1947
01:17:55,359 --> 01:17:58,880
have have their potential grow with the

1948
01:17:57,359 --> 01:18:00,559
market and then some people that are

1949
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:02,239
just stubbornly stuck in their ways. You

1950
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,159
know, kind of I I know I'm going kind of

1951
01:18:02,238 --> 01:18:06,158
on on the extremes of both ends of the

1952
01:18:04,158 --> 01:18:07,759
spectrum there, but uh it could fall

1953
01:18:06,158 --> 01:18:09,960
anywhere in between that as well. It

1954
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:12,640
just it does seem like it was something

1955
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:14,800
that it was hard for people to adjust

1956
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:16,640
and those who did did great and those

1957
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:18,239
who didn't maybe still did great for a

1958
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:21,360
while but eventually they started to see

1959
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:23,198
the tides kind of turn on them. Yeah.

1960
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:24,799
The attitude of like constantly trying

1961
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:27,479
to learn and get better and innovate.

1962
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:30,000
you know, there's a lot of uh discussion

1963
01:18:27,479 --> 01:18:31,678
around people switching back to HPS

1964
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:35,119
lighting because they got better quality

1965
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:36,800
or, you know, better better flower or

1966
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:38,399
whatever the case may be that they're

1967
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:41,920
saying, "Hey, I'm you know, going back

1968
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:44,399
to handwatering and organics and liquids

1969
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:47,279
and HPS lights the way I used to do it

1970
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:49,119
versus like, you know, driving new

1971
01:18:47,279 --> 01:18:50,800
genetic material coming out of these new

1972
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:53,359
environments where you're actually

1973
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:56,000
selecting under your selection pressure

1974
01:18:53,359 --> 01:18:58,079
comes from the environment that you're

1975
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,158
cultivating in that's representative of

1976
01:18:58,079 --> 01:19:02,559
your of your high production

1977
01:19:00,158 --> 01:19:04,158
environment. Like there's a there's a

1978
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:06,880
there's a give and take there, but I

1979
01:19:04,158 --> 01:19:09,279
mean to me I I would I would look to

1980
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:11,039
like innovations that are not like

1981
01:19:09,279 --> 01:19:14,800
taking a step back is fine as long as

1982
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:17,119
there's a uh a clear economic outcome

1983
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:18,400
because it's it's a business, right? For

1984
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:20,000
sure.

1985
01:19:18,399 --> 01:19:22,879
Like when I was in right when I

1986
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,520
graduated high school in 2009, I felt

1987
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:28,640
like there was this peak in the um at

1988
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:30,880
least in California in the 215 as well

1989
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:32,560
as the gray market where the quality of

1990
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:35,920
product that was coming out of like the

1991
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:37,840
Bay Area and SoCal was at such a peak

1992
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:40,560
that I can understand looking back at

1993
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:43,520
that and saying, "Man, this the weed

1994
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:45,840
then was really really good. it was

1995
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:48,560
knock you on your socks good, but also I

1996
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:50,159
was, you know, a much less educated and

1997
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:52,800
knowledgeable individual. And I feel

1998
01:19:50,158 --> 01:19:56,799
like um one thing my partner says all

1999
01:19:52,800 --> 01:20:00,400
the time is as we learn more, we know so

2000
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:02,719
much less, you know, and it's like by by

2001
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:04,799
gaining all of this knowledge now in the

2002
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:07,600
cannabis industry of the different

2003
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:09,360
styles of growing and we have, you know,

2004
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:12,640
probably a million plus different

2005
01:20:09,359 --> 01:20:15,439
cultivars that uh normal amounts of

2006
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:18,480
people are consuming on a weekly basis.

2007
01:20:15,439 --> 01:20:21,919
And uh all just all that uh sort of

2008
01:20:18,479 --> 01:20:24,639
compounding information provides almost

2009
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:26,399
this dilution effect of well what is

2010
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:28,800
quality and now we know that we have

2011
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:31,039
individual and unique endockinabonoid

2012
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,960
systems that respond differently to

2013
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:36,158
different cannabonoids as well as the

2014
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:40,158
different like tarpine esther and other

2015
01:20:36,158 --> 01:20:42,559
volatile organic compounds uh as they

2016
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:44,960
coalesce together and we're responding

2017
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:47,360
to them differently. It's not like a an

2018
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:49,439
ibuprofen where you have, you know, one

2019
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:52,079
single ingredient that's affecting your

2020
01:20:49,439 --> 01:20:55,198
system. You have a myriad of ingredients

2021
01:20:52,079 --> 01:20:58,158
that are affecting your system and, you

2022
01:20:55,198 --> 01:21:00,559
know, maybe when there were five popular

2023
01:20:58,158 --> 01:21:02,719
strains available to people, you knew

2024
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:06,080
that one of them worked way better for

2025
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:07,520
you. But now when you have 40, 50, 60

2026
01:21:06,079 --> 01:21:09,760
different strains available at one

2027
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:12,320
dispensary and 10 to 20 different

2028
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:14,880
dispensaries within driving distance all

2029
01:21:12,319 --> 01:21:16,880
holding a different menu, how can you

2030
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:19,199
even tell what's going to work for you?

2031
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,960
You can't go through, you know, hundreds

2032
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:25,759
of different strains in the same time

2033
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:27,600
that you could five, right? And you have

2034
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,520
constantly changing menus as well

2035
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:32,640
because the production is so much

2036
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:35,360
greater now than it was 20 years ago.

2037
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:37,840
Um, I just it's a it's a completely

2038
01:21:35,359 --> 01:21:39,599
different market. And to say that there

2039
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:41,520
was a better, you know, to have

2040
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:44,719
rosecolored glasses and look in the past

2041
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:47,520
and say that weed was better, I I don't

2042
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:49,520
believe it. I just don't, you know, I I

2043
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:52,639
I've smoked some of the tastiest weed in

2044
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:54,639
my life in the past couple years, but I

2045
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:56,319
still remember the stuff from 10 or 15

2046
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:58,319
years ago cuz it made an impression on

2047
01:21:56,319 --> 01:22:00,000
me. But I'll remember the stuff from

2048
01:21:58,319 --> 01:22:03,920
this year and last year the same because

2049
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:06,158
it's also a lasting impression.

2050
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:08,880
Yeah. Yeah. I feel the same way. I mean,

2051
01:22:06,158 --> 01:22:10,799
I've recently, you know, I've done I've

2052
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:12,400
judged some competitions and I've tried

2053
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:14,320
some, you know, interesting unique

2054
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:16,559
flavors and whatnot. And there's a lot

2055
01:22:14,319 --> 01:22:18,000
of of similarities in a lot of the

2056
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:20,000
varieties that are out now that are in

2057
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,158
commercial production, especially

2058
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,479
because the market demands a lot of the

2059
01:22:22,158 --> 01:22:26,638
similar flavors. But I guess yeah what

2060
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:28,479
you're getting at is is important to to

2061
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:31,039
point out which is that there and this

2062
01:22:28,479 --> 01:22:34,718
is this is partially beneficial to like

2063
01:22:31,039 --> 01:22:37,679
in the uh legalization and the in you

2064
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:39,039
know sort of advent of private research

2065
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:41,520
within the industry is we're able to

2066
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:43,600
understand what makes what are the all

2067
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:46,080
the factors that makes a quality

2068
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:48,079
experience or at least like quality

2069
01:22:46,079 --> 01:22:50,559
product and its effect on every

2070
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:53,840
individual person. like we it's so

2071
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:55,199
daunting to try to say hey I'm going to

2072
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,639
figure out what strain works the best

2073
01:22:55,198 --> 01:22:58,399
for me. It's like well we have to

2074
01:22:56,639 --> 01:23:00,639
understand why and what those mechanisms

2075
01:22:58,399 --> 01:23:02,719
are and it's very complicated. Everyone

2076
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:04,560
every person is different. Everyone just

2077
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:07,119
like your digestive system is different

2078
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:09,679
than mine and certain foods aggravate me

2079
01:23:07,119 --> 01:23:12,158
that don't aggravate you. like you know

2080
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:14,920
or vice versa like that's sort of uh I

2081
01:23:12,158 --> 01:23:17,599
look at it in in similarly to that which

2082
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:19,600
is it all starts with the base material

2083
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:22,000
and like how that's cultivated like what

2084
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:25,079
are the practices once you remove all of

2085
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:29,520
those factors like contamination risks

2086
01:23:25,079 --> 01:23:31,920
and poor storage and poor curing process

2087
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:34,320
or whatever uh it might be there. Then

2088
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:36,960
you get down to like the raw material

2089
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:39,559
input and how that affects you. uh

2090
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:42,560
that's a hard place to get to to try to

2091
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:45,039
evaluate. M um so I think that there's

2092
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:48,239
just this like wide world of of

2093
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:51,920
understanding um so many different

2094
01:23:48,238 --> 01:23:54,319
factors of the of the plant um that yeah

2095
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:58,158
the the production piece is is also just

2096
01:23:54,319 --> 01:24:00,319
a small portion of it right and and then

2097
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:01,920
also you know one of the things that I

2098
01:24:00,319 --> 01:24:05,439
feel like it's a little bit swept under

2099
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:07,600
the rug when people are asking for the

2100
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:10,960
different cultivar that works for them

2101
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:12,679
is the understanding of you Within the

2102
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:15,520
cultivation market

2103
01:24:12,679 --> 01:24:19,560
currently, you can't have something that

2104
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:26,159
yields the same grow for 12, 13, 14

2105
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:28,239
weeks and remain um viable uh for a for

2106
01:24:26,158 --> 01:24:31,359
a commercial facility where most of them

2107
01:24:28,238 --> 01:24:34,399
are u maybe pushing 10 weeks at the very

2108
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:36,639
most for a lot of their cultivars. Um so

2109
01:24:34,399 --> 01:24:39,638
anytime that you push past that, you

2110
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:44,000
can't then ask for that much more money.

2111
01:24:39,639 --> 01:24:47,520
uh per unit being sold uh typically um

2112
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:49,760
maybe for some really high quality uh

2113
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:52,400
product, but in a lot of cases when

2114
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:54,400
people are saying, I wish that there was

2115
01:24:52,399 --> 01:24:55,920
a really good sativa on the market

2116
01:24:54,399 --> 01:24:57,679
because I know that that worked really

2117
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:01,119
well for me when I had it back in the

2118
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:04,719
day. Um you know, a like I said, a

2119
01:25:01,119 --> 01:25:07,198
14week equatorial or a GMO or something.

2120
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:09,760
It's like yeah, just not commercially

2121
01:25:07,198 --> 01:25:13,198
viable. It's it it you don't see a lot

2122
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:15,039
of people growing GMOs like you know on

2123
01:25:13,198 --> 01:25:17,759
its own like you'll see garlic cookies

2124
01:25:15,039 --> 01:25:19,600
or like you know burgers or whatever

2125
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,719
like cuz they they they're shorter but

2126
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,480
they still get some of the similar

2127
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:24,880
flavors but they're not just GMO

2128
01:25:22,479 --> 01:25:29,759
anymore. No. Um and that's you know

2129
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:32,800
that's a that is a a case of we are um

2130
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:35,360
we have to conform to market viability

2131
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:40,320
which is a it could be potentially a

2132
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:42,719
sacrifice on on on um that specific

2133
01:25:40,319 --> 01:25:44,880
cultivar and and the the people who have

2134
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:46,800
had that experience with that cultivar.

2135
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:49,039
Yeah, I I agree with you on on that

2136
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:50,800
completely. I think that like the reason

2137
01:25:49,039 --> 01:25:54,880
that's part of the reason I think Sour

2138
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:57,520
Diesel like was so strong uh and so

2139
01:25:54,880 --> 01:26:01,600
popular for for a while back in like

2140
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:03,120
2008 2009 um Yep. Yeah. one of the

2141
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:05,280
co-founders of the Craft Growers

2142
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:06,719
Network. Um he goes by Gabby Staten

2143
01:26:05,279 --> 01:26:08,639
Island and he was one of the guys that

2144
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:13,279
brought Sour Diesel over from New York

2145
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:15,840
back in the early 2000s and um you know

2146
01:26:13,279 --> 01:26:18,399
people are people will still you know

2147
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:21,520
demand it on the shelves but it you know

2148
01:26:18,399 --> 01:26:24,399
from a cultivation perspective when uh

2149
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:26,360
you look at it as a cultiv cultivation

2150
01:26:24,399 --> 01:26:29,719
to buyer

2151
01:26:26,359 --> 01:26:32,880
relationship selling big fluffy green

2152
01:26:29,719 --> 01:26:33,760
buds it makes me sick to my stomach as a

2153
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:36,880
cultivator.

2154
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:39,199
trying to see that in a bag and try to

2155
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:40,960
go and shop that around because the

2156
01:26:39,198 --> 01:26:43,919
expressions you're going to get from a

2157
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:45,920
lot of people are going to be, "Are you

2158
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:49,199
the dumbest [ __ ] that just

2159
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:51,279
walked through my door today?" Um, and

2160
01:26:49,198 --> 01:26:52,519
it's it's really unfortunate because

2161
01:26:51,279 --> 01:26:55,759
then when

2162
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:57,600
people see that it's available, they

2163
01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:02,000
want it. So I you know there is this

2164
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:03,920
huge disconnect um I feel like with just

2165
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,399
across the board when it come you know

2166
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:10,560
at all different levels from cultivator

2167
01:27:06,399 --> 01:27:12,719
to purchaser to retailer to consumer and

2168
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:15,360
there needs to be a little bit more of a

2169
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:18,399
holistic approach in bringing more

2170
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:20,319
knowledge there somehow and that's for

2171
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:23,119
someone more intelligent than myself. I

2172
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:25,198
I can see the problem but I have no uh

2173
01:27:23,119 --> 01:27:27,920
avenue for rectifying that at this

2174
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:29,599
point. Yeah, I mean social media is a

2175
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:31,840
double-edged sword in that regard

2176
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:33,600
because social media, especially

2177
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:36,480
Instagram, which is where a lot of the

2178
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:37,920
cultivators are, uh, is pictures. You

2179
01:27:36,479 --> 01:27:40,638
can't smell, you know, you can't smell

2180
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:44,000
weed on Instagram. It's all bag appeal.

2181
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:46,800
So, you know, we've leaned further into

2182
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:49,840
like, uh, this conflation of quality

2183
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:51,440
with bag appeal, um, that that we never

2184
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:54,159
used to have before this was like a

2185
01:27:51,439 --> 01:27:55,678
thing, you know, before. So yeah, I

2186
01:27:54,158 --> 01:27:58,719
think there's a big that has a big role

2187
01:27:55,679 --> 01:28:00,719
to play too. Uh education and and

2188
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:02,399
teaching people what like teaching

2189
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:03,679
consumers what quality product is. And I

2190
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:06,319
deal with this with my family like

2191
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:09,319
elderly uh family members who are

2192
01:28:06,319 --> 01:28:12,719
interested in trying cannabis again.

2193
01:28:09,319 --> 01:28:15,198
Um but like my parents even or you know

2194
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:17,119
my cousins or whatever that are like I

2195
01:28:15,198 --> 01:28:18,960
just don't know like weed's too strong

2196
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:20,719
for me these days. Like I I can't smoke

2197
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:23,039
it. like I just get way way way to way

2198
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:24,880
way too high and I want to try to find

2199
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:26,639
strains that work for me or I want low

2200
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:28,079
potency weak wheat or whatever. they

2201
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:30,159
have these ideas in their heads around

2202
01:28:28,079 --> 01:28:32,158
like what they want and need out of

2203
01:28:30,158 --> 01:28:34,079
cannabis, but they just can't figure out

2204
01:28:32,158 --> 01:28:36,479
how to get it or how to find it or

2205
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:38,479
there's this like mindset of like I

2206
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:40,799
don't want this high potency, high THC

2207
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:43,198
weed anymore, whereas, you know, that's

2208
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:45,679
still talking about THC where whereas

2209
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:47,839
it's more, you know, I mean, yes, that

2210
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:50,399
number could potentially impact how high

2211
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:53,079
you get, you know, but to a certain

2212
01:28:50,399 --> 01:28:56,238
point like there's some

2213
01:28:53,079 --> 01:28:59,039
um there's some there's some factors

2214
01:28:56,238 --> 01:29:00,399
there where testing fraud or whatever,

2215
01:28:59,039 --> 01:29:01,840
you know, I mean, there's so many things

2216
01:29:00,399 --> 01:29:03,920
we could talk about there, but I would

2217
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:06,480
just say like for some of those guys

2218
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:07,920
rabbit hole. Yeah, exactly. And I don't

2219
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:10,638
need to go there, but for some of those

2220
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:12,319
guys who are looking for product that's

2221
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:14,440
going to make them feel the way they

2222
01:29:12,319 --> 01:29:17,439
want to feel off of smoking, there's so

2223
01:29:14,439 --> 01:29:21,279
much out there and there's very little

2224
01:29:17,439 --> 01:29:23,119
resources to uh help them figure it out.

2225
01:29:21,279 --> 01:29:24,800
You know, you go rely on your bud tender

2226
01:29:23,119 --> 01:29:27,279
most of the time.

2227
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:29,679
It's I feel like it's why I am such a

2228
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:31,359
huge advocate for home grower rights

2229
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:33,199
because I feel like that's going to be

2230
01:29:31,359 --> 01:29:35,920
one of the best routes that any

2231
01:29:33,198 --> 01:29:37,599
individual can take into trying to find

2232
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:41,279
what'll work for them, especially if

2233
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:43,600
they have uh access to clones and uh

2234
01:29:41,279 --> 01:29:46,079
readily known cultivars in their area

2235
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:48,320
because then they can, you know, they

2236
01:29:46,079 --> 01:29:50,000
can try it out at home, compare it to

2237
01:29:48,319 --> 01:29:52,079
what's at the store. If they think that

2238
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,679
they like what they do better, then they

2239
01:29:52,079 --> 01:29:55,359
can, you know, maybe spend a little bit

2240
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:57,920
more on a pack of seeds or on a really

2241
01:29:55,359 --> 01:29:59,839
nice cultivar or something and set up uh

2242
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:01,359
two small spaces even one just to keep

2243
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:03,440
that cultivar around, learn about

2244
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:06,719
cloning and and propagation because

2245
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:09,359
that's also a blast in and of itself and

2246
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:12,800
then also be able to grow that product

2247
01:30:09,359 --> 01:30:15,599
that they want and desire uh readily. So

2248
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:18,079
it but it is uh you know when when you

2249
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:20,079
are sifting through all the different

2250
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:21,439
iterations of even you know like let's

2251
01:30:20,079 --> 01:30:22,960
just say something like Girl Scout

2252
01:30:21,439 --> 01:30:24,960
cookies right you can see Girl Scout

2253
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:27,760
cookies at every dispensary in some

2254
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:30,158
iteration in every state that has a

2255
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,840
market for it and they're all going to

2256
01:30:30,158 --> 01:30:33,519
be different.

2257
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:35,760
you know, maybe there's going to be a

2258
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:37,679
few degrees of difference in some, but

2259
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:39,159
in others there's going to be, you know,

2260
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:41,600
a hundred different degrees of

2261
01:30:39,158 --> 01:30:44,960
separation, and it's going to be vastly

2262
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:47,960
different. Uh, so it it the the

2263
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:51,198
commercial space is um it has a lot of

2264
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:54,158
refinement uh to be done.

2265
01:30:51,198 --> 01:30:57,638
I've seen a lot of um I've heard a lot

2266
01:30:54,158 --> 01:31:01,599
of people say that Girl Scout cookies in

2267
01:30:57,639 --> 01:31:04,639
some way or another killed quality weed

2268
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:06,719
um because it was like it made the

2269
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:09,039
Purple Candy

2270
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:13,198
um you know, purple candy gas or purple

2271
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:14,880
candy kind of uh craze take over

2272
01:31:13,198 --> 01:31:16,960
everything and that's all everyone's

2273
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:19,119
growing in LA and that's all like and

2274
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:22,239
it's like oh like it it totally ruined

2275
01:31:19,119 --> 01:31:24,880
the creativity and breeding and can and

2276
01:31:22,238 --> 01:31:27,678
it's like you know I I see the point

2277
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:32,000
there but at the end of the day like it

2278
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:35,760
it it is what it is for a reason uh it

2279
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:39,158
does well in a lot of conditions and it

2280
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:41,600
performs um and and I think that the

2281
01:31:39,158 --> 01:31:44,599
original Girl Scout cookies was not

2282
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:47,840
really a great production strain. No.

2283
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:50,000
Um, but the form cutter, the the thin

2284
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:52,800
men's cut or whatever, like they they're

2285
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:55,840
not great producers and they're they're

2286
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:58,880
not really purple either. Like they're

2287
01:31:55,840 --> 01:32:00,960
they're kind of that like uh you know,

2288
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:02,960
speckled green and purple with with nice

2289
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:05,600
orange hairs. It it's a you know, it's a

2290
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:08,158
beautiful cultivar, but um I remember

2291
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:11,360
getting like the packs that were in the

2292
01:32:08,158 --> 01:32:13,039
Bay Area in 2009 and it was amazing.

2293
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:16,238
like some of the best smoke that I can

2294
01:32:13,039 --> 01:32:18,319
remember to this day. But, you know, no

2295
01:32:16,238 --> 01:32:20,879
one wanted it at the time at when it

2296
01:32:18,319 --> 01:32:22,479
first came out because it was weird and

2297
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:24,079
different. And people were looking at

2298
01:32:22,479 --> 01:32:26,399
these tiny little nugs and they're

2299
01:32:24,079 --> 01:32:28,000
going, "Man, I just give me some Sour

2300
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:30,479
Diesel or something or some Super Silver

2301
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,479
Haze or some Blue Dream because I want

2302
01:32:30,479 --> 01:32:34,238
to see like one big cola in the bottom

2303
01:32:32,479 --> 01:32:36,000
of my zip when I'm getting a when I'm

2304
01:32:34,238 --> 01:32:37,198
getting an ounce, you know? I don't I

2305
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,600
don't want all those different little

2306
01:32:37,198 --> 01:32:41,279
popcorn nugs." But it did. I mean, it

2307
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:45,800
has staying power for a reason, just

2308
01:32:41,279 --> 01:32:48,319
like lemon cherry gelato or

2309
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:50,320
um I feel like there's just too many to

2310
01:32:48,319 --> 01:32:53,119
name off now where there's they're all

2311
01:32:50,319 --> 01:32:55,519
considered these elite cuts or, you

2312
01:32:53,119 --> 01:32:57,679
know, uh commercially viable cuts that

2313
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:59,360
do well in, you know, a variety of

2314
01:32:57,679 --> 01:33:01,920
different markets. But that was the same

2315
01:32:59,359 --> 01:33:03,359
that it was, you know, 20, 30 years ago.

2316
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:05,440
It was just those markets were much

2317
01:33:03,359 --> 01:33:07,359
smaller and the the cuts were only

2318
01:33:05,439 --> 01:33:09,439
passed around to a few people, but those

2319
01:33:07,359 --> 01:33:11,279
few people provided for a majority of

2320
01:33:09,439 --> 01:33:13,919
those people in the area. So that it was

2321
01:33:11,279 --> 01:33:15,599
just the product was better known. Yeah,

2322
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:18,639
I think the breeding world is probably

2323
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:21,760
the final frontier of unadulterated

2324
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:26,199
creativity in the craft growing world.

2325
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:29,760
um being able to select strains

2326
01:33:26,198 --> 01:33:32,238
and make new crosses that are new

2327
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:34,440
flavors and just really try to like hone

2328
01:33:32,238 --> 01:33:36,799
in what your goals are and what and and

2329
01:33:34,439 --> 01:33:38,559
have there's there's not always going to

2330
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:41,039
be, you know, predictable outcomes with

2331
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:42,719
phenotypic variation. So, if you're just

2332
01:33:41,039 --> 01:33:45,519
if you're really breeding for a real

2333
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:48,319
purpose, that's one that's one like like

2334
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:50,480
a true economic purpose like, hey, we're

2335
01:33:48,319 --> 01:33:52,158
building this cultivar that's going to

2336
01:33:50,479 --> 01:33:55,599
have these qualities and these things

2337
01:33:52,158 --> 01:33:58,079
for production, whatever. Um, but I also

2338
01:33:55,600 --> 01:34:00,800
think genetic preservation and looking

2339
01:33:58,079 --> 01:34:02,960
at like creating combinations of flavors

2340
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:06,159
and selecting things that are more out

2341
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:07,920
of more for the the consumer that really

2342
01:34:06,158 --> 01:34:11,439
appreciates

2343
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:14,560
uh interesting depth and uniqueness to a

2344
01:34:11,439 --> 01:34:16,158
cultivar is about pretty much all we

2345
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:18,800
have left because everybody really is

2346
01:34:16,158 --> 01:34:20,559
growing very similarly nowadays. A lot

2347
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:24,560
of people are growing in small substrate

2348
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:27,520
with high EC uh you know precision

2349
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:30,639
irrigation strategies high you know

2350
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:32,560
reasonably high PPFD LEDs like not crazy

2351
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:34,639
but like you know there's a lot of

2352
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:36,639
similar practices that are successful in

2353
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:38,560
the commercial space that can still

2354
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:40,480
produce quality product. So there's not

2355
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:44,080
a lot of creativity left within that

2356
01:34:40,479 --> 01:34:46,718
aspect of it. I think a lot of that is

2357
01:34:44,079 --> 01:34:49,198
the sacred is left for like, you know,

2358
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:50,800
some of these um more well-known

2359
01:34:49,198 --> 01:34:54,559
breeders who have a reputation for

2360
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:56,719
putting out new quality hot strains.

2361
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:58,960
Yeah, I couldn't agree more. It and it

2362
01:34:56,719 --> 01:35:00,639
also feels like because some people will

2363
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:01,920
kind of say, well, what about organics,

2364
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:04,239
you know, like what about having some

2365
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:06,560
sort of commercial facility that runs an

2366
01:35:04,238 --> 01:35:08,399
organic system? And my retort would be

2367
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:10,719
well all of these organic systems that

2368
01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:14,839
have been found to be successful in an

2369
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:17,679
in an indoor setting um are also very

2370
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:21,679
homogeneous across you know if you take

2371
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:24,239
a large enough sample size um that it's

2372
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:27,119
all running you know these these fabric

2373
01:35:24,238 --> 01:35:29,439
beds with uh something like a bluemat

2374
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:32,800
drip system or even other irrigation

2375
01:35:29,439 --> 01:35:35,039
systems and uh substrate monitoring so

2376
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:38,480
that you're hitting your same target

2377
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:40,560
drybacks and wet dry cycles and making

2378
01:35:38,479 --> 01:35:42,718
sure that the electrical conductivity

2379
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:44,800
still isn't getting too out of control.

2380
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:47,679
And it all of these practices kind of

2381
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:49,440
then steer back to this, you know,

2382
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:53,279
controlled environment agriculture

2383
01:35:49,439 --> 01:35:56,079
conversation that is already a fairly

2384
01:35:53,279 --> 01:35:59,359
refined practice uh and can be applied

2385
01:35:56,079 --> 01:36:03,198
through a variety of substrates,

2386
01:35:59,359 --> 01:36:07,519
nutrient inputs, uh environmental uh

2387
01:36:03,198 --> 01:36:09,919
control abilities. Um it it's just, you

2388
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:11,679
know, I've we keep on circling back to

2389
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:15,359
it, but it's just about making sure that

2390
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:17,000
you're optimizing where you can and and

2391
01:36:15,359 --> 01:36:19,759
not

2392
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:24,319
um you're not overdoing it where you

2393
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:28,159
can't uh afford to. Um yeah, simplicity

2394
01:36:24,319 --> 01:36:30,479
is oftent times uh much more rewarding I

2395
01:36:28,158 --> 01:36:32,719
think uh than getting like lost in the

2396
01:36:30,479 --> 01:36:34,718
sauce on I want to need the nanobubbles

2397
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:37,439
and I need to do you know I need to

2398
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:39,198
default on day 21 and day you know just

2399
01:36:37,439 --> 01:36:41,359
having these like precise boundaries

2400
01:36:39,198 --> 01:36:43,759
that you're sitting within the it's it's

2401
01:36:41,359 --> 01:36:46,719
a dynamic environment and I think like

2402
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:50,159
the creativity that comes from exploring

2403
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:52,000
new flavors is all we can have left and

2404
01:36:50,158 --> 01:36:52,719
hold on to that we can do ourselves in a

2405
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,679
lot

2406
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:58,880
in a lot of ways. Like I can go into my

2407
01:36:55,679 --> 01:37:01,279
basement and take a male of this and a

2408
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:03,279
female that cross-pollinate, right? Like

2409
01:37:01,279 --> 01:37:05,359
that's not very hard and I can get some

2410
01:37:03,279 --> 01:37:07,519
really cool unique new expressions and

2411
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:10,319
flavors based on the genetic potential

2412
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:11,840
of each of those cultivars, right? So I

2413
01:37:10,319 --> 01:37:15,359
could still do that and find something

2414
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:17,679
that nobody else has in a way. Um, but I

2415
01:37:15,359 --> 01:37:20,719
but I like you know there's these there

2416
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:22,480
are guys out there now doing synthetic

2417
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:24,800
and organic combination where they're

2418
01:37:22,479 --> 01:37:27,198
feeding base salts and adding in which

2419
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:29,760
is not really reinventing the wheel or

2420
01:37:27,198 --> 01:37:32,559
doing anything new. It's just, hey, I'm

2421
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:34,800
putting this kelp fulvic acid combo

2422
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:37,440
through a separate doser in line after

2423
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:39,679
my batch tank so I can still deliver

2424
01:37:37,439 --> 01:37:42,158
these microbes and these bio stimulants

2425
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:44,319
to my plants and get what I think is

2426
01:37:42,158 --> 01:37:47,439
creating an increase in flavor profiles

2427
01:37:44,319 --> 01:37:50,039
and expression in the plant. uh you know

2428
01:37:47,439 --> 01:37:53,279
there is a science to the the

2429
01:37:50,039 --> 01:37:54,719
biomechanisms behind adding those

2430
01:37:53,279 --> 01:37:56,639
compounds into the plant and the

2431
01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:58,960
chilators and the the biological

2432
01:37:56,639 --> 01:38:01,920
organisms and enzymes you know there's a

2433
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:05,118
lot of depth to that argument and to

2434
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:07,600
that style um and so I I understand like

2435
01:38:05,118 --> 01:38:09,359
okay hey this is a new way of applying

2436
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:11,280
that strategy that we were doing in our

2437
01:38:09,359 --> 01:38:13,359
batch tanks and barrels before we were

2438
01:38:11,279 --> 01:38:15,599
doing all this stuff and keeping our

2439
01:38:13,359 --> 01:38:17,719
lines clean still you know still like

2440
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:20,560
kind

2441
01:38:17,719 --> 01:38:23,520
adapting and you know these old school

2442
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:25,440
practices to new school production

2443
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:27,520
methodologies which I even don't even

2444
01:38:25,439 --> 01:38:30,319
like using those terms but like you know

2445
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:33,440
the legacy versus the

2446
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:36,719
modern practices. I think that that part

2447
01:38:33,439 --> 01:38:39,118
of it is very limited in what we can uh

2448
01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:43,198
what we can explore in terms of

2449
01:38:39,118 --> 01:38:45,839
dynamics. I mean, veg time, pot size,

2450
01:38:43,198 --> 01:38:48,158
planting densities, like very very

2451
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:50,880
myopic decisions that you make that

2452
01:38:48,158 --> 01:38:53,439
could have substantial outcomes on

2453
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:55,118
expression. But I recently walked into a

2454
01:38:53,439 --> 01:38:57,359
facility where where someone was growing

2455
01:38:55,118 --> 01:39:00,279
in onegon pots and vegging for a long

2456
01:38:57,359 --> 01:39:03,839
time and he really really felt like root

2457
01:39:00,279 --> 01:39:07,118
circling and constraining of of space in

2458
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:10,639
the root zone drove a a a more desirable

2459
01:39:07,118 --> 01:39:12,639
outcome on bud structure and um and

2460
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:15,840
density and and what he was looking for

2461
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:17,520
from his buds over years of his trial

2462
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,960
and error and experience. That was his

2463
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:21,199
that was where he got to in his

2464
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:23,359
decision. So they were growing in these

2465
01:39:21,198 --> 01:39:26,279
large plants in these you know plastic

2466
01:39:23,359 --> 01:39:29,000
onegon pots. Um and you know

2467
01:39:26,279 --> 01:39:31,439
like if you're not

2468
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,880
um you have to do a lot of thing you

2469
01:39:31,439 --> 01:39:37,839
have to make a lot of adjustments to

2470
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:39,679
like fulfill the outcome of your your

2471
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:42,239
specific decision on your observation.

2472
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:43,840
There's so many confounding factors but

2473
01:39:42,238 --> 01:39:45,359
people have unique things and then they

2474
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:47,760
have to work around that and all the

2475
01:39:45,359 --> 01:39:49,920
other aspects. your irrigation strategy

2476
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:52,480
has to change a lot when you're when you

2477
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:53,679
have too small of a you know maybe not

2478
01:39:52,479 --> 01:39:56,959
too small but when you have a really

2479
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:59,319
small pot with a big plant you it's hard

2480
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:01,920
to just go full generative

2481
01:39:59,319 --> 01:40:06,000
um but some strains respond really well

2482
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:08,719
to that and others don't for sure I yeah

2483
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,719
like cuz sometimes we'll categorize like

2484
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:13,198
the different cultivars as being like

2485
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:16,480
generative balanced or vegetative

2486
01:40:13,198 --> 01:40:18,559
themselves and you know and and trying

2487
01:40:16,479 --> 01:40:20,879
to match those with your environmental

2488
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:23,440
cues and your irrigation cues to try and

2489
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:25,679
optimize it. Yeah, sure. Maybe uh

2490
01:40:23,439 --> 01:40:28,238
overvging your plant, providing some

2491
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:29,679
sort of girdling, which is a stressor,

2492
01:40:28,238 --> 01:40:31,519
so it's going to provide some sort of

2493
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:33,840
generative response, is doing something

2494
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:37,920
to the morphology of the flower that is

2495
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:40,159
desirable, but um it it seems like a a

2496
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:42,800
long walk, you know, to get to the end

2497
01:40:40,158 --> 01:40:44,319
result that you're looking for. Um but

2498
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:48,079
if it works, it works. And it's really

2499
01:40:44,319 --> 01:40:49,599
hard to discredit uh the different uh

2500
01:40:48,079 --> 01:40:51,198
methods that people will use that

2501
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:53,119
they've developed over time. You know,

2502
01:40:51,198 --> 01:40:56,799
like you're saying with this probably

2503
01:40:53,118 --> 01:40:59,198
single or mult multicult cultivar uh

2504
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:00,719
growing style that they use for this

2505
01:40:59,198 --> 01:41:02,238
because it works and they've found that

2506
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:05,359
it works. So they're not going to change

2507
01:41:02,238 --> 01:41:07,359
it. Um but you know like we've also

2508
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:10,759
discussed previously that could

2509
01:41:07,359 --> 01:41:14,158
eventually become a hindrance if

2510
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:18,159
some you know new strategy or technology

2511
01:41:14,158 --> 01:41:21,359
or uh option becomes available in the

2512
01:41:18,158 --> 01:41:24,000
cultivation facility that you then are

2513
01:41:21,359 --> 01:41:27,759
either uh too stubborn to change because

2514
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:30,319
of a single method that you must keep to

2515
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:32,639
make it your growing style to keep your

2516
01:41:30,319 --> 01:41:34,158
uniqueness. And unfortunately, you know,

2517
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:38,400
that's a little ego-driven at that

2518
01:41:34,158 --> 01:41:42,759
point. Um, so I, you know, I it there is

2519
01:41:38,399 --> 01:41:45,679
a balance there and especially as a um a

2520
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:47,119
consultant knowing that, you know, some

2521
01:41:45,679 --> 01:41:48,880
people are just going to be stuck in

2522
01:41:47,118 --> 01:41:51,359
their ways and it's about optimizing

2523
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:55,520
their ways rather than implementing

2524
01:41:51,359 --> 01:41:57,519
optimal ways, right? Uh that's uh I I

2525
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:59,760
have faced that issue as well and it

2526
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:02,480
it's a hard one to get used to

2527
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:05,159
especially when you see and have seen so

2528
01:42:02,479 --> 01:42:08,959
many different styles that you can kind

2529
01:42:05,158 --> 01:42:11,439
of formulate a you know if you have the

2530
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:13,520
education and understanding of how and

2531
01:42:11,439 --> 01:42:15,919
why plants react to certain things and

2532
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:17,760
you see a variety of ways that people

2533
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:19,920
implement those different things to

2534
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:21,679
watch how the plant reacts. You can pick

2535
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:24,079
and choose what works the best because

2536
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:26,480
you've seen it and now you have your

2537
01:42:24,079 --> 01:42:28,960
anecdotal model set up. So you're boom,

2538
01:42:26,479 --> 01:42:30,879
ready to run. And then when other people

2539
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:32,079
are faced with that model that you set

2540
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:34,239
up for them, they say, "Well, this

2541
01:42:32,079 --> 01:42:36,000
doesn't work for my setting because I

2542
01:42:34,238 --> 01:42:38,000
wanted to do it this way." And when you

2543
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:41,198
put this in place, it ruins everything

2544
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:43,439
else. Um, so I I've I've faced that.

2545
01:42:41,198 --> 01:42:45,839
It's a it's one of those things that I

2546
01:42:43,439 --> 01:42:48,638
feel like is is a pitfall for um people

2547
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:51,119
who want to enter into consulting where

2548
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:54,319
they're trying to maybe push their own

2549
01:42:51,118 --> 01:42:56,880
ideologies too much and not uh hear what

2550
01:42:54,319 --> 01:42:59,198
the people need and responding to those

2551
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:02,560
needs better. Yeah, there's so many

2552
01:42:59,198 --> 01:43:05,439
flavors of of uh advising or consulting

2553
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:07,039
that a lot of it comes down to like you

2554
01:43:05,439 --> 01:43:08,960
know what we're trying to do here is

2555
01:43:07,039 --> 01:43:10,719
achieve desired outcomes and then we

2556
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:12,800
work backwards from our desired outcome

2557
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:15,039
towards what we're what our day-to-day

2558
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:16,719
is and get slightly more myopic but at

2559
01:43:15,039 --> 01:43:19,118
the in the very beginning you have to

2560
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:20,880
take a holistic just like medicine right

2561
01:43:19,118 --> 01:43:23,118
like you have to treat the whole system

2562
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:24,719
you can't just go like yes you have to

2563
01:43:23,118 --> 01:43:26,158
stop the bleeding and put a bandage on

2564
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:28,158
it and all that but when you're we're

2565
01:43:26,158 --> 01:43:30,479
talking about like holistic health, you

2566
01:43:28,158 --> 01:43:32,079
know, like our whole system is flawed

2567
01:43:30,479 --> 01:43:33,439
where we're not eating well, we're not

2568
01:43:32,079 --> 01:43:34,880
sleeping well, we're not, you know, all

2569
01:43:33,439 --> 01:43:36,719
these things, right? Like we're

2570
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:38,079
hijacked. So, in a garden, when you're

2571
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:39,760
looking at the holistic aspect, you're

2572
01:43:38,079 --> 01:43:42,880
looking at what are the key dysfunctions

2573
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:44,880
of this operation and then we work

2574
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:46,000
backwards to the specific production

2575
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:47,359
things that are happening. And, you

2576
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,118
know, you can look at trends and see

2577
01:43:47,359 --> 01:43:50,719
things, but it's not always the best

2578
01:43:49,118 --> 01:43:53,118
idea to just go, okay, we're going to

2579
01:43:50,719 --> 01:43:56,000
switch to onegon pots at nine plants

2580
01:43:53,118 --> 01:43:58,399
under a light at like, you know, 10day

2581
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,560
vet. like you can't just go directly to

2582
01:43:58,399 --> 01:44:02,559
those things without a true

2583
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:03,760
understanding of revenue generation in

2584
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:05,440
the business and what are the key

2585
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:07,440
factors that move the needle for the

2586
01:44:05,439 --> 01:44:09,118
company. Um you have to look at that

2587
01:44:07,439 --> 01:44:11,678
first and then go well how do these

2588
01:44:09,118 --> 01:44:13,839
things all play into this right at every

2589
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:16,560
step of the you know efficiency is

2590
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:19,279
always really important. Um, but

2591
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:21,039
efficiency isn't the whole picture, you

2592
01:44:19,279 --> 01:44:24,079
know? I mean, you got to make sure that

2593
01:44:21,039 --> 01:44:26,238
the person feels good. Uh, and that

2594
01:44:24,079 --> 01:44:29,279
translates into like desire to make

2595
01:44:26,238 --> 01:44:31,359
change. And so from it's easy to look at

2596
01:44:29,279 --> 01:44:33,279
like the consulting thing as like a rose

2597
01:44:31,359 --> 01:44:35,279
colored glass kind of thing. It's like,

2598
01:44:33,279 --> 01:44:36,479
oh, I'm here to try to help you know

2599
01:44:35,279 --> 01:44:39,039
what what are you really doing to

2600
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:42,238
support this person? What what your

2601
01:44:39,039 --> 01:44:44,880
outcome based uh decisions and and value

2602
01:44:42,238 --> 01:44:46,959
based. we're trying to bring value to

2603
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:49,279
the company in a a way that's supportive

2604
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:51,279
that empowers them to drive success in

2605
01:44:49,279 --> 01:44:53,039
the business. That's one approach. The

2606
01:44:51,279 --> 01:44:55,198
other approach is I'm taking a piece of

2607
01:44:53,039 --> 01:44:57,600
this and I'm going to get the

2608
01:44:55,198 --> 01:45:00,799
performance out of this. Uh and so

2609
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:05,039
that's where my incentive is is to like

2610
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:06,960
take my SOPs, my strategies, all my uh

2611
01:45:05,039 --> 01:45:09,279
you know the way that I do things and

2612
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:10,960
I'm going to place it in this facility

2613
01:45:09,279 --> 01:45:12,479
and I'm going to get it to perform the

2614
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:16,079
way that I want it to. and then I get

2615
01:45:12,479 --> 01:45:18,079
the uh the upside of that. So, there's

2616
01:45:16,079 --> 01:45:20,158
different approaches and it doesn't all

2617
01:45:18,079 --> 01:45:22,158
it's not all applicable across the

2618
01:45:20,158 --> 01:45:24,158
board. Some people really just need

2619
01:45:22,158 --> 01:45:25,359
somebody to bounce ideas off of or to

2620
01:45:24,158 --> 01:45:27,198
just tell them when they're doing

2621
01:45:25,359 --> 01:45:28,880
something that doesn't make sense. And

2622
01:45:27,198 --> 01:45:30,479
some people want you to just step in and

2623
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:33,118
run everything for them and do it all

2624
01:45:30,479 --> 01:45:35,439
yourself. Every business has this this

2625
01:45:33,118 --> 01:45:38,719
gradient of like involvement and

2626
01:45:35,439 --> 01:45:41,039
empowerment and um you know when you're

2627
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:42,800
taking a a holistic systematic approach

2628
01:45:41,039 --> 01:45:44,238
you have to look at like what is the

2629
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:46,719
foundation of this company and the

2630
01:45:44,238 --> 01:45:48,399
culture and is it owner operator is it

2631
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:49,920
uh you know somebody trying to sell this

2632
01:45:48,399 --> 01:45:53,039
are they what what are they trying to do

2633
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:54,960
here uh and how do we change

2634
01:45:53,039 --> 01:45:57,920
incrementally change practices and

2635
01:45:54,960 --> 01:46:00,000
procedures and whatnot to like back our

2636
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:02,560
way into that and maybe like there's

2637
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:04,800
this potential roll out of capital

2638
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:06,239
expenditure that needs to happen. Like

2639
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:08,000
we deal with a lot of consultants at

2640
01:46:06,238 --> 01:46:09,279
Aoya. We have a lot of consultants that

2641
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,719
come in and say, "Hey, I need to get a

2642
01:46:09,279 --> 01:46:12,639
Roya in this growth so that I can see

2643
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:14,079
what's happening so that I can help make

2644
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:15,840
decisions and make changes and help

2645
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:18,079
them." And that that's a very common

2646
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:19,920
thing in the industry, you know, I mean,

2647
01:46:18,079 --> 01:46:21,760
people step in, they implement their

2648
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:23,600
tools that allow them to to do their

2649
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:26,239
job, and then they can, you know,

2650
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:29,920
functionally make a a pull a bigger

2651
01:46:26,238 --> 01:46:32,638
lever there without without as much of a

2652
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:35,520
um time or labor investment on their

2653
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:37,520
end. So, you know, I see that there's a

2654
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:38,800
there's such a wide range. Some people

2655
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:40,239
are like, we're taking our brand into

2656
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:42,000
this grow. We're going to put our we're

2657
01:46:40,238 --> 01:46:43,279
going to take these two flower rooms.

2658
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,960
We're going to run them our way. we're

2659
01:46:43,279 --> 01:46:47,840
going to do our do our thing here. We're

2660
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:49,279
going to bring our brand in and we're

2661
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:51,039
going to sell the brand from those two

2662
01:46:49,279 --> 01:46:52,880
sell the product in our brand from those

2663
01:46:51,039 --> 01:46:56,479
two rooms. So, there's like, you know,

2664
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:58,760
there's such a a wide scope of of

2665
01:46:56,479 --> 01:47:03,439
consulting uh type

2666
01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:04,960
um uh I guess business. Um, but it's

2667
01:47:03,439 --> 01:47:06,638
also very challenging when you have to,

2668
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:09,760
and I've I've had this personal

2669
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:11,279
experience with clients who didn't get

2670
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:12,800
the out the results that they were

2671
01:47:11,279 --> 01:47:14,800
looking for because they didn't put in

2672
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:19,039
the time and the effort and the work.

2673
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:20,639
Um, or they didn't pay, you know, or or

2674
01:47:19,039 --> 01:47:22,079
like it's like if you don't pay, you

2675
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:23,679
don't listen to someone's advice. if

2676
01:47:22,079 --> 01:47:26,639
you're if you don't have any skin in the

2677
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:28,399
game, you know, uh and if it's just ask

2678
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:31,118
getting advice that maybe isn't as

2679
01:47:28,399 --> 01:47:33,759
helpful as or writing out someone's SOPs

2680
01:47:31,118 --> 01:47:35,920
or writing out a IPM protocol for them,

2681
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:37,199
well, they don't do it or stick to it.

2682
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:38,639
There's two sides of that. It's like

2683
01:47:37,198 --> 01:47:41,439
either you need to put somebody in there

2684
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:43,279
who can or you know and and what am I

2685
01:47:41,439 --> 01:47:45,279
willing to actually do here? Like how

2686
01:47:43,279 --> 01:47:48,079
much involvement am I willing to

2687
01:47:45,279 --> 01:47:50,639
actually have and and do I actually see

2688
01:47:48,079 --> 01:47:52,399
a potential positive outcome here? like

2689
01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:54,960
when I when I'm going to help this

2690
01:47:52,399 --> 01:47:56,879
person, am I actually going to like let

2691
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:58,719
me let's be real here. Like let's be

2692
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:00,400
really realistic. Is what I'm offering

2693
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:02,639
and what I can what I have the

2694
01:48:00,399 --> 01:48:05,039
capabilities and capacity to do is is

2695
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:06,600
this really going to help this person?

2696
01:48:05,039 --> 01:48:09,519
Like is it really going to make a

2697
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:11,960
difference? And you know, to me, I'm I'm

2698
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:15,199
I'm at a point where I I don't

2699
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:17,520
really want to do that much consulting

2700
01:48:15,198 --> 01:48:20,399
unless I really like the people and

2701
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:23,440
really have trust and respect and know

2702
01:48:20,399 --> 01:48:25,359
like this is a relationship that's

2703
01:48:23,439 --> 01:48:27,599
positive, you know? I mean, you really

2704
01:48:25,359 --> 01:48:30,960
touched on it when you said trust,

2705
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:33,360
right? Um I I feel like in in a even in

2706
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:35,039
a a non-consulting

2707
01:48:33,359 --> 01:48:38,319
uh setting like let's say you're an

2708
01:48:35,039 --> 01:48:39,840
employee for a producer um as the

2709
01:48:38,319 --> 01:48:41,519
producer you have to trust your

2710
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:44,639
employees and as the employees you have

2711
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:46,960
to trust those uh that are hiring you um

2712
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:49,199
in in the direction that's being given

2713
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:51,760
as well as the effort that's being put

2714
01:48:49,198 --> 01:48:53,678
into those directions. And so, you know,

2715
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:57,719
it when then translating that to a

2716
01:48:53,679 --> 01:49:00,800
consultant and uh client relationship,

2717
01:48:57,719 --> 01:49:03,439
the the trust that needs to be there

2718
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:07,039
needs to be something that uh precedes

2719
01:49:03,439 --> 01:49:11,439
the application of these different um

2720
01:49:07,039 --> 01:49:13,039
methods and SOPs and strategies, right?

2721
01:49:11,439 --> 01:49:14,719
Because if they if they don't trust that

2722
01:49:13,039 --> 01:49:16,238
you know what you're talking about, then

2723
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:18,319
they're not going to want to implement

2724
01:49:16,238 --> 01:49:21,519
it. And if they don't implement it or if

2725
01:49:18,319 --> 01:49:23,359
they partially implement it and you as

2726
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:24,880
the consultant are saying, "Okay, here's

2727
01:49:23,359 --> 01:49:27,519
the results that we should be seeing

2728
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:29,840
when you implement my my recipe this

2729
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:31,840
way." Uh, but you're not seeing those

2730
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:34,480
results. And they're going, "Well, we

2731
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:37,520
listened, you know, to what you said."

2732
01:49:34,479 --> 01:49:39,919
um then that's where I can see a lot of

2733
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:41,920
um frustrations arise where you know

2734
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:44,239
unless you have these different

2735
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:47,600
abilities to monitor and then

2736
01:49:44,238 --> 01:49:49,439
understanding uh of how to interpret the

2737
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:51,199
different data that's being generated by

2738
01:49:49,439 --> 01:49:54,079
these different monitoring apparatuses

2739
01:49:51,198 --> 01:49:56,799
so that you can be like oh this tank

2740
01:49:54,079 --> 01:49:59,679
emptied at this point I see the dryback

2741
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:01,760
here I see that it wasn't handwatered

2742
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:04,158
then when that was the standard because

2743
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:05,920
you saw that the volutric water content

2744
01:50:04,158 --> 01:50:08,638
dropped below a specific point. Why

2745
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:10,560
didn't that happen? Oh, well, we didn't

2746
01:50:08,639 --> 01:50:13,359
know that the tank ran dry. Artifacts.

2747
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:15,520
That's one thing I I I like that that

2748
01:50:13,359 --> 01:50:17,359
David uses that term artifacts in the

2749
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:19,840
data cuz you're like you have to have

2750
01:50:17,359 --> 01:50:21,599
enough relevant world experience to know

2751
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:25,360
what to look for and what trends

2752
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:29,679
typically could mean certain uh certain

2753
01:50:25,359 --> 01:50:32,079
things. And and you know to me uh

2754
01:50:29,679 --> 01:50:33,359
looking at data it can be a double-edged

2755
01:50:32,079 --> 01:50:35,840
sword because you don't necessarily know

2756
01:50:33,359 --> 01:50:38,319
what to look for always uh if you're not

2757
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:40,960
trained but also if you are you can get

2758
01:50:38,319 --> 01:50:42,719
lost in the sauce and the data and just

2759
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:45,279
disappear down a rabbit hole in data

2760
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:48,079
that's not actually helping you. It's

2761
01:50:45,279 --> 01:50:50,719
kind of uh myopic too myopic and getting

2762
01:50:48,079 --> 01:50:52,399
in the way. um you know when you get

2763
01:50:50,719 --> 01:50:54,560
lost in the data all the time like you

2764
01:50:52,399 --> 01:50:56,319
may notice things and but the reality is

2765
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:57,840
is you you make observations in the

2766
01:50:56,319 --> 01:50:59,519
garden and you validate those

2767
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:02,159
observations with the data that you're

2768
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:05,639
looking at, right? Uh and and so then

2769
01:51:02,158 --> 01:51:08,719
there's there's a lot of

2770
01:51:05,639 --> 01:51:10,800
uh conflicting potential problems that

2771
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:13,600
you could have that could reflect in the

2772
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:15,760
same outcome in data. um right, you

2773
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:18,800
know, having too heavy of a dryback or

2774
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:20,480
having a VPD swing of like, oh, our dew

2775
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:23,600
went down here or lights went off and we

2776
01:51:20,479 --> 01:51:25,919
sprayed here or whatever the case may be

2777
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:28,079
that you're seeing like the decisions

2778
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:31,520
you're making are not always live and

2779
01:51:28,079 --> 01:51:34,399
die by by the data, but as more so how

2780
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:36,800
does that how do we like look at the

2781
01:51:34,399 --> 01:51:39,039
data objectively look at the facility

2782
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:42,239
and the plants and make correlations

2783
01:51:39,039 --> 01:51:44,960
here that drive quicker

2784
01:51:42,238 --> 01:51:48,559
solutions and outcomes to improvement in

2785
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:50,880
a more efficient and effective uh way.

2786
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:52,239
Um right, you know, and so that's why I

2787
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:54,880
think it's really helpful for a lot of

2788
01:51:52,238 --> 01:51:58,638
consultants to have more data and more

2789
01:51:54,880 --> 01:52:00,960
more of that. But um but that's kind of

2790
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:03,239
uh that's kind of the a big challenge

2791
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:07,158
too cuz it can be

2792
01:52:03,238 --> 01:52:09,359
potentially limiting for uh for some of

2793
01:52:07,158 --> 01:52:10,638
these consultants who aren't always on

2794
01:52:09,359 --> 01:52:12,479
site all the time, who aren't always

2795
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:14,800
there. Maybe they have to place somebody

2796
01:52:12,479 --> 01:52:16,319
who's got that skill set to be like,

2797
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:18,079
"Hey, you need to go do all these things

2798
01:52:16,319 --> 01:52:19,920
and check all, you know, and then I'll

2799
01:52:18,079 --> 01:52:22,719
look at this from a third party

2800
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:25,359
perspective and make some uh make some

2801
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:26,480
uh recommendations." For sure. I mean it

2802
01:52:25,359 --> 01:52:28,639
feels like there's a little bit of a

2803
01:52:26,479 --> 01:52:31,118
misnomer in the industry at this point

2804
01:52:28,639 --> 01:52:32,880
right now uh based on what you just said

2805
01:52:31,118 --> 01:52:37,839
where you know there there may need to

2806
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:41,440
be less datadriven decisionm and more um

2807
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:43,279
uh data supported decisionm where you're

2808
01:52:41,439 --> 01:52:45,118
not just looking at the data and making

2809
01:52:43,279 --> 01:52:47,279
a decision based on that but you need to

2810
01:52:45,118 --> 01:52:50,639
like you said look at the plants see

2811
01:52:47,279 --> 01:52:53,319
what they're saying to you based on you

2812
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:56,079
know their structure their

2813
01:52:53,319 --> 01:52:57,920
tur you you know, are the pots actually

2814
01:52:56,079 --> 01:53:00,439
drying back? Is there a consistency

2815
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:02,319
across the crop? Um, are there

2816
01:53:00,439 --> 01:53:04,238
inconsistencies? Look at those different

2817
01:53:02,319 --> 01:53:06,158
things. And then look at the data and

2818
01:53:04,238 --> 01:53:07,919
say, "Oh, you know, maybe I could

2819
01:53:06,158 --> 01:53:10,960
tighten up this parameter a little bit

2820
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:13,039
more." Or I could change this uh and

2821
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:15,039
tweak this. And I, you know, I can see

2822
01:53:13,039 --> 01:53:17,118
that based on the data and these

2823
01:53:15,039 --> 01:53:19,118
different trends that it is going this

2824
01:53:17,118 --> 01:53:21,039
way or that way. And I've seen that

2825
01:53:19,118 --> 01:53:24,479
before. It's caused this. So now I can

2826
01:53:21,039 --> 01:53:26,960
make that educated change. Um it because

2827
01:53:24,479 --> 01:53:29,198
sometimes you can look at a nice uh

2828
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:31,198
pretty chart and sometimes think oh

2829
01:53:29,198 --> 01:53:33,839
everything's fine but then you go into

2830
01:53:31,198 --> 01:53:35,598
the room and everything's not fine and

2831
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:38,560
you have to then figure out what it is

2832
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:40,159
that's causing that. Um, so I yeah,

2833
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:43,280
sometimes I do believe that there is

2834
01:53:40,158 --> 01:53:45,279
like a tyranny of data where if you

2835
01:53:43,279 --> 01:53:47,439
stick to the data and only the data,

2836
01:53:45,279 --> 01:53:49,039
then you're not going to, you know, that

2837
01:53:47,439 --> 01:53:50,399
like you said, you're lost in the sauce

2838
01:53:49,039 --> 01:53:52,399
at that point and you're not really

2839
01:53:50,399 --> 01:53:54,559
looking at, you know, are the plants

2840
01:53:52,399 --> 01:53:56,158
healthy? Good. Leave it alone. Don't

2841
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:57,760
look at the data anymore because you're

2842
01:53:56,158 --> 01:54:00,519
tricking yourself into thinking you need

2843
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:03,840
to do something. you're chasing this

2844
01:54:00,520 --> 01:54:06,320
this um nebulous kind of idea that you

2845
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:08,800
have that this one thing you're doing is

2846
01:54:06,319 --> 01:54:10,799
making all the difference and you're uh

2847
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:12,960
yeah you like I like I said you get lost

2848
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:15,440
in the sauce easily. Yeah. And that's

2849
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:19,039
the really the value of on-site you know

2850
01:54:15,439 --> 01:54:20,879
having somebody on site to really um

2851
01:54:19,039 --> 01:54:23,039
help be the eyes. And I think there's

2852
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:27,199
starting to be you starting to see these

2853
01:54:23,039 --> 01:54:29,519
like um Google glasses or these like you

2854
01:54:27,198 --> 01:54:30,879
know AI assisted technologies that allow

2855
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:34,560
you to look through the eyes of somebody

2856
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:36,800
else in uh in the facility that makes

2857
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:39,199
you be able to you know potentially be

2858
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:42,000
more valuable offsite or again back to

2859
01:54:39,198 --> 01:54:44,238
the hyperspectral imaging or RGB cameras

2860
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,760
or whatever like it's assisted you know

2861
01:54:44,238 --> 01:54:47,759
it's assisted you're still making the

2862
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:49,760
decisions you're still and maybe the AI

2863
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:52,079
will start driving those decisions in a

2864
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:54,480
way that's way superior to what we're

2865
01:54:52,079 --> 01:54:57,198
able to do. Um, and then you don't need

2866
01:54:54,479 --> 01:54:59,198
those types of people. But like you know

2867
01:54:57,198 --> 01:55:02,879
I think that we have to really start to

2868
01:54:59,198 --> 01:55:06,879
like define what our value is in this

2869
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:09,039
space of evolving technology and not to

2870
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:12,199
to to let the ego get involved and say

2871
01:55:09,039 --> 01:55:14,800
oh I'm better you know or I'm it's like

2872
01:55:12,198 --> 01:55:19,598
okay how do we make as humans make

2873
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:21,920
objective decisions to uh to support

2874
01:55:19,599 --> 01:55:24,079
people's businesses right like we're

2875
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:26,800
we're not just here to try to be the

2876
01:55:24,079 --> 01:55:28,719
best crop steer be the best breeder or

2877
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:30,880
whatever. You know, it's like we we want

2878
01:55:28,719 --> 01:55:33,599
to we want to make this industry

2879
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:36,400
sustainable and have longevity and have

2880
01:55:33,599 --> 01:55:39,599
still have a degree of craftsmanship and

2881
01:55:36,399 --> 01:55:41,839
and care and pride. Uh you know, that

2882
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:44,400
that is that is what we're holding on to

2883
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:46,719
in a lot of cases. That's what allows us

2884
01:55:44,399 --> 01:55:49,519
to, you know, love and appreciate what

2885
01:55:46,719 --> 01:55:53,000
we do. Um right. You know, I think that

2886
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:56,719
we have to to strike the balance between

2887
01:55:53,000 --> 01:56:01,319
production, revenue, and just

2888
01:55:56,719 --> 01:56:05,599
stewardship of of our of the the

2889
01:56:01,319 --> 01:56:07,198
plant. For sure. I mean, man, you you're

2890
01:56:05,599 --> 01:56:10,800
really well spoken in this field.

2891
01:56:07,198 --> 01:56:13,279
Obviously, you have a lot of experience

2892
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:15,440
and I feel like your application of

2893
01:56:13,279 --> 01:56:17,039
knowledge is up there with a lot of

2894
01:56:15,439 --> 01:56:19,678
other people that I've talked to that

2895
01:56:17,039 --> 01:56:22,560
are kind of leading big changes in the

2896
01:56:19,679 --> 01:56:24,960
industry to try to make this sustainable

2897
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:28,239
future for those of us that are not

2898
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:31,599
necessarily in this for some uh ego

2899
01:56:28,238 --> 01:56:34,399
prize, but because there's so many uses

2900
01:56:31,599 --> 01:56:37,199
for cannabis, right? like whether it be

2901
01:56:34,399 --> 01:56:40,719
a medicinal use, a recreational use, uh

2902
01:56:37,198 --> 01:56:43,519
leisurely use, um whether you're using

2903
01:56:40,719 --> 01:56:47,359
some topical for grandma's arthritis, or

2904
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:49,760
if you're using, you know, a giant 1oz

2905
01:56:47,359 --> 01:56:51,598
joint to set the party off, right?

2906
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:53,840
There's just a huge variety of

2907
01:56:51,599 --> 01:56:56,079
applications for cannabis. And as

2908
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:59,920
cultivators, we are almost the first

2909
01:56:56,079 --> 01:57:02,639
line in this operation where we are

2910
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:05,520
producing uh what is going to eventually

2911
01:57:02,639 --> 01:57:08,359
be turned into this myriad of products.

2912
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:11,440
And um you know with all of your

2913
01:57:08,359 --> 01:57:14,719
experience both in home growing and

2914
01:57:11,439 --> 01:57:16,479
commercial cultivation and um through

2915
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:19,359
all of these different avenues of

2916
01:57:16,479 --> 01:57:23,678
optimization that you've taken

2917
01:57:19,359 --> 01:57:26,000
um for yourself, what are some of the

2918
01:57:23,679 --> 01:57:28,039
biggest learning experiences that you've

2919
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:30,079
had? And let's take this as a

2920
01:57:28,039 --> 01:57:32,238
two-parter. So what would be one of the

2921
01:57:30,079 --> 01:57:34,960
biggest learning experiences that you've

2922
01:57:32,238 --> 01:57:36,000
had that was due to a setback? And what

2923
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:38,000
was one of the biggest learning

2924
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:40,679
experiences you had that was due to a

2925
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:44,960
success?

2926
01:57:40,679 --> 01:57:49,279
Um, yeah, that's a great question. The

2927
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:51,679
the um the setback piece we've encount

2928
01:57:49,279 --> 01:57:55,198
you know I've encountered multiple

2929
01:57:51,679 --> 01:57:58,319
situations with setbacks that were both

2930
01:57:55,198 --> 01:58:01,598
um eyeopening and disheartening at the

2931
01:57:58,319 --> 01:58:03,759
same time. um you know dealing with

2932
01:58:01,599 --> 01:58:08,480
hopllay and vyroid once we understood

2933
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:11,520
what it actually was. Uh we made an

2934
01:58:08,479 --> 01:58:14,319
executive decision to clear house in our

2935
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:17,159
mom and in our mom room and reset our

2936
01:58:14,319 --> 01:58:19,840
fix uh because everything was so heavily

2937
01:58:17,158 --> 01:58:21,759
infected that uh our production volume

2938
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:24,159
was going down and that was before I

2939
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:28,679
really knew best practices to mitigate

2940
01:58:24,158 --> 01:58:31,920
that. you know, we were victims of the

2941
01:58:28,679 --> 01:58:34,800
um I guess ignorance of hopllay and

2942
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:37,039
vyroid until it was too late. Um

2943
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:40,719
bringing in genetics from outside

2944
01:58:37,039 --> 01:58:42,479
sources that you don't trust fully. Uh

2945
01:58:40,719 --> 01:58:45,599
that was a double-edged sword because we

2946
01:58:42,479 --> 01:58:48,959
also got russet mites from that um from

2947
01:58:45,599 --> 01:58:50,880
that uh that clone order that was some

2948
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:52,639
of the best cultivars that we had, but

2949
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:53,960
we got it from somewhere that was not

2950
01:58:52,639 --> 01:58:57,760
necessarily

2951
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:58,880
um I guess uh reputable uh back then

2952
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:00,639
because there were not a lot of

2953
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:02,480
reputable options that had really good

2954
01:59:00,639 --> 01:59:05,039
variety and uniqueness and things that

2955
01:59:02,479 --> 01:59:07,359
were not out in the market fully. So

2956
01:59:05,039 --> 01:59:10,560
that was a naive decision that that I

2957
01:59:07,359 --> 01:59:13,118
made that I, you know, wouldn't say that

2958
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:16,080
I necessarily fully regret because I

2959
01:59:13,118 --> 01:59:18,000
learned a lot about how to manage hop

2960
01:59:16,079 --> 01:59:20,479
and vyroid, how to get rid of russet

2961
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:24,158
mites, but also like when to stop when

2962
01:59:20,479 --> 01:59:26,158
you when when it's time to uh to reset

2963
01:59:24,158 --> 01:59:28,079
and and like what is the point of

2964
01:59:26,158 --> 01:59:29,759
critical mass and no return and then

2965
01:59:28,079 --> 01:59:31,359
never letting yourself get back to that

2966
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:33,199
point again moving forward if you can

2967
01:59:31,359 --> 01:59:37,519
help it. you know, when you have a

2968
01:59:33,198 --> 01:59:40,158
problem that gets so out of hand uh that

2969
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:43,040
you have to make a huge sacrifice,

2970
01:59:40,158 --> 01:59:44,799
that's um that was a that was a a low

2971
01:59:43,039 --> 01:59:48,158
point, but also a big learning curve for

2972
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:50,639
me where I just I really understood like

2973
01:59:48,158 --> 01:59:52,399
incremental checks and balances and and

2974
01:59:50,639 --> 01:59:54,719
understanding like crop registration

2975
01:59:52,399 --> 01:59:58,079
even down to that like sanitary

2976
01:59:54,719 --> 02:00:00,239
practices with shears and it helped me

2977
01:59:58,079 --> 02:00:02,559
manage mold issues in the garden too

2978
02:00:00,238 --> 02:00:06,399
because it I just took a much more

2979
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:10,320
systematic approach. Uh, you know, I

2980
02:00:06,399 --> 02:00:12,158
think that's a big part of it. Um, yeah,

2981
02:00:10,319 --> 02:00:14,118
that's kind of how I would answer that

2982
02:00:12,158 --> 02:00:16,479
question in terms of

2983
02:00:14,118 --> 02:00:19,279
setbacks. The, uh, the other side of

2984
02:00:16,479 --> 02:00:23,000
that question is, you know, how do you

2985
02:00:19,279 --> 02:00:26,000
how did I triumph from a success?

2986
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:27,840
Um, you know, I think the successes, a

2987
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:30,639
lot of them, there were definitely some

2988
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:32,560
successes in terms of product that we

2989
02:00:30,639 --> 02:00:36,118
produced, quality and yield and whatnot.

2990
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:39,360
And like had some really good runs. Um,

2991
02:00:36,118 --> 02:00:40,719
but you know, to avoid the like, oh, the

2992
02:00:39,359 --> 02:00:43,039
you should have seen the fish that got

2993
02:00:40,719 --> 02:00:44,880
away kind of story. Like I think a lot

2994
02:00:43,039 --> 02:00:48,639
of it came down to like I felt success

2995
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:50,639
with training people. Um, I I I think

2996
02:00:48,639 --> 02:00:53,118
that I've taken a lot of pride in my

2997
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:56,840
ability to break things down and coach

2998
02:00:53,118 --> 02:01:00,399
and train and educate people. And

2999
02:00:56,840 --> 02:01:02,960
um, you know, when my first job ever was

3000
02:01:00,399 --> 02:01:05,598
a martial arts instructor and then I was

3001
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:07,359
an English teacher online and I, you

3002
02:01:05,599 --> 02:01:09,639
know, so I've had a lot of jobs and

3003
02:01:07,359 --> 02:01:13,039
roles and experiences as a

3004
02:01:09,639 --> 02:01:14,480
um, you know, an educator, I should say.

3005
02:01:13,039 --> 02:01:18,158
Um but yeah, when I was working at

3006
02:01:14,479 --> 02:01:20,399
Curleaf and and bringing up a lot of

3007
02:01:18,158 --> 02:01:23,439
people at the same time and just

3008
02:01:20,399 --> 02:01:25,759
watching people uh sort of take to

3009
02:01:23,439 --> 02:01:28,479
things or how to everyone has a very

3010
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:31,280
different way of learning and uh and I

3011
02:01:28,479 --> 02:01:33,919
had a couple guys that moved on up and

3012
02:01:31,279 --> 02:01:37,279
ended up in much higher roles and

3013
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:39,440
learned a lot and applied themselves and

3014
02:01:37,279 --> 02:01:41,279
um you know, not to necessarily credit

3015
02:01:39,439 --> 02:01:44,719
myself for their success at all, but to

3016
02:01:41,279 --> 02:01:46,158
be like, hey, you you know, they have uh

3017
02:01:44,719 --> 02:01:48,639
acknowledged that they wouldn't be where

3018
02:01:46,158 --> 02:01:50,158
they were without me. Um, for sure, you

3019
02:01:48,639 --> 02:01:51,800
know, I've had some really challenging

3020
02:01:50,158 --> 02:01:54,719
problems with staff, too,

3021
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:58,560
where people who felt undermined when I

3022
02:01:54,719 --> 02:02:00,279
came in or who felt like I maybe didn't

3023
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:02,880
have hadn't proved myself or hadn't

3024
02:02:00,279 --> 02:02:05,118
hadn't succeeded in a certain way that

3025
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:06,960
allowed them to have respect for me,

3026
02:02:05,118 --> 02:02:10,079
which was a projection obviously of

3027
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:11,679
their own personal insecurities. but to

3028
02:02:10,079 --> 02:02:13,118
bridge that gap and like build that

3029
02:02:11,679 --> 02:02:15,359
trust and build those positive

3030
02:02:13,118 --> 02:02:18,000
relationships to be to a point where I

3031
02:02:15,359 --> 02:02:20,238
had a successful collaborative effort

3032
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:22,960
with someone who felt very much like I

3033
02:02:20,238 --> 02:02:24,959
had stepped on them. Um, and then you

3034
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:27,599
know through the work and the my efforts

3035
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:29,279
and my labor and my knowledge and

3036
02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:30,960
everything to like kind of level with

3037
02:02:29,279 --> 02:02:33,198
that person and give them opportunities

3038
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:36,719
and then see them successful on their

3039
02:02:33,198 --> 02:02:38,158
own. Um, that that's a a success in my

3040
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:40,158
book.

3041
02:02:38,158 --> 02:02:42,638
Yeah, I love that. I It's always so

3042
02:02:40,158 --> 02:02:45,519
great to see especially when you are

3043
02:02:42,639 --> 02:02:48,000
trying to approach it through um you

3044
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:50,000
know not necessarily learning that my

3045
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:53,679
method is best but trying to teach

3046
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:56,238
people um you like in industry

3047
02:02:53,679 --> 02:02:58,560
standardized best practices

3048
02:02:56,238 --> 02:03:00,399
uh or um even just some basic

3049
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:03,920
understanding so that they can make more

3050
02:03:00,399 --> 02:03:05,920
educated uh decisions themselves. And

3051
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:08,000
then you start to see them make those

3052
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:10,239
decisions as you would have hoped for

3053
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:12,238
them to make them. It is a really nice

3054
02:03:10,238 --> 02:03:15,598
feeling because you you can start to see

3055
02:03:12,238 --> 02:03:18,799
that your uh style of education is not

3056
02:03:15,599 --> 02:03:20,639
only effective but it is uh it's working

3057
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:23,360
real time live right there in front of

3058
02:03:20,639 --> 02:03:25,679
you. And that that's a huge a huge

3059
02:03:23,359 --> 02:03:27,359
feeling. I I can definitely agree with

3060
02:03:25,679 --> 02:03:29,199
that. I've I've seen it a few times

3061
02:03:27,359 --> 02:03:31,598
where I've taught somebody something and

3062
02:03:29,198 --> 02:03:34,319
then seen them implement it successfully

3063
02:03:31,599 --> 02:03:37,440
and it feels really good to see that

3064
02:03:34,319 --> 02:03:39,519
that education is being uh understood

3065
02:03:37,439 --> 02:03:41,919
cuz sometimes I feel like I ramble and I

3066
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:43,920
I feel like my my mind doesn't

3067
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:46,319
necessarily work in the same way that

3068
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:48,719
someone else's mind may work and so my

3069
02:03:46,319 --> 02:03:52,079
explanation of something might just be

3070
02:03:48,719 --> 02:03:54,279
you know too esoterically me to be

3071
02:03:52,079 --> 02:03:57,359
applicable to their their way of

3072
02:03:54,279 --> 02:03:58,880
understanding Um, but you know, through

3073
02:03:57,359 --> 02:04:01,198
this podcast and even other

3074
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:04,480
conversations that I've had with people,

3075
02:04:01,198 --> 02:04:07,198
it is uh it is definitely helping to to

3076
02:04:04,479 --> 02:04:09,439
make a lot more of this information

3077
02:04:07,198 --> 02:04:11,919
um accessible to people and then to make

3078
02:04:09,439 --> 02:04:14,399
people like yourself or myself or any of

3079
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:17,118
our other guests more accessible to the

3080
02:04:14,399 --> 02:04:18,799
general community. um where now they'll

3081
02:04:17,118 --> 02:04:21,039
see that you have this level of

3082
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:22,719
education and understanding where maybe

3083
02:04:21,039 --> 02:04:25,039
they'll reach out to you with a question

3084
02:04:22,719 --> 02:04:27,279
because they feel confident in your

3085
02:04:25,039 --> 02:04:29,198
ability because they've heard you talk.

3086
02:04:27,279 --> 02:04:31,759
They've heard your your cander and your

3087
02:04:29,198 --> 02:04:34,079
understanding of these different topics.

3088
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:36,000
Um I I feel like that's just such a huge

3089
02:04:34,079 --> 02:04:38,639
value to the community in general as

3090
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:40,800
well. Yeah, I appreciate you hosting

3091
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:42,880
this podcast, too. I think that is

3092
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:44,400
really valuable to have you know there's

3093
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:46,880
a lot of noise and there's a lot of

3094
02:04:44,399 --> 02:04:49,118
negativity and there's a lot of uh it's

3095
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:51,840
easy to get caught up in a lot of things

3096
02:04:49,118 --> 02:04:54,399
in our industry because it's it's very

3097
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:56,319
turbulent very tumultuous you know um

3098
02:04:54,399 --> 02:04:59,279
and I think spreading the word and

3099
02:04:56,319 --> 02:05:01,920
education from not from a place of ego

3100
02:04:59,279 --> 02:05:04,238
or authority or anything just like hey

3101
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:06,079
we're just here sharing stuff this is my

3102
02:05:04,238 --> 02:05:09,919
experience you know nobody's any better

3103
02:05:06,079 --> 02:05:13,039
than I I like to uh I often like to use

3104
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:15,520
the term principles like guide uh guide

3105
02:05:13,039 --> 02:05:17,118
a lot of things. So you know if you

3106
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:20,880
understand the core principles of

3107
02:05:17,118 --> 02:05:22,799
functionality of of a system um or just

3108
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:26,400
a way of thinking then then you can

3109
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:28,800
always revert back to uh to that that

3110
02:05:26,399 --> 02:05:32,000
the fundamentals and the foundations of

3111
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:34,639
of uh of problem solving and

3112
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:36,599
troubleshooting and and and learning how

3113
02:05:34,639 --> 02:05:40,319
to problem solve. Learning how

3114
02:05:36,599 --> 02:05:43,039
to objectively make decisions that are

3115
02:05:40,319 --> 02:05:45,198
based on principles is is is like the

3116
02:05:43,039 --> 02:05:48,079
teach a man to fish thing in such an

3117
02:05:45,198 --> 02:05:49,598
extreme degree, right?

3118
02:05:48,079 --> 02:05:51,359
Yeah. Absolutely. Like provide those

3119
02:05:49,599 --> 02:05:53,599
foundations so that they can build their

3120
02:05:51,359 --> 02:05:55,920
own program, their own house basically

3121
02:05:53,599 --> 02:05:57,599
rather than um you know providing all

3122
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:59,440
the pre-fabricated lumber and

3123
02:05:57,599 --> 02:06:01,279
everything. You know you you want to

3124
02:05:59,439 --> 02:06:02,960
give them something solid to work from

3125
02:06:01,279 --> 02:06:06,079
but not necessarily provide them the

3126
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:08,158
whole thing. it because it is there is

3127
02:06:06,079 --> 02:06:10,158
such a uniqueness to how each individual

3128
02:06:08,158 --> 02:06:11,920
wants to operate not only within the

3129
02:06:10,158 --> 02:06:14,079
garden but within life that it's really

3130
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:17,920
hard to give them a cookie cutter and

3131
02:06:14,079 --> 02:06:19,760
say just do this. Um

3132
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:22,158
I'm guilty of that. I wanted that for a

3133
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:25,599
long time to be like I just need the

3134
02:06:22,158 --> 02:06:28,399
recipe. I just want the you know like I

3135
02:06:25,599 --> 02:06:32,078
want the irrigation strategy. I want the

3136
02:06:28,399 --> 02:06:33,839
you know whatever it might be. Um, I

3137
02:06:32,078 --> 02:06:35,679
wanted the the solution. Like I wanted

3138
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:38,639
the the myopic answer. And it's like

3139
02:06:35,679 --> 02:06:41,359
that doesn't really help help you. It

3140
02:06:38,639 --> 02:06:44,159
doesn't help anybody. It it just you're

3141
02:06:41,359 --> 02:06:47,759
trying to like fit this close this box

3142
02:06:44,158 --> 02:06:50,319
on um the specifics. Like we could go

3143
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:51,520
all day into like specific crop steering

3144
02:06:50,319 --> 02:06:53,198
strategies, but I don't think that

3145
02:06:51,520 --> 02:06:56,000
really helps people that much from my

3146
02:06:53,198 --> 02:07:00,158
perspective of like we don't you you

3147
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:04,960
learn the nuances of of these very kind

3148
02:07:00,158 --> 02:07:06,960
of um advanced strategies through a lot

3149
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:09,039
of your own trial and error and

3150
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:12,560
experience when you're trying to make

3151
02:07:09,039 --> 02:07:14,960
decisions based off of logic and

3152
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:16,880
principles and and that sort of thing.

3153
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:19,520
You know, I I that's why I I try not to

3154
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:21,039
get too deep in the weeds on anything,

3155
02:07:19,520 --> 02:07:24,800
you know, specific because I just find

3156
02:07:21,039 --> 02:07:26,238
it to be less less helpful than um than

3157
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:29,199
talking about what we've talked about

3158
02:07:26,238 --> 02:07:31,198
today. For sure. Well, I mean, we we've

3159
02:07:29,198 --> 02:07:33,598
kind of already gone over our uh

3160
02:07:31,198 --> 02:07:36,238
predicted runtime here, so I'm going to

3161
02:07:33,599 --> 02:07:38,639
start to try and wrap us wrap us up, but

3162
02:07:36,238 --> 02:07:40,399
um you know, there there's so many more

3163
02:07:38,639 --> 02:07:41,679
questions that I'd want to ask you. you

3164
02:07:40,399 --> 02:07:43,839
know, the future of the cannabis

3165
02:07:41,679 --> 02:07:45,440
industry, where you see it going, what

3166
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:47,760
do you feel is being like swept under

3167
02:07:45,439 --> 02:07:49,279
the rug in the cannabis industry now?

3168
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:52,719
But, you know, I feel like we've touched

3169
02:07:49,279 --> 02:07:54,759
on a lot of that stuff kind of uh

3170
02:07:52,719 --> 02:07:57,279
without it being direct throughout our

3171
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:59,880
conversation. So, maybe one of the final

3172
02:07:57,279 --> 02:08:02,559
wrap-up questions that I can ask

3173
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:04,960
is what advice would you give for new

3174
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:07,280
growers entering the industry? you're

3175
02:08:04,960 --> 02:08:10,960
you're not cuz you yourself are not one

3176
02:08:07,279 --> 02:08:13,599
of these uh old legacy growers that has

3177
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:15,520
been doing this for 20 years and adapted

3178
02:08:13,599 --> 02:08:18,880
with the market. You know, you you kind

3179
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:21,760
of entered it at a you know, late stage

3180
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:25,599
um within the cannabis game almost as it

3181
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:27,880
was going fully recreational across um

3182
02:08:25,599 --> 02:08:30,880
majority of the states.

3183
02:08:27,880 --> 02:08:32,960
So, you know, maybe you could address

3184
02:08:30,880 --> 02:08:35,279
this for people wanting to get into the

3185
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:38,000
cultivation industry or even those who

3186
02:08:35,279 --> 02:08:39,920
want to just get into growing cannabis

3187
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:42,078
in general, but what's some what's some

3188
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:44,239
advice you would give for new growers? I

3189
02:08:42,078 --> 02:08:48,158
mean, I I going to start with values,

3190
02:08:44,238 --> 02:08:51,279
right? like be humble, uh be curious, um

3191
02:08:48,158 --> 02:08:54,799
your use your excitement to

3192
02:08:51,279 --> 02:08:59,519
uh to learn, um and and kind of keep

3193
02:08:54,800 --> 02:09:01,360
your keep yourself uh within the like

3194
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:02,880
it's easy to get lost in the weeds as I

3195
02:09:01,359 --> 02:09:05,359
just said. And I think if you're a new

3196
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:07,039
grower coming in, find mentors, find

3197
02:09:05,359 --> 02:09:09,118
people who really understand certain

3198
02:09:07,039 --> 02:09:11,519
things that you want to learn, uh, and

3199
02:09:09,118 --> 02:09:14,000
diversify those things and like really

3200
02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:15,599
try to I think what helped me the most

3201
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:18,639
when I first started working in a

3202
02:09:15,599 --> 02:09:20,239
commercial facility, um, was that I just

3203
02:09:18,639 --> 02:09:22,319
wanted to do everything. I just wanted I

3204
02:09:20,238 --> 02:09:24,879
put in all it's work. It was work ethic.

3205
02:09:22,319 --> 02:09:26,479
It was like I just I wanted to work in

3206
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:29,440
every department. I wanted to learn how

3207
02:09:26,479 --> 02:09:31,598
to do all the things and I wanted to be

3208
02:09:29,439 --> 02:09:33,439
knowledgeable and useful and valuable

3209
02:09:31,599 --> 02:09:36,000
and I found the thing that I was really

3210
02:09:33,439 --> 02:09:38,158
good at, you know, whatever things those

3211
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:40,560
were that I was really good at and I dug

3212
02:09:38,158 --> 02:09:42,879
into those and I made a difference and

3213
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:46,159
made it, you know, measurable. And I

3214
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:48,159
think like just picking people to learn

3215
02:09:46,158 --> 02:09:50,799
from and picking opportunities that give

3216
02:09:48,158 --> 02:09:54,238
you the most the best education and and

3217
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:56,239
being constantly hungry and curious. uh

3218
02:09:54,238 --> 02:09:57,839
you know be the first one there and the

3219
02:09:56,238 --> 02:10:00,479
last one to leave. You can't that's

3220
02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:04,880
something that you can't learn from

3221
02:10:00,479 --> 02:10:06,718
somebody is uh is work ethic you know um

3222
02:10:04,880 --> 02:10:09,440
and I always found that to be the most

3223
02:10:06,719 --> 02:10:11,920
valuable quality within my employees to

3224
02:10:09,439 --> 02:10:13,919
to a certain extent was like you could

3225
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:15,679
have all the knowledge you want but if

3226
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:18,078
you can't just get out there and do what

3227
02:10:15,679 --> 02:10:21,599
has to be done you're not going to get

3228
02:10:18,078 --> 02:10:23,599
anywhere. Um, and I think that your

3229
02:10:21,599 --> 02:10:25,480
network and building that network and

3230
02:10:23,599 --> 02:10:27,800
meeting people and building

3231
02:10:25,479 --> 02:10:31,359
relationships h they have to go, you

3232
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:33,840
can't necessarily do that on top of like

3233
02:10:31,359 --> 02:10:35,439
above and beyond learning the skill and

3234
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:37,440
having the core skills and core

3235
02:10:35,439 --> 02:10:40,078
competencies. develop those core

3236
02:10:37,439 --> 02:10:42,078
competencies as much as you can and also

3237
02:10:40,078 --> 02:10:45,439
take opportunities to build your network

3238
02:10:42,078 --> 02:10:47,679
and to meet people and to ask questions

3239
02:10:45,439 --> 02:10:49,919
and sound stupid and whatever, you know,

3240
02:10:47,679 --> 02:10:52,719
like just constantly remove the ego and

3241
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:55,279
be hungry and and try really hard to

3242
02:10:52,719 --> 02:10:58,719
diversify and find mentors. I think

3243
02:10:55,279 --> 02:11:00,639
that's those are my best best bits. I

3244
02:10:58,719 --> 02:11:02,560
like it. Yeah, it's be hungry for

3245
02:11:00,639 --> 02:11:04,719
information and open to that information

3246
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:07,400
when it's given to you. And you know,

3247
02:11:04,719 --> 02:11:10,560
just if you're going to apply it, apply

3248
02:11:07,399 --> 02:11:12,638
it, assess it, and don't necessarily

3249
02:11:10,560 --> 02:11:15,880
just take everything for its face value.

3250
02:11:12,639 --> 02:11:19,760
Because there's a lot of

3251
02:11:15,880 --> 02:11:22,078
um uh what's the what's the term? Snake

3252
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:23,840
juice. You know, there's a lot of

3253
02:11:22,078 --> 02:11:27,039
there's a lot of misinformation and a

3254
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:29,599
lot of uh bad information out there. And

3255
02:11:27,039 --> 02:11:31,439
so being skeptical also I feel like

3256
02:11:29,599 --> 02:11:34,319
would go handinhand with what you're

3257
02:11:31,439 --> 02:11:36,960
saying is um you know take that

3258
02:11:34,319 --> 02:11:38,479
information and but use some skepticism

3259
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:40,399
and when you're trying to apply it and

3260
02:11:38,479 --> 02:11:43,439
and don't just take everything for what

3261
02:11:40,399 --> 02:11:45,920
people are saying as being true um even

3262
02:11:43,439 --> 02:11:49,439
if they sound good when they say it.

3263
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:51,679
Yeah. I mean definitely don't don't rush

3264
02:11:49,439 --> 02:11:54,319
the process. You know, one of the things

3265
02:11:51,679 --> 02:11:57,199
I learned from my early days in martial

3266
02:11:54,319 --> 02:11:59,599
arts and competing and whatnot was like

3267
02:11:57,198 --> 02:12:01,198
something that my instructor and master

3268
02:11:59,599 --> 02:12:03,440
always told me, which was like you never

3269
02:12:01,198 --> 02:12:05,279
really lose, you know, you may lose a

3270
02:12:03,439 --> 02:12:07,359
match or whatever, but at the end of the

3271
02:12:05,279 --> 02:12:10,238
day, like you either win or you learn,

3272
02:12:07,359 --> 02:12:12,639
you know, or you you do both. Uh, sure.

3273
02:12:10,238 --> 02:12:16,078
So that's I think it's easy to get

3274
02:12:12,639 --> 02:12:18,159
disheartened and have the um you know

3275
02:12:16,078 --> 02:12:19,519
bruising of the ego and whatnot and know

3276
02:12:18,158 --> 02:12:21,118
when it's time to walk away when it's

3277
02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:23,199
time to move on and move forward and

3278
02:12:21,118 --> 02:12:24,880
when you're not no longer being served.

3279
02:12:23,198 --> 02:12:26,319
I think I see a lot of people stagnate

3280
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:28,719
in the industry when they're finding

3281
02:12:26,319 --> 02:12:30,479
like this job isn't serving me anymore.

3282
02:12:28,719 --> 02:12:32,158
This this you know I'm not learning I'm

3283
02:12:30,479 --> 02:12:35,439
not getting anywhere and they just fall

3284
02:12:32,158 --> 02:12:37,598
into complacency and just stay there. uh

3285
02:12:35,439 --> 02:12:39,198
you know, take risks, jump off and do

3286
02:12:37,599 --> 02:12:41,920
something else. And and if you fail, you

3287
02:12:39,198 --> 02:12:45,359
fail, but like keep trying. You know, I

3288
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:48,719
I'm grateful for my um opportunities

3289
02:12:45,359 --> 02:12:51,118
that I was able to move into when I felt

3290
02:12:48,719 --> 02:12:53,279
like certain places were no longer

3291
02:12:51,118 --> 02:12:55,198
serving me. And I I constantly built my

3292
02:12:53,279 --> 02:12:57,279
network to put myself in a situation to

3293
02:12:55,198 --> 02:12:59,439
where I had opportunities when they when

3294
02:12:57,279 --> 02:13:02,319
I needed them.

3295
02:12:59,439 --> 02:13:04,559
Sure. It's like uh um dig the well

3296
02:13:02,319 --> 02:13:07,198
before you get thirsty.

3297
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:09,599
Um I've heard that a lot. Well, that's

3298
02:13:07,198 --> 02:13:11,000
awesome. And um I think that's a great a

3299
02:13:09,599 --> 02:13:13,360
great little wrap- up to our

3300
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:16,319
conversation. Uh of course, because this

3301
02:13:13,359 --> 02:13:18,960
is a cannabis podcast, we do have a few

3302
02:13:16,319 --> 02:13:21,439
ubiquitous uh cannabis related questions

3303
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:24,560
just to wrap up as a sort of rapidfire

3304
02:13:21,439 --> 02:13:27,839
finish to the conversation. Um so, what

3305
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:29,520
is your favorite strain of all time? M.

3306
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:31,520
Oh man, there's just so many for

3307
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:33,840
different reasons, but if I think back

3308
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:36,320
to like my best experiences on cannabis,

3309
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:37,319
it was probably uh some of the old

3310
02:13:36,319 --> 02:13:40,399
school

3311
02:13:37,319 --> 02:13:42,799
hazes, mango haze,

3312
02:13:40,399 --> 02:13:45,519
um you know, some of those really nice

3313
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:48,159
hazy strains that that I had as a kid.

3314
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:50,239
Yeah. And and you you grew up in Florida

3315
02:13:48,158 --> 02:13:54,000
is what I take it. Yeah, a lot of our

3316
02:13:50,238 --> 02:13:56,000
weed was from California and uh so I'm

3317
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:57,679
probably from New York, but Yeah, for

3318
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:00,319
sure. I think mango haze might have been

3319
02:13:57,679 --> 02:14:02,399
from your neck of the woods. We had some

3320
02:14:00,319 --> 02:14:05,279
interesting haze. We had like uh we had

3321
02:14:02,399 --> 02:14:09,039
a couple Florida haze strains for sure.

3322
02:14:05,279 --> 02:14:11,279
Swamp Boy seeds and whatnot. Yeah. Cool.

3323
02:14:09,039 --> 02:14:13,519
Well, um you know, the followup to that

3324
02:14:11,279 --> 02:14:16,559
question is of course who is your

3325
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:19,679
favorite breeder of all time?

3326
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:21,320
Uh man, that's a that's also a tough

3327
02:14:19,679 --> 02:14:27,639
question.

3328
02:14:21,319 --> 02:14:32,000
Um, I I used to I used to really like

3329
02:14:27,639 --> 02:14:33,679
DNA. Um, but I think I think most of the

3330
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:37,039
stuff that I've had lately that I really

3331
02:14:33,679 --> 02:14:40,840
liked has either come from like um you

3332
02:14:37,039 --> 02:14:43,840
know, Seed Junkie or like uh

3333
02:14:40,840 --> 02:14:46,239
um you know, even uh there's a there's a

3334
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:48,480
breeder here in Colorado uh called

3335
02:14:46,238 --> 02:14:50,839
Loving in Her Eyes. Yeah. just some

3336
02:14:48,479 --> 02:14:53,598
really really incredible incredible

3337
02:14:50,840 --> 02:14:55,599
strains. So something like that or like

3338
02:14:53,599 --> 02:14:58,078
you know I always really liked compound

3339
02:14:55,599 --> 02:14:59,920
growing compound genetic strains. They

3340
02:14:58,078 --> 02:15:02,399
were always some of the more fun ones to

3341
02:14:59,920 --> 02:15:06,480
grow. I'm I'm wrapping up a very small

3342
02:15:02,399 --> 02:15:09,198
hunt of um the blueberry rose from Love

3343
02:15:06,479 --> 02:15:12,078
in Her Eyes. I um I love their products.

3344
02:15:09,198 --> 02:15:16,000
I also their their Instagram profile is

3345
02:15:12,078 --> 02:15:18,719
always so well curated in terms of the

3346
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:21,198
the flower pictures and the sort of

3347
02:15:18,719 --> 02:15:22,719
mystique to the to the profile as well

3348
02:15:21,198 --> 02:15:24,319
where they don't even always tell you

3349
02:15:22,719 --> 02:15:26,960
the name of the strains that they're

3350
02:15:24,319 --> 02:15:28,479
showing. Um, so it it gets you that much

3351
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:31,359
more interested when it's, you know,

3352
02:15:28,479 --> 02:15:35,519
these beautiful blues and reds and

3353
02:15:31,359 --> 02:15:37,519
purples and uh like deep indigos almost

3354
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:39,360
in some cases. Their their color

3355
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:42,719
spectrum that they can produce out of

3356
02:15:39,359 --> 02:15:46,158
their genetics library is astounding.

3357
02:15:42,719 --> 02:15:48,239
Um, definitely cool, man. All right,

3358
02:15:46,158 --> 02:15:50,238
last question. Oh, sorry. Go ahead. No,

3359
02:15:48,238 --> 02:15:53,519
I was going to say there's a new a new

3360
02:15:50,238 --> 02:15:55,439
um breeder in town here that is someone

3361
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:57,199
if you're in Colorado to look out for,

3362
02:15:55,439 --> 02:15:59,678
which is Eleven's Genetics. They have

3363
02:15:57,198 --> 02:16:01,919
some really cool crosses of old school

3364
02:15:59,679 --> 02:16:05,118
like headbands and things like that that

3365
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:06,880
have some new new flavors uh kind of

3366
02:16:05,118 --> 02:16:09,598
associated. So, there's you get these

3367
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:12,319
old school flavors with some of the uh

3368
02:16:09,599 --> 02:16:13,920
qualities of modern production that that

3369
02:16:12,319 --> 02:16:16,078
make sense. So, that's one that I I

3370
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:19,199
really like. some of their strawberry

3371
02:16:16,078 --> 02:16:20,880
adhesive is a good one. That sounds

3372
02:16:19,198 --> 02:16:22,719
good. Strawberry. Yeah, it's really

3373
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:25,359
good. So,

3374
02:16:22,719 --> 02:16:28,399
awesome. Well, yeah. So, last question.

3375
02:16:25,359 --> 02:16:31,880
Um, what is your most memorable cannabis

3376
02:16:28,399 --> 02:16:31,879
related experience?

3377
02:16:33,159 --> 02:16:38,638
Um, like as a kid or like is this just

3378
02:16:36,718 --> 02:16:40,079
extremely open? It's it's open-ended.

3379
02:16:38,638 --> 02:16:42,000
Uh, you know, it could be like your

3380
02:16:40,079 --> 02:16:43,760
first time smoking. It could be, you

3381
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:46,558
know, that time you almost got busted by

3382
02:16:43,760 --> 02:16:49,040
the cops. You know, we've had a a wide

3383
02:16:46,558 --> 02:16:52,318
array of answers for this question. So,

3384
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:56,000
don't pigeon hole yourself. No. Yeah. I

3385
02:16:52,318 --> 02:16:57,920
mean, I definitely I I would say in

3386
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:00,318
terms of like best positive memory,

3387
02:16:57,920 --> 02:17:03,920
probably would be the first time I ever

3388
02:17:00,318 --> 02:17:07,359
smoked. Um, just listening to some music

3389
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:09,840
that touched my soul. And and I and I

3390
02:17:07,359 --> 02:17:12,318
did get um I did get busted when I was

3391
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:14,639
in college for smoking in my dorm. So

3392
02:17:12,318 --> 02:17:16,478
that was definitely extremely memorable

3393
02:17:14,638 --> 02:17:18,079
because they did kick me out of my dorms

3394
02:17:16,478 --> 02:17:21,519
for

3395
02:17:18,079 --> 02:17:24,239
for smoking it. We uh we I lived in a

3396
02:17:21,519 --> 02:17:26,398
suite with two rooms and one of them was

3397
02:17:24,239 --> 02:17:27,760
these two guys that came from the same

3398
02:17:26,398 --> 02:17:29,760
town and the other one was me and my

3399
02:17:27,760 --> 02:17:31,120
buddy from high school and my buddy from

3400
02:17:29,760 --> 02:17:32,719
high school didn't really smoke but the

3401
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:34,559
other two guys did and it was a cold

3402
02:17:32,718 --> 02:17:36,159
night and I was like hey we should still

3403
02:17:34,558 --> 02:17:38,079
we had this window behind the building

3404
02:17:36,159 --> 02:17:41,359
that we usually climb out of to smoke

3405
02:17:38,079 --> 02:17:42,318
behind and this time they were like no

3406
02:17:41,359 --> 02:17:43,200
we don't want to climb out there we

3407
02:17:42,318 --> 02:17:45,279
don't want to climb out there. I'm like

3408
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:47,120
all right whatever we'll you know towel

3409
02:17:45,280 --> 02:17:48,800
the door we'll get the splof out. We'll

3410
02:17:47,120 --> 02:17:50,399
open the window. We'll turn the fan on,

3411
02:17:48,799 --> 02:17:54,398
do all the things, but we forgot to

3412
02:17:50,398 --> 02:17:56,398
cover the vent and um like the the

3413
02:17:54,398 --> 02:17:59,358
shared room vents, the vent that went

3414
02:17:56,398 --> 02:18:02,159
into the hallway. And so, oh no, the

3415
02:17:59,359 --> 02:18:03,599
return vent pulled a lot of that air in

3416
02:18:02,159 --> 02:18:06,000
the room out into the hallway and like

3417
02:18:03,599 --> 02:18:08,318
within an hour or so, the TA had called

3418
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:11,120
the cops and they banged on the door and

3419
02:18:08,318 --> 02:18:14,799
we were watching like James and the

3420
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:17,599
Giant Peach or something and I was just

3421
02:18:14,799 --> 02:18:18,959
so so stoned and I heard banging on the

3422
02:18:17,599 --> 02:18:21,040
door and we ignored it. Banging,

3423
02:18:18,959 --> 02:18:23,039
banging, bang. And finally I get up,

3424
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:25,120
walk out of I was in the room with my

3425
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:27,439
sweetmates and I walked out. They closed

3426
02:18:25,120 --> 02:18:29,679
the door on me and I was in the little

3427
02:18:27,439 --> 02:18:31,359
like hallway between the two rooms. Look

3428
02:18:29,679 --> 02:18:32,558
at the door and I just see two cops out

3429
02:18:31,359 --> 02:18:34,399
there and I just heard one of them say,

3430
02:18:32,558 --> 02:18:37,438
"Well, if they don't open up this time,

3431
02:18:34,398 --> 02:18:40,159
we're going in." So I opened the door

3432
02:18:37,439 --> 02:18:41,760
and uh there was a they were doing the

3433
02:18:40,159 --> 02:18:43,519
whole good cop bad cop routine. and they

3434
02:18:41,760 --> 02:18:45,280
had like the little canine patches on

3435
02:18:43,519 --> 02:18:47,280
their their shirts and they were

3436
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:49,120
threatening to bring the dogs in and

3437
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:52,880
searched my whole room and found this

3438
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:55,120
like tiny little nug. Uh I'm assuming

3439
02:18:52,879 --> 02:18:56,959
this was in Florida. It was in Orlando.

3440
02:18:55,120 --> 02:18:58,719
Yeah,

3441
02:18:56,959 --> 02:19:03,919
I was about to say I I haven't heard

3442
02:18:58,718 --> 02:19:07,119
that level of uh militaristic style um

3443
02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:09,760
approach to a college kid with weed. Uh

3444
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:12,160
unless it was, you know, Florida across

3445
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:15,359
to Texas or something along the southern

3446
02:19:12,159 --> 02:19:18,000
states there. Yeah. No, they they they

3447
02:19:15,359 --> 02:19:21,359
were aggressive, man. It was Yeah, it

3448
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:24,318
sucked. But uh I had to do fortunately

3449
02:19:21,359 --> 02:19:26,479
um uh I didn't get arrested. I didn't

3450
02:19:24,318 --> 02:19:28,558
get anything on my permanent record. But

3451
02:19:26,478 --> 02:19:31,119
that's good. I did I was in like

3452
02:19:28,558 --> 02:19:34,239
probation on for with the university for

3453
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:35,359
like two years after that. Jeez. Yeah. I

3454
02:19:34,239 --> 02:19:37,039
knew in that moment I was like, "All

3455
02:19:35,359 --> 02:19:41,760
right, they're kicking me out. Can we

3456
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:43,280
start packing?" Yeah. But uh Wow. Yeah.

3457
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:45,599
Yeah. Well, that is those are both

3458
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:47,359
definitely some memorable experiences.

3459
02:19:45,599 --> 02:19:48,799
So, thank you for sharing. And again,

3460
02:19:47,359 --> 02:19:51,359
Liam, thank you so much for your time

3461
02:19:48,799 --> 02:19:53,679
today and um having this conversation

3462
02:19:51,359 --> 02:19:55,439
and kind of going deep on a few topics

3463
02:19:53,680 --> 02:19:57,760
that we don't normally get to touch on

3464
02:19:55,439 --> 02:19:59,720
with um with other cultivators. you

3465
02:19:57,760 --> 02:20:02,159
know, we we do a lot of uh homegrow

3466
02:19:59,719 --> 02:20:04,799
discussion and people who have just

3467
02:20:02,159 --> 02:20:06,799
entered into the commercial space. Um,

3468
02:20:04,799 --> 02:20:09,519
but we rarely have people on with your

3469
02:20:06,799 --> 02:20:12,920
level of commercial experience and kind

3470
02:20:09,520 --> 02:20:16,399
of understanding uh of where this

3471
02:20:12,920 --> 02:20:19,120
industry has been and is going um you

3472
02:20:16,398 --> 02:20:22,000
know from the past 5 to 10 years and

And these conversations, as I like to

3476
02:20:26,159 --> 02:20:31,039
say, are how we spread this knowledge,

3477
02:20:28,879 --> 02:20:33,438
which is why the podcast is called The

3478
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:35,280
Way We Grow, because this is how we grow

3479
02:20:33,439 --> 02:20:36,800
as a community and as individual

3480
02:20:35,280 --> 02:20:38,720
cultivators.

3481
02:20:36,799 --> 02:20:40,000

3485

3487
02:20:48,719 --> 02:20:53,679
