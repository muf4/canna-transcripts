00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,679
Hello and welcome to another episode of

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,399
the way we grow podcast, a production of

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,198
the craft growers network. I'm your host

5
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:21,519
Nick Wolf. Today we actually have two

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,480
guests in the house. Uh one is chief

7
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:27,518
science officer Dr. Tassa Sali and

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,399
research director Dr. Alfonso Geredo Lea

9
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:32,159
of TUMI genomics. Uh, Tasa Alonso, how

10
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,159
are you both doing today? Oh, we're

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,558
great. Good. Good. Thanks for having us

12
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,319
on today. Thanks. Awesome. Yeah, I'm

13
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,799
really excited that you guys are both uh

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,520
here today. Um, like we were saying

15
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,519
before the podcast uh started, Tasa has

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,719
done a lot of these podcasts for

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:52,160
cannabis growers and um cannabis related

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,840
content. So um you know and for our

19
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,759
listeners as well this is going to be a

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,199
little bit of a different show because

21
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:01,599
normally we in interview growers um both

22
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:04,079
like homegrow and commercial growers to

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,079
gain an insight into their world but we

24
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,759
don't usually have two doctors in the

25
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:13,679
house where you guys have uh an immense

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:16,478
background in both um genetics research

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,600
and um cannabis research specifically

28
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:23,359
and and pathogen prevention and testing.

29
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:25,118
Um so now I have been told uh Alfonso

30
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,759
that you have also some experience with

31
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:31,040
cannabis cultivation uh as a home grower

32
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,680
and at a research level. So I would love

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,280
for you to draw from that experience uh

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,880
to kind of be the grower in the

35
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,239
conversation. And Tass, you know, like I

36
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,158
said before, you've been on numerous

37
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,839
other podcasts. So we're going to kind

38
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:48,240
of stay within that vein of thought here

39
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,240
as well to best serve the listeners. Um,

40
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,399
but honestly, if we uh go off on a

41
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,319
tangent, I'm super happy to let the flow

42
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,960
of the conversation just carry us away

43
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,639
and I don't plan on stopping it. Um, so

44
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,959
I wanted to spend the first part of the

45
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,079
show to gain a little background on both

46
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,239
of you and how plants and science came

47
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,719
together for you. Uh, whether it started

48
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:11,439
off with one or the other or if your

49
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,919
involvement in both sort of developed in

50
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,840
tandem. Um, and then for the second part

51
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,159
of the show, I want to talk about tumi

52
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,560
genomics and how home growers and

53
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,799
commercial cultivators should be aware

54
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,840
of pathogens, how they can best mitigate

55
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,120
them, and the steps to take if they

56
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:33,280
detect a pathogen in their grow.

57
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:36,239
So, um, let's, uh, start with you,

58
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,159
Tassa. um because I feel like I've heard

59
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,840
so much about how you um operate through

60
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,799
TUMI, but I don't really know about your

61
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,280
background with plants. Um and maybe you

62
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,879
have told this story before, but um when

63
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,439
did you first become interested in

64
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,719
plants or science? Uh or was it

65
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:56,239
something that they kind of came

66
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:58,800
together uh in tandem like I was saying?

67
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,519
Um yeah, so I guess plants have been a

68
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,319
big part of my life for all of my life.

69
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,800
Um, I grew up out in the country in

70
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:09,359
Colorado in a in a house with a big

71
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,319
backyard. And my um father's a master

72
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,599
gardener, so I spent a lot of time in my

73
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,799
childhood just following him around. Um,

74
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:18,719
you know, and he taught me how to

75
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,560
transplant plants and how to see when

76
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:23,120
they're sick, how to see when they have

77
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,000
like diseases and issues in the bark or

78
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,800
whatever. Um and you know obviously he

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,400
also had a huge um collection of indoor

80
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,560
plants and so I just kind of grew up

81
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,080
around plants. Um as you can see that

82
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,840
continues now. Yeah. Um and so uh

83
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,719
gardening's always been something that I

84
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,560
love. I love being outside. I love the

85
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:47,359
smell of the dirt and growing things. Um

86
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,158
my cat's going to video bomb us here in

87
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,080
a second. Come here cat. Oh that's fine.

88
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,560
Well, as you can see we're lovers of

89
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,640
cats here.

90
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,920
We have a lot of pets, so there we might

91
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:02,079
get video bombed at any moment. Um, but

92
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,798
yeah, and so I mean, I've always loved

93
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,840
being outside. I've loved growing things

94
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:12,000
and living things. Um, and I've also

95
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,360
always loved science. Um, I've been just

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,560
been interested in the way the world

97
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,879
works, the way life works, how it works,

98
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,560
why it works. Um, pretty much my whole

99
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:25,759
life. Um, and I would say I, you know, I

100
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,560
got into biology and science and high

101
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,240
school. Um, you know, taking all those

102
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,759
courses and then I went straight into it

103
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,040
in college and it's just been something

104
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:38,000
that's always fascinated me. Um, and so

105
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:42,319
I once I discovered research, it was

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
like I was home. It's to me it's like um

107
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,759
there's all these questions that people

108
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,240
don't know the answer to and you just

109
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,000
wonder but for the first time in my life

110
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,400
you could answer a question that nobody

111
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,079
knew the answer to. Um and then for a

112
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,000
short period of time you're the only

113
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,918
person in the whole world that knows the

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,478
answer to that question and that is just

115
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,560
so exciting.

116
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,959
Yeah. And it's like solving a big puzzle

117
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,000
and so for me it was like exciting and

118
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:10,799
it was fun and it was interesting. Um,

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,680
and oddly enough, I went into what is

120
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,680
called RNA biology. Um, and specifically

121
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,240
I studied um the structure of RNA. So

122
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,478
that's like um it's like a the

123
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,280
three-dimensional shape that molecules

124
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:27,599
take um and that particular shape

125
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:30,239
carries information that tells the cell

126
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,280
what to do with it. Um and I did my

127
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,439
whole uh uh doctoral dissertation on

128
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:38,638
that and I also did my posttock on that.

129
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:40,240
And then when we um moved into cannabis,

130
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,400
and I'll let Alfonso tell the story

131
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:47,360
because he has the LA I think he started

132
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:50,319
uh earlier with cannabis than I did. Um

133
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,240
uh we started looking into vyroids and

134
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:56,240
vyroids are threedimensional RNAs that

135
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,600
adopt a specific shape and it's that

136
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,120
shape that carries all of the

137
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,280
information about how this they're

138
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,879
treated in the cell and how they become

139
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:07,519
pathogenic. And so it just felt like um

140
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:11,120
you know between the plants which I have

141
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:12,959
always loved and um you know discovering

142
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,399
all of these pathogens which are

143
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,918
terrible but super fascinating to me. Um

144
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:21,918
it just felt like the perfect

145
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:24,159
combination of things to um sort of make

146
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:28,159
a career and make one that I really

147
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,800
enjoy. So that's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. I

148
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,439
I really like that it kind of coalesed

149
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,120
together because um sometimes I feel

150
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:38,160
like especially in the cannabis

151
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,959
community that I um participate heavily

152
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,680
in, there's a lot of misinformation and

153
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:47,279
people approaching this plant as

154
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,759
something that's really magical and um

155
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,799
uh kind of like exceptional or special

156
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:56,000
or uh different than other plants, but

157
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,038
in so many ways it's the exact same as

158
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,120
uh any other crop plant in that it can

159
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:05,279
um harbor pathogens, vyroids. Um the

160
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,879
movement of these vyroids and uh

161
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,719
pathogens and pests are also kind of

162
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,959
universally known and they have been

163
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,479
known for a long time. And so when we

164
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:18,079
try to separate this plant

165
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:20,879
from everything else that it's connected

166
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:24,318
to within agriculture and horiculture,

167
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:27,519
we start to lose sight of some of the

168
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:31,039
more well understood methods of remedies

169
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:34,079
that we can take for um you know a

170
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:36,519
myriad of different uh problems that we

171
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:39,359
might uh face as growers.

172
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:43,120
Um so you know applying the science

173
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:46,960
while you are also loving plants it kind

174
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,639
of opens up your eyes I'm I'm sure as uh

175
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,719
you've experienced to where you can be

176
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,519
like well no I can just take I'll take

177
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,240
this information kind of Frankenstein it

178
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,839
up a little bit because I can you know

179
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,519
use the information that I have for this

180
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,079
other plant and just apply it right

181
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,918
there and look boom it works. Um, so

182
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,519
that it is really cool to be kind of on

183
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,839
the cutting edge of something like that.

184
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,279
Uh, where you're like discovering new

185
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:10,959
things that you're like, "Oh my gosh, I

186
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:14,478
can take this and apply it to something

187
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:16,239
else." And um, that that's that like

188
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:19,279
feeling of discovery has got to be

189
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,280
tremendous. Yeah. No, it's actually it's

190
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:24,000
been incredibly cool in cannabis because

191
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:26,399
there's so much that's unknown. Um, and

192
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,160
you're right, there's there's a huge

193
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,318
body of literature in agriculture that

194
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,800
we can lean on. And you know, cannabis

195
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,158
is an amazing plant, but it is a plant.

196
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:38,319
Um, and I would maybe argue that maybe

197
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:39,679
plant, all plants are kind of amazing in

198
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,760
their own way, and there's probably a

199
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,439
lot about them that we don't appreciate.

200
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,879
Um, but, you know, in cannabis, like you

201
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,800
can read all this literature, but

202
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,879
there's a lot that's just not known. And

203
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,958
so it's really exciting, you know, to

204
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,838
have a grower be like, well, I just

205
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,199
seated this mom plant that has hoped.

206
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,800
What do I do with those seeds? Are they

207
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,879
going to have it, too? And I'm like, you

208
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,919
know, I don't know. Let's do a research

209
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,600
study. And so, um, it's just really fun

210
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,360
to be in that position where you can

211
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,000
just be like, yeah, let's just set up a

212
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,278
research study with a grower or, you

213
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,519
know, um, another lab and industry. And

214
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,200
there's just so much to discover. Um,

215
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,200
and and there's always an opportunity to

216
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,759
discover more cool things. So, it's it's

217
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,640
a fun place to be in the sense there's

218
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:26,319
so much unknown. So, Sure. Yeah. And you

219
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,600
know, just to get a little bit off topic

220
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,399
because of something that you said

221
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,639
there. Um, when it comes to cannabis

222
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,200
seeds, I know that I believe I've heard

223
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,879
either you say before or heard elsewhere

224
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,200
that um, it's like 90 or

225
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:44,080
95% potential if it's um, the female

226
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,920
plant has hopen vyroid that the seeds

227
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,959
will become infected with hops laten

228
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:51,360
vyroid. And um I might have my numbers

229
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,039
off there, but I was curious. Is this

230
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,440
something that you're finding on the

231
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,159
seed coating or is it something that

232
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,800
you're finding within the germ plasm of

233
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:04,159
like the seed? Yeah. So that's a great

234
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:09,278
question. Um so the answer is both. Um

235
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:10,958
wow. The flower of uh for a cannabis

236
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:13,039
flower for a plant that's infected with

237
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,518
hot plate and thyroid has an incredibly

238
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,519
high level of vibroid. I would say it's

239
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,240
the it's the tissue that accumulates the

240
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,278
most vyroid. Um and then second of

241
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,759
course would be the root. So um on the

242
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:28,399
outside and even in that seed coat the

243
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,078
chances of finding the vyroid just

244
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,078
taking that seed and throwing it in a

245
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,958
tube, grinding it up and doing a PCR on

246
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,799
it is very high. It's like 90. I mean

247
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:39,838
some of the plants even 100% of those

248
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,278
seeds will test positive. Um there is a

249
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,279
difference though. that doesn't

250
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,360
necessarily mean that if you pop that

251
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,679
seed that the seedling will have hop

252
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,278
late and vyroid. Um we've done studies

253
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,599
together showing that um the chances of

254
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:57,360
the actual seedling having hop late

255
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,959
vyroid vary between 20 to 50%. Um and

256
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,600
that depends a little bit on the

257
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:04,399
cultivar and the level of infection of

258
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,720
the mother. Um if the father if the

259
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,399
pollen carries it in it's in our studies

260
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,800
was much lower. it was like 5% of those

261
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:14,320
seedlings. Um, but if you say you have a

262
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,240
packet of seeds that all came from the

263
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,320
same mother and you want to know did

264
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,720
that mother have hop late and thyroid

265
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,079
sending that seed in one or two of those

266
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,839
seeds and how doing a PCR um if it if

267
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,439
the mother did have hop late and thyroid

268
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,200
you'd be able to tell just by a few

269
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,839
seeds because the chances of finding

270
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,759
like that are incredibly high. Wow.

271
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,360
Well, thank you for indulging me on my

272
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,759
little tangent there because I I just

273
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,320
find that part really interesting as uh

274
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:44,159
someone who likes to pop cannabis seeds.

275
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,760
Um yeah. Um and you know, just one last

276
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,000
question on this first part for you,

277
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:50,639
Tasa. Uh when did you first encounter

278
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,320
cannabis? Was it uh something that you

279
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,319
encountered already as a research

280
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,519
scientist or did you have some

281
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,519
experience it with it prior? Um yeah, so

282
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,600
this is a great segue into talking to

283
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,200
Alfonso. Um so he's the director of

284
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,440
research and development. He's also my

285
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:10,720
husband. So um I mostly encountered

286
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,200
cannabis and growing of cannabis um

287
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,800
through Alfonso. Um he's been growing it

288
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,399
for a very long time. And so um uh

289
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:22,159
probably we've been together for about

290
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:24,639
20 years. So um you know the last 17

291
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:27,600
years or so. But that introduction um

292
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,799
happened when I met Alfonso. All right.

293
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,800
Cool. Um that's funny. my my parents, it

294
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:34,958
was the other way around. My my mom

295
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,799
introduced my dad to cannabis uh when he

296
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:39,278
moved out from the Midwest to the to the

297
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,439
West Coast.

298
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:44,078
Um I feel like that's a story as old as

299
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,560
time, though. So,

300
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:49,039
um Alonso, let's let's uh hear a little

301
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:52,239
bit about um when you first became

302
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:54,000
interested in plants and uh or science,

303
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,799
you know, whichever came first or if

304
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,200
they came together uh in unison that

305
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:02,319
like a let's hear your plant story.

306
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:07,278
Yeah. So um so I became interested in

307
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:10,800
plants is I think I can remember I was

308
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:13,278
always into the outdoors and plants just

309
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,879
being around plants just make me happy

310
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:18,799
just gave me like a good feeling

311
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:21,278
and times that I was not feeling good I

312
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:23,919
could just sit around pants in a forest

313
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:26,799
and it would just like calm me down and

314
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:31,519
make me go through the ideas.

315
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:35,439
Uh so I in science uh I was as a as a

316
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:39,519
kid I was um had really ADHD to the

317
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:43,040
extreme. So I I wasn't a a very I was

318
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:46,480
not a good student in high school or so

319
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:48,879
I thought that I will never become a

320
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,079
scientist or anything like that. And

321
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:54,240
interestingly like when I um tried

322
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:57,399
cannabis for the first time when I was

323
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:02,799
around 17 18 years

324
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:06,958
old it gave me a a a sense of I could

325
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:08,879
just sit down and be able to read

326
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:12,679
something that I have never experienced

327
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:18,759
before. So that kind of opened the door

328
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:22,198
to to the academia and science um

329
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:26,879
um I guess

330
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:30,719
journey and so so then so then I I guess

331
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:33,240
I I moved to to to the United States

332
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:37,120
from Peru back in

333
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:41,360
1997 and when I was here and I decided

334
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:44,879
to go into graduate school, I found that

335
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:49,039
I could just smoke a little bit and I

336
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:52,320
was able to to to to read journal

337
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:56,838
articles and and all these like um

338
00:14:52,320 --> 00:15:00,959
literature and so I started consuming

339
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:03,839
cannabis in grad school very often and I

340
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:06,799
actually did my dissertation

341
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,360
uh with cannabis because I wasn't able

342
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:12,240
to sit down for like eight months

343
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:16,000
every single day and write 12 hours a

344
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:19,440
day. It was it was kind of like intense.

345
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,720
Yeah. But it was in that moment in which

346
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:26,480
um I has was always already growing in

347
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:29,920
my basement since 2012 2000 in Colorado.

348
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,000
It became like um you will be able to

349
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:35,198
grow with your red card, with your

350
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,039
medicinal card, which I had

351
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:42,159
and I was growing in my basement.

352
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:44,799
And I the the the buds were incredible.

353
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,559
They were like awesome and I was

354
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,958
everybody was like, "Oh yeah, you can

355
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,758
grow cannabis." But in reality, it is

356
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:55,919
just a plant. I can grow any plant from

357
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:58,519
whatever. And so it was just a moment in

358
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:02,078
time in which everything went to

359
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:05,919
hell. Everything like it was just like

360
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:09,838
no more like resinous or sticky butts.

361
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:12,240
They were all like a fluffy thing. And I

362
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:16,079
was just like, "Okay, maybe the pH, the

363
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,159
nutrients, the the media, the the tent,

364
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,679
the

365
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:22,278
water." I went through all these thing

366
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:27,278
like for like four or five years.

367
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:31,360
Wow. Erh and then after that time

368
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:33,399
uh we Tumi started and we actually

369
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,600
started in doing

370
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:41,278
COVID and then when we transition into

371
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:44,720
cannabis we designed the PCR test and I

372
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:47,278
said well we can use my plants as a

373
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:51,278
negative control and they should be

374
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:53,439
negative because right and so then they

375
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:57,120
were always positive and they were

376
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,839
Oh, this test sucks and we should like

377
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,440
redesign it and it's hitting something

378
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,078
in the cannabis plant. It's always

379
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,000
positive. It doesn't matter. Doesn't And

380
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,639
then somebody gave me a plant, a little

381
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,279
plant, a little clone. And I I used that

382
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,000
one and boom, it was negative. And I was

383
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:16,078
like, I can't believe I was dealing with

384
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,919
hot plate and vyroid for the last four

385
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:22,959
years. So, wow.

386
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:26,559
2015 to 2020.

387
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,558
Uh so so so then that's how I realized

388
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,879
man there will be a lot of people out

389
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:33,200
there having the same problem as me and

390
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,919
I cannot even imagine if I only had four

391
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:39,440
plants or five plants at the most. But

392
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:43,160
if you have like an entire like facility

393
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:46,240
full for acres of of of cannabis then

394
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:49,320
you this is going to really affect you

395
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:53,679
right. So yeah, so that's I became

396
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:56,960
um aware of like this vir could do to to

397
00:17:53,679 --> 00:18:02,400
to the plant and to the growers.

398
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:05,038
So then um I in in kind of like

399
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,960
interesting parallel because at the same

400
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:09,679
time when I was writing my dissertation

401
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,319
I was writing about an enzyme called RNA

402
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,759
polymerase 2 which my dissertation was

403
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:17,599
about like when the DNA has genes and

404
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:22,160
this machinery needs to know where it

405
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:25,359
starts and where it ends and if like I

406
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,279
think like 5% of the DNA is coded by

407
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:30,959
genes and the other part is not. So we

408
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:32,839
were interested in see how does the

409
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,558
machinery knows when to

410
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:39,439
stop. So I was writing about this and

411
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:42,160
hope vyroid when it gets into the cell

412
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:46,558
it uses the same machinery to to copy

413
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:48,720
itself. So as I was dealing with hope in

414
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:52,480
my own grow without me knowing I was

415
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,160
digging into this same machinery in the

416
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,480
literature and knowing all these things

417
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:01,320
about this enzyme and it was just

418
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,279
curious to see that I was

419
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:07,918
um dealing with this in my grow and I

420
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:11,038
was probably at that moment I I knew the

421
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:15,840
entire literature of that enzyme which

422
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:17,599
goes back 40 of 50 years of of research.

423
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,399
Wow. So you were able to kind of apply

424
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:22,000
all of that previous research to the

425
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,160
current problem which was the hops late

426
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,919
and thyroid that you were facing. Yes.

427
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,519
Correct. And but also at the same time

428
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,759
there was is very little known about it.

429
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,960
It is because the cell uses the

430
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:38,240
machinery to do something similar but

431
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:41,160
not the same. the vyroid is exploiting

432
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,679
that to on its

433
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,360
own

434
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:47,559
benefit, but it's not like what is

435
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:51,119
intended to do. But

436
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:52,678
that actually works in the favor of the

437
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,599
vyroid because it makes a lot of

438
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,679
mistakes when it's copying itself. But

439
00:19:55,599 --> 00:20:01,038
that's what the vyroid wants because it

440
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:03,200
wants to evolve and and and mutate and

441
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:07,359
try to adapt to the different strains.

442
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,440
So that's why maybe uh people say and I

443
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:12,798
experienced it myself that when a plant

444
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,558
is infected with hope platon vyroid is

445
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:17,759
strain dependent on what you're going to

446
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:19,319
see and it may be that that's due to the

447
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,879
differences in

448
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:26,879
um mutations in in in in the vyroid

449
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,880
which I think are called quasi

450
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,280
quasi species quasi species or something

451
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,200
like that. Okay. Yeah, that's really

452
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:35,119
fascinating because, you know, I've seen

453
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,000
a bunch of people deal with hops and

454
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:40,000
thyroid and it just completely wreck

455
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,079
their grow, but then I've also seen

456
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,400
people who just not

457
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:48,879
outcl they'll they'll keep, you know,

458
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,640
vibrant new mothers uh for their

459
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,080
production and um and replace them at a

460
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,280
regular interval where they're not

461
00:20:54,079 --> 00:21:00,158
building up a sort a sort of um a

462
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:02,798
threshold that then creates these

463
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,559
devastating effects. And I've even heard

464
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:08,400
of people using things like putting

465
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:12,079
aspirin in their um in their nutrient

466
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:16,000
feed because the acetaminophen will will

467
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:18,798
um affect the rate at which the

468
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,558
um the vyroid builds up in the tissue. I

469
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,639
I believe that that's the how that

470
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:24,558
occurs. Um if if you guys know anything

471
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,360
more about that specifically, I'd love

472
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:30,399
to hear your thoughts on that.

473
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:33,759
No, I haven't. Um yeah so first the the

474
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,159
strain dependency so it's it's really

475
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,640
interesting um we've we have actually

476
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,799
done a study um in collaboration with

477
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,679
state house in California where we took

478
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:46,400
12 different strains um we cut clones

479
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,400
from them um from mothers that were

480
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,960
confirmed negative for hobble vyroid and

481
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,400
we infected them as clones um and then

482
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,360
we grew them throughout their lifetime

483
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,120
and we tested them every couple of weeks

484
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:58,798
and sort of followed the vyroid

485
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,879
infection and all these different 12

486
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,720
strains. Um, and it was really

487
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,320
fascinating because we found some that

488
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:09,120
were incredibly sensitive. Like, um,

489
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:11,599
they were super stunted, super messed

490
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:14,319
up. We'd lost a ton of yield. And with

491
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:16,399
those particular strains, I think, um,

492
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:18,720
you'd be unlikely to be able to outclone

493
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,240
it or outgrow it or even even if you

494
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,919
took really really good care of those

495
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,480
strains, they're just so sensitive that

496
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,640
they just kind of like crapped out. Um

497
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,960
there were others that seemed resistant

498
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,520
like um it was really difficult to get

499
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,200
all of the plants infected. The vyroid

500
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:36,639
load grew incredibly slowly and even

501
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,400
though they were all positive at the end

502
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,919
of the study, most of them we didn't see

503
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,000
a huge drop in yield um or THC levels or

504
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,080
anything like that. Um and then there

505
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,480
was one strain which I thought was kind

506
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:52,079
of terrifying that was super easy to

507
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,240
infect. um it like skyrocketed thyroid

508
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:56,798
level instantly and grew all the way to

509
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,599
adulthood with zero impact at all. It

510
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:02,000
was like tolerant. Um which is great for

511
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:03,918
that strain, but it kind of functions

512
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,679
somewhat like a Trojan horse if you have

513
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,960
that thing in your facility because

514
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,480
you're like, "Oh, this thing looks

515
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,759
great. I'm just going to clone it and

516
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,839
I'm just not going to worry about it."

517
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:15,200
And you're like silently spreading it um

518
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:17,918
to all of your other strains. So um it's

519
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,038
it's scary. it's super strain dependent

520
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,720
and um you know there there are certain

521
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,839
strains where I do think that it would

522
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,839
be possible to um clone so frequently

523
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:29,359
because the vyroid it it either is

524
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,599
traveling very slowly or it's

525
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:34,479
replicating slowly so that you're never

526
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:36,480
going to see a major impact. Um it does

527
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,640
continue to be an infection risk for

528
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,640
your for the rest of your plants. So if

529
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,799
if you are doing that, it's important to

530
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,000
be aware that you're cloning plants that

531
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:46,079
are positive so that you can be

532
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,519
incredibly careful about touching your

533
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:51,918
other plants. Um as far as adding

534
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:54,240
aspirin, um I think that they're

535
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,720
probably the the ideas there is the

536
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,640
salicylic acid um which is a plant

537
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,960
hormone that can um sort of

538
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:07,600
elicit the immune system for the plant.

539
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:09,440
And so um adding that um can um there

540
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:13,199
there is evidence in the literature that

541
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,200
it can slow um thyroid replication or

542
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,840
the accumulation of thyroid in some

543
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,640
crops. Um the the evidence isn't like

544
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:24,319
you know outstanding. It's like 8% or

545
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,960
something but it it it can help. Um,

546
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:29,918
although I I'm still a proponent of just

547
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,519
um getting nice clean moms and testing

548
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,559
to make sure that you don't have it and

549
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:36,158
just just like preventing it in the

550
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,480
beginning instead of trying to treat it

551
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:43,039
after the fact because that's incredibly

552
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:45,919
hard. Yeah. Um well, what are if we

553
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:49,359
could go over maybe a few symptoms that

554
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,919
um growers might uh find where they

555
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:54,399
might want to then be on the alert or

556
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,880
potentially start to look into getting

557
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,480
the plants tested for hops and thyroid.

558
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,039
Um and if we could go over kind of what

559
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,360
you might see in a vegetative stage of

560
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:06,079
growth as well as what you would see in

561
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:08,719
a flowering stage of growth.

562
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:10,960
Um yeah so and I guess to let if you

563
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,038
have any symptoms to add just just throw

564
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,319
them in there. Yeah. So symptoms are

565
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:18,720
incredibly variable. Um if you see

566
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:20,879
symptoms um some of the more common ones

567
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,000
with hop late and vyroid are going to be

568
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,159
um the plant will get stunted. Um it it

569
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,919
has kind of irregular growth. So

570
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,080
normally like the branches are going to

571
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,600
come off at like a 45 degree angle but

572
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:34,399
with hop late and borate they tend to

573
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:36,000
come off horizontally um which makes

574
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,519
them very brittle. So if you have a

575
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,119
plant and you like go like this and all

576
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:41,839
the branches break on the way down

577
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:45,119
that's um really characteristic of

578
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:48,240
hopllay and vyroid. Um you can also see

579
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:51,199
um leaf discoloration, chlorosis um

580
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,759
abnormal leaf shape. Um it does affect

581
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,720
the growth of the root system. So the

582
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:59,038
the leaf the leaf size Yes. The leaves

583
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,960
can be small yellow. Sometimes they over

584
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:04,480
they're not like the big thin leaves.

585
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,440
They're like little smaller.

586
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,839
Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. Um and then the

587
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,159
root system also can be affected. So, if

588
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:14,319
you if you have clones and they're just

589
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,080
rooting incredibly slowly and you don't

590
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:18,480
have like any sort of environmental

591
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:20,158
reason to suspect that they dried out or

592
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,278
something, um sometimes that could be a

593
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,960
sign that the mom plant had hop and

594
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:27,919
vyroid. Um what sort of time frames are

595
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,400
you seeing on the the cloning process?

596
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,400
Um and that that extension that you're

597
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,400
mentioning. Yeah. I don't do you have a

598
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,240
feel for the time frames like when you

599
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,519
see the like it's take long it takes

600
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:43,278
longer to root the sick ones. Yeah. So

601
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:47,038
that's that's interesting. I it's like a

602
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:47,960
very strain dependent I guess.

603
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:51,038
But

604
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:53,919
uh I I will say like what I have seen

605
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:58,400
like what happened to me is like when

606
00:26:53,919 --> 00:27:01,679
the clone is infected with HVD and

607
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,000
because I I'm growing them the infected

608
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:07,038
ones and the non-infected ones and if

609
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,640
one day I forget to to water them

610
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:13,359
because I was away or you know like the

611
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,919
usually all the leaves kind of like drop

612
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:17,319
and kind of like the plant feels sad But

613
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,759
you add water and it kind of like

614
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:22,558
recuperates. But I seen that for the hot

615
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:25,359
plate and vyroid ones, they they can't

616
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:27,879
deal with it. They just the majority of

617
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:32,519
them, they just die and the leaves

618
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:35,440
become uh like dried up and crispy

619
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:38,480
and yeah, I don't know if Yeah, I mean

620
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,200
it's it's about a 2x decrease in root

621
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,798
mass. So, it took about twice as long

622
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,720
for it to get um to that same place as

623
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:48,639
as a healthy one. And sometimes they

624
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,240
don't they don't make it at all. Like

625
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,400
you just don't see those really nice

626
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,359
white roots. Um and it just depends a

627
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:58,000
little bit on how sick the mom was, too.

628
00:27:55,359 --> 00:28:01,199
Um for sure. Yeah. Yeah. But this the

629
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,119
bottom line is like it's very hard to to

630
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:08,558
to figure it out just by eye. probably

631
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:10,439
if you are using seen it a lot and

632
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:15,480
probably your eye is

633
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:18,640
already used to it to identify it uh

634
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:22,319
but for that reason I think is it's good

635
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:25,600
to test and um you don't have to test

636
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:29,359
like a lot you have to test smart like

637
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:31,519
at at a specific point like you have to

638
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,278
test for example the mother before

639
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,599
cutting the clones and you have to test

640
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:39,119
the clone phones you you test you know

641
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:42,398
like it is um kind of like building

642
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:44,398
protocols and SOPs so that you can't uh

643
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:47,359
test in a smart way and you don't have

644
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:51,199
to spend that much money on it but you

645
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:55,678
protect yourself for sure I I heard um

646
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:59,038
test early um and test often um and then

647
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:02,080
you know if you have a pretty you know

648
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:03,759
good uh assurance that you don't have it

649
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:05,278
then just don't bring any genetic in

650
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:08,158
that you don't uh know where they're

651
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:11,038
coming from. Yeah. Yeah. And Yeah. And

652
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:15,200
also another thing is like if you

653
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:17,359
like sometimes me I want to smoke some

654
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,120
cheap wheat that you find at the

655
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:22,479
dispensary. you don't have much money

656
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:24,558
and you just like usually those cheap

657
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:29,599
weed that look like little butts and

658
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:29,599
stuff may be full hope and

659
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:38,960
vir you may pass it that way so it is

660
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:42,480
important to I think like use gloves

661
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,278
especially if if you're a stoner and and

662
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,079
protect your

663
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:52,720
clothes it is very easy to to pass it.

664
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:54,558
How how late have um you tested uh dried

665
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,319
flour? Like how how long after it has

666
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:59,839
been dried has hops late and thyroid

667
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:02,480
been detectable and transmittable?

668
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:05,759
So um so we we actually haven't done

669
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,079
those studies but um Zamir Punja from um

670
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:11,919
Simon Frasier University in Canada did a

671
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:14,960
big study where he um took flour from

672
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,880
dispensaries all over the place and I'm

673
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,960
going to space the percentage but it was

674
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:24,480
like 70 to 80% of the flour he found

675
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:27,200
over there was infected. Wow. So, it's

676
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,278
incredibly common and like I said, it's

677
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,080
it's in a very very high level in the

678
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:34,558
flower. So, even if the plant um got

679
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:36,240
that infection later on and it and then

680
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:37,678
it didn't impact the flower because it

681
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,839
wasn't infected for very long, the

682
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:44,320
flower itself is still going to have a

683
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:47,278
lot of um vyroid in it. Um vyroids in

684
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:50,000
general can be stay um active for about

685
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:52,558
3 months in dried tissue. It usually

686
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,519
requires like kind of rehydration um and

687
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:57,440
then it could become infectious. Um some

688
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,918
studies say up to six months. So it kind

689
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,399
of depends on on which vyroid you're

690
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,759
looking at. Although those studies like

691
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:05,519
you were saying there's a lot of

692
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:08,158
literature in other plants. They were

693
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:11,119
not done in cannabis with hopen vyroid.

694
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:13,039
So that's a guideline. Um, in general,

695
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:15,199
if you're if you're getting weeded, uh,

696
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:17,119
grinded up weed all over you, just be

697
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,519
real careful before you go in there and

698
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:21,359
cuddle with your plants because it's um,

699
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,000
super easy to transmit it and then

700
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:27,278
you're going to be stuck with years of

701
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,278
frustration, not just your plants. Yeah.

702
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:30,640
Yeah, that's such a good point because I

703
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:33,119
don't feel like a lot of people would

704
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:36,159
think about that, but um, it it does

705
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:39,398
make sense if you are already seeing

706
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:42,159
detection on the outside of seed shells.

707
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:44,319
Um I mean that's basically the same as

708
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,278
the dried flower at that point in terms

709
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:51,200
of uh what environment those those

710
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:54,798
vyroids are facing um outside of the the

711
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:57,759
living tissue. Um yeah that's very very

712
00:31:54,798 --> 00:32:01,440
fascinating. Um all right and then um

713
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:04,079
with the flower morphology and the the

714
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,440
um you know other symptoms you might

715
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:10,480
face or um find in flowering cannabis

716
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,480
plants. What are some of those? Um yeah,

717
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,120
so um unfortunately hop late and

718
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:19,120
vyroid's biggest impact is going to be

719
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:21,038
on the flower. Um it basically um the

720
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:23,119
the flowers that come out of infected

721
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:24,720
plants especially the susceptible ones

722
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:27,678
are you're going to lose a lot of

723
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,880
density that be more like the fluff. Um

724
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:33,679
the canabonoid content both THC and CBD

725
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,240
go way down. um you don't see the same

726
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,080
type of tricom formation and they just

727
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,399
don't produce as much turppen and all of

728
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:42,480
that and so they're basically you know

729
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:46,398
like the the disease the nickname is

730
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:49,000
their duds. Um uh pretty much it just

731
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:52,719
tanks the flower completely.

732
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,359
Wow. And then um like are there are

733
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,839
there any uh cases that you've seen

734
00:32:55,359 --> 00:33:00,639
where the symptoms only present in part

735
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:03,038
of the flowering plant or perhaps like

736
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,278
one branch? Um but everything else is

737
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:09,119
kind of looking as you would expect it

738
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:10,720
to look. Yes, absolutely. Um so one of

739
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:13,359
the important things to realize about

740
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,278
vyroids is they're they're like um

741
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:17,278
molecules. They're not like living

742
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:20,480
things that have the ability to move

743
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:22,480
about the plant on their own. So um when

744
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,319
a plant gets infected like say you cut a

745
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,440
branch and you cut it with a dirty tool

746
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:28,879
and the vir gains access it has to move

747
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,720
about the plant with the photo

748
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,278
assimilates which is basically the the

749
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,960
the goo inside the plant that's trans

750
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:37,519
transferring the energy of the sun or

751
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,600
the lights um to areas of the plant that

752
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,440
can't make their own energy. So the

753
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:44,079
vyroid is going to move from what's

754
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,000
called a source to a sink. And so sink

755
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:49,599
areas are areas that can't make their

756
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,319
own energy. So, it's going to go to um

757
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:54,319
you know new growth that hasn't doesn't

758
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:56,319
have the capability to do photosynthesis

759
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:58,158
yet or it'll go into the roots.

760
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:00,000
Obviously, there is no photosynthesis

761
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,240
going on there which is why testing the

762
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,640
roots is so useful because it it has to

763
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,599
go down there because it that's it needs

764
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,599
the energy from the foliage. Um but it's

765
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:12,639
the bottom line is it's not going to go

766
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,559
to every branch. um at least not right

767
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,878
away. And sometimes there can be a huge

768
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:18,878
delay like two months or whatever like

769
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:20,719
the lifetime of the plant. And so what

770
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:23,279
ends up happening is you can see exactly

771
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:25,519
what you described. Some branches are

772
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,200
going to look super, you know, infected

773
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:28,719
and sick and the buds are going to be

774
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,799
terrible and then other branches are

775
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:33,118
going to look just fine. Um because the

776
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,879
vyroid either hasn't traveled there or

777
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,000
hasn't been there long enough to build

778
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:39,918
up enough of a load to really impact the

779
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,280
plant.

780
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:45,279
For sure. Um and then in terms of

781
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,919
um oh let's see I lost my train of

782
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:53,119
thought there. Um so with with like the

783
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:55,358
the flowering cycles then um and you

784
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,320
seeing it only in one branch uh

785
00:34:55,358 --> 00:35:00,559
potentially or across uh an entire you

786
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,280
know canopy if if the viral level is

787
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:06,799
that high in the mother plant. Um other

788
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,440
than uh you know a de decrease in flower

789
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,519
quality maybe um could you describe some

790
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,679
of what you might have seen in some of

791
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:17,838
the plants that were more resistant but

792
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:22,078
still with um a reasonably high level of

793
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:25,559
uh vyroid uh presence within the tissue.

794
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:28,480
Um yeah so that's so that's the sort of

795
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:31,440
trick that hop late and vyroid plays on

796
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,599
all of us. Um, if the plants are

797
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,200
somewhat resistant or tolerant, you

798
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:41,200
often don't see much of anything. Um,

799
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:42,639
and so you can look across a canopy and

800
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:45,199
be like, "Everything looks great. I

801
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:50,639
don't need a test, whatever." But it can

802
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:52,719
look very asymptomatic. Um, so it's it's

803
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:54,639
it's important to know what the symptoms

804
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:56,239
are, to know that something might be

805
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:57,920
percolating in there that you need to

806
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:00,439
test for, but it's also important to

807
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,519
realize that it can exist

808
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:06,000
asymptomatically. Um, and it's still

809
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:08,079
important to confirm, especially if

810
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,159
you're bringing in new things, that it's

811
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:13,039
not sick before you put it next to all

812
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:15,118
your important mother plants. Um the

813
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:18,880
other really important observation we

814
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:21,039
made is that if plants test negative or

815
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,039
have an incredibly low vyroid load at

816
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:27,599
the kind of at the end of propagation

817
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:29,519
like the 2 to 3 week um time point even

818
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,559
if they end up building a pretty high

819
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:35,679
load by the time they flower out um we

820
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:37,679
don't tend to see symptoms. So, for

821
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:40,960
example, you could have a plant that

822
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:42,480
accumulates thyroid very slowly and um

823
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,559
let's say you're veging. You you keep

824
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,400
some for veg or to replace your mom's

825
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:48,199
and it builds up that load slowly. You

826
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,880
may not see it in the first couple of

827
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:53,358
generations and then maybe in the second

828
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,760
or third generation all of a sudden the

829
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:57,598
clones have enough of a load that when

830
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,119
they go into flower it's affected the

831
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,160
biology enough that now you're going to

832
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:05,760
see it. Um and so in a sense it can kind

833
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:09,358
of sneak up on you as well. So, um,

834
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:12,000
really if you just keep a few moms that

835
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:13,838
are clean and you test them, you know,

836
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,920
consistently and you can cut off those

837
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:17,440
moms and then they can be propagation

838
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,240
mothers. You don't have to like have

839
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,240
thousands. But that's the best way to

840
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:24,799
protect yourself. Um, because you can't

841
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:28,239
rely on the symptoms uh because you just

842
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:31,359
might not see it right away. Sure. Um

843
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:34,559
and um along the same sort of line with

844
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:36,719
the symptoms that you might um associate

845
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:40,000
with hops and vyroid, are there any

846
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:42,319
other pathogens or vyroids that can

847
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,039
cause similar symptoms that may be less

848
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,720
pervasive but um but might be almost

849
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:49,199
like a false positive if you're just

850
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:53,118
trying to visually identify what's going

851
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:55,838
on in your garden. Yes. So, it's

852
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:59,519
important to recognize that symptoms

853
00:37:55,838 --> 00:38:03,599
like leaf discoloration and stunting are

854
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:06,719
incredibly generic and there's a

855
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:10,160
plethora of viral or pathogens that can

856
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:11,838
cause things like that. And so, um just

857
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:15,358
seeing those symptoms, it's something

858
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:17,440
that hopen vyroid should be occur to

859
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:20,559
you, but it's not necessarily a given

860
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,760
that that's what your plant has. Um the

861
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:25,599
the vyro the

862
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:28,240
vyroid sorry the collection of uh

863
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,760
vyroids and viruses that impacts impact

864
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:33,519
cannabis

865
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,480
um is kind of under studied right now.

866
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:39,119
So we don't know a lot about it. Um

867
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:42,119
there are a few like alphalfpha mosaic

868
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:45,519
virus um tobacco streak

869
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:47,680
virus. Um what else would cause those

870
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:49,599
symptoms? Uh there's beet curly top

871
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:52,159
virus. Um, these have all been

872
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,680
characterized in cannabis. Um, most of

873
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:58,000
them are going to be more of a concern

874
00:38:53,679 --> 00:39:00,239
if you're growing outside. Um, but it's

875
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,559
all possible that it could be caused by

876
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:03,838
those types of things instead. Did you

877
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:06,880
want to add something? Lettuce

878
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:08,799
chlorosis. Oh, yes. Lettuce. Thank you.

879
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,280
Cool. Uh, yeah, because I feel like

880
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,800
sometimes um, you know, there's a little

881
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:17,839
bit of a a dog whistle when you hear uh,

882
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,359
HLVD. people start to freak out and they

883
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:21,279
just think, "Oh my god, every little

884
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:22,880
symptom that I notice in my garden where

885
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,720
my plants don't look healthy, that's got

886
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,200
to be that's got to be it, man. And the

887
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:30,639
world is the world is coming to an end

888
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:32,239
right now." Um, and so I've I've even

889
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:34,319
heard of kind of stories where people

890
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:37,118
have chucked out their entire genetic

891
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,880
collection because they were worried

892
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,800
about one plant and then they realized

893
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,358
they had been using the same scissors or

894
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,880
scalpel for the past year and they're

895
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:46,400
like, "Well, of course I have it. I

896
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,599
don't I don't even want to spend the

897
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,119
money to get it tested because um you

898
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,960
know that the same money that you could

899
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,640
spend on the tests in some cases you

900
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,119
could just spend to get the genetics

901
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:59,199
back from a clean source. Um and even

902
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,440
nowadays you know you can get them as uh

903
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:03,679
generation zero clones from tissue

904
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,039
culture labs that are going to provide

905
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:09,118
you a much more uh secure way of

906
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:12,320
acquiring genetics if they have all of

907
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,720
the um the paperwork and documents to

908
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:18,559
match. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But the tissue

909
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:20,759
culture is is is is important to know

910
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:26,239
that it's not

911
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:29,119
100%. That it is a very you can imagine

912
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:31,838
just u like what they're trying to

913
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:35,320
isolate is a bunch of little cells the

914
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:38,000
merry stems but the

915
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:40,800
adjacent cells that are not the stem

916
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,280
cells are right there. So if you're with

917
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,079
a scapeole, it doesn't matter how many

918
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,880
times you done it. If you just cut it a

919
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,039
little bit on the wrong part, everything

920
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,358
will be contaminated. So the tissue

921
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:55,358
culture, even if it goes through tissue

922
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:57,920
culture, those people that are doing

923
00:40:55,358 --> 00:41:01,799
tissue culture should check that if the

924
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:04,159
vyroid has been eradicated. I also have

925
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,318
heard although I have never done it but

926
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:09,519
I have heard

927
00:41:05,318 --> 00:41:14,480
from people breeders that that they have

928
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:18,519
been able to outgrow the vyroid by just

929
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:22,159
cutting the the the the shoot the the

930
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:25,519
epical shoot and they they say that they

931
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:28,399
have to cut it three four five times

932
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:30,239
that sometimes is like very lengthy more

933
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,240
than a year process.

934
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:35,358
So they were saying like it's not worth

935
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:38,000
it. But you can imagine if that shoot

936
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:39,920
grows because it grows pretty fast and

937
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,639
you haven't had the chance for the

938
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:46,400
vyroid to get there and you cut it, you

939
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:49,358
you you have a chance to to out compete

940
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,519
the vyroid. I guess for sure. I've I've

941
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:54,239
heard the exact same stories and uh from

942
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:56,000
a a bunch of different people and um you

943
00:41:54,239 --> 00:42:00,078
know I feel like that does give a lot of

944
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:03,440
hope for what was called you know like 2

945
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:05,760
or 3 years ago the the potential

946
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,720
um super villain of the cannabis

947
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:11,359
industry because people were losing

948
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:14,000
entire yields uh entire rooms worth of

949
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:17,279
yields out of um their facilities over

950
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:21,199
the course of uh a given space of time.

951
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,119
And um I I could see especially with

952
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:25,199
kind of the downturn that the cannabis

953
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,599
market has been facing lately in terms

954
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:30,719
of the price per pound and the overhead

955
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,318
cost and the operational cost. Um that

956
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:34,399
like all of them are going in the wrong

957
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:37,920
direction for there to be a decent

958
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:40,079
profit margin. And if something like

959
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,440
this where you could say look I have

960
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:46,480
this this population of plants and if

961
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:49,599
they have hot latent thyroid I can face

962
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:52,400
you know a 50% yield let's just say loss

963
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:54,240
and uh that that alone would be

964
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,599
devastating. It might not even be

965
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:59,199
tenable at that point. Um, so I I that's

966
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,359
why I'm like I'm really excited to get

967
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:03,799
this information out to people because I

968
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:07,838
do feel as though

969
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:12,480
um where there is a lot of potential for

970
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:14,480
yield loss and um crop failure even

971
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,440
there is also a lot of hope for how you

972
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,960
might be able to prevent it, combat it

973
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:23,000
as well as uh ameliate those those

974
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,280
issues overall.

975
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,119
Um well, you know, I think we've gotten

976
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,680
a little bit of a good background now on

977
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,358
both of you guys and um I think I want

978
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:34,239
to kind of move into a little bit more

979
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:37,358
about Tumi Genomics and what you guys do

980
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:39,118
there. So, if you could uh both go over

981
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:41,598
a little bit about your roles at the

982
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:44,318
company and maybe any exciting projects

983
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:47,920
that you're working on currently.

984
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:50,000
Um you want to start? Yeah. So, I mean,

985
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,519
I guess just a a quick background on

986
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,358
Tumi Genomics. Um we are a pathogen

987
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:58,559
testing company as well as a company

988
00:43:55,358 --> 00:44:01,119
that provides um guidance and

989
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:02,880
recommendations for growers. Um so if

990
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,640
you do have an issue, we don't just give

991
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:09,200
you a test result and be like, you know,

992
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:11,078
good luck. Um uh we do we do a lot of um

993
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:14,559
consulting and building pathogen

994
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:17,920
mitigation programs for growers. Um and

995
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:19,599
kind of as aside uh when we founded TUMI

996
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,920
genomics or we founded you know the

997
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:24,960
company in general we founded it with

998
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,599
the concept that we wanted to bring um

999
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,119
you know basically kickass science or or

1000
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:32,400
great science to industries or

1001
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:35,039
geographies that are underserved. Um and

1002
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,039
I think the cannabis industry um when we

1003
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:39,199
discovered it was you know it was

1004
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:41,480
exactly what our company was founded to

1005
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:45,559
do. Um and

1006
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:47,838
so our main focus at TUMI genomics is

1007
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:49,519
providing you know not just that testing

1008
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:52,239
and the pathogen mitigation and all of

1009
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:54,880
that but also the information and the

1010
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:56,719
research um that people can rely on.

1011
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,079
It's done correctly. It's done with the

1012
00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:02,078
right controls um you know so that we

1013
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:04,640
can sort of start chipping away at some

1014
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:07,119
of the misinformation and the unanswered

1015
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:11,519
questions so growers have what they need

1016
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:12,960
um to be successful. And um I think you

1017
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:14,559
had brought up, you know, like people

1018
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,599
are like, "Oh, I'm screwed. My whole

1019
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:17,920
life is over. I'm just going to throw

1020
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:21,039
everything away." And um I think that

1021
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,720
there's a lot of fear around pathogens

1022
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:25,358
and cannabis in general and especially

1023
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:27,679
around hop late and thyroid. And one of

1024
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:30,960
the most important things for me is for

1025
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:33,919
people to understand that um with

1026
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,240
information, you can combat fear. Um

1027
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,920
there's no reason to feel like you have

1028
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:39,358
to be terrified of this thing or it's

1029
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,079
going to ruin your whole life or the

1030
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:44,799
world is ending. Um there's a lot you

1031
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:47,039
can do to protect your facility or your

1032
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,519
grow. And there's even a way we've

1033
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:52,960
helped people um who have like rampid

1034
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:55,920
infections kind of build up a clean

1035
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:58,079
stock or you know a a sort of a genetic

1036
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:01,599
bank of very healthy mothers and then

1037
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:03,599
slowly over time work through um moving

1038
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:06,000
the vyroid out of the facility without

1039
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,920
having to shut operations down and lose

1040
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,760
a ton of money because it's not you know

1041
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,280
whether you're a home grower or you have

1042
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,800
a huge facility you don't always want to

1043
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,720
be like and now I'm just going to cut it

1044
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:19,200
off and have nothing no flower at

1045
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:21,118
Um and so the the whole that's the whole

1046
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:23,519
basis of this company is really to fight

1047
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:25,760
fear and to bring information to growers

1048
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:30,079
so that they are empowered to to do

1049
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:32,880
something about this. Um and so with

1050
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:36,000
that the way we do that is through um

1051
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:39,680
research with academic um industries as

1052
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,599
well as with um industry uh like

1053
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:44,239
cultivation partners and things to sort

1054
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:47,359
of answer some of those questions. Um we

1055
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:49,838
do testing um we we test plant tissue

1056
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:52,559
for you know our the main three that are

1057
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:54,880
going to ruin your life are hopen vyroid

1058
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:57,039
fuserium and pytheium. The fuserium and

1059
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:00,000
pithium are mold or mold like infections

1060
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:02,559
that can tank your plants or your entire

1061
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,159
facility. Um and then we also test for a

1062
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:08,559
myriad of other um you know viruses and

1063
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:11,199
pathogens that are are much less common.

1064
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,960
But if the symptoms warrant it warrant

1065
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:15,759
at that, we can also test for all of

1066
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,920
those things as well. Um as well as

1067
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,000
providing um pathogen mitigation

1068
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,400
programs. So if you realize your

1069
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,119
facility has 30% infection, what do I

1070
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,039
do? Um we will get on the phone with

1071
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,039
you. We'll learn a lot about your

1072
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:31,920
facility and your practices and then

1073
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:34,559
we'll identify ways that you can correct

1074
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,318
um the issue like a testing plan that's

1075
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:38,799
within your budget so that you can start

1076
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:40,000
to work through it. and you know kind of

1077
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,359
correcting some of the cultural

1078
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,280
practices around sterility and you know

1079
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:48,000
uh people movement and all of those

1080
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:51,280
things to sort of make sure that um that

1081
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,480
it's cleared out. Um also if you have a

1082
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:56,480
pathogen like a a fungal infection um we

1083
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,318
we help people track those down so we

1084
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,318
can test your water, your air, your

1085
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:02,159
growing media, kind of figure out where

1086
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:03,679
it's coming from, why it's happening to

1087
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:05,920
you and then build you a plan around

1088
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:09,118
that to sort of get yourself out of it.

1089
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:11,599
Um, so, um, we'd like to think that

1090
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:14,000
we're a complete scientific solution.

1091
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,838
Um, that we're partners with growers and

1092
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,679
we help them work through these issues

1093
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:19,679
and and come out the other side clean

1094
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:21,199
and successful.

1095
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:23,519
That's awesome. I feel like that's super

1096
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:25,838
important. Um, cuz sometimes just

1097
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:28,480
giving, you know, like uh it's kind of

1098
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:30,400
the difference between like leading uh

1099
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,760
the horse to water, right? Like you can

1100
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,960
you can lead them there and then if you

1101
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,720
just leave them there, they may or may

1102
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,240
not drink. But if you kind of show them

1103
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:37,838
that you can drink the water, right? And

1104
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:39,838
then how you get through all of these

1105
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:42,480
problems, you know, potentially if it's

1106
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:45,039
if it's a a pathogen or a vyroid that

1107
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:47,519
you're facing, that's such a a huge

1108
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:50,000
benefit to add to the services that you

1109
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:51,838
guys are providing. Um because it is

1110
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,079
really hard to figure out then what you

1111
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:56,159
do. Uh especially if you're, you know,

1112
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,400
you're already dealing with flower rooms

1113
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:01,118
and environmental parameters and

1114
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,559
irrigation maintenance and oh, you got a

1115
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,880
drying room that you need to have

1116
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:07,839
trimmed and all this other stuff that

1117
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:11,039
like the life of a grower is very hectic

1118
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:13,599
and can be very uh time consuming. And

1119
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:15,679
so to add then the extra stress on top

1120
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:18,240
of it of something like a pathogen or a

1121
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:20,719
vyroid, you know, it's it's uh almost

1122
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:24,000
like dealing with a pest infestation

1123
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:27,118
where you have this huge battle in front

1124
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,760
of you that you see and you go, I I just

1125
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:32,720
got to kind of toughen up and buckle

1126
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,800
down and and get to it. And um I feel

1127
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:37,078
like sometimes maybe the fear of these

1128
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,680
different pathogens and thyroids is

1129
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:42,839
because you don't really see the damage

1130
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:47,279
until it's too late.

1131
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:51,199
And the the path to fixing it is not as

1132
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:53,760
easy as applying a pest spray where um

1133
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:56,159
you know pests are already such a big

1134
00:49:53,760 --> 00:50:00,319
problem that it's like the next level of

1135
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:02,639
hell is vyroids because you you have so

1136
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:05,480
much it's so much is unknown to the

1137
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:08,000
grower in the moment. And

1138
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:10,639
uh yeah, that's it's great that you guys

1139
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,880
do provide sort of the whole holistic

1140
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:16,719
package um for growers. Um that's

1141
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,160
awesome. Alfonso though uh let's hear a

1142
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:20,959
little bit more about your role with the

1143
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:22,558
company and uh any potentially exciting

1144
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:26,559
projects considering you are the

1145
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:29,440
director of research. Yes. So I have

1146
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:32,119
developed the all the test services that

1147
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:36,400
we offer. But

1148
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:40,680
um in in particular we are aware that a

1149
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:44,000
p the PCR technology is kind of

1150
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:48,159
like 20th century technology is has been

1151
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:52,719
around for 50 so years. Erh so we are

1152
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:54,039
trying to move uh away from that into a

1153
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:58,439
more

1154
00:50:54,039 --> 00:51:02,239
um 21st century uh science uh

1155
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:06,079
technological tests. So we developed the

1156
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:08,719
the tumi globe for for for growers to

1157
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:12,480
test in their in their facility for

1158
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:14,959
hopllay and broid and uh and that's

1159
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:20,358
important because it is it costs the

1160
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:24,000
costs a lot because a PCR machine is 50k

1161
00:51:20,358 --> 00:51:26,639
and the reagents are expensive it's time

1162
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,880
consuming preparing and so we were

1163
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:30,039
trying to basically develop something

1164
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,760
that

1165
00:51:30,039 --> 00:51:38,480
to overcome all those things. So we did

1166
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:42,240
our tumiglow and um and now I am working

1167
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:45,280
on basically making a uh the fuserium

1168
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:48,078
equivalent of the tumiglow so that

1169
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,000
growers in the grow can test for HOVD

1170
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:52,318
and

1171
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,079
perfuserium and probably I haven't

1172
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:56,159
started yet but probably in the next

1173
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,800
year we will be doing the same for

1174
00:51:56,159 --> 00:52:02,078
pithium and other common diseases that

1175
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:05,599
you will find at the same time there's

1176
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:07,079
uh there's this technology called um

1177
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:11,519
next generation

1178
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:14,640
sequencing in which we are uh trying to

1179
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:17,519
get into it because it's becoming with a

1180
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:20,679
year's super cheap to just instead of

1181
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:24,559
you asking me does my plant has

1182
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:27,480
hopid you can ask what does my plant has

1183
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:30,960
and then the NGS or next generation

1184
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:33,679
sequencing will be able to tell you all

1185
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:36,880
the all the pathogens that your plant

1186
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:41,279
may have in in that mode. Wow. And and

1187
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:44,318
and and and the costs are like super uh

1188
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:46,400
low compared to PCR. Is it is it

1189
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:49,318
something to do with like having a it

1190
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:52,160
has like a bank of

1191
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:54,239
um references that it can use versus

1192
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:57,440
having like a direct reference of like

1193
00:52:54,239 --> 00:53:00,719
having the you know the the confirmed

1194
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:03,358
positive um and then you take that and

1195
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:05,159
compare it to the information. Yeah.

1196
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:09,838
Basically what you do is just just

1197
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:13,679
sequence the entire nucleic acids DNA or

1198
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:16,558
RNA of the so you will get by by by by

1199
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:18,799
default a bunch of the plant stuff uh

1200
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:22,760
but then uh you can focus on the

1201
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:27,039
pathogens non-plant sequences and on

1202
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:30,000
online free there's libraries uh

1203
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:32,719
databases of uh of all these pathogens

1204
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,679
and their sequences. So you basically uh

1205
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:38,879
with a computer byformatically you can

1206
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:42,078
see okay this sequence which is repeated

1207
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,920
100,000 times in my sample what is it

1208
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:46,079
and then you go to this database and it

1209
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:50,838
tells you okay this sequence is this

1210
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:56,079
this pathogen awesome yeah so it's like

1211
00:53:50,838 --> 00:53:58,719
a a better approach than the old PCR

1212
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:00,318
technology and I'm sure you could even

1213
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:03,838
then kind of apply some of these

1214
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:05,519
different AI learning models and um kind

1215
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:08,318
of sift through that information even

1216
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:11,480
faster and more accurately. Yes, this

1217
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:15,358
this technology is uh going

1218
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:18,318
uh advancing at a very high pace like

1219
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:20,318
that's awesome. Uh, you know, that's

1220
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:22,159
also just another level of hope for the

1221
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:25,639
growers where it's going to allow for

1222
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:28,159
such a more comprehensive testing

1223
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:29,679
um scenario for them where they're going

1224
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:31,118
to be able to just find out that much

1225
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:33,358
more about their plants and what they

1226
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:35,838
can then do to help improve their grows

1227
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:37,519
overall or their yields, their health of

1228
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:38,880
the plants, and all those different

1229
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:40,800
things. That's that's great cuz I bet

1230
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,519
you there's probably a lot of other sort

1231
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:45,359
of combinations of pathogens or just

1232
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:47,318
little issues that would be something as

1233
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:51,119
simple as applying like a

1234
00:54:47,318 --> 00:54:53,358
um like a oxyos or a zerol or something

1235
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,920
like that to the to the plant and be

1236
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:59,679
able to kind of kill it off, take a new

1237
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:04,000
cutting, outgrow it, outstrip it and um

1238
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:06,519
and be free of that potential issue. Um

1239
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:10,159
so that's really great.

1240
00:55:06,519 --> 00:55:12,480
Um, so you know, I I like to do this

1241
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:14,239
podcast for both home growers and

1242
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,159
commercial cultivators because I feel

1243
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:18,959
like there's a lot of information that

1244
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:21,039
can uh help both of them um but at

1245
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:24,960
different in different ways in a lot of

1246
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:26,679
a lot of times. And so for the services

1247
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,440
that you guys

1248
00:55:26,679 --> 00:55:32,719
provide both for home growers and

1249
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:36,079
commercial uh growers, when should

1250
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:38,799
people uh potentially look into getting

1251
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:40,559
testing done for their plants uh like

1252
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:44,400
what I know we kind of went over some of

1253
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:48,319
the signs and symptoms, but um if you

1254
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:50,160
were to go to uh say a new grower and

1255
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:52,239
they they've heard of hops late and

1256
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:53,759
thyroid, right? um they know that they

1257
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:55,759
can get tested, but they go, "Well, I

1258
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,520
don't I'm just growing a plant. I don't

1259
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,880
know if I should get it tested or not."

1260
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:00,719
Or as a commercial grower, right,

1261
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:03,519
they're not seeing yield loss or or

1262
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:04,879
anything um significant. Do like what

1263
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:07,119
what are some of those things that they

1264
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:10,720
should be aware of where they go, "Ah, I

1265
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:12,119
need to start looking into testing."

1266
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:15,558
Um,

1267
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:19,280
so I guess my take on it is

1268
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:22,079
that prevention is always going to be

1269
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:26,319
significantly cheaper, faster, and

1270
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:28,559
easier than um, trying to mitigate it

1271
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:30,639
once it's spread in your facility. Um,

1272
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,400
and often you don't see anything like

1273
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:34,879
you were saying until it's gotten really

1274
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,960
bad and then fixing it becomes this

1275
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:40,640
thing that feels very overwhelming and

1276
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:43,199
requires a lot of intervention. Um, so

1277
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:45,039
if you know if I were starting a brand

1278
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:46,480
new grow and I was bringing in new

1279
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:48,318
clones, you know, the first thing I

1280
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,559
would do is go to my clone provider and

1281
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:51,920
say, "Hey, did you test these clones or

1282
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:54,079
did you test the mother that you cut

1283
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,920
these clones from?" You know, for

1284
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:58,240
ideally hop late and thyroid and

1285
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,960
fuserium um because you don't want

1286
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:04,318
either of those in your facility. Um,

1287
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,679
pytheium um can be not quite as bad, but

1288
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:09,039
obviously you don't want to be bringing

1289
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:10,798
that in either. So, um, confirming if

1290
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:14,239
you can that the clones you're

1291
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:16,159
purchasing are negative is step one. Um,

1292
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:19,439
if you already have mothers growing in

1293
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:22,399
your facility, um, I would definitely do

1294
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:24,079
kind of a baseline test. Um, ideally,

1295
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:26,720
the way people are organizing their

1296
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:28,318
mothers is that they have, um, it kind

1297
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:29,838
of depends on the size of your facility

1298
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:32,400
and how many production mothers you

1299
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:35,838
need, but you have a smaller subset of

1300
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:38,160
plants that are called, um, nuclear

1301
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:41,039
stock. Um, so let's say, you know, if

1302
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:44,879
you need 20 mothers of each strain, you

1303
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:46,719
have a few moms that are um, uh,

1304
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,480
represent that strain, but they're kept

1305
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:50,798
in a separate place. Even if it's a

1306
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,159
separate table in the corner, and you

1307
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:53,280
know, even if you're a home grower and

1308
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:55,199
you have stuff going on in your

1309
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,200
basement, you'll have a little tent

1310
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:59,358
with, you know, one or two of each

1311
00:57:57,199 --> 00:58:01,519
strain that you like to grow that are

1312
00:57:59,358 --> 00:58:03,119
protected that you you keep the bugs

1313
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:05,119
away, you're very careful when you're

1314
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:08,480
handling them. Those should be tested

1315
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:10,559
periodically. Like I mean ideally you

1316
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:13,440
test them before you cut clones off of

1317
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:16,319
them and you test the clone that will

1318
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,920
become the replacement mother. Um so you

1319
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:20,798
know depending on the cadence of how

1320
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,798
often you're replacing those. Um, and

1321
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:26,318
that's to make sure that nothing sneaks

1322
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:28,880
in and sort of, you know, is sneakily

1323
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:30,798
moving about your your basement or your

1324
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,960
huge facility until it, you know,

1325
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:34,880
basically kicks you in the ass six

1326
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:38,079
months later and you're looking at this

1327
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:39,599
huge loss. Um, so I guess the the the

1328
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:42,240
short answer, that was a really long

1329
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:43,599
answer. The short answer is um I don't

1330
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:46,159
think there's a time when you should

1331
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:48,559
like say and now I start testing this.

1332
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:50,399
It's a continual thing that you do and

1333
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:52,559
it it doesn't need to be thousands and

1334
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,358
thousands of dollars, but it does need

1335
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:57,280
to be something that's worked into your

1336
00:58:54,358 --> 00:59:00,159
regular process. Um because if you skip

1337
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:02,240
that and you work without information,

1338
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:03,358
it's kind of like a ticking time bomb.

1339
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:06,078
You don't know when things are going to

1340
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:12,078
go south for you. So, it's better to

1341
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:14,640
just prevent it at the offset. Um,

1342
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:17,119
I was just gonna say that in my case

1343
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:22,318
when I since you were talking about Nick

1344
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:25,519
about the how you sprout seeds h I I

1345
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:28,719
have found that before sprouting them

1346
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:32,599
like sticking them into 10 to 20% bleach

1347
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:37,039
for one minute uh it is is

1348
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:38,720
is important because if the HVD is in

1349
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:41,000
the outside of the coat it will destroy

1350
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:43,838
destroy it or if any

1351
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:46,559
fungi anything fungal like is in the

1352
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:48,639
outside it will also destroy it. So it

1353
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:53,440
it is a you know it will just take you

1354
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:56,318
one minute. Uh I have not seen any uh

1355
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,798
decrease in germination rate. The seats

1356
00:59:56,318 --> 01:00:01,599
are pretty tough

1357
00:59:57,798 --> 01:00:03,838
and so yeah so that's a a good practice

1358
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:06,720
to to to do before you sprouting your

1359
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:09,039
seeds for sure. And um is the other

1360
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:12,959
product that you can use is it called uh

1361
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:15,358
Zirkcon or is it uh uh it's Verircon?

1362
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:17,760
Vercon. Thank you. Zirkcon I think is an

1363
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:20,078
allergy medicine.

1364
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,680
That does sound familiar to me. Oh, I

1365
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:23,440
don't know why my mind went there, but V

1366
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:25,358
and Z, you know, they're they're at the

1367
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:29,039
end of the alphabet. Same same side of

1368
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:30,880
the alphabet. Yeah. Okay. So, so Vercon

1369
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:34,079
is the other product that people can use

1370
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:35,680
um also potentially by for seed washes

1371
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:38,079
ahead of times just to give yourself

1372
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:40,480
that extra assurance. Um, and when

1373
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:43,680
you're using the bleach on the uh seed

1374
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:46,480
wash, do you recommend letting that

1375
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:49,039
bleach fully dry on the seed coating

1376
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:51,358
after removing it from the solution or

1377
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:54,000
do you rinse it with water? I rinse it

1378
01:00:51,358 --> 01:00:56,318
with water. Okay, great. That's good to

1379
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,639
know. I know that sometimes uh like with

1380
01:00:56,318 --> 01:01:00,239
different chemical applications, you

1381
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:02,639
need to allow it to like either fully

1382
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:04,479
dry in the air be so so it has the full

1383
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:08,920
effect. You know, I rinse it with water,

1384
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:12,079
but I have uh many times forgotten

1385
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:14,240
like stone and you're like, "Oh, well, I

1386
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:17,519
forgot." And but they they still do

1387
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:18,798
great. Cool. No, that's great to hear. U

1388
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:21,440
I feel like some people think that

1389
01:01:18,798 --> 01:01:23,759
bleach is the the complete enemy of a

1390
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,358
grow, but in a lot of ways, it's

1391
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:27,599
probably one of your best friends to

1392
01:01:25,358 --> 01:01:30,000
make sure that things stay clean and

1393
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:32,559
Yeah. It's the enemy of your clothes.

1394
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,798
The clothes. Yeah. Yes. Fashion. Yes.

1395
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:37,280
Enemy for sure.

1396
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:39,280
Yes. And I And even with things like um

1397
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:41,440
hypocchloric acid, it still has the the

1398
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:44,000
chlorine molecule in it. So that it's uh

1399
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,679
it'll test for on chlorine strips at the

1400
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,280
same, you know, in the same way that

1401
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:50,798
bleach would, but bleach just is that uh

1402
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:54,079
hypocchlorite rather than um

1403
01:01:50,798 --> 01:01:55,759
hypocchlorous, which it seems to be as

1404
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:58,000
though the hypocchlorous acid has a

1405
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:02,240
little bit more of a gentler effect on

1406
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:04,400
biologicals, but um still makes the the

1407
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:07,199
surroundings sterile.

1408
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:08,960
Yeah. Yeah. And so unfortunately like

1409
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:11,039
sterile generally means that you're

1410
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:13,920
killing, you know, it's usually fungus

1411
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:15,599
and bacteria, right? And that's that's

1412
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,798
actually a lot of the pathogens that

1413
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:19,760
you're going to need to worry about,

1414
01:02:16,798 --> 01:02:23,199
especially the fungus. Um, vyroids are

1415
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:25,440
weird. They're they don't have um an

1416
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:27,919
outside coat. They don't have any lipids

1417
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:30,240
or fats or proteins associated. It's

1418
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:32,880
just genetic information. And so the

1419
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:35,838
stuff that will work to decontaminate

1420
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:38,079
vibroids is the the list is very tiny.

1421
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:39,599
Um there's bleach obviously which

1422
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:42,480
thankfully is super easy to find

1423
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:44,318
everywhere and cheap. And cheap. Yeah.

1424
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,880
Um and you know you're diluting it 1 to

1425
01:02:44,318 --> 01:02:49,039
10. So it's one part bleached, nine

1426
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:52,240
parts water. So you're going to use it

1427
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:54,079
pretty slowly. Um or that Verircon 2%

1428
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:56,798
although I do like to tell people it's

1429
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:58,318
only one study that that was shown to be

1430
01:02:56,798 --> 01:03:01,759
effective. That doesn't mean it's

1431
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:04,000
effective in all vibroids, but the the

1432
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:06,079
doesn't have nearly as much data as

1433
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,079
bleach does. Bleach has like it's

1434
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:10,160
basically the positive control in all

1435
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:11,599
studies. Like if somebody wants to try

1436
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:13,358
something new, they're like, "Well,

1437
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:17,200
bleach should work for sure. Does it

1438
01:03:13,358 --> 01:03:19,920
work as well as bleach?" Um, and so um

1439
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:24,159
it it's it's important to remember that

1440
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:26,880
that one is the most effective for um

1441
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:29,598
for decontaminating stuff. For sure. I I

1442
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:33,200
I always suggest a 10% bleach solution

1443
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:35,519
for anybody. Um that it is just it is

1444
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:36,960
it's cheap, it's accessible. Um you

1445
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:38,480
know, I always tell people to make sure

1446
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,039
that they're soaking their cutting

1447
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:42,400
scissors in a 10% bleach solution and

1448
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:44,480
making sure that they sit there for a

1449
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:48,400
minute. Uh if you're not like agitating

1450
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:49,760
them, you know, vigorously. Uh and I I

1451
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:52,000
believe that I've learned that from you

1452
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:54,960
through the um uh We the Growers

1453
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,880
podcast. Uh it was very informative uh

1454
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:00,159
information that you gave people there.

1455
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:05,519
Um and would you mind touching briefly

1456
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:08,480
on why people shouldn't use alcohol to

1457
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:12,079
um try to help prevent the spread of

1458
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:14,400
vyroids? Yes, absolutely. Um so

1459
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:17,359
alcohol's uh mechanism of action is

1460
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:20,400
going to be to um dehydrate proteins.

1461
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:22,239
And so, um, people use like isopropyl

1462
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,880
alcohol and stuff, you know, like it's

1463
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:28,479
hand sanitizer. Um, and that works fine

1464
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:30,160
for viruses, um, and bacteria. Although,

1465
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:33,039
I'll be honest, it doesn't it's not

1466
01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:35,358
amazing, but it does work. Um, the

1467
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:38,480
problem with vyroids is because they are

1468
01:04:35,358 --> 01:04:40,480
just naked genetic information, um,

1469
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:44,318
nothing in the mechanism of action of

1470
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:47,599
alcohol works at all. Um, and actually,

1471
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:50,400
um, alcohol stabilizes, uh,

1472
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:54,720
genetic information and so using alcohol

1473
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:58,000
actually will stabilize vibroids um and

1474
01:04:54,719 --> 01:05:00,879
make it easier to infect the next plant.

1475
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,559
Um so there was one study where they I

1476
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,480
think this was using potato spindle

1477
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:05,720
tuber vyroid but it has the same

1478
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,798
structure as

1479
01:05:05,719 --> 01:05:10,879
hoplenyroid. Um and they basically uh

1480
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:13,199
took the infected scissors and dipped it

1481
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:15,920
in water and then cut the next plant and

1482
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:17,759
the transmission rate was like 70%. But

1483
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:21,200
if they dipped it in alcohol, it went up

1484
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:22,319
to 90 to 95% transmission. Wow. Um, so

1485
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:24,719
you're actually you're pedaling

1486
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:27,759
backwards by using alcohol. So just

1487
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:29,919
don't use that. Um, it doesn't work at

1488
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:32,799
all on vibroids. It just makes it worse.

1489
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,880
Or the flame torch, which Yes. And flame

1490
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:36,960
doesn't even work on vibroids. They've

1491
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:39,680
done that experiment as well. So um,

1492
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:42,240
which is amazing. They're that is crazy.

1493
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:44,719
Tough little buggers vibroids. They're

1494
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:47,838
it's wild. They're very stable. Is there

1495
01:05:44,719 --> 01:05:50,399
a heat threshold for for um destruction

1496
01:05:47,838 --> 01:05:52,719
of a vyroid or can they withstand

1497
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:56,000
basically any heat that we would be able

1498
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:59,038
to apply to them? Um so there is a heat

1499
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,798
threshold. I believe it was 140 degrees

1500
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,000
Celsius.

1501
01:06:00,798 --> 01:06:04,239
That's really hot. I don't know what

1502
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:07,440
that is in Fahrenheit, but um it was

1503
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:10,000
like almost 300 degrees. Yeah. But um

1504
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:12,639
they did do, for example, a pro a

1505
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:15,920
propane blow torch that did not cut it.

1506
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:18,078
So, um, they're very heat stable. So, I

1507
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:20,400
would, you know, bleach is so easy. It's

1508
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:22,839
so accessible, it's so cheap, and it

1509
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:25,200
works like that. So,

1510
01:06:22,838 --> 01:06:27,279
um, I just recommend that to people

1511
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:30,159
because I don't have investment in a

1512
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:32,160
bleach company, but work. There's just

1513
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:35,598
so much data. I'm like, this just works.

1514
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:37,279
So, for sure. Um, well, that's that's

1515
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:39,039
great information for people because I

1516
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:40,000
feel like the uh, you know, a lot of

1517
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:41,599
people will just be like, "I have

1518
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,920
alcohol for my scissors because I use it

1519
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:46,318
to clean off all the the gunk when I'm

1520
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,358
trimming my weed." And um, so I'm just

1521
01:06:46,318 --> 01:06:48,960
going to use that to spray everything

1522
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:50,598
down. It smells like alcohol. How can it

1523
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:53,599
not be clean?

1524
01:06:50,599 --> 01:06:55,760
Um, but it it's very important to know

1525
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:58,480
that it will help even spread the

1526
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:01,920
pathogen further. Um, and I believe I've

1527
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:06,079
even heard before that it's used uh in

1528
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:08,480
like in vitro um reproduction of vyroids

1529
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:12,079
like you can use alcohol to kind of help

1530
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:13,679
proliferate their spread um within the

1531
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:15,680
alcohol or maybe it was just that it

1532
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:18,480
would spread easier if then applied to a

1533
01:07:15,679 --> 01:07:21,759
plant. Uh yeah, so I mean alcohol is

1534
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:24,400
used frequently in the lab um to help

1535
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:26,079
precipitate. So you can take um like

1536
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,160
genetic information can actually become

1537
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:30,000
like a solid and you can precipitate it

1538
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:32,719
into like a little like particulates at

1539
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:35,599
the bottom of the tube. Um and alcohol

1540
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:38,239
helps with that process. Um and it's it

1541
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:40,160
makes them very stable. So if you if you

1542
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:42,399
store them in alcohol in the freezer,

1543
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:44,719
they they last much longer than if you

1544
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:47,200
stored them in water. And so that's why

1545
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:49,118
that's why it helps to transmit it

1546
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:51,358
because it makes them more stable and it

1547
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:53,039
kind of helps them precipitate into

1548
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:56,480
these little particulates. Yeah. It

1549
01:07:53,039 --> 01:08:00,000
concentrates it. So um yeah, it's it's

1550
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:02,240
it's a no-go for for vibroids. But they

1551
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,480
don't replicate in the alcohol. No, no,

1552
01:08:02,239 --> 01:08:06,239
no, no. They require like like Alfonso

1553
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:09,039
was saying, they require that machine

1554
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:11,279
that exists inside the cell. So they

1555
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:13,920
actually have to be in this in in a

1556
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:18,159
living cell in order to replicate. Got

1557
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:21,520
it. Okay. That all great information. Um

1558
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:24,039
so uh I mean we've talked about bleach,

1559
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:26,319
we've talked about the vercon.

1560
01:08:24,039 --> 01:08:28,399
Um and those are just kind of the

1561
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:31,279
chemical ways of destroying or

1562
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:34,639
potentially destroying the um the

1563
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:37,080
vyroid. Uh, are there any other

1564
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:41,880
practices that home growers

1565
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:46,399
um might might uh use to help prevent uh

1566
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:49,279
pathogens or um help uh prevent the

1567
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:51,119
spread? And then also uh in that same

1568
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:54,480
line of thought, uh what are some of the

1569
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:57,679
treatments that people can use?

1570
01:08:54,479 --> 01:09:00,238
Um yeah, so I mean I would recommend

1571
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:02,399
starting from the beginning. Um, if you

1572
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:05,358
bring something new into your facility

1573
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:08,719
or or into your basement, um, you need

1574
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:10,640
to have a quarantine area. So, that can

1575
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:12,798
just be the corner like underneath a

1576
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:15,920
lamp with a bench or a little tent or

1577
01:09:12,798 --> 01:09:18,399
something. Um, and make sure that you

1578
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:20,399
put that plant there and it has a

1579
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:24,399
separate set of tools. You use gloves

1580
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:26,798
when you're messing with it. Um, and um,

1581
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:29,039
test that plant. Um, test it at the

1582
01:09:26,798 --> 01:09:31,278
minimum for hot plate and vibrate. And I

1583
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:33,119
would test it if for serarium as well.

1584
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:35,359
If you want, you can test for pytheium

1585
01:09:33,119 --> 01:09:39,039
also. Um, those three are going to give

1586
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:40,960
you misery if you find them. Um, do not

1587
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:43,359
put them next like in the tent with your

1588
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:46,880
favorite strains until you make sure

1589
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:49,679
that that plant isn't infected. Um,

1590
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:53,039
generally I would recommend two tests

1591
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:54,960
about uh 2 to 3 weeks apart just in case

1592
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:57,039
the vyroid was at a very low level in

1593
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,399
the beginning. Um, and this is just

1594
01:09:57,039 --> 01:10:00,560
really important when you're bringing in

1595
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:04,399
new genetics into a place where you know

1596
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:05,840
it's clean. Um, while you're waiting,

1597
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:08,079
obviously you want to be looking for

1598
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:10,319
bugs, um, any kind of weird

1599
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:12,158
discoloration, any other funky symptoms

1600
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:14,238
that you're like, "Oh, okay. I don't

1601
01:10:12,158 --> 01:10:16,319
really want my plants to have that." Um,

1602
01:10:14,238 --> 01:10:20,319
and so just be just be scouting those

1603
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:22,559
new clones. Um once you put it into, you

1604
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:25,359
know, the tent or or the mom room or

1605
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:27,520
whatever, um you want to be just very

1606
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:29,759
careful, especially with your mother

1607
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:32,480
plants, um it's always good to wear

1608
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:33,760
gloves. Um you can, like Fono was

1609
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:35,839
saying, you can have vibrate on your

1610
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:38,239
hands if you're smoking or grinding. You

1611
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:39,520
can also have like fungus, bacteria, and

1612
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:42,319
you just don't want to be touching your

1613
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:45,199
plants with your naked hands. Um, if you

1614
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:46,880
like to garden outside, which I do and

1615
01:10:45,198 --> 01:10:49,039
it's awesome, but like things like

1616
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:51,279
ferium, pytheium, and other kinds of

1617
01:10:49,039 --> 01:10:53,279
molds like, you know, betritis and all

1618
01:10:51,279 --> 01:10:54,960
sorts of nasty stuff is outside. So, if

1619
01:10:53,279 --> 01:10:57,519
you're coming into your grow in your

1620
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:59,840
basement or in your into your facility,

1621
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:01,679
you need to be aware that it could be on

1622
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:04,560
your gardening clothes. It can be on the

1623
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:07,119
bottom of your shoes. So, um, just throw

1624
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,719
on like if you just get a a lab coat or

1625
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:10,479
even, you know, change your shoes out

1626
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:11,760
like Mr. Rogers before you go down

1627
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:14,399
there, something like that, so you're

1628
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:17,520
not bringing stuff in um to your

1629
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:20,158
facility or into your basement. Um and

1630
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:21,840
then as you're working with your plants,

1631
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:23,439
when you you have your gloves on and

1632
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:25,920
you're moving from plant to plant, if

1633
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:28,158
you'd make a 10% bleach solution and put

1634
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:29,679
it in a little spray bottle, then you

1635
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:30,799
know, you can be like trimming or

1636
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:32,640
whatever with a plant. You're going to

1637
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,239
put your scissors in the 10% bleach.

1638
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:36,239
Just spray some on your hands and rub it

1639
01:11:34,238 --> 01:11:38,319
around. Um and then you shake it like

1640
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:40,718
that. It's okay to touch the plants with

1641
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:42,399
the 10% bleach. That concentration isn't

1642
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:44,079
going to hurt them. Um, and that's to

1643
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:46,479
just sort of clean them so you're you're

1644
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:49,279
not the big vector there transferring it

1645
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:51,198
from plant to plant. Um, it's important

1646
01:11:49,279 --> 01:11:54,800
to remember the roots have a very high

1647
01:11:51,198 --> 01:11:56,158
level. So, ideally, um, your plants,

1648
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,520
especially if there's water at the

1649
01:11:56,158 --> 01:11:59,198
bottom of your tent or they're on a

1650
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:01,040
table and there's runoff, they're

1651
01:11:59,198 --> 01:12:03,198
elevated a little bit so the roots

1652
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:05,039
aren't sitting in that runoff water

1653
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:08,799
because you can transfer it through the

1654
01:12:05,039 --> 01:12:11,279
water. Um goes for fungal pathogens. Um

1655
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,960
and remember things like clonal trays or

1656
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:15,198
if you want to do a flood and drain or

1657
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:18,039
something like that, that's another big

1658
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:21,359
transmission risk for um hop late and

1659
01:12:18,039 --> 01:12:24,079
vyroid. Um, and then, um, obviously

1660
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:27,039
insects. There's just information coming

1661
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:28,880
out right now from CSU showing that, um,

1662
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:30,479
uh, I believe it was aphids they found.

1663
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:32,880
But kind of any insect that's going to

1664
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:34,479
chew up and get on the sap, like on

1665
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,920
their mouth parts or whatever, and then

1666
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:39,119
they go to another plant, you could

1667
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:42,880
transfer it like that as well. Or pets.

1668
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:47,198
Yes. Worried. Cats. My cats like to chew

1669
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:49,440
on the leaves and I there's not any data

1670
01:12:47,198 --> 01:12:51,678
out there, but I can just see if my cat

1671
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:54,238
is chewing on the leaf and then it's

1672
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:56,960
going to chew on the other one. It could

1673
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:58,718
It makes sense, right? And then another

1674
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:01,119
thing that I seen that happened,

1675
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:02,960
although there's no data to it, but one

1676
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:05,119
time we had like a plant which was

1677
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:06,560
negative and a plant that was positive

1678
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:10,479
right next to each other and we were

1679
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:14,000
using it to test um just as our controls

1680
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:15,959
for the lab. And we noticed that one day

1681
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:20,319
they got fungus

1682
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:23,840
nets and all of the sudden the the

1683
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:25,559
negative plant was positive. Sure. So

1684
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:28,400
the fungus nuts has

1685
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:30,560
this stage in which they're when they're

1686
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:33,599
before flying they they they leave in

1687
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:36,719
the soil and and they feed on the roots.

1688
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:41,280
So that's I think like a way for the

1689
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:43,840
vyroid to to get wings and just fly to

1690
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:45,759
the other side. Sure. I've I've heard it

1691
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:49,039
uh be transmitted with root aphids as

1692
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:51,360
well. Um, yeah, any anything like that,

1693
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:53,198
it it I mean they unless they're

1694
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:55,519
producing some sort of chemical in their

1695
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:57,759
body that's going to destroy the vyroid.

1696
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,520
Um, but as we've previously discussed,

1697
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,760
there's not a lot of those chemicals

1698
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:04,320
that we can even use in a lab setting.

1699
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:06,560
Um, and so I it's doubtful that the bugs

1700
01:14:04,319 --> 01:14:08,039
are producing uh chlorine in their

1701
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:11,199
bodies.

1702
01:14:08,039 --> 01:14:14,640
Um so yeah I' I've heard that before

1703
01:14:11,198 --> 01:14:17,119
that um uh pathogen pressures can

1704
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:19,079
definitely increase with uh pest

1705
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:21,679
pressures because of the the

1706
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:25,000
transmittability through the the the

1707
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:27,359
pest being the vector.

1708
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,439
Um let's see. Are there are there any

1709
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:32,158
other vectors that you that you feel

1710
01:14:29,439 --> 01:14:35,319
like growers should be aware of that um

1711
01:14:32,158 --> 01:14:38,238
we may not have touched on yet?

1712
01:14:35,319 --> 01:14:41,679
Um, see, mechanical is going to be the

1713
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:43,678
most common way. Um, you know, seed,

1714
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:46,079
it's possible. Um, so you should

1715
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:48,239
definitely be testing seed. Um, and like

1716
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:49,600
I said, one seed from a seed packet if

1717
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:51,839
if all those seeds came from the same

1718
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:54,440
mother is sufficient really to determine

1719
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:56,880
whether or not they're infected. Um,

1720
01:14:54,439 --> 01:14:58,879
insects are definitely a possibility.

1721
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,719
Water transmission is real and there's

1722
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:03,279
plenty of data to support that now. So,

1723
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:06,000
you need to be thinking about that.

1724
01:15:03,279 --> 01:15:07,759
um you know roots touch each other like

1725
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,479
if you have things super super close

1726
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:12,880
together and the roots are like kissing

1727
01:15:10,479 --> 01:15:14,799
that's a possibility too. It's not the

1728
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:16,159
same with the foliage. If the foliage is

1729
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,640
really close as long as there's no

1730
01:15:16,158 --> 01:15:20,639
breakage um where there's like sap

1731
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:23,840
transfer between two like wounds or

1732
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:26,800
micro wounds um you're okay there. Um

1733
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:28,640
and and Alfonso was saying um you know

1734
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:32,159
other other things you don't think about

1735
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:33,520
like your pets, your cats um and and

1736
01:15:32,158 --> 01:15:35,920
anything you bring it in from the

1737
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:38,239
outside. Remember that weeds are vectors

1738
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:41,199
too for a lot of people. I have a

1739
01:15:38,238 --> 01:15:43,439
quicken um yes and it does it is in the

1740
01:15:41,198 --> 01:15:45,919
pollen as well. So um be careful with

1741
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:48,639
that too. I I do have a question about

1742
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:50,719
the foliage. Um, is there any potential

1743
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:53,920
for it to be released through the

1744
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:56,079
moisture that the as the stamata are

1745
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:57,359
sort of uh transpiring? Because I know

1746
01:15:56,079 --> 01:15:59,760
that, you know, sometimes you get the

1747
01:15:57,359 --> 01:16:01,519
leaves that will overlap, let's say,

1748
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,119
from two plants that are next to each

1749
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:06,080
other and when you pull them apart,

1750
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:07,599
it'll be a nice wet layer on both the

1751
01:16:06,079 --> 01:16:10,719
top and the bottom of the leaf that

1752
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:13,120
we're touching. Um, now that's not

1753
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:16,158
necessarily a wound, but it could be

1754
01:16:13,119 --> 01:16:20,399
considered like a a transfer of fluids.

1755
01:16:16,158 --> 01:16:23,119
Um is there any potential there for

1756
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:25,359
uh the vyroid to transfer?

1757
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:28,119
Yeah, so there's no evidence that it can

1758
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:30,479
transfer um like you know with

1759
01:16:28,119 --> 01:16:33,279
respiration byproducts or whatever for

1760
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:35,519
plants. Um it's it's mostly going to be

1761
01:16:33,279 --> 01:16:37,679
contained you know within the cells of

1762
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:40,719
the plant and in the sap which is kind

1763
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:42,158
of how it travels around. Um and but if

1764
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:43,679
there's little cuts on both of those

1765
01:16:42,158 --> 01:16:45,519
leaves and it we're not talking about

1766
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:47,760
like you know half the leaf is missing.

1767
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:49,360
it can be really like microscopic.

1768
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:51,600
That's sufficient to transfer it between

1769
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:54,960
those two leaves.

1770
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:57,760
Great information. Um yeah, it's just

1771
01:16:54,960 --> 01:17:00,079
prepping people for uh being able to

1772
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:03,520
look at this stuff with an educated eye.

1773
01:17:00,079 --> 01:17:07,359
feel like is so important because um you

1774
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:10,480
know I I've now kind of busted one of my

1775
01:17:07,359 --> 01:17:12,479
own myths that I had uh heard where it

1776
01:17:10,479 --> 01:17:15,039
doesn't necessarily need to have like

1777
01:17:12,479 --> 01:17:17,599
the the sap like the phm or the xyllem

1778
01:17:15,039 --> 01:17:20,560
transfer uh but it could just be like a

1779
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:22,640
contact transfer which um that's really

1780
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:25,280
good to hear that that's not necessarily

1781
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:29,119
an easy way for that to occur uh if at

1782
01:17:25,279 --> 01:17:31,039
all possible. Um, so keeping yeah,

1783
01:17:29,119 --> 01:17:33,359
plants elevated. I love that idea,

1784
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:35,920
especially for drain tables where in

1785
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:38,319
facilities there's a lot of um times

1786
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:40,719
where I've seen, you know, based on the

1787
01:17:38,319 --> 01:17:42,799
construction of those uh drain tables

1788
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:44,480
there may be a dip in them where it does

1789
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:47,360
build up a little water, but it's not

1790
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:49,519
too much to where you're creating like

1791
01:17:47,359 --> 01:17:51,519
um hypoxic environments within the root

1792
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:53,280
zone. You're just, you know, giving them

1793
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:55,520
a little bit extra water compared to all

1794
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:57,279
the other plants that are on that table.

1795
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:59,040
um and they're still using it up, but it

1796
01:17:57,279 --> 01:18:00,800
is then at that point transferring

1797
01:17:59,039 --> 01:18:02,479
between three or four plants or

1798
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:06,760
something that are in that that dip in

1799
01:18:02,479 --> 01:18:10,000
the table. Um I I will say one of the

1800
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:13,280
biggest I think details that a lot of

1801
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,840
growers miss is um the rooting gel when

1802
01:18:13,279 --> 01:18:18,158
people are cloning. Um a lot of times

1803
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:19,360
they'll dip that clone. They're super

1804
01:18:18,158 --> 01:18:20,879
careful about everything and then

1805
01:18:19,359 --> 01:18:22,719
they'll cut clones and everybody gets

1806
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:25,840
dipped in the same shot glass. like you

1807
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:28,079
know 100 plants same shot glass um but

1808
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:29,760
that is a gaping wound a clone you dip

1809
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:31,920
it in that shot glass and it becomes

1810
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,440
like a little hop and brood inoculum and

1811
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,119
you're basically inoculating every

1812
01:18:33,439 --> 01:18:38,639
single clone as you go through your

1813
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:40,158
process um so be really careful like

1814
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:41,920
thinking like that like what am I

1815
01:18:40,158 --> 01:18:43,839
sharing between these plants and is

1816
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:46,760
there you know either something that

1817
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:50,159
comes in contact with the roots or or

1818
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:52,239
like clonal gel that I'm sharing and

1819
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:54,158
even though I'm really careful I'm I'm

1820
01:18:52,238 --> 01:18:57,759
infecting all of these clones by using

1821
01:18:54,158 --> 01:19:00,479
the same gel for each clone. Um yeah,

1822
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:03,440
and growing media is the same issue. Um

1823
01:19:00,479 --> 01:19:05,439
we had one grower submit their growing

1824
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:08,519
media that they were reusing the cocoa

1825
01:19:05,439 --> 01:19:11,519
and it tested positive. Um

1826
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:13,199
so I I would recommend not reusing it.

1827
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:16,480
If you do choose to reuse it, you should

1828
01:19:13,198 --> 01:19:18,000
sterilize it. Again, 10% bleach. Um I'd

1829
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:19,919
probably give it a good 10-minute soak

1830
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,359
just u to kill off anything else that

1831
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:25,440
might be in there. and then rinse it

1832
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:26,880
really well. Um but um yeah, reusing

1833
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:29,919
stuff between plants, you got to think

1834
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:32,480
about that. Pots, tools, growing media,

1835
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,560
everything can transfer. Composting.

1836
01:19:32,479 --> 01:19:36,718
Some people

1837
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:38,960
compost. Oh, this plant is doesn't look

1838
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:42,000
healthy. I'm going to compost it. But

1839
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:44,000
that's like the worst you could do.

1840
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,238
Yeah. And then reusing it on the healthy

1841
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,719
ones. That's Yeah. Sure. Oh, that's a

1842
01:19:46,238 --> 01:19:51,839
great that's a great point. Um, I've

1843
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:54,000
heard in in like living soil bed systems

1844
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:56,400
that that's also one of the the, you

1845
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,158
know, kind of the death death touches to

1846
01:19:56,399 --> 01:20:00,238
those beds is if you have hops and

1847
01:19:58,158 --> 01:20:02,559
vyroid because typically you're leaving

1848
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:05,919
some level of root mass behind when

1849
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:09,360
you're um transplanting with new plants

1850
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:11,640
for another cycle. Um, are there any

1851
01:20:09,359 --> 01:20:14,719
ways to

1852
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:18,640
potentially kill off the vyroid in

1853
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:21,279
living soil beds or other um, substrates

1854
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:22,800
that are reused? Uh, cuz I know that

1855
01:20:21,279 --> 01:20:25,439
sometimes that can be a significant

1856
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:28,360
investment for even a home grower. Um,

1857
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:31,599
if they're doing like a small 4x4 or a

1858
01:20:28,359 --> 01:20:33,759
2x4 fabric bed and they buy all this

1859
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:36,000
soil to fill it or they spend all this

1860
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:38,360
time to create their own soil at home.

1861
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,479
Uh yeah. Are there any

1862
01:20:38,359 --> 01:20:42,000
potentially are there any ways that you

1863
01:20:40,479 --> 01:20:45,678
can potentially remove the vyroid from

1864
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:47,840
the soil? I guess. Yeah. I mean, I I've

1865
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:49,679
had this conversation with lots of

1866
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:51,279
growers that have this really awesome

1867
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:52,960
living soil that they've been they've

1868
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:55,519
had for years and they've worked on it

1869
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:57,840
and it's really wonderful and rich, but

1870
01:20:55,520 --> 01:21:00,960
uh unfortunately any treatment that's

1871
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:02,960
going to remove the vibroid is going to

1872
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:06,079
destroy everything that you love about

1873
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:08,560
your living soil in the first place. Um,

1874
01:21:06,079 --> 01:21:12,640
so what about leaving it untouched for

1875
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:14,320
like a year? Yeah, it's I mean I don't

1876
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:17,280
the studies on what how long I think

1877
01:21:14,319 --> 01:21:20,799
it's 6 months. So maybe you can let it

1878
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:23,599
sit for a very long time. Um, I'd be I'd

1879
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:26,239
be wary. I'd want to test it just to be

1880
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:28,000
sure before you reuse it. But I mean,

1881
01:21:26,238 --> 01:21:30,238
honestly, the best way to protect your

1882
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
living's soil is don't just don't plant

1883
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:34,319
anything in there until you test it

1884
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,679
first. Like don't don't go backwards and

1885
01:21:34,319 --> 01:21:37,599
be like, "Oh, I've planted something

1886
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:39,920
with positive in my living soil and that

1887
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:42,400
this was so important." Like put it in

1888
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:44,960
quarantine, test it twice, and then put

1889
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:46,238
it in your living soil. Um and then you

1890
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:48,800
don't have to worry about it because

1891
01:21:46,238 --> 01:21:51,519
it's not positive. So yeah, that's the

1892
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:54,079
best way to go about it. Yeah. And I it,

1893
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:56,880
you know, in my mind I'm thinking even

1894
01:21:54,079 --> 01:21:58,880
if you let it sit for a long time, um if

1895
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:00,480
there's any root mass left, then there's

1896
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:03,199
still potential for the vyroid to

1897
01:22:00,479 --> 01:22:05,119
replicate, right? And so the 6 month

1898
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:08,638
mark is probably after the last

1899
01:22:05,119 --> 01:22:11,439
replication occurs. And so if you have

1900
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:13,600
food for it basically in there for a

1901
01:22:11,439 --> 01:22:16,319
couple years, then you're still looking

1902
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:19,360
at like a couple years plus 6 months at

1903
01:22:16,319 --> 01:22:20,960
that point for it to potentially be um

1904
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:23,158
okay. And maybe there's even a little

1905
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:26,000
pocket of other

1906
01:22:23,158 --> 01:22:28,279
uh biological material in there that it

1907
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:32,238
can latch on to and and continue to

1908
01:22:28,279 --> 01:22:34,639
proliferate. Um, are are there other

1909
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:36,079
Sorry. Are there other Go ahead. Sorry.

1910
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:38,480
Are there are there other biological

1911
01:22:36,079 --> 01:22:41,119
tissues that it could latch on to to

1912
01:22:38,479 --> 01:22:46,638
continue to replicate itself other than

1913
01:22:41,119 --> 01:22:48,238
um plant plant matter like So yeah. So

1914
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:50,400
so it can't it's not going to be able to

1915
01:22:48,238 --> 01:22:52,718
replicate in dead tissue per se um

1916
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:54,879
because it it requires a living cell and

1917
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:56,079
it has to go it has to go into this

1918
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:58,639
special place in the cell called the

1919
01:22:56,079 --> 01:23:01,639
nucleus. So once the tissue is dead

1920
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:04,560
dead, it's not going to be replicating

1921
01:23:01,639 --> 01:23:07,520
necessarily. Um, we have to remember

1922
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:08,960
though, it's not alive like the way we

1923
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:12,080
think of like a fungus or something

1924
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:14,639
being alive. Um, it's it's almost like a

1925
01:23:12,079 --> 01:23:18,079
toxin. It's like inert. So once it's if

1926
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:20,960
it's there, it just hangs out waiting to

1927
01:23:18,079 --> 01:23:22,559
be rehydrated and uptook by a living

1928
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:24,480
cell and then it just does its thing

1929
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:27,039
again. Um, so really what you're

1930
01:23:24,479 --> 01:23:29,119
fighting is how stable is this? How much

1931
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:31,119
thyroid is in my living soil? And how

1932
01:23:29,119 --> 01:23:33,359
long do I have to wait until it actually

1933
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:36,399
degrades? And the the answers to all of

1934
01:23:33,359 --> 01:23:38,158
those questions aren't known. Um, the

1935
01:23:36,399 --> 01:23:41,039
one thing that has been shown for a

1936
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:43,519
vyroid similar to hoplenyroid called hop

1937
01:23:41,039 --> 01:23:45,920
stunt vyroid is that it can be taken up

1938
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:48,639
by fungal pathogens and replicated

1939
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:50,960
inside of those. So um if there's like

1940
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:53,359
fuserium or maybe I mean we don't know

1941
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:55,439
all the pathogens or organisms this

1942
01:23:53,359 --> 01:23:57,759
could happen. They could even be like

1943
01:23:55,439 --> 01:23:59,919
you know indifitzer or you know other

1944
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:03,119
types of living things in the soil. They

1945
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:05,039
may take up the vyroid and keep it

1946
01:24:03,119 --> 01:24:06,840
replicating until you plant new things

1947
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:09,198
in there. So,

1948
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:12,480
um, it's really one of those things

1949
01:24:09,198 --> 01:24:14,238
like, you know, your living soil makes

1950
01:24:12,479 --> 01:24:15,919
your plants really awesome and you've

1951
01:24:14,238 --> 01:24:17,678
worked very difficult on it, but if

1952
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:20,800
there's something in there that is just

1953
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:24,239
going to make everything tank, then it

1954
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:25,920
it's not worth keeping cuz you know, you

1955
01:24:24,238 --> 01:24:28,319
you have it because they make your

1956
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:30,960
plants successful, but keeping the soil

1957
01:24:28,319 --> 01:24:33,840
at some point if it's infected works the

1958
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:36,359
opposite way.

1959
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:39,440
Yeah. I guess it's like

1960
01:24:36,359 --> 01:24:41,279
um if uh you know if you you invested

1961
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:43,678
all this time into it typically a lot of

1962
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:46,319
people when they've had you know a

1963
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:47,760
living soil bed for a couple years um

1964
01:24:46,319 --> 01:24:50,238
but that investment might not

1965
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:52,960
necessarily be worth uh the pains that

1966
01:24:50,238 --> 01:24:55,119
you will then face from hotlen fire or

1967
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:57,520
or fuserium or something along those

1968
01:24:55,119 --> 01:24:59,359
lines. Um, so that, you know, it's it's

1969
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:01,199
kind of one of those tough answers that

1970
01:24:59,359 --> 01:25:03,439
I feel like people do need to hear that

1971
01:25:01,198 --> 01:25:05,198
it it might just not be worth it. You

1972
01:25:03,439 --> 01:25:07,678
know, no matter how much time you let it

1973
01:25:05,198 --> 01:25:12,399
sit there, there's there's potentials

1974
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:15,520
and um opportunities for it to be an

1975
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:17,279
issue in the future. Um, so that's

1976
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,880
that's good. It is, like I said, it's

1977
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:20,800
that's that's a tough one though. I

1978
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:22,199
could only imagine having a whole

1979
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:25,679
facility go

1980
01:25:22,198 --> 01:25:27,279
down, you know, 100 light room all in

1981
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:30,079
living soil beds. That would be

1982
01:25:27,279 --> 01:25:31,840
devastating. Um, yeah. No, absolutely.

1983
01:25:30,079 --> 01:25:34,639
It's it's one of those really hard

1984
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:37,199
things to to mitigate, you know, and

1985
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:39,840
fuserium is worse to be honest. It in

1986
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:42,399
out in the field the spores can last

1987
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:45,520
like 3 to 5 years and if you're you're

1988
01:25:42,399 --> 01:25:48,238
in like a a more protected environment,

1989
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:50,880
it's they can last up to 10. So, it's

1990
01:25:48,238 --> 01:25:53,839
just it's just not something that you

1991
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:56,319
want to mess with. Um,

1992
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:59,279
so, wow. I did not know that they could

1993
01:25:56,319 --> 01:26:02,479
last 10 years in an indoor environment.

1994
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:04,399
That is frightening. It is. It's

1995
01:26:02,479 --> 01:26:06,319
terrifying. And that's why, you know, I

1996
01:26:04,399 --> 01:26:07,920
mean, hoping vibra is an insidious

1997
01:26:06,319 --> 01:26:09,759
pathogen. It can sneak into your grow.

1998
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:12,880
It can spread everywhere. But, um,

1999
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:14,960
fuserium is devastating. If if it really

2000
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:16,880
takes hold, it kills thing. It can kill

2001
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:19,039
an entire room in like a week. And the

2002
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:21,679
plants are just dead. And then they like

2003
01:26:19,039 --> 01:26:23,840
melt into the table. Exactly. And it

2004
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:25,440
it's it gets in the water system. It

2005
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:27,119
gets the growing media and it can go

2006
01:26:25,439 --> 01:26:31,039
airborne and then you're just looking

2007
01:26:27,119 --> 01:26:33,039
at, you know, like a nuclear option. So

2008
01:26:31,039 --> 01:26:35,039
you really want to test for that. You do

2009
01:26:33,039 --> 01:26:39,359
not want that to be in your facility or

2010
01:26:35,039 --> 01:26:41,198
your basement um at all. Awesome. Yeah,

2011
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:43,279
that's that I mean that's not awesome,

2012
01:26:41,198 --> 01:26:46,879
but it's awesome for people to know that

2013
01:26:43,279 --> 01:26:49,920
that is uh can be more devastating. Um

2014
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:52,079
you know it's it's kind of the unspoken

2015
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,679
vyroid that a lot of pe or uh pathogen

2016
01:26:52,079 --> 01:26:55,840
that people don't really talk about too

2017
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:57,600
much because when it does happen it is

2018
01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:00,199
just kind of like well I guess the

2019
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:03,199
game's over at this point.

2020
01:27:00,198 --> 01:27:06,000
Um, so, um, you know, we did touch

2021
01:27:03,198 --> 01:27:08,759
briefly on tissue culture before, uh,

2022
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:12,158
and how that can be an option to help,

2023
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:15,719
uh, either potentially remove, uh,

2024
01:27:12,158 --> 01:27:18,799
vyroids or other pathogens from a plant.

2025
01:27:15,719 --> 01:27:20,399
Um, but are there any other uh points on

2026
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:23,199
tissue culture that you feel like people

2027
01:27:20,399 --> 01:27:27,679
should be aware of? Um, do you want to

2028
01:27:23,198 --> 01:27:29,439
take that? Um well specifically

2029
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:30,679
especially like remembering that it's

2030
01:27:29,439 --> 01:27:34,599
not

2031
01:27:30,679 --> 01:27:38,239
100% that it doesn't work like that and

2032
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:41,400
um it could it could be expensive

2033
01:27:38,238 --> 01:27:43,919
uh to do that if you have several

2034
01:27:41,399 --> 01:27:46,920
genetics strains that you have to clean

2035
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,920
up.

2036
01:27:47,039 --> 01:27:55,519
But also it does it does work in the in

2037
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:59,880
other crops I guess protected like in

2038
01:27:55,520 --> 01:28:02,800
similar to in grown in green houses

2039
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:06,880
um they they use it successfully there

2040
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:10,800
and uh but I'm sure that it is attached

2041
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:14,480
to a testing protocol. So like the

2042
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:17,920
tissue culture has to be tested for sure

2043
01:28:14,479 --> 01:28:21,359
to know that the the the culturing of

2044
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:23,199
those cells was successful without any

2045
01:28:21,359 --> 01:28:25,839
pathogens.

2046
01:28:23,198 --> 01:28:27,839
For sure. Um I do I do like that there

2047
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:30,719
are a lot of practices within tissue

2048
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:33,279
culture that um within aseptic technique

2049
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:36,158
that kind of allow for you to help

2050
01:28:33,279 --> 01:28:38,719
mitigate the transfer of pathogens. um

2051
01:28:36,158 --> 01:28:41,039
like even within like let's say you have

2052
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:44,000
something in tissue culture that does

2053
01:28:41,039 --> 01:28:47,198
carry a pathogen with it um you have a

2054
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:49,679
lot more fail safes and uh and stops in

2055
01:28:47,198 --> 01:28:52,799
place to help prevent the transfer of it

2056
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:54,719
to other uh tissue culture that you're

2057
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:58,000
working with at the time. And then if

2058
01:28:54,719 --> 01:29:00,960
you can prove that you have no pathogen

2059
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:03,520
or vyroid in that uh in that plant

2060
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:06,158
tissue, then you can proliferate it from

2061
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:09,199
that small amount of plant matter into a

2062
01:29:06,158 --> 01:29:12,000
much larger population to then help um

2063
01:29:09,198 --> 01:29:15,759
provide that genetic uh cultivar to

2064
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:17,600
other people um in a very safe way as

2065
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:19,280
long as it's, you know, not entering a

2066
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:21,360
facility that already has a bunch of

2067
01:29:19,279 --> 01:29:23,719
these problems and isn't going through

2068
01:29:21,359 --> 01:29:26,719
some sort of quarantine phase.

2069
01:29:23,719 --> 01:29:28,800
Um it I I think that tissue culture has

2070
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:30,960
a lot of potential uh at least

2071
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:33,800
especially within pathogen prevention

2072
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:35,679
and um

2073
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:37,199
remediation. Well, you know, this has

2074
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:39,840
been a wonderful conversation, guys, and

2075
01:29:37,198 --> 01:29:41,678
I feel like uh we we've gotten a lot of

2076
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,600
information out there to people that

2077
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:45,840
they can kind of make actionable within

2078
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:48,639
their own gardens, which is very

2079
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:51,480
important to me. Um, but I do like to

2080
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:54,319
kind of wrap these up uh as a cannabis

2081
01:29:51,479 --> 01:29:57,759
podcast with a little bit more cannabis

2082
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:59,920
focused questions. So, um, quick

2083
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:02,880
question. Do either of you currently use

2084
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:05,600
cannabis?

2085
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:07,760
I I I tend to be more the edible type,

2086
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:10,320
but um, sure. Oh, well, I mean, edibles

2087
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:13,159
are still, you know, a form of cannabis,

2088
01:30:10,319 --> 01:30:15,920
I feel like. But, um, you know,

2089
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:18,638
I, as someone who is also a user of

2090
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:20,560
cannabis, I feel like there's a lot of

2091
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:22,480
there's still a lot of stigma within the

2092
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:25,520
professional world of people using

2093
01:30:22,479 --> 01:30:28,238
cannabis and incorporating it into their

2094
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:30,239
professional lives successfully. But um

2095
01:30:28,238 --> 01:30:32,799
Alonso, like even with what you said

2096
01:30:30,238 --> 01:30:36,158
earlier, it was almost cannabis that

2097
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:38,079
allowed you to um develop all these

2098
01:30:36,158 --> 01:30:41,279
different skills because you were able

2099
01:30:38,079 --> 01:30:43,039
to finally sit down and open a book and

2100
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:44,279
you know have the attention span. Yeah.

2101
01:30:43,039 --> 01:30:49,198
The

2102
01:30:44,279 --> 01:30:51,519
stigma that society has created that if

2103
01:30:49,198 --> 01:30:54,879
you smoke cannabis you you you must be

2104
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:57,360
lazy or unproductive or unsuccessful.

2105
01:30:54,880 --> 01:31:00,719
But I think that's a misunderstanding

2106
01:30:57,359 --> 01:31:05,599
and that's not true. It's just probably

2107
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:10,319
something that came out in the dark ages

2108
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:12,560
to you know bring down cannabis and all

2109
01:31:10,319 --> 01:31:13,639
these manipulations that the government

2110
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:17,920
have done

2111
01:31:13,639 --> 01:31:20,480
or you know I agree wholeheartedly. I

2112
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:22,719
mean I um I think it's so important to

2113
01:31:20,479 --> 01:31:25,119
show that uh professionals you know of

2114
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:27,600
your caliber both of you being doctors

2115
01:31:25,119 --> 01:31:31,119
are pro cannabis that's something that I

2116
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:32,960
feel like uh it opens up the door to

2117
01:31:31,119 --> 01:31:35,198
more people who want to enter the

2118
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:39,198
different STEM fields but might think

2119
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:42,279
that their passion for cannabis or um

2120
01:31:39,198 --> 01:31:45,439
you know other other illicits

2121
01:31:42,279 --> 01:31:48,479
like magic mushrooms for example and how

2122
01:31:45,439 --> 01:31:50,638
many potential um benefits there are to

2123
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:53,519
the different alkaloid components within

2124
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:54,960
mushrooms. Um you know and and then with

2125
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:56,400
cannabis it you know people think that

2126
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:58,560
that's their barrier to entry that

2127
01:31:56,399 --> 01:32:00,238
that's what they want to study um or

2128
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:02,080
that they want to make sure that that's

2129
01:32:00,238 --> 01:32:04,959
continuing to be incorporated in their

2130
01:32:02,079 --> 01:32:06,719
life whether it be through a a medical

2131
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:09,679
application or a recreational

2132
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:11,840
application. I mean, no one tests you if

2133
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:13,920
you drank alcohol the night before when

2134
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:16,360
you come in to work the next day, but

2135
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:19,119
that can be devastating for a heavy

2136
01:32:16,359 --> 01:32:21,839
workload. You're going to come in and be

2137
01:32:19,119 --> 01:32:23,840
more fuzzy and hazy and uh with less

2138
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:25,840
ability to do things than if you smoked

2139
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:28,880
a nice joint the night before. Yeah. But

2140
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:32,000
I I would like to add that cannabis

2141
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:33,719
research is is in infancy, like it's

2142
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:38,800
just starting.

2143
01:32:33,719 --> 01:32:41,760
And if smoking cannabis uh does not give

2144
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:44,639
you this effect that it doesn't make you

2145
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:47,119
like productive or it it takes you the

2146
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:50,079
other way, maybe cannabis is not for

2147
01:32:47,119 --> 01:32:53,319
you. There's different diseases out

2148
01:32:50,079 --> 01:32:57,679
there that are coming out that are

2149
01:32:53,319 --> 01:33:00,079
potentially death threatening that that

2150
01:32:57,679 --> 01:33:02,000
people are not aware. And it's just like

2151
01:33:00,079 --> 01:33:04,639
it's just depending on your genetics.

2152
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:08,319
Not everybody is get affected by it

2153
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:11,800
because as we all know we we are our

2154
01:33:08,319 --> 01:33:15,719
cells are covering these receptors for

2155
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:19,360
canabonoids and it might be that your

2156
01:33:15,719 --> 01:33:22,319
genetic makeup is not conducive to that

2157
01:33:19,359 --> 01:33:23,679
and you should be aware of that too.

2158
01:33:22,319 --> 01:33:27,840
Sure. I mean there's even things like

2159
01:33:23,679 --> 01:33:29,679
the cannabis hyperis syndrome um where

2160
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:33,760
that can be devastating to someone's

2161
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:36,079
entire life and uh it it is all as far

2162
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:40,639
as we know up to this point cannabis

2163
01:33:36,079 --> 01:33:42,840
induced and um related. So it

2164
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:45,440
I absolutely agree. I mean, just like

2165
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:47,279
with anything else in life, some people

2166
01:33:45,439 --> 01:33:49,119
have a tolerance for it and some people

2167
01:33:47,279 --> 01:33:50,479
don't. And some people can, you know,

2168
01:33:49,119 --> 01:33:53,760
some people can be functioning

2169
01:33:50,479 --> 01:33:57,198
alcoholics and and do amazing work while

2170
01:33:53,760 --> 01:34:01,440
completely uh you know, at the bottom of

2171
01:33:57,198 --> 01:34:04,638
the of the barrel. Um, and so it it is

2172
01:34:01,439 --> 01:34:06,238
very much independent uh or subjective

2173
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:09,359
in in a sense where you need to make

2174
01:34:06,238 --> 01:34:11,599
sure that you can handle it. Yeah. I'm

2175
01:34:09,359 --> 01:34:13,679
sorry, say that again. be careful and be

2176
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:17,000
smart. I'm saying to the people that

2177
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:21,199
want to use cannabis and

2178
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:24,000
and in in in or or want to or want to

2179
01:34:21,198 --> 01:34:26,319
follow what I'm saying it is like what

2180
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:29,439
my life experience was like that but I

2181
01:34:26,319 --> 01:34:32,639
do have friends that is the opposite and

2182
01:34:29,439 --> 01:34:35,839
sure and and you have to learn to listen

2183
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:38,639
to your body and what is it telling you.

2184
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:40,880
Sure. And because cannabis is also, you

2185
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:42,880
know, it's not a it's not an aspirin and

2186
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:44,880
it's not um like a typical

2187
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:47,440
pharmaceutical where there's one

2188
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:50,159
component that's the active ingredient

2189
01:34:47,439 --> 01:34:52,960
that's going to have a very universal

2190
01:34:50,158 --> 01:34:54,559
response across most humans. Where

2191
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:57,039
cannabis, you know, it has different

2192
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:59,960
tarpin profiles, different cannabonoid

2193
01:34:57,039 --> 01:35:03,039
profiles, uh other volatile organic

2194
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:06,800
compounds. Um, and all of those kind of

2195
01:35:03,039 --> 01:35:09,198
play together and uh can cause vastly

2196
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:10,560
different responses. It's sort of why so

2197
01:35:09,198 --> 01:35:12,719
many people say, you know, they love

2198
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:15,840
cannabis because variety is the spice of

2199
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:18,079
life and they can have a huge variety of

2200
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:20,719
different experiences all from

2201
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:22,479
technically this the same plant. Um,

2202
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:24,840
just different different genetic

2203
01:35:22,479 --> 01:35:27,039
expressions within that plant.

2204
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:29,920
Um so yeah I think that that's a very

2205
01:35:27,039 --> 01:35:32,119
good point to bring up that it it's not

2206
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:34,719
a universal

2207
01:35:32,119 --> 01:35:37,920
uh you know we we shouldn't put it in a

2208
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:40,560
good bad dichconomy. Uh it it is uh very

2209
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:42,719
much uh very much subjective and

2210
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:45,440
everyone can have a unique experience

2211
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:47,840
using cannabis.

2212
01:35:45,439 --> 01:35:51,119
Um so you know just a couple more

2213
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:53,199
questions for you guys but um and and

2214
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:56,399
take this one in whichever way you want.

2215
01:35:53,198 --> 01:35:58,960
uh Alfonso, you uh having grown cannabis

2216
01:35:56,399 --> 01:36:01,519
and Tessa, you having researched plenty

2217
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:03,600
of cannabis, but is there a favorite

2218
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:06,080
cultivar that either of you have

2219
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:08,960
encountered either uh through research

2220
01:36:06,079 --> 01:36:10,880
where maybe it is just, you know, it it

2221
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:13,760
never catches hops and thyroid or it

2222
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:16,560
never has an issue if it does have it or

2223
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:18,880
maybe through the growth characteristics

2224
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:21,679
of how it grows. Um, if there's

2225
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:25,840
something that you find extremely

2226
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:30,158
uh favorable for your own desires.

2227
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:32,639
Yeah, I I I prefer the old school what

2228
01:36:30,158 --> 01:36:34,879
they people call the old school strains.

2229
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:38,400
Old the OG strains. Yeah. Like the

2230
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:41,119
Northern Lights number five or AK-47.

2231
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:43,119
Those are my favorite. But but recently,

2232
01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:46,880
not that long ago, I brought uh some

2233
01:36:43,119 --> 01:36:50,719
seats um from back home.

2234
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:54,159
um some some land races that grow in the

2235
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:57,158
mountains of Peru. And I actually love

2236
01:36:54,158 --> 01:37:01,039
it. It is kind of

2237
01:36:57,158 --> 01:37:04,079
um similar to having a glass of wine.

2238
01:37:01,039 --> 01:37:07,118
It's not like very potent like in the

2239
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:11,039
THC kind of probably probably one to one

2240
01:37:07,118 --> 01:37:12,819
THC CBD probably one of those things. Uh

2241
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:14,519
very mellow and

2242
01:37:12,819 --> 01:37:17,599
[Music]

2243
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:20,800
very active. you you you want to do

2244
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:22,880
things. You you you want to get the next

2245
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:26,480
thing done, the next thing done. And

2246
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:28,960
yeah, I really like like land races is

2247
01:37:26,479 --> 01:37:31,599
strange. It's just the flowering time is

2248
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:36,560
like 95 days or something like Oh my

2249
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:40,079
god. But that's crazy. Yeah. But I I I

2250
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:42,000
love that. like I I I'm not a very I

2251
01:37:40,079 --> 01:37:44,359
don't like the the strains that are high

2252
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:47,960
in in THC

2253
01:37:44,359 --> 01:37:52,399
or I prefer the the the other

2254
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:54,158
way. I'm just getting older. So, no, I I

2255
01:37:52,399 --> 01:37:55,920
think that it it has a lot of benefit

2256
01:37:54,158 --> 01:37:59,839
for people, especially when you do find

2257
01:37:55,920 --> 01:38:01,600
like a true onetoone uh THC CBD. Those

2258
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:05,520
tend to work really well for people that

2259
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:08,079
have like high anxiety or um you know,

2260
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:09,920
the their attention span might need to

2261
01:38:08,079 --> 01:38:12,000
be, you know, tweaked in one way or the

2262
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:14,639
other. Um I feel like those always tend

2263
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,399
to work fairly well for people. Um but

2264
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:19,199
you you know you can never really find a

2265
01:38:16,399 --> 01:38:21,759
95day cultivar on the commercial market

2266
01:38:19,198 --> 01:38:24,000
because it would be um you can't charge

2267
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:26,480
more for something that you grow longer,

2268
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:28,560
right? It's uh and so it then becomes

2269
01:38:26,479 --> 01:38:30,638
that much more expensive to create that

2270
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:32,560
final product. So I always say for home

2271
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:34,800
growers, they should absolutely try

2272
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:37,600
growing out um something that's like an

2273
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:39,760
equatorial strain because they will

2274
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:41,119
never experience that to its fullest

2275
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:48,800
potential unless they grow it

2276
01:38:41,118 --> 01:38:52,279
themselves. Um and uh and so Tassa um uh

2277
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:56,000
yeah so I your your favorite cultivar.

2278
01:38:52,279 --> 01:38:58,238
Yeah. Um to smoke um I don't have as

2279
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,840
many cultivars in my pocket as Alonso

2280
01:38:58,238 --> 01:39:01,678
here. I actually don't know anyone that

2281
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:04,960
has as many cultivars in this pocket as

2282
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:07,279
him. But um um I tend to favor the ones

2283
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:09,840
grown outside. I haven't read any of

2284
01:39:07,279 --> 01:39:11,759
that literature and I don't understand

2285
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:15,119
like why that is um or what the

2286
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:17,280
scientific basis of it is, but um um

2287
01:39:15,118 --> 01:39:19,519
they tend to make me less anxious. Um

2288
01:39:17,279 --> 01:39:23,920
and I also prefer the ones where there's

2289
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:26,719
a little bit less THC. Um I and then the

2290
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:28,239
you know I take gummies sometimes um if

2291
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:30,639
I like like my brain is spinning at

2292
01:39:28,238 --> 01:39:32,718
night and I can't sleep. Um, and they've

2293
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:34,560
actually been like gamechanging for me

2294
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:35,920
cuz you know if you take a benadryil or

2295
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:38,239
something, the next day it's like

2296
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:41,679
somebody hit you in the head with a 2x4

2297
01:39:38,238 --> 01:39:44,238
for like hours. Um, but you know, you

2298
01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:45,600
can take a gummy and um, the next day

2299
01:39:44,238 --> 01:39:47,118
you just fall asleep great and the next

2300
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:49,039
day you wake up and you're just feeling

2301
01:39:47,118 --> 01:39:51,118
good and you're ready for the day. And

2302
01:39:49,039 --> 01:39:52,479
um you know to me it's it's phenomenal

2303
01:39:51,118 --> 01:39:55,118
that there's a stigma around that

2304
01:39:52,479 --> 01:39:56,959
because it's just so much more gentle um

2305
01:39:55,118 --> 01:39:58,639
and effective than all the stuff that

2306
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:00,158
you could get at the doctors if you're

2307
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:01,679
like oh I can't fall asleep. They're

2308
01:40:00,158 --> 01:40:03,359
like you know here's an ambient and

2309
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:05,239
you're just I can't remember what I did

2310
01:40:03,359 --> 01:40:08,880
last night.

2311
01:40:05,238 --> 01:40:11,678
Well, um but yeah, and then um from the

2312
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:13,920
science side, um I don't remember all of

2313
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:16,639
the strains, but I do remember one

2314
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:18,560
specific one called Motorhead, um that

2315
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:21,520
we had an incredibly difficult time

2316
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:23,679
infecting with hot plate and vyroid. Um

2317
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:27,280
you know, it it it built the level super

2318
01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:30,000
low. you know, we I think we inoculated

2319
01:40:27,279 --> 01:40:33,198
15 clones and something like two of them

2320
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:36,158
had a very very low almost undetectable

2321
01:40:33,198 --> 01:40:38,000
level and it took like entire flowering

2322
01:40:36,158 --> 01:40:39,839
um time frame in order for it to build

2323
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,319
up enough vyroid you know for it to be

2324
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:44,960
like a reasonable level. So, um, from

2325
01:40:42,319 --> 01:40:47,039
the science side, like that one was a

2326
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:50,079
pretty good one. When it comes to, uh,

2327
01:40:47,039 --> 01:40:53,039
resist or, yes, to resistance, um,

2328
01:40:50,079 --> 01:40:55,439
tolerance, Illuminati tended to be it

2329
01:40:53,039 --> 01:40:57,198
would it it got infected like that and

2330
01:40:55,439 --> 01:40:59,759
built up a super high load, but it did

2331
01:40:57,198 --> 01:41:02,319
not show any symptoms. Um, wow. That

2332
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:04,880
would be your your Trojan horse strain

2333
01:41:02,319 --> 01:41:06,799
to watch out for. Now, I will qualify

2334
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:09,359
that with that was that specific

2335
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:12,320
motorhead and that specific Illuminati.

2336
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:13,839
And as we all know, you could go and buy

2337
01:41:12,319 --> 01:41:17,198
those strains and they may behave

2338
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:18,800
completely differently because um they

2339
01:41:17,198 --> 01:41:20,638
have the same name, but genetically

2340
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:23,039
they're not, you know, the same plant.

2341
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:25,039
And so do be careful. For sure. Yeah.

2342
01:41:23,039 --> 01:41:27,279
There's a a lot of I feel like uh

2343
01:41:25,039 --> 01:41:29,519
confusion through the way that seeds are

2344
01:41:27,279 --> 01:41:32,158
marketed within the cannabis industry.

2345
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:33,679
And um so usually when I refer to like a

2346
01:41:32,158 --> 01:41:35,638
single plant, I'll refer to it as a

2347
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:39,039
cultivar like with uh normal

2348
01:41:35,639 --> 01:41:42,400
agriculture. And um then a seed would be

2349
01:41:39,039 --> 01:41:46,319
like a genetics, right? Or or or a cross

2350
01:41:42,399 --> 01:41:49,839
or a uh um a strain perhaps uh if you

2351
01:41:46,319 --> 01:41:52,158
want to go down that path. But um yeah,

2352
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:55,600
I feel like that's that's good

2353
01:41:52,158 --> 01:41:57,679
information to have people, you know, it

2354
01:41:55,600 --> 01:42:00,560
the fact that there are the abilities

2355
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:02,399
for plants to com completely almost like

2356
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:05,600
ignore the fact that the vyroid's even

2357
01:42:02,399 --> 01:42:08,399
present and uh uptakeable by the plant.

2358
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:10,480
It'll be nope. I'm don't really care to

2359
01:42:08,399 --> 01:42:12,960
have that whatever mechanism of action

2360
01:42:10,479 --> 01:42:15,279
it is that's causing it to not be

2361
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:16,960
uptook. That's just very special in and

2362
01:42:15,279 --> 01:42:19,198
of itself. And then also the fact that

2363
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:21,279
you can have a ridiculously high

2364
01:42:19,198 --> 01:42:23,439
threshold of viral pres or vyroid

2365
01:42:21,279 --> 01:42:25,599
presence within the the tissue and that

2366
01:42:23,439 --> 01:42:28,559
it just doesn't even affect the

2367
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:32,000
flowering time or the the yield or um

2368
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:34,480
the final product. That's amazing. Um,

2369
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:36,639
yeah, it's a very it's very cool and

2370
01:42:34,479 --> 01:42:38,799
it's it's a place of super interesting

2371
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:41,600
research because if you could figure out

2372
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:43,279
the gene or genes that keep the vyroid

2373
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:44,800
that that are that are involved in

2374
01:42:43,279 --> 01:42:47,840
transmitting it around the plant like

2375
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:49,920
the transport or the replication then

2376
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:52,400
you know maybe you can breathe that in

2377
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:54,000
to the strains that you like and just

2378
01:42:52,399 --> 01:42:56,238
kind of create a bunch of resistant

2379
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:59,039
things. So, it's definitely something

2380
01:42:56,238 --> 01:43:00,479
that, you know, if I had like clones of

2381
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:03,039
myself, I would be doing those

2382
01:43:00,479 --> 01:43:05,359
experiments all the time,

2383
01:43:03,039 --> 01:43:07,198
for sure. Um, all right. And then last

2384
01:43:05,359 --> 01:43:10,039
question for both of you. Uh, what is

2385
01:43:07,198 --> 01:43:12,238
your most memorable cannabis related

2386
01:43:10,039 --> 01:43:14,880
experience, whether it be something in

2387
01:43:12,238 --> 01:43:19,118
the lab or even a a personal use

2388
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:23,118
experience or or otherwise? Uh,

2389
01:43:19,118 --> 01:43:24,719
um, that's a hard question. Yeah, it's

2390
01:43:23,118 --> 01:43:26,079
you know I I figured it would be kind of

2391
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:29,079
one of the harder questions that I

2392
01:43:26,079 --> 01:43:29,079
asked.

2393
01:43:29,359 --> 01:43:34,880
Lucky maybe you can start. I can think.

2394
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:37,118
Um yeah, I mean I guess you know I

2395
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:39,920
honestly like from the lab standpoint

2396
01:43:37,118 --> 01:43:44,238
the most the most memorable one was

2397
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:45,920
after you know two months of frustration

2398
01:43:44,238 --> 01:43:47,839
being like boy where I've designed

2399
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:50,000
hundreds of PCRs like what's wrong with

2400
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:52,400
me? realizing that the plants we have at

2401
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:54,000
home are actually positive and that's

2402
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:55,759
why we can't get the test to work and

2403
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:59,359
that's why the weed sucked for so many

2404
01:43:55,760 --> 01:44:01,840
years was um pretty pretty memorable

2405
01:43:59,359 --> 01:44:03,359
from a science standpoint um and kind of

2406
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:04,880
cool in a sense because you're like oh

2407
01:44:03,359 --> 01:44:07,118
my god how many people are struggling

2408
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:09,359
with the same problem we are and you

2409
01:44:07,118 --> 01:44:12,719
know we're scientists we had no idea

2410
01:44:09,359 --> 01:44:14,799
that this was even there um you know and

2411
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:18,319
then from a personal standpoint you know

2412
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:20,320
I guess I we I'm probably one of those

2413
01:44:18,319 --> 01:44:22,719
people that Alfonso cautions about when

2414
01:44:20,319 --> 01:44:24,399
it comes to smoking cuz um I definitely

2415
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:27,439
can't have a big joint and go to the lab

2416
01:44:24,399 --> 01:44:28,879
that I would maybe I'd have fun but I

2417
01:44:27,439 --> 01:44:31,279
don't think smart would come out of me

2418
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:32,880
at all. Um you know and there's

2419
01:44:31,279 --> 01:44:35,118
definitely strains that I have to be

2420
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:37,359
careful with because I get you know

2421
01:44:35,118 --> 01:44:38,960
anxious or freak out or you know so

2422
01:44:37,359 --> 01:44:42,559
those are those are memories. Maybe

2423
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:44,719
they're not good ones per se, but um um

2424
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:46,639
but I, you know, did the discovery of

2425
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:48,719
edibles and being able to fall asleep at

2426
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:50,800
night when I'm feeling anxious and just

2427
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:52,639
having that just I mean get like the

2428
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:54,400
medicinal like I don't get high or

2429
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:57,279
anything. I just fall asleep and then

2430
01:44:54,399 --> 01:44:59,519
the next day is pleasant for me. Like um

2431
01:44:57,279 --> 01:45:02,559
it's been a huge thing for me in my life

2432
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:04,960
and and I'm I'm glad to be alive at a

2433
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:07,199
time when I could use that legally to

2434
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:08,960
feel better. So that's awesome. Yeah.

2435
01:45:07,198 --> 01:45:10,198
For me, I don't have a specific thing

2436
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:14,079
that I could

2437
01:45:10,198 --> 01:45:18,079
remember. Uh, but I do like the social

2438
01:45:14,079 --> 01:45:20,319
aspect of cannabis that um it doesn't

2439
01:45:18,079 --> 01:45:25,359
matter if you talk English or whatever

2440
01:45:20,319 --> 01:45:28,158
language or whatever background or race

2441
01:45:25,359 --> 01:45:30,880
or religion you are. You just smoking a

2442
01:45:28,158 --> 01:45:33,638
joint together. you're like um it's kind

2443
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:38,639
of like feels connected

2444
01:45:33,639 --> 01:45:41,000
and you share things and I don't know

2445
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:44,039
it's something like

2446
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:48,319
brings you humble and

2447
01:45:44,039 --> 01:45:51,279
uh listen listening and understanding

2448
01:45:48,319 --> 01:45:55,679
other opinions and I think it's the

2449
01:45:51,279 --> 01:45:58,559
social aspect for me is is something big

2450
01:45:55,679 --> 01:46:01,600
for sure. Yeah. sharing a a joint or

2451
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:03,360
something is a great equalizer um across

2452
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:07,440
all different barriers that you might

2453
01:46:03,359 --> 01:46:09,679
face otherwise um social or economic or

2454
01:46:07,439 --> 01:46:13,118
status based. You know, if you light up

2455
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:15,600
a nice joint and people smell it and uh

2456
01:46:13,118 --> 01:46:19,198
and u want to hang out and smoke, it's

2457
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:21,679
it's easy. And then you like talking and

2458
01:46:19,198 --> 01:46:23,198
and you get to know this person and

2459
01:46:21,679 --> 01:46:24,600
where they coming from, their

2460
01:46:23,198 --> 01:46:27,638
experiences

2461
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:31,600
and it is great. It

2462
01:46:27,639 --> 01:46:34,719
is equality for you know for

2463
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:37,320
for everyone. Oh I love it. Well again

2464
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:40,239
guys this has been a wonderful uh

2465
01:46:37,319 --> 01:46:42,319
conversation uh Tessa Alons. So I really

2466
01:46:40,238 --> 01:46:45,439
appreciate your time. I know that you go

2467
01:46:42,319 --> 01:46:47,679
both are probably extremely busy um with

2468
01:46:45,439 --> 01:46:50,158
how many different grows and operations

2469
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:52,399
you must be serving at this point, but

2470
01:46:50,158 --> 01:46:55,359
um yeah, this has been great. And you

2471
01:46:52,399 --> 01:46:59,439
know, this this podcast uh is designed

2472
01:46:55,359 --> 01:47:01,439
to help people learn new processes uh or

2473
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:03,439
help perfect other processes that they

2474
01:47:01,439 --> 01:47:05,678
have. And I feel like we've provided a

2475
01:47:03,439 --> 01:47:09,519
lot of information today that will allow

2476
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:11,679
them to take a look at uh some of the

2477
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:14,960
the cultural practices of their grow

2478
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:17,440
operation and potentially prevent

2479
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:19,920
massive issues from arising in the

2480
01:47:17,439 --> 01:47:21,439
future. As well as, you know, maybe take

2481
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:23,840
that first step and get some of their

2482
01:47:21,439 --> 01:47:25,519
plants tested that they haven't uh been

2483
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:29,159
doing yet and kind of been putting off

2484
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:32,560
because of uh financial or um

2485
01:47:29,158 --> 01:47:34,638
stubbornness or otherwise. Um, so yeah,

2486
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:36,880
this has been great and uh I really

2487
01:47:34,639 --> 01:47:38,560
appreciate your time. Of course. Yeah.

2488
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:42,239
No, absolutely. Thank you so much for

2489
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:44,719
having us on. It was Thanks very much.

2490
01:47:42,238 --> 01:47:45,919
Awesome. Always a pleasure to share. Y

2491
01:47:44,719 --> 01:47:47,840
All right. Well, you know, getting this

2492
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:50,399
information out there, uh, like I like

2493
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:52,800
to say is how we grow the community and

2494
01:47:50,399 --> 01:47:55,859
that's the way we grow. So again, thank

2495
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:57,400
you guys. Thank you. All right. Byebye.
