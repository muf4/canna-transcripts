00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:23,198
What's up everybody? is Gabby Staten

3
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:26,359
Island on the Craft Growers Network. And

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:30,000
of course, we're joined by my co-hosts

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:33,359
Cosmic and Sasha, the Slovenian Hobbit.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And today, our guest is JJ Edwards from

7
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:40,159
Top Dog Seeds. Um, we've done a few

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,159
episodes regarding the sour, including

9
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:46,078
with Klopp, and it was definitely

10
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:49,038
something that was high on my list is to

11
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,719
have a conversation with JJ because he

12
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,039
was extremely relevant to the sour

13
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,439
story. As a matter of fact, far more

14
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,920
relevant than I am. You know, people

15
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,920
generally or regularly say, "Hey, Gabby,

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,719
I want to thank you for your involvement

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,519
in the sour." And I tell them I really

18
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:10,079
had nothing to do with it. I mean, I was

19
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:12,560
living on the West Coast and, you know,

20
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,200
we got the sour cuts out here and, you

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,400
know, I've grown a lot of sour, more

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,600
sour than than most people, I think. But

23
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:25,159
JJ was in the heart of the sour scene in

24
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:29,519
New York. He used to do business with

25
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:32,320
KOP. And so, um, really nice to have you

26
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:35,920
finally, JJ, and tell us your weed

27
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:39,039
story. No, I I appreciate it. And, um, I

28
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,960
don't deserve all those accolades. Um, I

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,880
was, well, I didn't say you were cool or

30
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,399
anything. I just said you were relevant.

31
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,640
You know, I was, you know, I was lucky

32
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,159
enough to be, you know, in the right

33
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,799
place at the right time. And um you know

34
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,520
and really a lot of those accolades go

35
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,640
to some of the other people that that

36
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:01,280
created the the Sour Diesel like you

37
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,920
know Klopp was part of it and you know

38
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,840
AJ had a big part of the you know the

39
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,878
distribution and getting the the

40
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,640
popularity out there. So you know I I

41
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:14,799
was just one of those people that were

42
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,479
kind of along along for the ride. But um

43
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,599
you know just I guess you know starting

44
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:21,840
from you know the beginning um you know

45
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:25,679
I you know I started first I first

46
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:30,239
smoked weed when I was 13 and I think

47
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,840
that was like in 1979 and it was I think

48
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,878
it was like a it was a snowy

49
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:40,159
uh Christmas day actually and we used to

50
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:43,518
go out shoveling snow to make money and

51
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:45,680
me and my neighbor and so We, you know,

52
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,400
it had snowed. We, you know, got our

53
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,519
shovels. We went out. We're going to

54
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,000
shovel some, uh, driveways and sidewalks

55
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,560
and, um, he pulled out a joint. You

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,400
know, he had some older brothers and I

57
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,598
guess he had gotten a joint from them.

58
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,480
And, you know, we were in the woods and

59
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:07,439
we smoked it. And that was basically,

60
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:09,158
you know, my first experience with it. I

61
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:13,680
was probably in seventh grade at the

62
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:16,239
time. And um so you know you know

63
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,519
growing up in middle school I probably

64
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,120
you know had a couple more

65
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,759
experiences with weed but it wasn't

66
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,239
really a a regular thing for me until I

67
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:29,120
hit high school. And you know when we

68
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,120
hit high school you know it was kind of

69
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,959
turned into an everyday thing. There was

70
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,840
people smoking. There were people

71
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,158
selling uh loose joints for a dollar

72
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,799
back then if you if you could believe

73
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:44,120
that. You know, people used to just uh

74
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,760
take a a marbor box, fill it up with

75
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:50,400
joints, bring it, you know, into, you

76
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,239
know, the school in the beginning of

77
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,879
school and you would be able, you know,

78
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,039
we had a smoking

79
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:58,959
section on grounds and so everyone would

80
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,679
smoke their cigarettes and we smoked our

81
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,158
weed there, too. So that's where, you

82
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,519
know, pretty much going up through high

83
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:09,598
school, I um, you know, when you're when

84
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,360
you're smoking and buying weed, you're

85
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,479
actually starting to sell it to your

86
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,000
friends and stuff. So like

87
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:17,918
unknowingly, you kind of just start into

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,439
the business if you're buying it and

89
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,399
your friend is like, "Oh, sell me

90
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,639
something five or $10 worth."

91
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,959
you know, and then before you know it,

92
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,519
you're kind of wheeling and dealing a

93
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:31,839
little bit, making trying to make free

94
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,680
weed basically back then, you know, and

95
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:37,279
so, you know, that was really my first

96
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,319
experiences really, you know, getting

97
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:43,959
coming up through high school. um you

98
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:47,519
know experiencing kind of the the

99
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:50,000
late7s you know early 80 well I would I

100
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:53,120
would describe the late7s as kind of the

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,839
chich and chong era and it kind of was

102
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,319
kind of the Panama

103
00:04:54,839 --> 00:05:00,799
reds you know the poker golds the

104
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:04,159
Colombian golds

105
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,840
um and you were getting that as a kid um

106
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:12,520
I no I I had gotten the Colombian gold

107
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:15,839
one time and it was this really bright

108
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:18,719
gold kind of sativa.

109
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,638
Um, it was kind of grassy the way that

110
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,960
it looked almost, you know, but it

111
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,000
wasn't really loose, but it was it was

112
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:28,959
kind of loose but not super

113
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,199
loose, but you know, and my friend's

114
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:34,799
brother who was older, you know, we had

115
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,360
split um we split an ounce and we got a

116
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,840
half ounce each of it. And, you know, at

117
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,080
the time it wasn't he didn't say it was

118
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,758
gold or anything like that, but we I was

119
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:47,279
like, man, I've never seen weed like

120
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:50,240
this before. And then, you know, looking

121
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:54,719
at pictures of the real stuff, you know,

122
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:57,199
I recognized it right away. And uh so I

123
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,600
was really too young to really like

124
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,400
remember I was it was probably more

125
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,879
sativa uppidity high. I don't remember

126
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,839
it really being that devastating or

127
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:10,038
anything like that, but I was probably

128
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:13,439
too young to really

129
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:16,478
um recognize the the effects and the

130
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:20,000
specialness of it. you know, and so we

131
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:22,879
used to get some good tie back then, uh,

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,839
the Hawaiian, but really, you know,

133
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:30,319
leading up until, you know, I would say

134
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:31,918
81,82, everything was strictly import.

135
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:36,160
So, we would always just see the

136
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:38,240
Mexicans and the and the Colombians and

137
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,080
Jamaicans basically, you know, and the

138
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,439
ties would, you know, rarely come in.

139
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:48,240
But uh but then there was you know the

140
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:50,160
that's when the the real centy bud came

141
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,038
out and we called it the Christmas tree

142
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,840
bud and it was just this the the green

143
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:59,038
centy bud that came out of Cali. I guess

144
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:02,239
it was pretty much uh outdoor light

145
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:05,759
depth looking back at it. Um you know

146
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,960
had a little bit of a sativa twist to it

147
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:12,080
very piny and stuff. So, that was pretty

148
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:15,000
much like the first kind of kind bud, if

149
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,959
you want to call it that, uh, that I

150
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
experienced. Uh, other than the

151
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:22,399
Hawaiian, the Hawaiian bud would come in

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,959
and I remember that. Well, both both of

153
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:27,519
both of them were back then was 200

154
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:31,680
bucks an ounce. And so we're we're

155
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:34,959
talking early 80s and um compared to

156
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,879
like you can get an ounce of Mexican or

157
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:40,478
so for 40 bucks or 30 bucks. So that was

158
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:45,360
you know it was quite a big difference

159
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:47,199
in uh in in price. So, um, yeah, that

160
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,759
was really kind of my first experience

161
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:55,439
in in in in the in in the kind bud and,

162
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:59,120
you know, and as you know, um, you know,

163
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:02,319
I graduated high school and such and so

164
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,598
people started going into um into New

165
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,759
York City and and and scoring weed. And

166
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:10,560
so that's, you know, I started or a

167
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,439
friend of mine introduced me to someone

168
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,598
he had hooked up with and, you know, I

169
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:20,560
got an inn right away. And uh so we

170
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:22,319
would be able to go there and get 1,200

171
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,720
lb

172
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:30,240
uh 12 $1,200 pounds of uh pretty much

173
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,959
really good green maximum mids that were

174
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,599
kind of um we call them the you know the

175
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,518
pillows cuz they would you know you

176
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,919
would be able to break one up and fill

177
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,479
up a whole gallon baggie inside of you

178
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:44,879
that would be your pillow pretty much.

179
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,480
And so we would we would, you know, get

180
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:51,600
those and um bring them back to Jersey.

181
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,080
And so, uh, that was really my first,

182
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,600
you know, then I was able to tap into

183
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,278
the to the local scene of the exotics of

184
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,240
the stuff that they were bringing in.

185
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:05,759
And, um, so I was able to see a lot of

186
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:10,080
different stuff, you know, in the mid

187
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:11,919
mid to late, uh, 80s or Yeah. it because

188
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,720
I pretty much probably started going in

189
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:17,719
the city around

190
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:20,560
85. And so from 85 going

191
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,879
onwards, you know, I, you know, was just

192
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:25,199
had a, you know, a plug in the city. He

193
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,278
had an apartment and you could just go

194
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,839
up and cherry pick what you wanted, what

195
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:32,320
he had for

196
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:35,680
sale. And then I wound up I wound up in

197
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,839
the park in 1991.

198
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,679
Sheep's sheep's meadow. But we're

199
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,640
actually it was 92. Well, I first went

200
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:45,679
up there in '91. I scoped out the scene

201
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:48,319
and I seen it was just an open air drug

202
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:50,479
market kind of like, you know, the same

203
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,920
thing that you were doing in in San

204
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,839
Francisco in Golden Gate Park. And there

205
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,958
was a connection between Sheep Meadow

206
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,440
and Golden Gate Park because a lot of

207
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:03,958
the hippies that they would just travel

208
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,480
back and forth, you know, to both

209
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:08,719
places. And you know, you know, people

210
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,440
would mention to me Golden Gate Park,

211
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,959
that's where you go and you be able to

212
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,680
buy acid and buy weed and mushrooms and

213
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,599
psychedelics. And it was the same scene

214
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:23,039
in in Sheep's Meadow, you know, when I

215
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,639
first went in there. And so when I want

216
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,838
Sheep's Meadow was a really cool place.

217
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,559
Yeah. You know, like particularly in

218
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,920
when the weather was nice, Sheep's

219
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:36,639
Meadow was just like a magical place

220
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:39,319
where not, you know, cuz you know, the

221
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:42,439
Golden Gate Park over by the Hayda

222
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:45,519
Ashberry. It was really kind of a seedy

223
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:48,320
scene, you know. It was it was dark. It

224
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,759
was dark. Well, Chief was dark, too. if

225
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,079
you I mean on but what I was going to

226
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:54,159
say is in the summertime even Sheep's

227
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,319
Meadow would be you know would be really

228
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,159
there'd be families there too but in the

229
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,760
midst of all of that someone would pull

230
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:03,919
out a gun or I I I saw firsthand you

231
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,399
know I mean I got robbed there too but

232
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,559
it wasn't in the summertime it was more

233
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,039
like you know later in the season as

234
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:14,239
actually as it got more packed it got

235
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:17,439
more dangerous because it was hard to

236
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,399
see like the commote what was going on

237
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,519
at the time, you know, I saw some kid

238
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,799
trying to well, I I watched a scammer.

239
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,200
He used to uh he used to sell fake hits

240
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,519
and the guy was kind of big. He had just

241
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,720
gotten out of jail months beforehand and

242
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,399
I was aware of who he was and he was

243
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,720
trying to, you know, there's like this

244
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,480
young like 17-year-old high school kid

245
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,959
was trying to buy some hits from him and

246
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,920
they were fake and the kid was looking

247
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,599
at him and then he was like unsure and

248
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,519
then he had the money in his hand and

249
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,360
then eventually the [ __ ] dude just

250
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,200
[ __ ] yolked him around to [ __ ]

251
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,919
tried choking him out and grabbing his

252
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,000
money. And this was like just in the

253
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:02,240
same environment as you described,

254
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,039
families, kids, like it was just crazy

255
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,680
back then. So like you know it was you

256
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:12,319
know even though you know there would be

257
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:14,519
people like JFK Jr. up there um all

258
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,839
types of actors,

259
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:20,480
celebrities, you know um it it was a

260
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:25,040
really it was really a really cool scene

261
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:28,000
back then. But, you know, as I um you

262
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:30,958
know, before the before that, you know,

263
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I um you know, so I first got in there

264
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:37,359
in ' 91, I started, you know, I saw the

265
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,039
scene. I I prepared myself for, you

266
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,320
know, during the winter because during

267
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,799
the winter, that's when all the good

268
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,120
weed would come in. So, like some of

269
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:47,199
these really good like high-end Mexis

270
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,200
came in and they were like, you know, it

271
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,399
was kind of like the Bratendica weed

272
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,519
back in the day. If you're in my the

273
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:56,000
botendica, you know, and that was like

274
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,120
really good Mexi and there was like

275
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,519
maybe a few seeds in there. So if you

276
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,799
were really slick, you were able to pop

277
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:09,200
those seeds out and present it almost as

278
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:11,120
kind bud. So um you know I had gotten

279
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,399
some of that and I that was the first

280
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,480
fakers. Right. Right. So I you know I

281
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,159
saw this you know the potential of this.

282
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,200
So, I was just going to bag up Ace and

283
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:23,199
just sell it straight up, you know. So,

284
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,200
you know, I got a good price on it and

285
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,759
and that's what I did. I hit the park

286
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,600
and I just started selling, you know,

287
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,240
ace of that Mexi out there and I didn't

288
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,120
really have any I didn't really have any

289
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,278
really straight Kind Bud connections or

290
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,639
grower connections back then. Like I had

291
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:43,679
my main plug and he would get exotics

292
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,600
here and there and whatever. So, but I

293
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:48,638
didn't really have my main connection.

294
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,720
And then, you know, uh, you know, one

295
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,799
day that all changed. You know, I met I

296
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:58,240
met Mike Klopp out there and, um, the

297
00:13:54,799 --> 00:14:01,599
weasel. The weasel. Yeah. So, I mean,

298
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,079
when I met Mike, um, he had the skunk

299
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:08,320
one, two, and three. So, that was the

300
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:11,519
RFK one, two, and three. So you know uh

301
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:16,160
proceeding you know that that's when you

302
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:18,440
guys you kind of um you know did you

303
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:22,799
know your whole thing with you know the

304
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:26,320
RFK and you know how he inspired you to

305
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:28,719
grow and then you inspired him to grow

306
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,480
and then eventually Mike inspired me to

307
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,720
grow. So, it was like a really kind of

308
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,959
real, you know, full circle kind of a

309
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,360
thing, you know, didn't it didn't start

310
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:41,679
off like that. But, you know, but when I

311
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,159
first met Mike, you know, and I and he

312
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:47,359
was um he was just selling the, you

313
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:49,360
know, RFK one, two, and three. So, and I

314
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,759
was just, you know, he he was a grower

315
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,759
and I was just like, "Listen, dude. I'll

316
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,159
take everything you got." Cuz he had he

317
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,120
had everything broken down into

318
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:58,639
quarters. And he was like, "Oh, well,

319
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,399
I'm going to try sell all of them." I

320
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,959
said, "Listen, how much do you want for

321
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,759
him?" And I'll take them all. Boom. You

322
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,838
know, and then and and you know, so I

323
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,919
just wanted to lock him in. And

324
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,680
eventually I did, you know, and you

325
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,198
know, the the business, you know, he

326
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:14,638
started getting a little bit bigger.

327
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:16,559
Then he was like, "Hey, listen. You

328
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,519
know, maybe we shouldn't meet in the

329
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,479
park anymore. We should go down to

330
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:22,879
Wetlands." He's like, "You go down to

331
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,480
Wetlands on Tuesday. It's Grateful Dead

332
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:28,559
night. And you know, they have a a drum

333
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,399
circle and stuff, you know, you could

334
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,000
smoke weed, blah blah blah. And so we

335
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,839
went down there and it was like, you

336
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,519
know, it was really cool down there. And

337
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,519
so

338
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,519
downstairs in the wetlands where they

339
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,480
had all the pillows. Yes. Yes. Well,

340
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,720
they had a green peace meeting in, you

341
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,120
know, before that. So as soon as a green

342
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,639
peace meeting wrapped up, you know,

343
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,360
everyone would be just sitting there

344
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,680
hanging out with, you know, with, you

345
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,278
know, a guitar, some

346
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:58,559
bongos,

347
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:01,600
tambourine, whatever little instrument

348
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:04,559
you had, you know, and so, uh, you know,

349
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,079
once the Greenpeace meeting wrapped up,

350
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:07,679
then everyone would just start, you

351
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,198
know, start jamming a little bit,

352
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,838
getting the scene going. They would

353
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:13,758
start playing some, you know, dead

354
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,120
music. you know, some nights he had a

355
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:19,720
cover band. Uh, you know, so it was a

356
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,240
really really cool scene back then. And

357
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:25,600
um, so, you know, we, you know, that's

358
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,198
how we kind of first met AJ. And so,

359
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,959
like, you know, somehow or another, he

360
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,758
just kind of sniffed us out because it

361
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,838
was just me meeting me meeting Mike down

362
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,480
there, you know, and so, you know, we

363
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,240
would do the deal and, you know, then we

364
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,639
would be able to spark up and kind of

365
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,360
relax and kind, you know what I mean?

366
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,799
And so that's when we first met AJ and

367
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,759
you know he he sniffed out you know the

368
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:53,039
the you know the I think by then we

369
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:57,759
might he might have gotten the the chem

370
00:16:53,039 --> 00:17:00,559
the the chem dog by then and um so

371
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:03,440
that's you know yeah pretty much that

372
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:07,359
you know he had the chem 91 back then

373
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,838
you mean the weasel not AJ no not AJ the

374
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,159
weasel had it and so you know he he

375
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,159
sniffed He sniffed out the 91 and me and

376
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,000
him were smoking. And then he just kind

377
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,558
of he's like, "Hey, you know, if you

378
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,679
want, we can go into the back office cuz

379
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:25,519
he was an intern for the Greenpeace

380
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:27,600
meeting and and also for, you know, uh,

381
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,119
the bar and stuff. So, you know, he had

382
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,879
a back office. So, we used to be able to

383
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,519
go right into the back office, you know,

384
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,600
and have like four or six people there,

385
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,558
break out all of our weed, just kind of

386
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:41,839
start throwing down,

387
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:43,839
smoking, selling this and that. And um

388
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:46,959
yeah, that's how that whole thing really

389
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:48,720
kind of first started. And um and that's

390
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,720
when, you know, AJ kind that's when

391
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,160
Diesel first got coined because he'd be

392
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,200
like, "Yo, you guys got any of that

393
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,840
diesel?" you know, meaning the 91, but

394
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,319
meaning like back then diesel was kind

395
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:03,038
of just a catch name for stuff that was

396
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:05,119
really strong, you know, so like a lot

397
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:07,519
of things were diesel back then, so it

398
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:10,558
wasn't just weeds. So, you know, that's

399
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:14,400
kind of where the the you first called

400
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:17,599
diesel and then, you know, I you know, I

401
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,240
remember smoking a a Jay with someone

402
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:23,279
down there and I and I passed it to him

403
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,480
and he's smoking on it. He's like, he's

404
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:28,160
like, "Uh, is this organic?" And I'm

405
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,079
like, I'm like, "No, I don't think you

406
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,798
know." At the time, I wasn't growing. I,

407
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:32,558
you know, I didn't know. I was like,

408
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:34,558
"No, I don't think so." You know, he

409
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:36,079
goes, "What's the name of this stuff?" I

410
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,918
was like, "It's called Chem Dog." He's

411
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:41,038
like, "Chem Chem." He's grown with

412
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:43,120
chemicals, this and that. And he's just

413
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,879
like, you know, because of the smell and

414
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:48,000
everything. Then he just started going

415
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,679
off on this tangent. So then after that,

416
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I was like, "Oh, wow. maybe we should

417
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,559
just, you know, get rid of the get rid

418
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,759
of the cam and just kind of call it

419
00:18:54,558 --> 00:19:01,759
diesel or, you know, so that's kind of u

420
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,798
kind of the direction it kind of went in

421
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,640
in the beginning with with the 91 was

422
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:10,319
kind of I had a similar I had a

423
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,360
similar feeling and story myself. I

424
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:15,279
don't know if you've heard it on my

425
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:18,879
podcast, but when I got the Chem Dog

426
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:20,960
from Greg, I was an organic grower.

427
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,440
And I was like, I'm not going to call

428
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,919
this [ __ ] the chem dog. Like, I'm

429
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:30,000
growing it organic. So, I I just used to

430
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:33,360
call it the dog, you know, because for

431
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,200
me at that point, I was offended by the

432
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:38,879
idea of growing with mineral salts,

433
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,720
which, you know, I've I've come a long

434
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,039
way since then, but yeah, I just called

435
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,640
it the dog, not the chem dog. Yeah.

436
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:48,400
There. And back then it wasn't called

437
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,320
the 91, you know, there was it was just

438
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,080
the chem right at the time. Yeah. But

439
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:55,079
there back then there was just like this

440
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:58,879
whole kind of hippie dippy kind of

441
00:19:55,079 --> 00:20:01,199
organic kind of thing going on back then

442
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,840
and no one really had the really the

443
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,919
real knowledge behind all of it.

444
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,959
Especially back then, everyone was just

445
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:11,840
kind of trying to work with guanos and

446
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,360
other kind of stuff like that. And so,

447
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,678
you know, that just stuff just really

448
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:17,599
turned into a

449
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:20,559
nightmare in in the end. So, it was just

450
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:23,519
so much work and, you know, you know, it

451
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:25,839
was still really hard to pull off. So,

452
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:29,519
you know, especially if you're if you're

453
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:31,119
growing for production. So, uh you know,

454
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,918
you just got to really start making some

455
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,839
decisions on on really what what you're

456
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,080
doing. But back then, none of that was

457
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,839
ever really none of that was really

458
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:42,720
thought of. you know, is this a matter

459
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,798
of, you know, a lot of people just had,

460
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,000
you know, grows in their in their in

461
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:50,158
their closet or their bedrooms or, you

462
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
know, one or two lights and, you know,

463
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,840
that that's really how it started. You

464
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,640
know, people didn't start out with these

465
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:59,119
big elaborate, you know, five or 10

466
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,600
light grows. They were, you know, happy

467
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,798
just to pull one or two lights off, you

468
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:04,558
know, because we didn't know what the

469
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:06,319
[ __ ] we were doing back then, you know.

470
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:08,720
It was really a And also, we were

471
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:11,038
getting such a high price that with two

472
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,960
lights, we were making a great Right.

473
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,640
Right. You're right about that. It's

474
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,880
funny when you think about saying, you

475
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,520
know, two to five lights as an elaborate

476
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,080
grow, you know, but back then it was.

477
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:24,240
Yeah. If you had five lights back then,

478
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,359
you were just crushing. You were making

479
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,240
so much money. Yeah. But if you're

480
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:30,959
getting, you know, 4 or 500 an ounce

481
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,079
straight up, like and you and you can't

482
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,679
grow enough of it, like, you know, and

483
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,678
that's kind of like how it was because

484
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,600
really there weren't really that many

485
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,840
people that were really growing back

486
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:45,918
then and growing, you know, the super

487
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:47,119
fire stuff, you know, on top of it, you

488
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,559
know. So there, you know, there were

489
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,359
people who were growing, but you know,

490
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:53,918
when people smelled the Chem Dog, when

491
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:55,759
they smelled the Sour Diesel, you know,

492
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,520
it was something like they've never seen

493
00:21:55,759 --> 00:22:00,558
before and people just started going

494
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:04,279
crazy for it. And, you know, and just,

495
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:06,960
you know, touching on, you know, the the

496
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:09,839
sour, you know, it was really, you know,

497
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:14,000
AJ that really kind of, you know, got

498
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:16,240
that popularized down in the city. And

499
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,599
you know at the time I was just kind of

500
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:23,038
you know selling weed and I was you know

501
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:26,319
I was close to the sources of you know

502
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:30,400
uh of KOP who you know where those seeds

503
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:33,439
first started off at and you know but

504
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,919
even before that Mike had made the

505
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:40,080
underdog which I don't know if you ever

506
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:42,640
remember the underdog and it was 91

507
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:45,038
times the well he's told me two

508
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,520
different stories on it. Originally,

509
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:50,558
when I first remember him telling me, he

510
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:52,079
told me it was NL Super Skunk Times the

511
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:55,440
91.

512
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:59,119
Now he says it was just the NL times the

513
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,840
91. But after after you know I didn't

514
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:04,038
after growing it and smoking it like

515
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:06,759
there was definitely some skunk in there

516
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:10,158
because NL's are kind of

517
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:12,240
blandish and and the 91 could kind of

518
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,960
you can kind of say the same thing about

519
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,240
it other than the cheminess to it you

520
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:21,600
know there is no real fun you know like

521
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,839
skunk skunkiness sort to speak to it you

522
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:27,199
know kind of like I would say the chem

523
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:30,480
is more skunkier than the 91

524
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,640
So the 91 I think is more like OG. Yeah.

525
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,279
And and really, you know, and it's funny

526
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,880
that you say that because I think the

527
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:41,200
same thing and and if you think about it

528
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:45,039
now, if the story that's true about the

529
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:47,960
OG being um now the guy that tells the

530
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:51,679
story says it was

531
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:55,679
um what did he say it was? It was Hindu

532
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:57,360
Kush times the em or the the emerald

533
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,240
triangle, which we don't know what the

534
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:02,079
emerald triangle was, but we do know the

535
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:06,079
Hindu Kush that he had gotten at the

536
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:09,399
time from Neville. Well, that was NL2

537
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:13,038
times um Kush number

538
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:17,038
four. And I've also I've grown out to

539
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:19,278
NL2 recently from Todd McCormick. And I

540
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:22,319
can tell you when you look when the

541
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:26,960
growth that of the NL2 compared to the

542
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:29,200
to the 91 and the Kush, it's they're

543
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,440
pretty much the same. you know, the the

544
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,720
tur profiles are a little bit different,

545
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,120
but the the

546
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,759
popcorn style nugs and the way that it

547
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:43,199
stretches out and everything, you know,

548
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:45,759
and even Neville himself when he first

549
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,919
saw the OG, he said he's like, "Yeah,

550
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:51,038
that's my NL2 is in there." So, he

551
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,960
recognized it. So, you know, I have a,

552
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:57,278
you know, it might be, you know,

553
00:24:52,960 --> 00:25:01,120
different type of of a mixture, but I

554
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:03,640
would say NL2 is probably in both the

555
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:06,558
the the Kush and in the

556
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:09,038
91 from my experience, from what I what

557
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:11,200
I've grown out, you know. So, you know,

558
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:13,200
it's it's funny that that that you

559
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,840
mention that.

560
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,480
I mean, to me, it's obvious when when

561
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:19,839
you taste and, you know, most people I I

562
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,798
could say even today most people have

563
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:27,558
zero experience smoking the Chem Dog,

564
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:30,798
you know, the 91, but when I smoke any

565
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:33,119
OG or or the Chem Dog, it's it's like

566
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:34,558
they're sisters, right? I agree. You can

567
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,239
definitely you can definitely you can

568
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:38,319
definitely taste that. But, you know,

569
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,200
but then, you know, we don't know what

570
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:42,879
the the emerald triangle was, you know.

571
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,519
So, there that that definitely had some

572
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,760
kind of like gassiness it seems like

573
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:50,400
whatever. But to me, the question is

574
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:53,119
where does that where's that chem? Where

575
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,278
does that chem funk come from? And so

576
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:57,239
that's, you know, to me, I think it's

577
00:25:55,278 --> 00:26:01,440
got to be some type of

578
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:03,759
Afghan or Hindu Kush or something along

579
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,320
those lines because you just don't

580
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:10,079
really get that fooliness really out of

581
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:12,158
any kind of like Mexican sativa or

582
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:14,480
anything like that. That's other that

583
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,120
that has been suggested in the past, you

584
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,960
know. So, you know, that that's the you

585
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:21,678
know, that's the question is where does

586
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:25,120
that like, you know, even with the the

587
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:28,400
chem you you get that garlic oniony kind

588
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:32,079
of thing going on and you know and then

589
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:35,120
originally you know you had the the 91

590
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:37,439
and the sister, you remember the sister

591
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:41,038
and the sister was kind of like the

592
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,840
sativa version of the chem like they

593
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:46,480
both smelled exactly the same but grew

594
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:48,879
totally different and the effects were

595
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,519
totally different, you know, where the

596
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:55,278
sister was more of that sativa kind of

597
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:57,918
more stretchy, more kind of uplifting

598
00:26:55,278 --> 00:27:00,798
kind of, you know, but it still kind of

599
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:03,759
had that garlic oniony kind of profile

600
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:07,359
that the Chem D has. And the Chem D is

601
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:10,960
more of a more indigga, more, you know,

602
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:15,678
heavyhitting type of um, you know,

603
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:18,880
plant. And so even in you know um you

604
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:23,038
know there there's there's lots of um

605
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:25,840
hybrids sativa indiga hybrids even in uh

606
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:27,599
Afghanistan and Pakistan you know as you

607
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:31,359
get up north more as you're getting

608
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:34,480
towards the Indian borders in Nepal and

609
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:37,439
all that you know you start getting into

610
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,960
I think a little bit more uh sativa type

611
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,440
of plants that could possibly you

612
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:47,120
especially on the more going towards

613
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,200
India I would say that would maybe you

614
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,918
know display some of these you know

615
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,038
traits but you know all that is kind of

616
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:58,520
speculation on my part and you know I

617
00:27:55,038 --> 00:28:01,759
don't have any real proof to really you

618
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:04,319
know behind any of that but you know at

619
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:08,000
this point we only kind of have that to

620
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:11,439
go on is what we know and what the

621
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,480
history of certain things are in certain

622
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:18,159
regions and stuff. And unfortunately, a

623
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:21,759
lot of that's been lost because of wars

624
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:23,200
and and and and stuff like that. So, you

625
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,599
know, there isn't like, you know, any of

626
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,278
us could really go on go on the ground

627
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:30,079
over there and try to do any kind of

628
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:32,240
research or whatever. But even what what

629
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:34,639
Kevin Jod Reed did was, you know, you

630
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,440
got to have a set of balls to really,

631
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,840
you know, go over there. You know, at

632
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,720
that point, your life is in these other

633
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:45,038
people's hands. You know, you know, I I

634
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,720
wouldn't feel safe unless I had an an

635
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:50,720
armed security guard with me at at all

636
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:53,360
times because just the the appearance of

637
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,640
you could just, you know, make someone

638
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:59,359
want to do something possibly. So, um,

639
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,679
you know, I I tip my hat for for to him

640
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:04,079
to, you know, for having the balls to do

641
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:07,038
that.

642
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:10,240
Yeah, I I agree. I would say you would

643
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:12,558
need more than one armed guard. Well, I

644
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,798
I I would want more than one armed guard

645
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:17,278
because what's one guy with a gun going

646
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:22,000
to do against right 10 people with a

647
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:24,319
gun? So, but so one question I want to

648
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,240
ask since you've got the Dancing Bears

649
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:29,639
behind you. When did you get into the

650
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:34,159
Grateful Dead? Um my first show

651
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:35,679
was spring of 87 at the Brendan Burn

652
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:40,320
Arena.

653
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:42,080
Opening song was Dancing in the Streets.

654
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:44,079
Nice. And you got the dancing bears

655
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:46,879
behind you. My first show was at the

656
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:51,038
same location but in 1988.

657
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:53,000
Brendan Burn 33088 was that shows and

658
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:55,278
the reason why I wanted to ask was

659
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,919
because well first of all because I'm a

660
00:29:55,278 --> 00:30:00,079
dead head but second of all was you

661
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:03,200
didn't find Kind Bud at the Grateful

662
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:07,119
Dead shows and weren't able to make any

663
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,880
connections for for nice weed there. You

664
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,798
had to wait you know because you saying

665
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,320
you weren't getting any of that till you

666
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:16,558
know 91. Well, I was getting it I was

667
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:18,879
getting it some from my plug, you know,

668
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:21,759
in the city, you know, but it wasn't

669
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,640
like I was directly, you know, connected

670
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:26,640
to the grower or anything. And in here,

671
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,880
when I used to go into the shows,

672
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,200
everyone would go shopping park, you

673
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,720
know, in the parking lot on Shakedown

674
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,558
Street and everything. Um, but I never,

675
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,200
you know, when I went to the shows, it

676
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:41,599
really wasn't my focus to do business

677
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,038
really. It was really my focus was more

678
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:46,558
to enjoy myself, let my guard down and

679
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:48,798
you know have a good time and

680
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:51,119
everything. So, uh, you know, when

681
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:53,519
you're high on mushrooms and acid,

682
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:57,599
sometimes it's hard to navigate, you

683
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:59,679
know, doing things. So, uh, yeah, you

684
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:02,319
know, I so I never really made any

685
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,840
really major connections on tour or

686
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:06,398
anything like that. I wouldn't, you

687
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:09,278
know, I wasn't really a tour head. I

688
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:11,119
mean, I would go to most local shows,

689
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:14,079
the local shows, you know, I would, you

690
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:16,479
know, go out on the East Coast or, you

691
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:19,678
know, we would, you know, plan plan a

692
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,480
trip here or there, but uh, no, I I

693
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:25,038
wasn't someone that went on on on tour

694
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,120
on every on on every show or whatever.

695
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:30,079
And so, you know, I stayed within my

696
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:32,000
means and my bounds. And, you know, at

697
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:34,599
that time, you know, I was really just

698
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
trying to get my [ __ ] together.

699
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:40,079
and you know you and figure out life you

700
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,480
know because you know you know you're

701
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,480
trying to you know think about doing a

702
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,278
career and then you're hustling on the

703
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,480
side and so you see how much money is

704
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:53,440
kind of being made and you know it's a

705
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,079
hard decision you know and you know I

706
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,519
went the route of you know going into a

707
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:03,359
trade school and learning you know a a

708
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:05,679
craft in the union and you know and

709
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:09,319
trying to have some kind of legitimate

710
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:13,278
uh skills to be able to survive on other

711
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:17,359
than kind of hustling and and and you

712
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:20,000
know dedicating my life full time to to

713
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:22,719
hustling and and selling weed you know

714
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,679
and kind of looking back now how things

715
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,240
have kind of shaken out and you know

716
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,919
some of those people now that kind of

717
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,679
went the route of just doing the the

718
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:36,880
hustle now they find themselves in a in

719
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,600
in a spot now because of legalization

720
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,320
and things aren't the way they used to

721
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:45,759
and now they don't have no job skills to

722
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:49,798
survive on on the outside. Now you find

723
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:52,640
yourself 60 65 years old with no job

724
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:55,200
skills. You got minimal money. you

725
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:58,320
might, you know, own a house or have

726
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:01,679
some kind of equity behind you, but you

727
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:04,558
know, trying to, you know, uh, trying to

728
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:06,798
make money, you know, in that type of,

729
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:09,359
uh, you know, in today's, you know,

730
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:11,918
times and everything, it's it's really

731
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:14,558
tough. You know, back in the day, it was

732
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,919
easy for anyone to to pick up a job. The

733
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:18,639
only thing you had to do is pick up a

734
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,720
newspaper and look in the want ads, you

735
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,840
know, that doesn't exist anymore, you

736
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,600
know, like And back in the day in New

737
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:29,839
York City, you could be a terrible

738
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:32,000
grower and still make good money. Yeah.

739
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:34,879
You know, like you could grow shitty

740
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,038
weed, get a shitty yield, sell it wet

741
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,640
and still be and still and still be sell

742
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:43,200
wet and still be crushing. Nowadays, you

743
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,200
can be growing really good weed and

744
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,679
still struggle selling it and and

745
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,600
struggle selling it for a price where

746
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,759
you could actually even just pay the

747
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:54,480
bills to grow it. Well, well, now I

748
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:56,480
think you know, you know, it's really

749
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,079
it's all about the retail now. So, if

750
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,880
you if you're growing, you know, if you

751
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:03,278
got a home grow and you know, you got to

752
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,840
have your own customers basically. You

753
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:08,079
know, there's no more wholesale. So,

754
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:09,918
there's no more, you know, so all the

755
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,320
people that you're selling to are all

756
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:15,118
consuming it, you know. Maybe you might

757
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,599
get a few people that you know might

758
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,240
take something, but like for the for for

759
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,720
the prices

760
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:25,039
like and you know and and as a as a

761
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,799
grower, as a craft grower, what is the

762
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:29,358
bottom? You know what I mean? What's the

763
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:33,359
b what's the bottom per pound that

764
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:35,199
you're willing to go? So here, you know,

765
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:39,440
I don't think we've found out. Yeah. You

766
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:43,559
know, to me, I mean, anywhere there's it

767
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:46,800
ranges. It could be $24 to

768
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:49,918
$3,000, you know, and and it really all

769
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:54,159
depends on how good of a grower you are,

770
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:55,759
how good your product is, and and where

771
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,400
you're willing to stand, you know, and

772
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,800
if you're like, listen, my my my units

773
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,639
are 3Gs straight up, you know, and if

774
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:07,599
you're only producing X amount of

775
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:09,199
product and you're able to sell it

776
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,800
before the next crop, before the next

777
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:12,559
crop,

778
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,960
you know that's that's all that's what

779
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:18,320
you you know so it's better to have a

780
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:21,559
demand than have an oversaturation and I

781
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:25,838
think and that's where I think you know

782
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:29,119
the the commercialized legal market has

783
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:32,078
made the the mistake because they've

784
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:35,760
made these massive grows you know that

785
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:38,480
cost a lot of money to you know to keep

786
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,760
up distant payroll and just monthly

787
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,838
expenses is and just as you explained

788
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,800
like all right so you got it doesn't

789
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:49,440
matter how many square feet you have if

790
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,839
you ain't selling all that weed before

791
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,320
your next

792
00:35:50,838 --> 00:35:56,719
crop

793
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:58,720
then you it's just a race to the bottom

794
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:02,159
you know what I mean so to me I think

795
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:06,959
it's being better to be micro being

796
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:09,199
small craft producing a higher quality

797
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,039
product that's going to sell out and be

798
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:12,639
in

799
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:15,599
demand and then then you could build

800
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:17,920
your business model off of that if you

801
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:21,960
want to upscale off of that. But

802
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:24,559
starting off off of these big upscale

803
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,679
projects just don't work. This doesn't

804
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:29,920
work. The majority of them fail. Yes.

805
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:31,919
And otherwise, well, the majority of

806
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,519
them are back door and pounds out the

807
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,079
[ __ ] back. And that's the only way

808
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:38,719
they are surviving. Everyone, not the

809
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,000
majority. Every single one. anyone

810
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:42,879
anyone that tells you that they're not

811
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,519
back throwing the weed is just you know

812
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,519
trying to protect their privacy and you

813
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:50,320
know you know and so to me you know if

814
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:54,480
you if you can do this craft thing and

815
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:57,359
then and go right from you know farmer

816
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,639
to consumer like that's the best

817
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:03,119
business model that there is. There's no

818
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:07,598
middleman. It's from from you know seed

819
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:11,680
to sale uh small small craft farmer

820
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:16,320
markets higher quality higher profits

821
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:20,078
you know you know per per unit should we

822
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:22,400
say now overall sales per year yeah you

823
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:26,000
may be limited but listen if you're just

824
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,559
you know you know one or two people you

825
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,480
know how many how much money do you need

826
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:33,279
every you know you know what I'm And

827
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,559
like you just got to be happy for what

828
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,240
for what you get

829
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:39,920
and just be thankful that you're doing

830
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:42,639
something that you love and getting paid

831
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,760
for it. You know, like I like to make it

832
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:48,960
the analogy of comparing it to being in

833
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:52,240
music where you don't have to be a

834
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,000
superstar. You could be a music teacher

835
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:56,399
and if you can make a living off of

836
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,400
teaching people how to play guitar or

837
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,480
piano and you're doing something that

838
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,320
you love and you're getting paid for it,

839
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:07,440
like that's a win for me. Yeah. It's

840
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:10,160
also a hard life. I I've done that. I

841
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,119
had my own teaching company. Um I was

842
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:12,639
going to say though, you know, with

843
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,079
those commercial growers, one of the

844
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:15,598
other things that they've done is

845
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,200
they've essentially flooded the market

846
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,280
and they've lowered prices

847
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:22,000
significantly. you know, I'm here in

848
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,599
Southern California and um you know, I'm

849
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,519
luckily in a position where I have a

850
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,039
career. I don't, you know, I I do my

851
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:28,880
breeding stuff for fun. I don't have to

852
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,960
rely on anything, you know, to help pay

853
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,640
the bills. Um but from what I

854
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,480
understand, you know, pounds out here,

855
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:36,400
even for high quality product, it's like

856
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,320
1,800, you know, two grand, you know,

857
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,039
for a pound. And that's for the best

858
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,039
quality product. Exactly. Exactly. And

859
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:44,960
And that's hard to get. I mean, most

860
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:46,480
people they're just they don't really

861
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,079
care too much, you know. They can go to

862
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,320
their local dispensary and get ounces

863
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,320
for what, 60, 70, 80 bucks, you know,

864
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,000
and in their mind that's what the price

865
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,838
is now. It doesn't matter if it's craft

866
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,639
or if it's commercial, you know, the

867
00:38:55,838 --> 00:39:02,960
average person, you know, at least. So,

868
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:06,199
I remember I remember it was uh the

869
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:10,159
early 2000s or yeah, somewhere in the

870
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:13,519
2000s when Sunrown in California was

871
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:15,838
dropping below $1,000 a pound. And

872
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:17,599
everyone thought that that was the end.

873
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:20,880
They couldn't believe that they couldn't

874
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:24,720
get $1,000 a pound for their outdoor

875
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,720
weed. And today, that same weed is a

876
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:28,959
couple hundred bucks.

877
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:32,480
You know, like you you can get really

878
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:36,159
really nice outdoor weed, not greenhouse

879
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,440
for 300 bucks, 200 bucks, and like the

880
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:41,118
best greenhouse

881
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,519
weed, maybe not like light assisted, but

882
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:47,000
just greenhouse weed, if you can get

883
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:49,519
four or $500 for that, you're absolutely

884
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,320
crushing, you know. And and I remember

885
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:55,199
some oldtime growers that thought, you

886
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:58,240
know, $1,000 a pound. Anything less than

887
00:39:55,199 --> 00:40:00,399
that was just how how do you survive?

888
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:04,078
And also think about it, that was $1,000

889
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,960
a pound 20 plus years ago. So with the

890
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,880
value of money having changed, you know,

891
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,960
it's it's become very difficult to make

892
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,358
a living growing weed these days is is

893
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,039
the reality. And also I think it's know

894
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:20,559
knowing who your customers are and and

895
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:22,960
trying to market yourself towards them

896
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:26,559
because right now you know the market is

897
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:29,519
just flooded with mids you know just

898
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:31,960
flooded you know so you know as just as

899
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:36,480
cosmic was saying like most

900
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:41,440
people you know weed is weed right to to

901
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:43,519
to people like us weed isn't weed so you

902
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:47,079
you you know so when you're in the mids

903
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:49,320
game like you're you're not really

904
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:51,240
particularly you

905
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:56,079
know trying

906
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:59,279
to you know uh overdo things for people

907
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:02,079
as as in promotions and stuff. If it is,

908
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,160
it is what it is. Where where you know

909
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:07,519
where where you're trying to do a more

910
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:09,838
higher connoisseur clientele then you

911
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:12,960
know you got to get people's attention

912
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:16,960
you know it's like you know and so you

913
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:20,079
know and really you know it it comes

914
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,800
down to the product speaking for itself.

915
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,680
You know, when something is that good

916
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,599
and and it's shown

917
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:30,318
around and then it gets recognized, you

918
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:33,359
know, then it becomes it becomes its own

919
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:35,039
thing, you know. So, you can't really,

920
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:37,358
you know, you can't really make that up.

921
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:39,679
The only thing you could do is you put

922
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:42,799
something in the market and, you know,

923
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:46,239
the market determines kind of like, you

924
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:49,200
know, what it is. And so, you know, when

925
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:51,838
you're dealing with a higher connoisseur

926
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:54,199
type of people that are weed nerds

927
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:56,960
essentially that know everything about

928
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:58,559
weed, you know, you know, so that, you

929
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,440
know, those going to be the your more

930
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:02,880
craft kind of customer, you know, where

931
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,480
you know, they come in, they're going to

932
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,200
want to know, you know, what's behind

933
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,679
the lineage of this and that. And, you

934
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:11,598
know, you know, you know, when you're

935
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:13,919
talking to a bud tender and they tell

936
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:16,559
you, well, it's a sativa. That's all I

937
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,280
know. it's a sativa or it's a hybrid or

938
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:21,199
you know whatever and

939
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:24,000
so I think you know you know knowledge

940
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:26,358
behind the product and the way that you

941
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,960
know you market yourself and all of that

942
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:31,679
and you know all of that is very

943
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,838
relevant in today's because you know

944
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:35,519
kids kids now you know you're on

945
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:38,078
Instagram and you're just kind of

946
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,599
scrolling through scrolling through you

947
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,318
know then all of a sudden you see that

948
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,079
picture of a of a bud with diamonds on

949
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:45,599
it you know and all of a sudden you stop

950
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:47,119
and look at it and you're like, "Wow,

951
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,800
that looks amazing." you know, and you

952
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,800
give it a like, you know, and you might

953
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,839
[ __ ] give it a fire comment or

954
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,560
something like that, you know, but you

955
00:42:53,838 --> 00:43:01,039
know, and that's kind of like what we're

956
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:02,960
kind of um you know, is just like

957
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:05,679
driving down the highway and you see a

958
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,119
billboard with a bikini girl on, you're

959
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:09,519
going to take a look at it, you know,

960
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:13,519
and so everything is kind of like, you

961
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:17,358
know, uh you know, for for the moment.

962
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:21,199
And I think, you know, as as turpps are

963
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:23,440
now become a big part of of of the

964
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:25,358
equation, it's just not the looks of it.

965
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:28,400
Now you're talking about the smell of

966
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:31,759
things. And so when you open a open a

967
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:34,160
jar of that old school sour diesel and

968
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,720
you and you just smell it and you just

969
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:39,358
kind of like, you know, all all of a

970
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:42,480
sudden all of these other senses get

971
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:45,679
activated in your brain. You know the

972
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:48,240
smell of the the sense of smell is very

973
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:51,799
strong. you know, it's like smelling a

974
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:55,519
woman or smelling something that is

975
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:57,680
enticing and and so, you know, you you

976
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:59,679
know, I kind of, you know, compare

977
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:02,879
cannabis the same way because when you

978
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:04,399
crack that jar and and you smell that,

979
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,240
you know, and that's the first thing,

980
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,200
you know, how you how you judge things

981
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:12,159
is by the smell and now now you look at

982
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:14,719
it and you smells amazing and it looks

983
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:18,000
amazing that so that must mean that it

984
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:19,838
must be amazing, you know and as we all

985
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,838
know that's not always the case. You

986
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:25,679
know trying to get something to check

987
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:27,838
all the boxes is is is very rare. You

988
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:32,159
know there are you know a lot of things

989
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:34,239
that do fit that description but um you

990
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:37,358
know that's kind of like you know you

991
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:40,159
know where I think you know the future

992
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:42,719
is. You know it's just um you know it's

993
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:44,960
it's ever changing market. you know,

994
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:47,318
even when you're judging something, you

995
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,679
know, if you're in a contest or

996
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:52,318
whatever, you know, I could speak from

997
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:54,879
my past experiences being a judge, you

998
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:58,639
know, once you smoke like the fifth or

999
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:01,599
10th thing, the effect is non-existent,

1000
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:03,279
you know. So, so by So, if you're

1001
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,119
judging now, what are you judging?

1002
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,200
You're not judging by effect anymore.

1003
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,760
Now, you're judging by the way that it

1004
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:13,679
smells and the way that it looks, you

1005
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:17,760
know? So, Noto Dog mentioned something

1006
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:20,879
similar in one of his podcasts as far as

1007
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:24,240
the uh ego clash, which is a hash

1008
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,318
competition here in California. And he

1009
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:29,118
said, you know, you're judging so much

1010
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:31,039
hash in such a short period of time

1011
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,519
that, you know, after the first couple

1012
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:38,079
of dabs, that's it. There there's really

1013
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:41,759
no way to do it. Now the um the Emerald

1014
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:45,519
Cup is a little bit better because they

1015
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,119
give the judges like judging packs and

1016
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:49,920
you know they have them for you know

1017
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:53,599
over a month. So they're you know they

1018
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:56,559
have time to go through it and you know

1019
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:59,400
be a little bit more conscious of the

1020
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:01,960
effect. But even with that they have so

1021
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:04,160
many entries that they're going through

1022
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:07,880
that it's pretty hard to judge the

1023
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:07,879
height. No, it is.

1024
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:16,159
Yeah. So, um I I wanted to we talked

1025
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:19,039
about Klopp and the sour story a little

1026
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:21,039
bit, but I wanted to get back to that

1027
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:23,679
just a little because I feel like we we

1028
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:26,639
glossed over it and the sour is

1029
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:28,318
something that, you know, not only a lot

1030
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:30,559
of people want to know about, but it's

1031
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:32,559
also a a big part of the work that

1032
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:34,559
you're doing today. Yeah. You know, so I

1033
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:37,279
have some thoughts about the sour. You

1034
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:39,519
know, I was, you know, I was there, you

1035
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,480
know, um, buying weed from Klopp the

1036
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:45,599
whole time. And so, you know, what we do

1037
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:50,199
know is that, you know, seeds were found

1038
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:55,680
in the bag of 91 that Klopp sold to

1039
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:57,399
Vondo. And Vondo uh, lived upstate with

1040
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:00,960
a guy named

1041
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:04,000
Maxwell. And they both lived together.

1042
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,960
And um they sprouted those seeds that

1043
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,000
they found from Klopp uh that became the

1044
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:14,079
diesel number one and

1045
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,159
two. And um recently Maxwell went on a

1046
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:18,560
different

1047
00:47:15,159 --> 00:47:21,358
podcast and he kind of elaborated on he

1048
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:24,000
came, you know, because Maxwell was uh

1049
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:25,400
he had dropped out of the scene. He had

1050
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
started a

1051
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:30,720
family, you know, and just really got

1052
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,719
back on the internet.

1053
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:37,759
within the p past couple years. And so a

1054
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:40,399
AJ went on a podcast with him and they

1055
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:43,200
kind of confirmed a few things I didn't

1056
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,440
know really at the time. But so those

1057
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:48,559
guys were both living together. Had the

1058
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:52,480
diesel one and two. Um they were growing

1059
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:56,719
that, but also they had in their room uh

1060
00:47:52,480 --> 00:48:00,000
the RFK I guess that Klopp gave them.

1061
00:47:56,719 --> 00:48:03,118
And they also had a purple Kush seed

1062
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,440
that they had gotten from Kyle Kushman.

1063
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:08,318
And uh you know, I've talked to Maxwell

1064
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:11,440
and we've kind of bounced back and forth

1065
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:14,159
some some different ideas, but we do

1066
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:17,519
know that those four plants were in the

1067
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:18,440
in the room. Diesel one, Diesel 2, RFK,

1068
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:23,440
Purple

1069
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:26,760
Kush. One of those plants, Herme.

1070
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:30,400
Well, we do know that the RFK had a

1071
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:32,240
very strong reputation of of of herming

1072
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,880
and that was one of the reasons why

1073
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:37,759
Klopp got rid of it. Especially if you

1074
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:40,039
didn't clip off the lower branches, it

1075
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:43,920
usually would throw a herm or

1076
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:46,079
two. So, you know, that to me, you know,

1077
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:49,280
that probably would be one of the

1078
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:52,880
strongest candidates to that would have

1079
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:54,559
harmed in the room and it it it it

1080
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:58,800
pollinated. I don't know if it was the

1081
00:48:54,559 --> 00:49:03,200
diesel one or the diesel 2. Uh they grew

1082
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:05,318
they grew out that stuff and uh sold um

1083
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:09,519
that weed to a guy named

1084
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:13,759
Manny. And Manny found the seeds and

1085
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:16,318
grew them out that really became the the

1086
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:20,040
sour diesel.

1087
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:24,000
And so we know that um I I know I'm not

1088
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:28,199
really I'm not 100% sure but um I'm

1089
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:32,079
pretty sure that Vondo went out to

1090
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:35,199
California and I don't know if he had

1091
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:37,240
the Diesel one or Diesel 2 clone or he

1092
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:42,078
had gotten seeds

1093
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:44,159
from Manny but there seems to be some

1094
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:48,200
kind of connection. I guess Vondo you

1095
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:53,118
have when when was that?

1096
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:53,118
Well, it had to be

1097
00:49:53,800 --> 00:50:00,240
Vondo I think that he left for

1098
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:02,960
California in 94.

1099
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:06,399
Mhm. And are you saying that he did the

1100
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:08,400
uh got those seeds before then? Well, he

1101
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:11,920
Well, all those guys were friends and

1102
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,720
they were part of this Skynctity Albany

1103
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:17,280
crew. So, because to give you to give

1104
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:20,000
you a little information, when Vondo

1105
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:23,680
came out to California, he had nothing.

1106
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,960
Had nothing and didn't know how to grow

1107
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:29,679
and I know this because I gave him

1108
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:32,480
everything and taught him how to grow. I

1109
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:37,039
was partners with him. So, he didn't

1110
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:39,119
come out with the sour or the 91 or He

1111
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:41,358
didn't have any of that stuff.

1112
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:44,240
Yeah, you'd have to Yeah, you'd have to

1113
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:45,759
um clarify that with him, but you know,

1114
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:47,519
I heard that, you know, there was a

1115
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,040
rumor that he might have had brought

1116
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:50,880
seeds out there. I don't know if that

1117
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:53,199
was true or not. You'd have to, you

1118
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:57,079
know, have to ask him. And really, the

1119
00:50:53,199 --> 00:51:00,960
real players in the whole sour story is

1120
00:50:57,079 --> 00:51:03,519
really, you know, Vondo, Maxwell, and

1121
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:08,880
Manny. At the end of the day, those

1122
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:12,000
three guys, AJ, myself, and other people

1123
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:16,280
were kind of involved afterwards, you

1124
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:19,920
know, AJ more than me. I know that

1125
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:24,079
um Manny, you know, he was connected to

1126
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:26,159
the bro, you know, Keith in Albany. So,

1127
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:30,720
that was, you know, that that connection

1128
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:33,440
with the bro. Uh, the bro brought sour

1129
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:34,118
clones out to Amsterdam at some point in

1130
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,639
the

1131
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:40,559
'9s. Um, I guess through Manny. Uh so

1132
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:43,440
you know so really you know these guys

1133
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:45,920
are still around you know and you know

1134
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:50,720
you know you can really you know if you

1135
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:53,039
can get Maxwell on and and Vondo on and

1136
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:55,919
Manny on you know those you know those

1137
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:59,279
guys are the ones that that really know

1138
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:02,079
these really intricate details. I mean,

1139
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,800
a lot of a lot of stuff you hear through

1140
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:08,079
through, you know, different channels

1141
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:10,559
through the years and and and yeah, you

1142
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:13,680
know, the story changes because a guy

1143
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:16,240
like Maxwell comes out after 25 years

1144
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:18,960
and tells his his side of the story

1145
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:22,479
where Vondo, you know, he's been around,

1146
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:24,880
but he's never really really told really

1147
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,519
kind of like, you know, what what

1148
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,599
happened in the room or what strains

1149
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:32,559
they had in the room. You know, there

1150
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:35,599
was no really specific details behind

1151
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:38,559
any of that until Maxwell came out. So,

1152
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:40,640
you know, you know, as time goes on, you

1153
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:43,280
know, these guys may be willing to to

1154
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:47,039
talk to find out the the the details of

1155
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:49,920
of everything else, but um as far as I

1156
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:53,519
know, this is this is as much as we know

1157
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:56,480
as as of right now.

1158
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:59,519
Well, I just looked up at my phone and I

1159
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:01,599
still have Vondo's phone number. So,

1160
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:03,679
yeah, I I can give him a call. I don't

1161
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:06,519
know, man. Yeah, you might. Well, you

1162
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:09,679
can contact He's Wild Mountain

1163
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:13,358
Cannabis. Wild Mountain Cannabis on

1164
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:16,719
Instagram, but also, you know, you can

1165
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:19,358
probably get through to him through AJ

1166
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:23,199
because I think both of them are working

1167
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:27,039
on seed projects together. So, um, Wild

1168
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:30,000
Mountain Cannabis and AJ Sour,

1169
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:32,400
um, those guys definitely, um, they they

1170
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,599
did another podcast and they had

1171
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:38,800
elaborated on on some of this stuff. So,

1172
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:41,599
that was how I became aware of it. But,

1173
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:43,559
you know, but then, you know, I got into

1174
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:46,240
a conversation with

1175
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:48,000
Maxwell and, you know, we, you know,

1176
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:50,959
just, you know, I was kind of curious

1177
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:55,318
about it myself. So, uh, there was

1178
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,318
definitely some more to dig into.

1179
00:53:55,519 --> 00:54:00,800
Yeah, I feel like it's the the topic

1180
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,039
that we will never we will never

1181
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,760
completely get dug into, you know, and

1182
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:08,480
everyone is kind of like, you know, on

1183
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:11,520
the search for the real sour and what

1184
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:15,519
happened to the sour? Is it real? Is it

1185
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:17,920
fake? like, you know, so like originally

1186
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:20,079
there was only one cut of the sour,

1187
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,400
which was originally known as the AJ

1188
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:25,039
sour because AJ was the one that brought

1189
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:28,160
it down to the city and he was the one

1190
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:30,239
that started selling trays of it, you

1191
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:32,879
know, and then he was set he was setting

1192
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:34,959
up other people like Wing Wang, you

1193
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,800
know, he was setting up other rooms, you

1194
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:39,280
know, and so and he was getting pieces

1195
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:41,599
of the room. So it was in in his

1196
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:44,000
interest to to spread the sour around

1197
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:46,720
because there was uh there was never

1198
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,519
enough of it, you know, and so like you

1199
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:51,759
could literally just have well no one

1200
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:55,480
could produce that much, you know, cuz

1201
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:58,240
most people were only running like five

1202
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:01,119
lights, you know, maybe 10 lights back

1203
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:03,279
then was a really big growth. So, like

1204
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:05,318
most people didn't have 10 lights, you

1205
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:08,240
know, like the most I ever had was

1206
00:55:05,318 --> 00:55:11,039
eight, you know, and so, you know, back

1207
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:12,959
then, you know, you know, you know,

1208
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:16,000
things were scary back then. The bigger

1209
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,599
that you got, the more you know, the

1210
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,358
more of a chance something something

1211
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:21,760
could happen and it all depending on the

1212
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:23,920
logistics of where you were, the grow,

1213
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,079
the building, your neighbors. We were

1214
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,838
doing it all in home. Yes. We weren't

1215
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:29,280
ever doing it in commercial buildings,

1216
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:31,358
right? So, we always had power

1217
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,920
limitations. Power limitations. And you

1218
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:36,318
had neighbors to worry about, landlords

1219
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,639
to deal with. So there was always, you

1220
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:41,199
know, carrying bales of Promixing,

1221
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:43,118
everything, you know, just, you know,

1222
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:45,519
uh, getting garbage out the door,

1223
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:48,079
getting getting stuff up in, you know,

1224
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:50,639
just back the back and forth, you know,

1225
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:53,200
carrying garbage bags at nighttime,

1226
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:55,279
filling up a, you know, a Suburban

1227
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:57,759
parked out front, you know, and just

1228
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:00,480
speeding off and dumping the garbage,

1229
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:03,680
you know, you know, who knows where.

1230
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,599
But, uh, yeah, you know, it it was it

1231
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:08,480
was, you know, it was different back

1232
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:11,119
then. It was, you know, I I made a

1233
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,679
video. I'm not sure if you saw it. It

1234
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:17,039
was one of the first videos that I made

1235
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:19,759
and I tell a story about how I lived in

1236
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:21,119
on the third story in Brooklyn for my

1237
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,760
first growth. Did you Did you hear that

1238
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:26,960
story? That's That's insane.

1239
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:29,520
I flushed all my soil and all my garbage

1240
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,519
trash down the toilet. That's insane. I

1241
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:33,119
was petri I was petrified to put it on

1242
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:35,358
the street. That's how the cops would

1243
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:37,280
find out, you know, like they were going

1244
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:39,119
through people's garbage you know what

1245
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,000
we did was we would just just get like

1246
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:43,920
those big contractor garbage bags and so

1247
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,159
you know you you're you're just hauling

1248
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,400
the bags in and out of the out of the

1249
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:50,639
you know building you know you just fill

1250
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,000
up the trunk of your car and speed off

1251
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:54,480
you know and back then there wasn't

1252
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,838
cameras or anything around so you could

1253
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:00,318
just pull up to really any kind of

1254
00:56:56,838 --> 00:57:03,039
industrial or commercial place and find

1255
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:05,440
a dumpster or wherever you could find

1256
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:06,798
some garbage cans or throw it off on the

1257
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,960
curb somewhere where it's going to get

1258
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:10,480
picked up or, you know, you can't really

1259
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,159
get away with that kind of stuff now

1260
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,679
with cameras everywhere, you know, but

1261
00:57:12,159 --> 00:57:16,279
back then, yeah, you you know, you

1262
00:57:13,679 --> 00:57:18,719
didn't want to have any any kind of

1263
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:21,359
paraphernalia or anything in your

1264
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:24,318
garbage, you know, empty fertilizer

1265
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:25,838
bottles or anything of that stuff. You

1266
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:29,279
want, you know, you wanted to try to

1267
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:31,838
keep everything as clean and as quiet as

1268
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,440
possible.

1269
00:57:31,838 --> 00:57:35,440
I found someone's dump like that one

1270
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,559
time. I was uh working at for an office

1271
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,480
furniture company and they had a

1272
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:39,599
dumpster in the back. I went down to go

1273
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,440
break out some, you know, break down

1274
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:42,400
some boxes and I just started smelling.

1275
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,159
I was like, "What the hell?" So, I

1276
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,838
opened it up and sure enough, there was

1277
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:48,000
these garbage bags full of like

1278
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:49,199
premature plants that, you know, for

1279
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,639
whatever reason, they cut them down.

1280
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:52,078
But, yeah, it's so funny that you you

1281
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:54,159
brought that up. Yeah. And that's what

1282
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:57,280
you had to do back in the day. You know,

1283
00:57:54,159 --> 00:58:00,159
it's you know, the people that didn't do

1284
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:02,240
that ended up getting locked up. Yeah.

1285
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:04,159
And and also, you know, you didn't want

1286
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:06,798
to tell anyone like you were kind of

1287
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:08,639
like a hermit in a sense where you

1288
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:11,119
didn't have people coming over to your

1289
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:13,519
house. The only people that came over to

1290
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:16,240
your house were the essential people

1291
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:18,480
that knew that what you were doing and

1292
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:21,838
maybe helped you out for watering when

1293
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:23,599
you're out of town or uh some kind of,

1294
00:58:21,838 --> 00:58:25,920
you know, maintenance or help, maybe

1295
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:28,559
helped you trim or, you know, help solve

1296
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,400
a problem in your room or or whatever.

1297
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:33,680
you you always had to have those kind of

1298
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:35,440
people around. But outside of that, like

1299
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:37,118
there was no one, you know, it wasn't

1300
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,280
like, you know, yeah, let's come over to

1301
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,880
my house and let me show you my plants,

1302
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:44,040
you know, like you you didn't want to

1303
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:49,358
tell anyone anything, you know, so, you

1304
00:58:44,039 --> 00:58:52,798
know, being anonymous was the key.

1305
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:55,519
Yeah, for sure. I I tell another story

1306
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:58,239
about how when I was already in

1307
00:58:55,519 --> 00:59:00,159
California, a friend knocked on my door

1308
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:02,399
one day.

1309
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:04,558
Oh yeah, that's the worst. He He didn't

1310
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,639
know I was growing. Oh yeah. And this is

1311
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:09,440
this is before peeping out windows

1312
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:11,039
looking to see who is it? And then all

1313
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,519
of a sudden you got to get enough

1314
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:15,920
[ __ ] balls to open up the open up the

1315
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:17,838
door to see who it is. And and it's your

1316
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:20,000
friend. You know, you're expecting like

1317
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:22,239
I was so [ __ ] pissed and he had no

1318
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,760
idea why cuz he didn't know I was

1319
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:25,118
growing. He had been to my house before,

1320
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,680
but when he came to my house, you know,

1321
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:29,440
there was nothing nothing out. And he

1322
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:30,960
stopped by my house and he's like, I was

1323
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,119
just in the neighbor. I was like, "Dude,

1324
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:36,240
don't ever [ __ ] come to my house

1325
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:38,318
without calling me first." I like And if

1326
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:40,078
anything, that was a big tell. Like, why

1327
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:44,159
got me so freaked out that I [ __ ]

1328
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:46,079
just stopped by to say hello? You know,

1329
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:47,440
paranoia. I feel like nothing's changed,

1330
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:48,559
you know, cuz if someone stops by

1331
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,679
without hitting you up, you're just

1332
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:51,760
like, "What? What the hell?" Like,

1333
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:55,039
"Who's at my door?" Well, I have kids,

1334
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:56,960
so my my my doorbell rings all the time,

1335
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:58,960
you know, like my neighbors kids are

1336
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:02,000
always knocking on the door wanting to

1337
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:03,760
find my kids and stuff. So, if I freaked

1338
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,838
out on them, it wouldn't be good. Yeah.

1339
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,920
I mean, I remember I was up at my house

1340
01:00:05,838 --> 01:00:10,318
up, you know, upstate in the in the cat

1341
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:12,240
skills and, you know, I'm talking about

1342
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:14,440
a secluded place where you don't even

1343
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:17,759
get cell service. You know what I mean?

1344
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:19,679
Like, so all of a sudden, I get a knock

1345
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,200
at the door. I'm like, "Oh my god, who

1346
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:23,039
is it?" You know? I'm [ __ ] peeking

1347
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:24,719
out the window. I'm like, "Don't answer

1348
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:26,719
the door. Don't answer the door." You

1349
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:29,039
know, they they leave. They leave a note

1350
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:31,279
there. It's a census. I didn't I didn't

1351
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:33,599
I didn't I didn't send in my census

1352
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:35,839
form. And so the census people were up

1353
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:38,559
there knocking on my door. But something

1354
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:42,719
as stupid as that became like a [ __ ]

1355
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:44,880
major [ __ ] you know, anxiety attack.

1356
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:47,598
And even, you know, up until today, I,

1357
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:50,880
you know, I have PSTD. You know, I have,

1358
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:53,838
you know, dreams of, you know, the cops

1359
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:56,240
coming for me and and running from the

1360
01:00:53,838 --> 01:00:58,558
cops and, you know, if you've been

1361
01:00:56,239 --> 01:01:00,798
busted, you know, and I've been busted

1362
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:03,519
multiple times, eight times, two

1363
01:01:00,798 --> 01:01:06,559
felonies, you know, but luckily all that

1364
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:09,159
stuff has now been uh, you know, it's

1365
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:11,519
all been cleaned off. Yes. because of

1366
01:01:09,159 --> 01:01:13,279
legalization, you know, but when you but

1367
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:16,000
when you've gone through that trauma of

1368
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:18,400
being locked up, being the having the

1369
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,798
cuffs on you, spending a day or two in

1370
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:23,039
jail, like it really does something to

1371
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:26,880
your psyche that that that you never

1372
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:31,079
really recover from, you know, and so um

1373
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,079
yeah, it it it's tough.

1374
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:38,719
Yeah, for for sure. People don't realize

1375
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:42,079
the mecca that the Catkills is for

1376
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:44,159
cannabis and has been for a long time,

1377
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:46,480
you know. Yeah, it has been. Well, you

1378
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:49,759
know, it's a place where you you're kind

1379
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:53,519
of secluded and everyone kind of minds

1380
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:56,640
their own business and you can kind of

1381
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:59,599
come and go unnoticed. Like, you know, I

1382
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:02,558
I lived at the end of a culac. I was the

1383
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:05,680
only house on the culac. I mean, there

1384
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:09,440
was one other one other uh house on my

1385
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:12,000
street. Like, it was very very secluded.

1386
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:14,318
Uh, but you know, I picked that location

1387
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,280
for a reason, you know, and I was up

1388
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:20,519
there for like 12 years and I never had

1389
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:24,079
a problem until one day

1390
01:02:20,519 --> 01:02:27,838
um I, you know, I was cutting and um,

1391
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:30,480
what happened was my septic um, it the

1392
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:33,440
the pipe got crushed outside the septic

1393
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:37,679
and so it it backed up. So I couldn't

1394
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:41,599
take a shower, you know, and stuff. So I

1395
01:02:37,679 --> 01:02:45,039
was cutting and when I was driving home,

1396
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:46,359
you know, down in 287, I got pulled over

1397
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:50,599
by the state

1398
01:02:46,358 --> 01:02:53,960
cops and it became this whole

1399
01:02:50,599 --> 01:02:58,720
ordeal where, you know, I had a

1400
01:02:53,960 --> 01:03:01,920
fertilizer bottle in the trunk and I I I

1401
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:04,078
just it was one fl one red flag after

1402
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,240
another. I just saw the whole thing

1403
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:08,798
envisioning the whole thing going down

1404
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:11,118
because really the New Jersey state cops

1405
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:14,000
couldn't do anything to me other than,

1406
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:16,400
you know, arrest me for the the the pipe

1407
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:19,318
I had and the gram or two of weed I had

1408
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:23,280
and then charged me with

1409
01:03:19,318 --> 01:03:26,159
DWI. But they were very [ __ ] curious

1410
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:31,280
about, you know, growing in the

1411
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:33,679
fertilizer bottle and such. And so like

1412
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,519
everything was in my name in the power

1413
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:37,598
department. The power was in my name.

1414
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:39,880
Everything was in my name. So I could

1415
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:42,640
just envisioning the New Jersey state

1416
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:45,440
police calling the New York State Police

1417
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:46,920
and say, "Hey, listen. We got this guy

1418
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:51,200
coming

1419
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:54,480
down state, you know, run his name." So

1420
01:03:51,199 --> 01:03:57,038
they run my name. They get the power.

1421
01:03:54,480 --> 01:04:00,240
They look at the power bill. I see. And

1422
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:03,760
I remember I remember cuz uh I was

1423
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:06,558
getting the I I'd get my power bill and

1424
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:09,200
they would give you a rating on how much

1425
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:13,760
power you were using and they would be

1426
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:16,480
like you you are number 100 out of 100

1427
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:18,480
out of the most used p you know you most

1428
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:20,240
used power in the area or some [ __ ] like

1429
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,960
that. And I remember showing my friend.

1430
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:27,279
I'm like, "Look at this." You know, and

1431
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:29,358
so like uh so I can I envision them

1432
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:31,039
calling, you know, the New York State

1433
01:04:29,358 --> 01:04:32,719
Police. Only thing they got to do is run

1434
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:35,599
the power record. Look at the power

1435
01:04:32,719 --> 01:04:37,519
record. Oh, it's it looks pretty high.

1436
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:39,519
Okay. So, we're going to go up and do a

1437
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:40,719
walk around. And that's what they would

1438
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:42,639
essentially would have done. They would

1439
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:44,558
have came up to the property. Look in

1440
01:04:42,639 --> 01:04:47,440
the trash. looked in. Well, there was

1441
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:49,599
never any trash cuz I I brought all my

1442
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:52,960
trash down state. Like there was no

1443
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:55,359
garbage collection there. So everything

1444
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:57,280
I brought out and but but they would

1445
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:59,279
what they would do is they would walk

1446
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:02,720
around the house to see if there was any

1447
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:05,039
tell signs of a grow, any smell, any

1448
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:07,358
anything that would tip them off to be

1449
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:08,960
able to try to get a warrant. And then

1450
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:11,358
the next thing they would do is try to

1451
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:13,838
make contact, try to find out when you

1452
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:16,960
were there, try to talk to you, just to

1453
01:05:13,838 --> 01:05:19,358
get you to open the door and such and

1454
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:22,599
and you know and just just anything to

1455
01:05:19,358 --> 01:05:26,480
tip them off so they can get a warrant.

1456
01:05:22,599 --> 01:05:28,559
So, I just, you know, I I envisioning

1457
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:32,159
all of this happening and I was just

1458
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:34,400
like starting to, you know, get popular

1459
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:36,318
with the seeds and everything and I was

1460
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,559
like, "Yo, this is not going to go down

1461
01:05:36,318 --> 01:05:40,719
like this." And so, I just pulled the

1462
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:43,280
plug, you know, I I shut the I shut the

1463
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:45,679
room down. And I I chopped every you

1464
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:48,319
know once I got well I had chopped at

1465
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:50,719
that time and I took everything out of

1466
01:05:48,318 --> 01:05:52,639
the out of the house all cuz it was

1467
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:54,719
drying and I was like man they might

1468
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:57,118
[ __ ] come at any time. So I was

1469
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:59,439
paranoid. So I [ __ ] moved all I had

1470
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:01,760
to bring all the wet weed down to the

1471
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:04,159
city and dried it down there and bagged

1472
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:06,799
it up. Then I had to get rid of the

1473
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:09,519
garbage and then I had to break down the

1474
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:11,679
room. And so the whole thing was like a

1475
01:06:09,519 --> 01:06:13,199
[ __ ] mad scramble within like a

1476
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:15,118
couple and then they never came. I don't

1477
01:06:13,199 --> 01:06:17,279
know if they ever came. They might I

1478
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:19,039
don't know, you know, there's but my

1479
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:21,599
main thing was just [ __ ] pulling the

1480
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:23,280
plug and get and ending the project cuz

1481
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:26,318
I had already been up there like 10 or

1482
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:29,280
like 12 years. So I mean that's a good

1483
01:06:26,318 --> 01:06:31,519
run in one [ __ ] spot, you know? So I

1484
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,599
was like I ain't going to press my luck

1485
01:06:31,519 --> 01:06:36,159
to see what's going to happen next. I'm

1486
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:37,760
just going to [ __ ] bail out now. So,

1487
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:39,679
and I, you know, and that's what I did.

1488
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,920
I shut it down. I sold the house. And

1489
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:44,719
then I decided to come to Colorado where

1490
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:46,720
I could, you know, grow legally and not

1491
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:49,358
have to worry about getting arrested.

1492
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:51,759
And I just wanted to make seeds at that

1493
01:06:49,358 --> 01:06:53,679
point. So, you know, and so that's

1494
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:56,000
really, you know, how I really wound up

1495
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:57,838
in Colorado was just that. And is that

1496
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,960
where you're at still? Yeah. But now I

1497
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:01,119
want to go back to because I see

1498
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:03,760
sometimes I see sometimes you're in New

1499
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:05,760
York City for like Yes. Yes. I want to

1500
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:08,000
go back to New York, but my wife doesn't

1501
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:10,559
want to go back. So, but now, I mean,

1502
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:13,519
when I came out to Colorado, Colorado

1503
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:15,760
was the mecca of the industry, of the

1504
01:07:13,519 --> 01:07:18,400
cannabis scene. Like, you they had just

1505
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:20,760
gone wrecked, the first wreck state.

1506
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:24,480
Like, that was in

1507
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:27,039
2015. And you know now as you know other

1508
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:29,920
states opened up people used their

1509
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:33,920
experience to go to you know different

1510
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:36,400
states and um you know so really like

1511
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:40,000
everyone that that was here that made

1512
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:42,160
you know kind of the mecca it's all gone

1513
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:45,920
now. There is there is no more scene

1514
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:49,038
here in in Colorado anymore. So now that

1515
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:50,960
scene exists in New York now. And so,

1516
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:53,039
and I don't think I don't really see it

1517
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:55,358
ever really going away there because New

1518
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:58,640
York is a very unique, you know, thing

1519
01:07:55,358 --> 01:08:01,679
in itself because you're dealing with a

1520
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:05,118
mass population of people with the

1521
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:07,679
majority of them having the money that

1522
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:09,440
they have to get whatever they want, you

1523
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:11,679
know, meaning like, you know, these some

1524
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,440
of these super rich people, you know,

1525
01:08:11,679 --> 01:08:15,279
they just don't want the best. They want

1526
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,679
the best of everything. And that was

1527
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:19,838
really how the Sour Diesel kind of fit

1528
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:23,759
into the whole equation of the New York

1529
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:27,759
scene was because it was like the

1530
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:31,039
quintessential the creme de creme of of

1531
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:33,039
cannabis at the time. And so, you know,

1532
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:34,640
just like everything else in life,

1533
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:36,399
people want the best. And when they have

1534
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,640
the money, they're willing to pay for

1535
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:40,559
it. And they, you know, and that's all

1536
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,319
that they want. They just want results.

1537
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:45,359
They don't want anything else but

1538
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:49,679
results. So when you deliver that, then

1539
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:52,960
you can charge $800 or $1,000 an ounce

1540
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:55,279
as AJ did and other people did. And

1541
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:57,880
because that's, you know, people wanted

1542
01:08:55,279 --> 01:09:00,159
their stuff, they would prepay for it.

1543
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:02,400
And, you know, that's how it went down

1544
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:05,920
back then. It just was not enough supply

1545
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:08,798
back then. So, um, you know, you're

1546
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:10,880
dealing with a whole different type of

1547
01:09:08,798 --> 01:09:13,359
customer out there and and it still

1548
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:16,159
exists today to where, you know, we're

1549
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:18,000
doing these popup events and it's just

1550
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:20,238
people, you know, it's basically people

1551
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,560
that got, you know, two, three, four,

1552
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:24,718
five lights and, you know, we all come

1553
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:27,359
together and, you know, we have these

1554
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:29,600
popup events and people could come and

1555
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:32,319
they can go from table to table and they

1556
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:34,640
could look for the best sour diesel or

1557
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:36,798
the best kush or whatever they're

1558
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:40,560
looking for and they, you know, or they

1559
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:43,359
might like a specific grower or or or

1560
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:46,960
whatever. And so they it gives the

1561
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:49,838
consumer an opportunity to get a a

1562
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:52,079
higher product and it gives the farmers

1563
01:09:49,838 --> 01:09:54,880
an opportunity to move their product

1564
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:58,319
straight to consumer. And so and is this

1565
01:09:54,880 --> 01:10:00,640
safe? And it's safe. Yes. You know, it's

1566
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:02,799
not legal, right? It's not legal. No.

1567
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:05,600
And so, you know, and and I think, you

1568
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:08,320
know, that model is going to continue to

1569
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:11,920
exist because I don't think that the New

1570
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:13,920
York market is going to be able to um be

1571
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:17,279
able to compete with the product, you

1572
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:19,600
know, like I mean, there might be some a

1573
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:21,519
few, but like anyone that's mass-

1574
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:23,039
prodducing any of these, the only people

1575
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:25,520
that are going to be able to compete

1576
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:27,519
with that are the micro grows. That's

1577
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:29,920
it. You know, if you're one of these

1578
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:33,120
guys that got or people that have a

1579
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:34,800
brand Well, that's Well, see, that's

1580
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:37,679
that that's the thing where the New York

1581
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:41,520
market is. is now if you're a uh if

1582
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:43,920
you're a wck grower like you can't like

1583
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:46,840
you got to sell your you got to sell

1584
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:49,679
your guy to a you to a

1585
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:51,920
distributor and then the distributor I

1586
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:55,079
don't know I don't know who brands if

1587
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:57,520
it's the distributor or or the

1588
01:10:55,079 --> 01:10:58,800
dispensary. So like essentially like

1589
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:01,880
you'd have to, you know, it doesn't

1590
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:04,079
matter what your flower brand is as a

1591
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:07,520
grower. If they're not going to brand

1592
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:10,079
your flower as such, they can brand it

1593
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:13,280
any way they want to.

1594
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:15,840
So you can't brand your own weed there,

1595
01:11:13,279 --> 01:11:18,319
you know, and really uh essentially what

1596
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:20,800
happens is all the power now becomes of

1597
01:11:18,319 --> 01:11:22,880
the broker because the broker is the one

1598
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:25,679
that's going to that that is the

1599
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:27,600
middleman between the farmer and the

1600
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:29,679
dispensary. So, you got to sell to the

1601
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:32,239
broker and the broker can be like,

1602
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:35,440
"Well, I'm only going to give you so

1603
01:11:32,238 --> 01:11:37,599
much for it or, you know, and then he

1604
01:11:35,439 --> 01:11:40,079
can turn around on the other side, you

1605
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:42,960
know, it doesn't matter what, you know,

1606
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:44,800
on on the retail side of it, it doesn't

1607
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,279
matter what they pay for, they're just

1608
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:48,320
going to they're just going to charge

1609
01:11:46,279 --> 01:11:50,479
double, right?" So, that's pretty much

1610
01:11:48,319 --> 01:11:53,439
how retail works. So, as a dispensary,

1611
01:11:50,479 --> 01:11:57,198
you're going to buy a wholesale pound

1612
01:11:53,439 --> 01:11:58,799
and just double it at the minimum. At

1613
01:11:57,198 --> 01:12:02,919
the minimum, you're going to double your

1614
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:06,159
money on that. So, you know,

1615
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:09,600
as so, you know, those guys are are are

1616
01:12:06,158 --> 01:12:12,879
going to be making just as much as as

1617
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:14,480
the farmer, so to speak. you know, of

1618
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:16,880
course they got to move the product and

1619
01:12:14,479 --> 01:12:20,079
everyone's got to deal with o overhead

1620
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:22,960
prices and everything, but you know, as

1621
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:25,359
as the market, you know, shakes out, you

1622
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:28,079
know, it always seems, you know, even in

1623
01:12:25,359 --> 01:12:30,519
regular agriculture that the farmer

1624
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:33,039
always gets the short end of the

1625
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:34,600
stick and he's the one that's producing

1626
01:12:33,039 --> 01:12:37,119
the

1627
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:39,760
product. And so I think that's, you

1628
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:42,960
know, a tragedy especially in cannabis

1629
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:45,119
and really in in in in in any kind of

1630
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:48,158
agriculture because if you know if

1631
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:50,719
you're do putting in the hard work, you

1632
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:53,279
know, you should be able to at least

1633
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:55,520
have the opportunity to sell to the

1634
01:12:53,279 --> 01:12:57,198
consumer. Now, you know, in some

1635
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:59,199
instances, some people might not be

1636
01:12:57,198 --> 01:13:02,000
geared to sell to the consumer and they

1637
01:12:59,198 --> 01:13:06,479
only want to sell wholesale, but you

1638
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:08,960
know, as as a micro craft former, that's

1639
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:12,678
what you want and that's where I think

1640
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,679
it's going to be profitable.

1641
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:17,839
You know, one question or one topic that

1642
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,920
we've brought up here a number of times

1643
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:22,719
in the podcast and I'd like to hear what

1644
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:25,279
you think is how do you define a craft

1645
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:27,119
grower?

1646
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:30,399
That's a hard that's a hard question,

1647
01:13:27,119 --> 01:13:32,399
you know? And so I guess at the end of

1648
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:35,359
the day it would be like the product. I

1649
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:39,119
mean the quality of your product, right?

1650
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:42,799
You know, and so and then I guess then

1651
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:44,800
you can break it down to how many lights

1652
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:47,199
and then you could break it down to is

1653
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:49,760
it organic and then you could just keep

1654
01:13:47,198 --> 01:13:53,678
breaking it down more and more. I guess

1655
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:58,159
if I guess to where what your definition

1656
01:13:53,679 --> 01:14:02,158
of craft is, but like to me craft is

1657
01:13:58,158 --> 01:14:05,119
more smallcaled should we say now what

1658
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:08,879
that number of lights or what that

1659
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:12,800
square footage is is hard to say. took

1660
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:16,119
because you know even in you know a

1661
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:19,279
black market grow you know is it 10

1662
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:19,880
lights is it 20 lights like what where

1663
01:14:19,279 --> 01:14:24,000
where where

1664
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:27,440
where is it you know where where it is

1665
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:30,479
is is it's too much for one person. But

1666
01:14:27,439 --> 01:14:33,678
now if if if you have two lights and

1667
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:35,759
it's crap, you're not crap. Right.

1668
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:39,079
Right. You're not crap. Now and if you

1669
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:41,679
have a 100 lights and it's

1670
01:14:39,079 --> 01:14:43,760
fire, is that crap? Yeah, you can

1671
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:46,158
consider that, you know, but that is a

1672
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:48,640
lot of, you know, to pull that off. Now,

1673
01:14:46,158 --> 01:14:51,519
I'm not saying that it's not possible,

1674
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:55,199
but it it's a lot of work, you know, and

1675
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:57,840
the guy with two lights can give his x

1676
01:14:55,198 --> 01:15:01,039
amount of plans way more attention than

1677
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:04,239
the person with a 100 lights. Now, if

1678
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:05,679
you got what if the guy with 100 lights

1679
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:08,879
has 50? Yeah, I was just going to say

1680
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:12,480
now if he's got like a you know you know

1681
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:15,359
that many employees but there's you know

1682
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:18,678
there's a balance of of a business of

1683
01:15:15,359 --> 01:15:20,599
the business part of it where you know

1684
01:15:18,679 --> 01:15:22,960
expenses take

1685
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:25,199
over. You know what I'm saying? So it

1686
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:28,640
doesn't you know there it's a very fine

1687
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:31,119
balance of trying to find um trying to

1688
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:33,360
find that that craft mark. I don't I

1689
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:35,840
don't know what it is. And and in

1690
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:39,679
theory, you would think the smaller the

1691
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:43,039
better, easier. Now, you know, if once

1692
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:45,359
you get that model down, can you upscale

1693
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:48,158
that model into something bigger? That's

1694
01:15:45,359 --> 01:15:52,359
the question now. Is it 100 lights? All

1695
01:15:48,158 --> 01:15:55,559
right. But is that 10 10 rooms with 10

1696
01:15:52,359 --> 01:15:57,559
lights or is that 20 rooms with five

1697
01:15:55,560 --> 01:16:03,719
lights?

1698
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:06,480
like is that possible you know so you

1699
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:09,279
know I think you know there's a lot to

1700
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:12,319
be you know dis discovered in all that

1701
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:15,319
because most people that are going to do

1702
01:16:12,319 --> 01:16:18,880
a 100 lights just got one room with 100

1703
01:16:15,319 --> 01:16:21,119
lights. They don't have 10 rooms with 10

1704
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:25,960
lights because now they got to have 10

1705
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:28,760
air conditioning units, 10 uh

1706
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:31,760
dehumidifiers, 10 of 10 more of

1707
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:34,800
everything, you know. And so I think a

1708
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:39,280
lot of it has to do with the cost of

1709
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:42,079
things where people and I've seen this

1710
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:44,079
over and over again where they get, you

1711
01:16:42,079 --> 01:16:46,399
know, x amount of million dollars, they

1712
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:49,519
build out a grow and then they find out

1713
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:51,920
the grow the grow rooms aren't aren't

1714
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,719
designed properly and they're like,

1715
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:56,560
well, we spent $10 million, you know,

1716
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:58,880
well, you know, you guess what, you

1717
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:02,000
know, you got to spend another$2 million

1718
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:06,440
to rectify, you know, the engineering uh

1719
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:09,600
defects in there and and so that's you

1720
01:17:06,439 --> 01:17:11,759
know a part of the problem where you got

1721
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,920
people that are in cannabis that

1722
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:16,159
necessarily don't belong in cannabis.

1723
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:18,239
They don't come from they don't come

1724
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:20,879
from they don't come from the culture.

1725
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:23,039
They come from a business background and

1726
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:25,920
they see everything in dollars and

1727
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:28,800
cents, which you know, let's face it, to

1728
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:31,920
to run a successful business, you have

1729
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:35,079
to have a sense of that, you know, but

1730
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:40,000
you also got to have a sense of a

1731
01:17:35,079 --> 01:17:42,079
long-term plan in sight of experience on

1732
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:45,279
exactly, you know, how you're going to

1733
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:47,600
do things. And so when you get a guy

1734
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:50,559
that is, you know, you get some guy

1735
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:54,320
that's a real estate guy that got a got

1736
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:56,880
a a legal license and he's got $10

1737
01:17:54,319 --> 01:18:00,000
million and, you know, now all of a

1738
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:02,480
sudden he, you know, uh, employ, you

1739
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,158
know, employs one of these consultants

1740
01:18:02,479 --> 01:18:07,119
and he don't know what the [ __ ] he's

1741
01:18:04,158 --> 01:18:09,599
doing and and, you know, and it just,

1742
01:18:07,119 --> 01:18:12,640
you know, just a downhill effect all the

1743
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:16,560
way down of of people of incompetency.

1744
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:19,199
that are designing and building and and

1745
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:22,880
setting up businesses that they have no

1746
01:18:19,198 --> 01:18:26,158
idea of of of how it really works.

1747
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:28,880
Because in theory, you could have x

1748
01:18:26,158 --> 01:18:30,960
amount of plants that's going to produce

1749
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:34,239
x amount of pounds and you're going to

1750
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:37,439
get e x amount per pound, you know, and

1751
01:18:34,238 --> 01:18:39,279
then on paper, you know, it all [ __ ]

1752
01:18:37,439 --> 01:18:43,279
it's all at work, you know, you want to

1753
01:18:39,279 --> 01:18:45,359
be [ __ ] super profitable, but it at

1754
01:18:43,279 --> 01:18:46,679
the end of the day when when you know,

1755
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:49,119
you fail your

1756
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:51,600
testing, you can't get your product out

1757
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:53,760
the door or you get your product out the

1758
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:56,960
door and it's worse. half of what you

1759
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:59,480
thought it was going to be. And so, you

1760
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:02,960
know, and when you got these big

1761
01:18:59,479 --> 01:19:06,158
investments and, you know, investors,

1762
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:09,679
you know, to answer to and things aren't

1763
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:11,439
running like they supposed to. Um, you

1764
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:13,440
know, that it it just doesn't work, you

1765
01:19:11,439 --> 01:19:15,359
know, but on paper, I mean, it really

1766
01:19:13,439 --> 01:19:17,599
does work, you know, but at the end of

1767
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:18,960
the day, you got to sell all your [ __ ]

1768
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:21,199
you know what I mean? And if you can't

1769
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:23,840
sell it, sell it. it, you know, what

1770
01:19:21,198 --> 01:19:26,879
what's it worth? It's only worth what

1771
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:30,960
people are willing to give you.

1772
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:33,520
Yeah, for sure. Um, my my opinion on

1773
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:35,439
what a craft grower is is has been

1774
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:38,159
evolving and still trying to figure it

1775
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:40,158
out. So, I appreciate you uh giving your

1776
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:43,599
feedback on that. I remember when I

1777
01:19:40,158 --> 01:19:44,359
asked Kevin what he thought because you

1778
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:47,360
know

1779
01:19:44,359 --> 01:19:50,479
originally my thought was look if you

1780
01:19:47,359 --> 01:19:53,238
grow this with love and with the

1781
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:57,519
intention of growing the highest quality

1782
01:19:53,238 --> 01:19:59,678
product you know to me that's crap if it

1783
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:01,520
if it comes out like that just because

1784
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:03,279
you're Kevin said just because you have

1785
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:05,520
those intentions don't mean the results

1786
01:20:03,279 --> 01:20:08,000
are going to be that. So that that's

1787
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:10,800
what Kevin said. Kevin said the road to

1788
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:13,279
hell was built with good intention, you

1789
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:17,679
know. So, it's exactly that. But, you

1790
01:20:13,279 --> 01:20:20,319
know, one thing about size is that I

1791
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:21,399
believe that, you know, some of the

1792
01:20:20,319 --> 01:20:25,119
larger

1793
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:27,359
facilities, they also have

1794
01:20:25,119 --> 01:20:30,800
um, you know, they've built nicer

1795
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:34,479
growrooms with more control, you know,

1796
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:37,679
with, you know, monitoring that small

1797
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:42,399
growers don't have. So, I don't think

1798
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:44,800
that size is really what decides if it's

1799
01:20:42,399 --> 01:20:47,119
craft. I mean, in the end, it's the

1800
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,520
quality that comes out. If the quality

1801
01:20:47,119 --> 01:20:51,198
is really good, then I think that can be

1802
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:54,159
called craft cannabis, no matter what

1803
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:58,000
the size of the garden is. Um, you know,

1804
01:20:54,158 --> 01:21:00,158
I'm a member of a group on Reddit and

1805
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,640
it's called Craft Marijuana. That's

1806
01:21:00,158 --> 01:21:04,960
actually where I met

1807
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:07,679
Cosmic. And um I was in the moderator

1808
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:09,198
chat and this was the the topic that was

1809
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:12,399
always coming up. They would say, "Well,

1810
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:14,319
you know, this room is too big, you

1811
01:21:12,399 --> 01:21:17,759
know, so that can't be craft because

1812
01:21:14,319 --> 01:21:20,399
he's got over 30 lights." And, you know,

1813
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:22,719
they they wouldn't want to post that

1814
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:25,198
stuff. Or, you know, if it was a tent

1815
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:27,719
garden and the guy wasn't doing a

1816
01:21:25,198 --> 01:21:31,279
perfect job, they didn't want to post

1817
01:21:27,719 --> 01:21:32,719
that. And, you know, I felt like, hey,

1818
01:21:31,279 --> 01:21:36,079
you know what? if you're growing with

1819
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:37,760
love and like I said the intention of

1820
01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:39,158
growing the highest quality product that

1821
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:42,000
that your goal

1822
01:21:39,158 --> 01:21:44,319
isn't to how do I make the most money

1823
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,800
but if your goal is how do I grow the

1824
01:21:44,319 --> 01:21:50,158
best weed I like to think of that as

1825
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:53,320
craft but you know as we continue to

1826
01:21:50,158 --> 01:21:55,599
have the discussion I realized that you

1827
01:21:53,319 --> 01:21:58,719
know I still don't know what craft can

1828
01:21:55,600 --> 01:22:01,360
be but also like with them in doing that

1829
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:03,600
they're really not really helping anyone

1830
01:22:01,359 --> 01:22:06,079
Because even though that person might

1831
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:08,239
have the right intentions, he might be

1832
01:22:06,079 --> 01:22:10,399
doing something wrong. And whereas

1833
01:22:08,238 --> 01:22:12,718
someone in the group could help him to

1834
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:14,799
point out, hey, listen, this is what's

1835
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:17,760
working for me or I see that you're

1836
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:20,719
doing this wrong or or whatever. And you

1837
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:22,639
know and really you know the you know

1838
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:24,960
when you were in those groups and even

1839
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:27,199
you know when we were on the forums back

1840
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:29,039
in the day that's what it was all about

1841
01:22:27,198 --> 01:22:31,039
was trying to help each other you know

1842
01:22:29,039 --> 01:22:33,279
because everyone didn't have the

1843
01:22:31,039 --> 01:22:35,760
information that they have today. You

1844
01:22:33,279 --> 01:22:38,158
know, back then, you know, there was a

1845
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:40,960
few books that you you were a few grow

1846
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:44,799
books that you were able to get maybe in

1847
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:47,119
some kind of underground uh bookstore or

1848
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:49,039
in in the back of high times and then,

1849
01:22:47,119 --> 01:22:51,760
you know, then you'd have to get those

1850
01:22:49,039 --> 01:22:55,198
High Times mailed to your house. So, it

1851
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:58,480
was always a, you know, a big deal and

1852
01:22:55,198 --> 01:22:59,678
trying to uh purchase information and,

1853
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:01,439
you know, and so when you're dealing

1854
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:04,158
with people that are all doing the same

1855
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:06,719
thing and, you know, maybe, you know,

1856
01:23:04,158 --> 01:23:09,119
people using different methods and and

1857
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:11,359
and really that's was really, you know,

1858
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:14,238
the the the forms kind of brought all of

1859
01:23:11,359 --> 01:23:17,439
that together and then it also helped,

1860
01:23:14,238 --> 01:23:19,238
you know, shape the community whereas,

1861
01:23:17,439 --> 01:23:21,678
you know, someone in

1862
01:23:19,238 --> 01:23:24,238
California could mail someone in New

1863
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:26,880
York a clone in New York can send

1864
01:23:24,238 --> 01:23:28,799
someone to someone in California. So

1865
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:31,920
then then there you know there you know

1866
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:34,320
it also opened up this big exchange of

1867
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:37,359
of genetics that you know we we never

1868
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:39,599
saw before where before like you had to

1869
01:23:37,359 --> 01:23:42,238
know someone like you know like if you

1870
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:45,120
didn't know those guys in in Virginia if

1871
01:23:42,238 --> 01:23:46,559
you didn't know who who Greg was like

1872
01:23:45,119 --> 01:23:49,198
you know you never would have gotten any

1873
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:50,960
of those cuts or anything because you

1874
01:23:49,198 --> 01:23:53,119
know and back then it was like it was

1875
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:56,079
about all about who you knew and it was

1876
01:23:53,119 --> 01:23:58,238
really a very small niche community

1877
01:23:56,079 --> 01:24:00,000
where you weren't going around telling

1878
01:23:58,238 --> 01:24:01,279
people, "Yeah, I'm a grower this and

1879
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,679
that," you know, you kept everything

1880
01:24:01,279 --> 01:24:06,000
under wraps. So when you when you

1881
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:08,880
finally when when one grower actually

1882
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:12,000
finally did, you know, meet another

1883
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:13,840
grower under the right circumstances,

1884
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,840
you know, it was like a match made in

1885
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:18,400
heaven because, you know, you know, you

1886
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:20,719
had some two alike minds and they could

1887
01:24:18,399 --> 01:24:23,519
exchange in information. They could

1888
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:25,920
exchange genetics and so it just opened

1889
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:28,159
up, you know, all of this, you know,

1890
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:31,520
information for everyone and, you know,

1891
01:24:28,158 --> 01:24:33,839
the genetics also. And so, you know, you

1892
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:36,719
know, that's one thing about, you know,

1893
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:38,719
um, you know, the American weed scene is

1894
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:40,960
we're very passionate. You know, we've

1895
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:43,840
always been very passionate from from

1896
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:46,079
the very beginning. And, you know, and

1897
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:47,760
that's what is kind of what what kind of

1898
01:24:46,079 --> 01:24:50,559
drives us, I think, you know, and it

1899
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:53,280
sets us apart from people in Amsterdam

1900
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:55,280
and people in Spain and people anywhere,

1901
01:24:53,279 --> 01:24:57,599
you know, because now we're we're the

1902
01:24:55,279 --> 01:25:00,158
weed mecca of the world right now.

1903
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:03,920
everyone is watching what the what we

1904
01:25:00,158 --> 01:25:06,158
are doing and and so uh you know we just

1905
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:08,319
got to just keep you know trying to keep

1906
01:25:06,158 --> 01:25:10,719
you know moving things forward in the

1907
01:25:08,319 --> 01:25:13,439
right way and you know and I think

1908
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:16,399
helping people and to encourage people

1909
01:25:13,439 --> 01:25:18,559
to grow and you know like for me I'm I

1910
01:25:16,399 --> 01:25:21,839
know I sell seeds so like the home

1911
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:23,840
grower is my customer you know that guy

1912
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:26,000
that's you know that wants to start

1913
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:28,639
something in a tent with one or two

1914
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:31,279
lights and you know he he's reading

1915
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:33,840
about the sour diesel but he can't get

1916
01:25:31,279 --> 01:25:35,439
the sour diesel clones so he could buy

1917
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:37,760
my seeds and try to get a good

1918
01:25:35,439 --> 01:25:40,000
representation of it and so that's

1919
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:42,639
always been kind of like you know when I

1920
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,639
was breeding it was always about

1921
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:46,639
preservation for me in the beginning

1922
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:48,400
like we would get certain clones and we

1923
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:50,639
would lose them and then be like oh

1924
01:25:48,399 --> 01:25:52,638
they're gone forever you know and and I

1925
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:55,440
would and I'd be selling the weed and so

1926
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:56,800
customers I had direct feedback from the

1927
01:25:55,439 --> 01:25:58,399
customer and I'd Like they'd be like,

1928
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,760
"Yeah, I like that Northern Lights." And

1929
01:25:58,399 --> 01:26:02,000
I'd be like, "Mike, what happened to the

1930
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:04,159
Northern Lights?" "Oh, we lost it." I'm

1931
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:07,600
like, "Dude, you know, like that [ __ ]

1932
01:26:04,158 --> 01:26:10,238
was [ __ ] you know, popular." And so,

1933
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:12,079
um, you know, so when I started growing,

1934
01:26:10,238 --> 01:26:14,479
you know, and started coming in contact

1935
01:26:12,079 --> 01:26:15,840
with some of these clone only strains, I

1936
01:26:14,479 --> 01:26:17,678
was like, I got to, you know, at least

1937
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,880
try to make some kind of, you know,

1938
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:20,800
cross or get some kind of

1939
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:23,440
representation. Even if it's not an

1940
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:26,079
exact cross of what it is, if it's 70

1941
01:26:23,439 --> 01:26:29,599
80% of what it is, that's a home run for

1942
01:26:26,079 --> 01:26:33,198
me. So, so is that that, you know, and

1943
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:36,639
so trying to, you know, and so I use my

1944
01:26:33,198 --> 01:26:39,678
experience and my taste in in, you know,

1945
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:42,079
with the sour diesel and with the hazes.

1946
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:44,880
And so I try to recreate those

1947
01:26:42,079 --> 01:26:46,960
experience for other people to try. So

1948
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:49,520
they can buy a pack of seeds and they

1949
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:52,960
can get the sourd or or they can get the

1950
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:55,040
pith or they can get the chem or or or

1951
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:57,198
whatever. So that's really, you know,

1952
01:26:55,039 --> 01:26:59,920
what's really been, you know, my main

1953
01:26:57,198 --> 01:27:02,319
focus in in breeding. And, you know,

1954
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:04,880
it's always been trying to move and also

1955
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:07,840
try just trying to move the, you know,

1956
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:10,000
the gene pool forward as as we as as we

1957
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:12,319
go along. We just want the gene pool to

1958
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:15,198
get better and better and we've, you

1959
01:27:12,319 --> 01:27:18,639
know, you know, if and you know, looking

1960
01:27:15,198 --> 01:27:20,879
back, you know, 30 years of smoking, 30,

1961
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:23,760
40 years of smoking weed, you know, I

1962
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:26,480
can I can I can say that we've really

1963
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:30,079
moved things forward. When I first

1964
01:27:26,479 --> 01:27:33,039
smoked that first joint in 1979 of some

1965
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:35,279
Mexican or some Colombian crap or

1966
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:37,600
whatever, where that doesn't even exist

1967
01:27:35,279 --> 01:27:41,039
anymore. You don't you don't see those

1968
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:43,679
Mexi mids or Jamaicans or any of that

1969
01:27:41,039 --> 01:27:46,880
imports anymore. Actually, now from what

1970
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:50,039
I hear, we we export where where people

1971
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:54,480
in California are exporting to to the

1972
01:27:50,039 --> 01:27:57,359
UK, to Thailand, to to Europe. Like

1973
01:27:54,479 --> 01:28:00,000
people want, you know, to try the runs,

1974
01:27:57,359 --> 01:28:02,079
they want to try the sherbets and all

1975
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,479
these other, you know, all these strains

1976
01:28:02,079 --> 01:28:06,880
that they they see and read about on the

1977
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:09,759
internet. And you know and that's why

1978
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:12,960
you know the internet is a very you know

1979
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:14,480
powerful tool in communication you know

1980
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:16,880
cuz you know you you know you could put

1981
01:28:14,479 --> 01:28:19,599
up a and I could just speak from my own

1982
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:22,159
experience. you put up a a dank picture

1983
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:24,239
or something of of of a plant someone

1984
01:28:22,158 --> 01:28:26,079
grew from your seeds and like yo that

1985
01:28:24,238 --> 01:28:29,439
looks dank you know I want to get some

1986
01:28:26,079 --> 01:28:34,238
of that you know and so you know it's

1987
01:28:29,439 --> 01:28:36,319
very powerful the you know the internet

1988
01:28:34,238 --> 01:28:41,238
speaking of which where do you find your

1989
01:28:36,319 --> 01:28:44,960
seeds now um I pretty much sell my seeds

1990
01:28:41,238 --> 01:28:47,759
wholesale to uh you know many different

1991
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:50,079
people that sell um on Instagram. They

1992
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:52,719
also have websites and stuff like that.

1993
01:28:50,079 --> 01:28:56,880
I couldn't really name all of them, but

1994
01:28:52,719 --> 01:29:00,000
I also uh sell seeds direct from from me

1995
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:03,719
to the customer. If you if you email me

1996
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:06,079
at topdog seeds at

1997
01:29:03,719 --> 01:29:08,960
protonmmail.com, you email me, I'll send

1998
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:11,519
you a list and you can pick out what you

1999
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:15,039
want and we can move forward if you

2000
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:18,480
want. Um, I haven't really, um, set up

2001
01:29:15,039 --> 01:29:22,000
any kind of a, uh, legal website or

2002
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:26,399
anything like that. Uh, just because,

2003
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:29,719
you know, of of processing problems and

2004
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:34,799
pretty much payment stuff like that is,

2005
01:29:29,719 --> 01:29:38,560
uh, you know, and top dog is to o p a

2006
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:42,560
wg. Correct. Correct. So, he doesn't he

2007
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:45,600
doesn't call it top dog. It's D A WG.

2008
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:47,760
Yeah. Rich. And to be honest with you,

2009
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:51,199
or not, you know, I'm always honest, but

2010
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:54,960
uh I've been looking at your your posts

2011
01:29:51,198 --> 01:29:56,960
and stuff and the sour is it the ones

2012
01:29:54,960 --> 01:30:01,119
that I'm seeing photos of. Are those F5

2013
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:03,520
or F6? Um most of them are F5s. I think

2014
01:30:01,119 --> 01:30:07,198
there are a few F6s that are out there

2015
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:09,600
now. Um, so when I started the sour

2016
01:30:07,198 --> 01:30:12,158
project, um, I pretty much, you know,

2017
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:16,000
had the original sour clone that we had

2018
01:30:12,158 --> 01:30:19,920
from AJ back from the, you know, late

2019
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:21,679
90s, early 2000s. So I had that and I I

2020
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:25,880
crossed it with the the trade dog and

2021
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:29,199
the trade dog was Afghan chem and then c

2022
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:31,279
backcrossed two more times to the chem.

2023
01:30:29,198 --> 01:30:34,960
So when I made that when I made that

2024
01:30:31,279 --> 01:30:37,920
mail, you know, I kind of was trying to

2025
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:40,399
uh duplicate the chem, which I never

2026
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:42,319
did. Like I, you know, I had gotten some

2027
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:44,479
chem I did the same thing with the chem

2028
01:30:42,319 --> 01:30:47,519
dog and never got I was really looking

2029
01:30:44,479 --> 01:30:49,799
for that garlic onion chem like and I

2030
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:52,560
really more or less got kind of like a

2031
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:55,000
chemy kind of, you know, so I wasn't

2032
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:58,000
really particularly happy with the

2033
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:01,198
overall results of that. But, you know,

2034
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:03,439
when I made that, I made it for also to

2035
01:31:01,198 --> 01:31:05,519
try to make the best male, like the the

2036
01:31:03,439 --> 01:31:07,759
strongest weed and the best male. So,

2037
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:10,719
that was kind of my starting point, you

2038
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:14,079
know. So, I just decided to make that an

2039
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:16,880
outcross male. So, you know, so that

2040
01:31:14,079 --> 01:31:20,279
that that that plant kind of grew kind

2041
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:23,520
of short, stocky, kind of Afghan kind of

2042
01:31:20,279 --> 01:31:26,039
chem structure. And so I crossed that to

2043
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:28,400
the to the sour diesel which was tall,

2044
01:31:26,039 --> 01:31:31,560
stretchy, you know, kind of almost a

2045
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:35,759
different, you know, opposite uh growth

2046
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:38,800
structure. And so, you know, I I I c I

2047
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:41,440
backrossed it three times, you know, and

2048
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:44,960
trying to, you know, trying to get in as

2049
01:31:41,439 --> 01:31:47,759
much um of the sour genetics as

2050
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:50,158
possible. And so then I from the back

2051
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:54,320
cross three that's when I started you

2052
01:31:50,158 --> 01:31:56,238
know doing the F2s to F3s. And so when I

2053
01:31:54,319 --> 01:31:58,079
was making my selection throughout the

2054
01:31:56,238 --> 01:32:00,559
whole process, it was kind of easy

2055
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:04,079
because I was always looking for the the

2056
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:08,320
the taller stretchier plants that were

2057
01:32:04,079 --> 01:32:10,639
more kind of chem I mean sour diesel in

2058
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:13,279
structure where you know we where I

2059
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:16,239
would get some that were shorter and

2060
01:32:13,279 --> 01:32:18,880
some are kind of medium bushier type of

2061
01:32:16,238 --> 01:32:22,000
plants you know so the sour diesel has a

2062
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:24,239
very unique growth structure and it's

2063
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:26,079
very distinguishable. able. So that's

2064
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:29,919
how I would, you know, make my

2065
01:32:26,079 --> 01:32:32,158
selections as as I went along. And so,

2066
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:35,119
uh, you know, I would I would, you know,

2067
01:32:32,158 --> 01:32:37,920
I would get a female and I would try to

2068
01:32:35,119 --> 01:32:40,399
get the the, you know, the the growth

2069
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:42,600
and the smell and and then I would just

2070
01:32:40,399 --> 01:32:44,799
try to find a male that had the same

2071
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:47,360
structure. And obviously, like, you

2072
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:49,199
really can't test that male out until,

2073
01:32:47,359 --> 01:32:51,439
you know, you grow the plants out. And

2074
01:32:49,198 --> 01:32:53,599
so, you know, you just really got to

2075
01:32:51,439 --> 01:32:57,678
make a conscious decision on on

2076
01:32:53,600 --> 01:33:00,920
selection and and and just and just move

2077
01:32:57,679 --> 01:33:03,840
forward and just trying to keep keep it

2078
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:06,800
going and keep in breeding as you go

2079
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:09,360
along until you find exactly what you're

2080
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:11,199
looking for. And so, in the early in

2081
01:33:09,359 --> 01:33:13,359
early ones, you know, we were getting

2082
01:33:11,198 --> 01:33:15,678
like a a lot of shorter, bushier plants.

2083
01:33:13,359 --> 01:33:17,519
I mean, they did have the sour profiles,

2084
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:19,840
the smell to them, but, you know, I was

2085
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:21,840
really looking for the structure more.

2086
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:24,880
And so, you know, I've really bred it

2087
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:27,520
back to to the F6s now. And they're

2088
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:30,039
pretty much coming out pretty uh, you

2089
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:33,600
know, pretty pretty

2090
01:33:30,039 --> 01:33:36,079
uh, stable, pretty uh, in structure

2091
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:37,840
where not every not everyone, but

2092
01:33:36,079 --> 01:33:40,079
they're they're all pretty much alike.

2093
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:42,480
you know, you might get a few that are

2094
01:33:40,079 --> 01:33:45,840
kind of still on the shorter squad side,

2095
01:33:42,479 --> 01:33:47,759
but um I'm just really trying to get

2096
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:51,119
everything to where it's all kind of

2097
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:54,639
like the same. And so we're it it's

2098
01:33:51,119 --> 01:33:56,719
getting a lot closer now. And so, um I

2099
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:59,400
just kind of like held back now. I've

2100
01:33:56,719 --> 01:34:03,359
done the F6. I just did a remake of the

2101
01:33:59,399 --> 01:34:06,000
F6. And so, um, I'm I got a couple

2102
01:34:03,359 --> 01:34:08,238
selections now that I've kind of have

2103
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:11,520
out that I want to kind of just grow

2104
01:34:08,238 --> 01:34:13,279
out, um, and see, you know, how good

2105
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:15,880
they are and maybe get them into

2106
01:34:13,279 --> 01:34:18,399
production and, you know, see

2107
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:20,319
exactly, you know, h how it how it, you

2108
01:34:18,399 --> 01:34:22,960
know, how it turns out. But, you know,

2109
01:34:20,319 --> 01:34:25,119
it's funny how everyone is like, "Oh,

2110
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:27,520
where's the sour? What happened to it?

2111
01:34:25,119 --> 01:34:28,800
It's not around anymore." And and you

2112
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:30,719
know, like I was saying before, there

2113
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:33,600
was only one cut in the very beginning.

2114
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:36,000
And so really, you know, as those as

2115
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:39,000
those cuts spread out, I think what what

2116
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:43,039
happens is, you know, you you you know,

2117
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:45,439
the the the plant is going to adapt to

2118
01:34:43,039 --> 01:34:47,519
the different conditions. So, if you're

2119
01:34:45,439 --> 01:34:51,759
if you're if you're running your room

2120
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:54,560
with organics and uh soil and I'm

2121
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:57,840
running mine with hydroponics and salts

2122
01:34:54,560 --> 01:35:00,320
and my grows got it's got PM, it's got

2123
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:03,239
mites, it's got this, it's got that, you

2124
01:35:00,319 --> 01:35:06,000
know, I think over over a period of

2125
01:35:03,238 --> 01:35:08,638
time, you know, my sour is going to be

2126
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:11,600
different than your sour. And so a lot

2127
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:15,600
and I pick a lot of sour you know at

2128
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:16,440
this point the sour is like what like

2129
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:19,679
the

2130
01:35:16,439 --> 01:35:25,439
30 you know close to 30 years old now

2131
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:27,760
you know 25 years old no I guess 95 90

2132
01:35:25,439 --> 01:35:28,919
yeah you could say 95 like 30 years you

2133
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:32,360
know what I mean

2134
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:35,760
so any any plant that's been passed

2135
01:35:32,359 --> 01:35:38,880
around for 30 years is going to be you

2136
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:41,679
know is you know the genetic drift or

2137
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:44,880
whatever epigenetic changes. Yeah. due

2138
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:47,760
to you know environment to pests for

2139
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:49,440
fertilizer to light to everything you

2140
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:52,320
know and and I think that's why they

2141
01:35:49,439 --> 01:35:54,559
call it weed because it's it's adaptable

2142
01:35:52,319 --> 01:35:56,238
you know it does it doesn't just stay

2143
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:59,840
the same and I think it's kind of been

2144
01:35:56,238 --> 01:36:01,678
proven you know even in in some clone

2145
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:03,679
you know some plants where you can take

2146
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:05,440
multiple clones off of one plant and

2147
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:08,000
have three different plants from the

2148
01:36:05,439 --> 01:36:11,279
from the same from the same plant you

2149
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:14,319
know so that in itself kind of tells the

2150
01:36:11,279 --> 01:36:15,920
genetic diversity that that's in one

2151
01:36:14,319 --> 01:36:17,840
plant. You know, if you can get three

2152
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:20,960
different phenotypes off of three

2153
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:23,920
different cutings off of one plant, uh,

2154
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:26,158
you know, so, you know, all of that, I

2155
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:28,480
think, you know, over time makes the

2156
01:36:26,158 --> 01:36:30,399
plant change. And so, I think really

2157
01:36:28,479 --> 01:36:33,678
what people are kind of looking for is

2158
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:35,439
really that sour diesel woof, if you

2159
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:38,319
want to call it that, when you open the

2160
01:36:35,439 --> 01:36:40,879
bag and you just kind of get woofed by

2161
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:42,880
the smell of it. And back in the day, it

2162
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:45,440
was very distinguishable of the way that

2163
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:46,639
it smelled and everything. And so I

2164
01:36:45,439 --> 01:36:48,399
think, you know, the smell and the

2165
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:50,719
taste. Yeah. And I think it's kind of

2166
01:36:48,399 --> 01:36:52,238
lost some of that over time. And and I

2167
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:54,960
and I can just tell you from my

2168
01:36:52,238 --> 01:36:57,839
experience from other plants that we've

2169
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:59,840
had for a long period of time that they

2170
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:01,840
eventually they do go bad. Even like

2171
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:03,840
that's what happened to the underdog,

2172
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:05,760
the original underdog that Mike Klopp

2173
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:08,239
made. Like originally that just kind of

2174
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:10,639
crapped out. Now looking back, did it

2175
01:37:08,238 --> 01:37:12,079
have some kind of virus or something?

2176
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:13,600
Something could have been going on with

2177
01:37:12,079 --> 01:37:16,000
it, but it, you know, something

2178
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:17,920
definitely made made it degrade in

2179
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,079
quality to the point where we got we

2180
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:21,840
just let it go. And I think the same

2181
01:37:20,079 --> 01:37:23,880
thing happened with the super skunk.

2182
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:26,880
like the super skunk.

2183
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:28,719
Like listen, you know, everyone says,

2184
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:32,000
you know, there's different stories on

2185
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:34,719
it and and the one that Greg got was the

2186
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,719
one that you gave him and it was the one

2187
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:39,039
that Mike had and it was the one that

2188
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:42,399
kind of got passed around in the

2189
01:37:39,039 --> 01:37:44,880
Massachusetts, New England area. And

2190
01:37:42,399 --> 01:37:46,960
from what I remember it being, like it

2191
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:48,880
was super like when you open that jar,

2192
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:52,560
you just got like, you know, you got

2193
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:55,359
that super skunk woof, you know, but the

2194
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:57,199
the butt itself wasn't super strong. It

2195
01:37:55,359 --> 01:37:59,519
was kind of light, you know, it didn't

2196
01:37:57,198 --> 01:38:01,759
get you super high or whatever. It was

2197
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:05,480
not like the 90. No, not at all. You

2198
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:08,320
know, it it was Bud Light, you know. So,

2199
01:38:05,479 --> 01:38:10,519
uh, you know, everyone's kind of chasing

2200
01:38:08,319 --> 01:38:14,599
the Roadkill skunk now. how they're

2201
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:17,600
chasing the you know the sour diesel

2202
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:19,440
and you know you know I don't know like

2203
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:21,199
with the roadkill skunk you know maybe

2204
01:38:19,439 --> 01:38:24,238
there is someone out there that's got

2205
01:38:21,198 --> 01:38:27,359
something that but to me all of that

2206
01:38:24,238 --> 01:38:29,279
kind of points back to Afghan genetics

2207
01:38:27,359 --> 01:38:30,799
you know so if you really want to really

2208
01:38:29,279 --> 01:38:33,519
start from the beginning I think that's

2209
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:36,719
where the original skunks come from

2210
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:38,639
Afghans it's kind of been documented you

2211
01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:40,399
know through the years through different

2212
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:43,079
people have written books

2213
01:38:40,399 --> 01:38:46,319
so on and so forth.

2214
01:38:43,079 --> 01:38:49,279
Um, and you know, so I, you know, I

2215
01:38:46,319 --> 01:38:50,960
think that, you know, the thios and and

2216
01:38:49,279 --> 01:38:53,759
all of that stuff, I think they

2217
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:56,079
eventually kind of change over over time

2218
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:59,199
and and depending on your fertilizers

2219
01:38:56,079 --> 01:39:00,359
and everything. Um and now with lights

2220
01:38:59,198 --> 01:39:02,960
changing

2221
01:39:00,359 --> 01:39:05,519
and you know we're kind of we kind of

2222
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:07,840
have what we have you know and you know

2223
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:10,119
there's always that chance of you know

2224
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:13,760
someone finding a needle in the hay

2225
01:39:10,118 --> 01:39:15,679
stack and you know we you know but you

2226
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:18,639
know you just got to keep looking and

2227
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:21,199
you got to keep trying and you know I I

2228
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:24,800
I've always you know try to do these

2229
01:39:21,198 --> 01:39:27,599
small kind of um little hunts of stuff

2230
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:29,840
you know that's land race or you know

2231
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:32,560
and a lot of that stuff is just for you

2232
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:34,960
know my own you know personal you know

2233
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:36,800
what I want to do you know and there's

2234
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:38,560
you know some Tai stuff that I remember

2235
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:40,800
from back in the day that I would like

2236
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:42,480
to get back and stuff. So there's a lot

2237
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:44,880
of things that we've experienced as

2238
01:39:42,479 --> 01:39:47,759
smokers that we'd like to you know

2239
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:49,679
recreate or we'd like to experience

2240
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:52,960
again. And so I think that's part of

2241
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:55,118
like chasing the the nostalgia of

2242
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:58,399
certain strains or whatever and is just

2243
01:39:55,118 --> 01:40:00,238
trying to recreate some of that. But you

2244
01:39:58,399 --> 01:40:02,960
know a lot of that stuff you know when

2245
01:40:00,238 --> 01:40:07,118
we first experienced you know I think

2246
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:09,679
like the overall the overall um

2247
01:40:07,118 --> 01:40:12,238
tolerance that everyone has to weed now

2248
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:15,118
is so much more because back in the day

2249
01:40:12,238 --> 01:40:17,519
like during the 90s uh there were

2250
01:40:15,118 --> 01:40:19,039
droughts. You remember have you ever

2251
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:22,159
been in a drought where you couldn't

2252
01:40:19,039 --> 01:40:23,920
find weed? Like I I've been in through

2253
01:40:22,158 --> 01:40:26,638
many, you know, and the last one I

2254
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:29,840
remember being in like 1990 in the early

2255
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:33,039
90s where there was just no weed to be

2256
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:36,639
found in the city or anywhere else. And

2257
01:40:33,039 --> 01:40:38,158
so, you know, so overall, you know, you

2258
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:39,840
know, we say if you if you going through

2259
01:40:38,158 --> 01:40:42,879
a drought and you haven't smoked for a

2260
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:44,960
few days or a week or however, how long

2261
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:47,920
it may be, now you smoke something like

2262
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:50,639
the Super Skunk and you know, on today's

2263
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:52,158
terms maybe Bud Light, but back then you

2264
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:54,400
were like, "Wow, I'm [ __ ] super

2265
01:40:52,158 --> 01:40:58,079
high." So now with especially

2266
01:40:54,399 --> 01:41:00,638
concentrates and dabs and you know and

2267
01:40:58,079 --> 01:41:03,279
the THC being at the highest that it's

2268
01:41:00,639 --> 01:41:06,400
ever been I think overall people's

2269
01:41:03,279 --> 01:41:09,759
tolerance are much higher and the

2270
01:41:06,399 --> 01:41:13,198
nostalgia that they remember as as a kid

2271
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:14,719
or back in the day was because yeah just

2272
01:41:13,198 --> 01:41:16,319
because they didn't smoke anything in

2273
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:17,840
two or three days and all of a sudden

2274
01:41:16,319 --> 01:41:19,439
they smoked something and got super

2275
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:21,840
stoned and you know that would be the

2276
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:23,839
case in and you know you could smoke

2277
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:26,960
Mexican if you didn't smoke, you know,

2278
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:28,960
and smoke for a week and get high. So,

2279
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:31,520
the Jamaican weed used to be really

2280
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:34,158
potent. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You know, so

2281
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:37,040
like I mean it may not have been, you

2282
01:41:34,158 --> 01:41:38,479
know, kind bud, but that [ __ ] would make

2283
01:41:37,039 --> 01:41:41,359
you fall asleep. Oh, yeah. you know,

2284
01:41:38,479 --> 01:41:44,479
well, if you got that, you know, the the

2285
01:41:41,359 --> 01:41:46,960
that that that chocolatey uh lamb's

2286
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:48,799
bread or lamb's breath or whatever they

2287
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:50,158
want to call it, man, that that that was

2288
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:52,800
the [ __ ] you know, cuz that was

2289
01:41:50,158 --> 01:41:56,158
actually kind of like chocolate tie kind

2290
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:58,000
of and, you know, was it was grown, you

2291
01:41:56,158 --> 01:42:00,158
know, in a different environment, came

2292
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,800
out differently, but yeah, it definitely

2293
01:42:00,158 --> 01:42:04,719
had some some really super good effects

2294
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:06,480
to it.

2295
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:08,239
I think another lacker is the novel

2296
01:42:06,479 --> 01:42:10,079
novelty, too. back when you first

2297
01:42:08,238 --> 01:42:11,599
started smoking, you know, it wasn't a

2298
01:42:10,079 --> 01:42:13,279
feeling that you were very used to, you

2299
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:15,119
know, because I feel like that kind of

2300
01:42:13,279 --> 01:42:16,800
attributes to what I like to call the

2301
01:42:15,118 --> 01:42:18,719
high school high, right? Because how

2302
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:20,639
often do you get high like you were in

2303
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:22,880
high school, right? Well, if you stop

2304
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:24,480
smoking for a week or a month, and if

2305
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:27,920
you smoke, you will get that effect

2306
01:42:24,479 --> 01:42:31,198
again. Well, I I I can actually say that

2307
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:34,880
the other day I got higher on weed than

2308
01:42:31,198 --> 01:42:38,158
I've gotten in years, and it was on sour

2309
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:39,440
diesel. So, and I'm going to tell that

2310
01:42:38,158 --> 01:42:41,519
story in a minute, but before I do, I

2311
01:42:39,439 --> 01:42:43,439
just want to say because I want to

2312
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:46,719
finish saying this that I've been

2313
01:42:43,439 --> 01:42:49,279
watching you on social media and I've

2314
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:52,079
been seeing these sour and although, you

2315
01:42:49,279 --> 01:42:53,840
know, you're thousand miles away from me

2316
01:42:52,079 --> 01:42:57,359
and I haven't actually gotten a chance

2317
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:59,279
to to try that stuff. It looks like sour

2318
01:42:57,359 --> 01:43:01,039
diesel. It does. You know, like when you

2319
01:42:59,279 --> 01:43:04,238
when you look at it, you're like, man,

2320
01:43:01,039 --> 01:43:06,800
that that [ __ ] actually looks legit. And

2321
01:43:04,238 --> 01:43:09,519
it has the smell to it. It has a smell

2322
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:12,560
to it. So, it's really really really

2323
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:15,280
trying to do a really proper hunt to

2324
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:16,960
find that one [ __ ] really really I

2325
01:43:15,279 --> 01:43:18,719
think I think you did a good I think you

2326
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:20,719
did a good job. So, really that's really

2327
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:23,920
what really needs to be done where

2328
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:26,319
someone can really do like a 100 or 200,

2329
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:28,239
you know, plant hunt and really go

2330
01:43:26,319 --> 01:43:32,158
through that, you know. unfortunately

2331
01:43:28,238 --> 01:43:34,319
like you know I don't have you know

2332
01:43:32,158 --> 01:43:37,198
those means to do that that that those

2333
01:43:34,319 --> 01:43:41,039
type of of hunts and stuff. So, you

2334
01:43:37,198 --> 01:43:43,839
know, um just trying to, you know, uh

2335
01:43:41,039 --> 01:43:46,399
trying to really, you know, get people

2336
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:48,000
to to, you know, and that's the other

2337
01:43:46,399 --> 01:43:49,679
thing like, you know, you can make the

2338
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,399
best [ __ ] in the world if people aren't

2339
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:54,480
willing to do it, you know, what what is

2340
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:56,960
it, you know? And so, you know, I'm

2341
01:43:54,479 --> 01:43:59,118
fortunate enough where people, you know,

2342
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:01,679
were are buying my things and they're

2343
01:43:59,118 --> 01:44:03,839
and they're reporting on it and, you

2344
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:06,279
know, and after a while, you know,

2345
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:09,360
things just kind of, you

2346
01:44:06,279 --> 01:44:12,158
know, the the reputation and the results

2347
01:44:09,359 --> 01:44:13,519
kind of speak for themselves. And so,

2348
01:44:12,158 --> 01:44:15,359
you know, you just got to, you know, I

2349
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:19,040
just got to thank people that, you know,

2350
01:44:15,359 --> 01:44:22,000
that are willing, you know, to to to buy

2351
01:44:19,039 --> 01:44:24,479
and grow my stuff and then and and and

2352
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,560
then report on it, you know, because and

2353
01:44:24,479 --> 01:44:30,238
a lot of this is, you know, like I said

2354
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:32,080
before, like, you know, if if you can

2355
01:44:30,238 --> 01:44:33,678
create the best thing in the world and

2356
01:44:32,079 --> 01:44:35,840
if it doesn't get out there, no one's

2357
01:44:33,679 --> 01:44:38,399
going to know about it. And so, you

2358
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:40,719
know, and and that and that's and that's

2359
01:44:38,399 --> 01:44:43,679
part of the whole thing. and and as a

2360
01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:47,760
community um I think you know it you

2361
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:50,239

2362
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:53,679
you know uh try to make things better

2363
01:44:50,238 --> 01:44:57,638
for everyone is you know in in the end

2364
01:44:53,679 --> 01:44:57,639
it it helps everyone

2365
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:03,840
I wanted to tell you about the the thing

2366
01:45:00,399 --> 01:45:06,319
is here in Europe yeah your seats are

2367
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:09,039
considered as craft as they can be you

2368
01:45:06,319 --> 01:45:11,920
know it's like uh people here in Europe

2369
01:45:09,039 --> 01:45:13,760
are uh actually your seats are very

2370
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:17,118
rarely available but when they are

2371
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:19,360
available people buy them and uh for

2372
01:45:17,118 --> 01:45:22,479
example in Austria I know there is a

2373
01:45:19,359 --> 01:45:25,359
three dogs clone circulating which is

2374
01:45:22,479 --> 01:45:29,439
really appreciated I mean you are very

2375
01:45:25,359 --> 01:45:32,238
well known as a craft uh breeder you

2376
01:45:29,439 --> 01:45:35,198
know I appreciate that but even like

2377
01:45:32,238 --> 01:45:37,118
like in in England where the star the

2378
01:45:35,198 --> 01:45:39,678
star dog became you know one of the most

2379
01:45:37,118 --> 01:45:41,198
popular strains like I had nothing to do

2380
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:43,199
with that, you know. Someone bought a

2381
01:45:41,198 --> 01:45:45,678
pack of Star Dog over there and blew it

2382
01:45:43,198 --> 01:45:47,759
up, you know. So, like I can only be

2383
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:50,079
thankful for that, you know, where, you

2384
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:52,960
know, he he he blew it up and it kind of

2385
01:45:50,079 --> 01:45:54,679
took a life of its own and it things

2386
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:58,480
were that good. That's what that's what

2387
01:45:54,679 --> 01:46:01,440
happens. And yeah, I don't really have a

2388
01:45:58,479 --> 01:46:03,759
main distributor in Europe, so to speak.

2389
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:05,678
I'm actually I'm just been in touch with

2390
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:07,920
a couple guys in Amsterdam and they're

2391
01:46:05,679 --> 01:46:09,760
going to uh there's one guy in Spain

2392
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:12,560
actually and then there's a guy in

2393
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:15,440
Amsterdam that are going to start um uh

2394
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:18,480
carrying my seeds. But I do hopefully

2395
01:46:15,439 --> 01:46:22,960
plan to come out to Germany for the Mary

2396
01:46:18,479 --> 01:46:24,959
Jane event out is in June. So um so

2397
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:26,800
yeah, just keep your eyes peeled for

2398
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:29,359
that. Uh hopefully I'm going to make

2399
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:32,079
that uh I've been contacted. I will meet

2400
01:46:29,359 --> 01:46:35,118
you there. I've been contacted by

2401
01:46:32,079 --> 01:46:37,039
someone and I've been invited. Uh I

2402
01:46:35,118 --> 01:46:40,238
haven't really gotten all the details on

2403
01:46:37,039 --> 01:46:43,679
it yet, but uh I think that's definitely

2404
01:46:40,238 --> 01:46:46,079
something that I want to um be a part of

2405
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:49,079
that Mary Jane in the opening of of

2406
01:46:46,079 --> 01:46:49,079
Germany.

2407
01:46:50,319 --> 01:46:55,359
Yeah, that I'm really wanting to get

2408
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:58,080
over there too because I I hear it's

2409
01:46:55,359 --> 01:47:00,158
it's a special event. Yeah. Well, now

2410
01:46:58,079 --> 01:47:03,039
you know it's pretty incredible because

2411
01:47:00,158 --> 01:47:04,879
everything is worldwide now and that and

2412
01:47:03,039 --> 01:47:07,359
that's just you know you know a

2413
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:09,920
connection to the internet where you

2414
01:47:07,359 --> 01:47:13,599
know we can talk to you know someone

2415
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:16,239
that's in Slovenia or or anywhere around

2416
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:19,119
the world where they would never know

2417
01:47:16,238 --> 01:47:21,759
who Top Dog was if it wasn't if it

2418
01:47:19,118 --> 01:47:24,319
wasn't for that. And so now like the

2419
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:26,880
community is now actually now a whole

2420
01:47:24,319 --> 01:47:30,960
world community where people in

2421
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:33,440
Australia and Thailand and Europe and

2422
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:36,480
South America like everywhere around the

2423
01:47:33,439 --> 01:47:38,879
world you know um it's it's really kind

2424
01:47:36,479 --> 01:47:40,799
of hard to wrap your head around. you

2425
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:44,000
know, it was never really like my

2426
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:46,920
intention to have this happen or you

2427
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,960
know, uh, you know, when things were or

2428
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:51,600
organically, you know, from from the

2429
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:54,158
from the beginning, you know, you know,

2430
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:56,159
that's the way things just happen and

2431
01:47:54,158 --> 01:47:57,920
things take a life of its own and you

2432
01:47:56,158 --> 01:48:00,638
can only you just got to kind of go with

2433
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:04,560
the flow and just, you know, I mean,

2434
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:07,840
just try to not be do something stupid.

2435
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:10,960
Well, I mean, you you've had a legal,

2436
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:13,520
you know, cannabis brand for for years

2437
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:17,520
now. People have known Top Dog for a

2438
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:20,239
long time. Imagine my surprise when the

2439
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:22,320
Slovenian Hobbit messaged me telling me

2440
01:48:20,238 --> 01:48:24,479
that he's been hearing about me on the

2441
01:48:22,319 --> 01:48:26,479
internet and everything. I mean, people

2442
01:48:24,479 --> 01:48:29,118
were talking about me on podcasts I

2443
01:48:26,479 --> 01:48:31,039
didn't even know, you know, and they

2444
01:48:29,118 --> 01:48:33,118
gave me this nickname, Staten Island,

2445
01:48:31,039 --> 01:48:35,519
which, you know, you being from New

2446
01:48:33,118 --> 01:48:38,639
York, you you can relate to how shitty

2447
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:40,239
of a of a nickname Staten Island. It's

2448
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:42,400
gotten better. At least they've closed

2449
01:48:40,238 --> 01:48:44,638
the dump. Okay. Yeah, they closed the

2450
01:48:42,399 --> 01:48:46,719
dump. So, now it's just toxic

2451
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:49,359
underground. But, but listen, you know,

2452
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:51,760
back then we were doing what we had to

2453
01:48:49,359 --> 01:48:53,839
do. You know that as well as I do. We

2454
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:56,159
were never like there was never any

2455
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:59,119
glory that was part of this, you know.

2456
01:48:56,158 --> 01:49:02,079
It was always it was always danger in my

2457
01:48:59,118 --> 01:49:03,920
eyes like it in and the glory was

2458
01:49:02,079 --> 01:49:05,920
getting paid at the end of the day and

2459
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:09,118
not getting arrested, you know. So there

2460
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:11,600
was no like pats on the back or you know

2461
01:49:09,118 --> 01:49:14,639
internet you know popularity or any of

2462
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:17,760
that kind of stuff that you know you

2463
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:19,440
getting away with it was was your reward

2464
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:22,239
and you wanted to just kind of keep it

2465
01:49:19,439 --> 01:49:25,439
at that. Well, now everyone is, you

2466
01:49:22,238 --> 01:49:27,839
know, waving their flag and, you know,

2467
01:49:25,439 --> 01:49:30,238
uh, you know, want to tell tell their

2468
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:31,600
story where before, you know, you didn't

2469
01:49:30,238 --> 01:49:34,799
want to, you know, you didn't want to

2470
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:37,039
say anything. So, you know, it it it

2471
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:39,119
it's changed quite a bit now and, you

2472
01:49:37,039 --> 01:49:41,760
know, for the better, I think, of the

2473
01:49:39,118 --> 01:49:44,279
plant where I think now some real

2474
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:47,800
research can actually get done into this

2475
01:49:44,279 --> 01:49:50,960
where, you know, you're getting uh

2476
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:54,320
universities and, you know, other

2477
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:55,399
establishments that are, you know, in

2478
01:49:54,319 --> 01:49:58,359
the

2479
01:49:55,399 --> 01:50:02,319
research department to actually do some

2480
01:49:58,359 --> 01:50:03,920
real, you know, real stuff in, you know,

2481
01:50:02,319 --> 01:50:05,679
and, you you know, and if you you know,

2482
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:09,279
if you're looking, you know, you know,

2483
01:50:05,679 --> 01:50:10,800
just um on the passing of the skunk man,

2484
01:50:09,279 --> 01:50:13,198
but you know, the the re some of the

2485
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:17,039
research that that that guy, those guys

2486
01:50:13,198 --> 01:50:20,960
were doing were just just light years

2487
01:50:17,039 --> 01:50:23,920
ahead of everyone. It's um you know you

2488
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:25,600
know so really you know uh you know I

2489
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:29,600
didn't you know agree with all of his

2490
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:32,320
actions and and such but you know you

2491
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:35,039
know I think that you know the the you

2492
01:50:32,319 --> 01:50:38,000
know they had a way they were so far

2493
01:50:35,039 --> 01:50:39,679
ahead of everyone that like we were

2494
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:43,279
playing checkers and those guys were

2495
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:46,480
playing chess more or less.

2496
01:50:43,279 --> 01:50:50,639
You know, I was going to make a podcast,

2497
01:50:46,479 --> 01:50:53,919
another one, um, just on this topic of

2498
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:58,480
Sam and Neville, but since you mentioned

2499
01:50:53,920 --> 01:51:01,600
it now, I can't stop myself from from

2500
01:50:58,479 --> 01:51:03,839
bringing this up. Um, we did a podcast

2501
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:06,159
with DJ Short, which hasn't been

2502
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:07,760
released yet. I saw I saw the I saw the

2503
01:51:06,158 --> 01:51:09,519
clip of that and I was looking for it. I

2504
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:11,760
was like, where is it? Where is it? And

2505
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:13,840
it's like you guys are holding out. I I

2506
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:15,679
no not holding out. I'm not like that. I

2507
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:18,639
don't have like a Patreon yet where

2508
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:21,520
members get it. It's just I've been

2509
01:51:18,639 --> 01:51:23,118
honestly I released a new sour myself

2510
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:25,600
and it's gotten such a tremendous

2511
01:51:23,118 --> 01:51:29,519
response that I've just been slammed.

2512
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:31,079
But um when I released that

2513
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:35,760
um little

2514
01:51:31,079 --> 01:51:38,719
clip, I received some hate and it was

2515
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:41,679
really the first hate that I've received

2516
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:44,639
on my podcast at all. Like it I've

2517
01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:46,960
gotten nothing but positive responses

2518
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:48,560
from everyone. It's it's really been

2519
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:52,480
overwhelming.

2520
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:56,520
And when I made this podcast and I put

2521
01:51:52,479 --> 01:52:00,238
that clip up just trying to honor

2522
01:51:56,520 --> 01:52:01,800
Sam, I received hate messages and some

2523
01:52:00,238 --> 01:52:04,039
to be honest with even

2524
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:05,800
racist.

2525
01:52:04,039 --> 01:52:08,079
Um,

2526
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:09,960
but you know, and I I just want to say

2527
01:52:08,079 --> 01:52:12,039
this again because I think it's

2528
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:15,520
important

2529
01:52:12,039 --> 01:52:17,880
that I am not defending anything that

2530
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:21,520
Sam or Neville

2531
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:23,639
did. Whether they're scumbags or not

2532
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:26,639
doesn't change the fact that they're

2533
01:52:23,639 --> 01:52:31,840
relevant and they've really contributed

2534
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:33,520
to our community. And I don't know if

2535
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:36,079
Sam did the things that he's been

2536
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:40,080
accused of. I haven't seen any, you

2537
01:52:36,079 --> 01:52:42,639
know, proof of it. And I don't know if

2538
01:52:40,079 --> 01:52:44,479
um, you know, Neville was a drug addict

2539
01:52:42,639 --> 01:52:47,840
or any of the other terrible things that

2540
01:52:44,479 --> 01:52:50,959
they say about him. But Sam did an

2541
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:56,079
incredible amount of work in cannabis

2542
01:52:50,960 --> 01:53:00,520
that probably or surely to this day no

2543
01:52:56,079 --> 01:53:03,800
single person has ever done. And

2544
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:06,320
Neville, he made all these genetics

2545
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:07,840
available, you know, like he was the

2546
01:53:06,319 --> 01:53:09,599
first person to put his face out there

2547
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:11,520
and be like, "Yeah, send me money and

2548
01:53:09,599 --> 01:53:14,159
I'll send you seeds."

2549
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:16,880
And so even though I received a whole

2550
01:53:14,158 --> 01:53:18,198
bunch of and the hate came from, people

2551
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:20,719
just want to choose

2552
01:53:18,198 --> 01:53:24,879
sides, you know, they're either on team

2553
01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:27,039
Sam or on team Neville. And my guess is

2554
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:29,760
that probably neither of them are

2555
01:53:27,039 --> 01:53:35,840
flawless human beings, you know, and

2556
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:35,840
they, you know, but how can you deny the

2557
01:53:36,279 --> 01:53:41,439
tremendous like the work that both of

2558
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:44,799
these guys did, the contribution that

2559
01:53:41,439 --> 01:53:47,598
they both made for cannabis, you know?

2560
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:50,239
So yeah, you know, well, you know, you

2561
01:53:47,599 --> 01:53:52,880
it's kind of like today where, you know,

2562
01:53:50,238 --> 01:53:56,919
back then, you know, I wasn't really a

2563
01:53:52,880 --> 01:54:00,159
part of, you know, the '9s Amsterdam

2564
01:53:56,920 --> 01:54:02,840
scene, but from from what I've been

2565
01:54:00,158 --> 01:54:07,279
told, you know, it was very

2566
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:09,920
competitive. You know, Sam, an American,

2567
01:54:07,279 --> 01:54:12,319
brought over genetics. all all the all

2568
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:16,319
the genetics that pretty much Amsterdam

2569
01:54:12,319 --> 01:54:18,479
were founded on came from Sam, you know,

2570
01:54:16,319 --> 01:54:21,039
you know, they might have had something.

2571
01:54:18,479 --> 01:54:23,598
It's undisputed, you know. Yeah. So, we

2572
01:54:21,039 --> 01:54:27,439
can't really argue that, you know, and

2573
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:31,440
so, you know, the the practices of some

2574
01:54:27,439 --> 01:54:33,399
of the the the Dutch business guys

2575
01:54:31,439 --> 01:54:37,439
uh were kind of

2576
01:54:33,399 --> 01:54:41,359
unscrupulous. Uh, and they never were

2577
01:54:37,439 --> 01:54:44,879
really for the consumer. They I mean,

2578
01:54:41,359 --> 01:54:46,039
even up until today now, like they're

2579
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:50,960
very

2580
01:54:46,039 --> 01:54:53,840
unreliable. like uh I mean I think that

2581
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:56,960
overall I mean they were gifted all of

2582
01:54:53,840 --> 01:55:00,520
those genetics and they screwed the

2583
01:54:56,960 --> 01:55:04,198
whole gene pool up you know pretty much

2584
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:06,800
um you know getting away from the

2585
01:55:04,198 --> 01:55:09,759
original pro you know the original stuff

2586
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:12,639
that that Neville brought over there and

2587
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:14,560
really you know you look Sam yeah no I'm

2588
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:17,599
sorry Sam brought over there but and if

2589
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:21,119
you look at the the real history of it

2590
01:55:17,599 --> 01:55:24,719
all like you know the the real heyday

2591
01:55:21,118 --> 01:55:28,238
was really during the Neville period and

2592
01:55:24,719 --> 01:55:31,039
pretty much from the late 90s to the

2593
01:55:28,238 --> 01:55:35,279
early I mean I'm sorry the late 80s to

2594
01:55:31,039 --> 01:55:38,439
the mid 90s pretty much and really the

2595
01:55:35,279 --> 01:55:41,599
last harrah was kind of like the Jack

2596
01:55:38,439 --> 01:55:44,799
Carrer and then after that it all kind

2597
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:46,760
of like all kind of like went downhill

2598
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:49,079
and it was just kind of like a

2599
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:52,000
reshuffleling of all

2600
01:55:49,079 --> 01:55:54,719
those the same genetics that you know

2601
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,800
the northern lights the skunk the haze

2602
01:55:54,719 --> 01:55:59,039
the

2603
01:55:55,800 --> 01:56:01,360
Afghan you know etc and they're all just

2604
01:55:59,039 --> 01:56:04,158
kind of reshuffled and if you kind of

2605
01:56:01,359 --> 01:56:06,399
look at it now it's kind of like all of

2606
01:56:04,158 --> 01:56:09,279
that is kind of all that history is

2607
01:56:06,399 --> 01:56:11,519
repeating itself today where you got

2608
01:56:09,279 --> 01:56:14,079
haters on the internet trying to

2609
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:16,719
discredit I mean they discredit you I

2610
01:56:14,079 --> 01:56:19,599
mean they're trying even Today I' last

2611
01:56:16,719 --> 01:56:22,319
two days I've gotten post uh reported or

2612
01:56:19,599 --> 01:56:25,119
trying to get my account deleted again.

2613
01:56:22,319 --> 01:56:26,960
It's been deleted twice already, you

2614
01:56:25,118 --> 01:56:31,359
know. So you got people that make up

2615
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:33,359
narratives about certain people and you

2616
01:56:31,359 --> 01:56:35,279
know and it's just kind of like now it's

2617
01:56:33,359 --> 01:56:38,559
kind of like a reshuffleling of all the

2618
01:56:35,279 --> 01:56:41,519
cookies and you know candy stuff and

2619
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:44,719
gelato gelades all that kind of stuff on

2620
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:47,679
that realm. And so it gets kind of

2621
01:56:44,719 --> 01:56:50,079
history kind of repeating itself in in a

2622
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:52,960
sense, you know, where it just becomes

2623
01:56:50,079 --> 01:56:55,279
so competitive that, you know, you just

2624
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:58,480
want to take down the guy that's on top

2625
01:56:55,279 --> 01:57:00,880
or, you know, whoever you don't like.

2626
01:56:58,479 --> 01:57:03,039
And in in today's societies, it's so

2627
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:05,679
much easier to try to cancel people

2628
01:57:03,039 --> 01:57:09,359
with, you know, someone just reporting

2629
01:57:05,679 --> 01:57:12,639
posts or or or whatever. My Instagram

2630
01:57:09,359 --> 01:57:16,079
got taken down. Yeah. like like you know

2631
01:57:12,639 --> 01:57:17,679
the um I believe that the person or one

2632
01:57:16,079 --> 01:57:21,359
of the people that sent me the hate

2633
01:57:17,679 --> 01:57:24,960
message he reported my Instagram and

2634
01:57:21,359 --> 01:57:27,039
somehow Instagram had me back on within

2635
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:28,800
like 6 to 8 hours cuz I I was in a

2636
01:57:27,039 --> 01:57:31,679
panic. I couldn't believe well if you

2637
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:33,440
appeal it if you appeal it you know a

2638
01:57:31,679 --> 01:57:37,440
lot of those things they find out are

2639
01:57:33,439 --> 01:57:40,719
bogus you know like how can you put uh a

2640
01:57:37,439 --> 01:57:43,439
sexual content on a flower picture how

2641
01:57:40,719 --> 01:57:44,880
can you put violence on a flower picture

2642
01:57:43,439 --> 01:57:47,919
you know and this is the kind of stuff

2643
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:50,599
that's getting reported and and post

2644
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:53,199
taken down for so I mean there's an

2645
01:57:50,599 --> 01:57:55,440
algorithm is there anyone that's really

2646
01:57:53,198 --> 01:57:57,839
actually looking at some of this stuff I

2647
01:57:55,439 --> 01:57:59,279
I I I don't think So, you know, cuz

2648
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:01,279
there's probably million there's

2649
01:57:59,279 --> 01:58:04,000
millions of accounts. You know how much

2650
01:58:01,279 --> 01:58:06,000
of no you know how many thousands of

2651
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:09,039
accounts this must happen to a day. It's

2652
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:12,158
just it just you know can't do it.

2653
01:58:09,039 --> 01:58:14,439
Here's here's what they said about me

2654
01:58:12,158 --> 01:58:16,879
that I was supporting a dangerous

2655
01:58:14,439 --> 01:58:19,319
organization and individual. Yeah, I've

2656
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:21,840
gotten that. glorifying a terrorist

2657
01:58:19,319 --> 01:58:23,920
attack, supporting violence against a

2658
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:26,480
particular group of people, and

2659
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:28,760
supporting or promoting harmful criminal

2660
01:58:26,479 --> 01:58:32,399
activity like human

2661
01:58:28,760 --> 01:58:34,880
trafficking. It's like, what the [ __ ]

2662
01:58:32,399 --> 01:58:37,198
You know, like I don't even know how

2663
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:39,920
like, but because they reported me as

2664
01:58:37,198 --> 01:58:42,158
such a ridiculous thing, Instagram was

2665
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:45,039
able to quickly see that that that

2666
01:58:42,158 --> 01:58:47,359
wasn't the case. And you know, luckily

2667
01:58:45,039 --> 01:58:49,039
they didn't [ __ ] with me for the weed

2668
01:58:47,359 --> 01:58:51,039
pickicss and right, but it just shows

2669
01:58:49,039 --> 01:58:53,039
you the female parts, but it just shows

2670
01:58:51,039 --> 01:58:55,279
you the power that some of these people

2671
01:58:53,039 --> 01:58:58,158
have that are nobodyies that can just

2672
01:58:55,279 --> 01:59:00,639
sit back in their mother's basement and

2673
01:58:58,158 --> 01:59:03,399
just, you know, just troll people all

2674
01:59:00,639 --> 01:59:06,079
day long. And you know, there's there's

2675
01:59:03,399 --> 01:59:08,479
there's numerous people out there that

2676
01:59:06,079 --> 01:59:11,760
do that on a regular basis. that's their

2677
01:59:08,479 --> 01:59:14,158
main content is just to troll people and

2678
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:16,400
just to put negative, you know, energy

2679
01:59:14,158 --> 01:59:19,118
out there. And so, you just really, you

2680
01:59:16,399 --> 01:59:21,279
know, got to try to stay focused and

2681
01:59:19,118 --> 01:59:23,759
don't let other people define who you

2682
01:59:21,279 --> 01:59:26,079
are. You know who you are and you tell

2683
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:30,480
people who you are and you don't let

2684
01:59:26,079 --> 01:59:33,760
anyone tell people who you are.

2685
01:59:30,479 --> 01:59:37,598
Yeah. Um, I don't want to drag on this

2686
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:40,639
too much, but um, this person said to

2687
01:59:37,599 --> 01:59:44,639
me, "What gives you the right to mention

2688
01:59:40,639 --> 01:59:46,599
Neville in the same breath as Sam when

2689
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:49,679
Sam died?"

2690
01:59:46,599 --> 01:59:52,279
And you know, I don't know if this

2691
01:59:49,679 --> 01:59:55,279
person is listening or not,

2692
01:59:52,279 --> 01:59:58,599
but I give myself the right to talk

2693
01:59:55,279 --> 02:00:02,399
about anything that I want on our

2694
01:59:58,599 --> 02:00:04,560
podcast, but I try to keep it positive.

2695
02:00:02,399 --> 02:00:07,920
I don't think I've ever talked negative

2696
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:10,239
about anyone, you know, like that's not

2697
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:12,079
and it's there's been and I've this is

2698
02:00:10,238 --> 02:00:14,559
the most negative I've ever been on on

2699
02:00:12,079 --> 02:00:16,880
our podcast. And I've had moments when

2700
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:19,360
I've really wanted to like I have this

2701
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:21,599
platform and sometimes I think like

2702
02:00:19,359 --> 02:00:25,198
should I use this platform to out out

2703
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:28,319
these scumbags that are out there that

2704
02:00:25,198 --> 02:00:32,039
you know because people are out there

2705
02:00:28,319 --> 02:00:34,399
kissing ass to people that they don't

2706
02:00:32,039 --> 02:00:36,639
know, you know, and they're like this

2707
02:00:34,399 --> 02:00:38,439
person's so amazing. And it's like,

2708
02:00:36,639 --> 02:00:40,800
okay, first of all, this person is a

2709
02:00:38,439 --> 02:00:43,279
douchebag. And second of all, they

2710
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:44,760
really haven't contributed as much. And

2711
02:00:43,279 --> 02:00:48,800
the Chem

2712
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:51,119
Dog, people give me so much credit for,

2713
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:53,520
you know, the Chem Dog. But the way I

2714
02:00:51,118 --> 02:00:56,639
see it is I just drove that [ __ ] across

2715
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:59,199
country and and gave it to some friends.

2716
02:00:56,639 --> 02:01:01,679
I didn't breed it. I didn't pop the

2717
02:00:59,198 --> 02:01:03,598
seeds. I mean, I bred with it later on,

2718
02:01:01,679 --> 02:01:05,760
but uh most people didn't get a chance

2719
02:01:03,599 --> 02:01:09,520
to see that stuff. But, you know, there

2720
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:10,639
are people that are just trying to

2721
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:12,239
I I don't know. I know what you're

2722
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:14,319
saying. I don't I don't want to I don't

2723
02:01:12,238 --> 02:01:15,759
want to take cuz and I'll finish real

2724
02:01:14,319 --> 02:01:19,118
quick because this is your show, not

2725
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:21,800
mine. But, um like I'm way more proud of

2726
02:01:19,118 --> 02:01:24,399
this podcast that we've done in three

2727
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:27,199
months than anything that I have to do

2728
02:01:24,399 --> 02:01:29,118
with the Chem Dog story, you know? And

2729
02:01:27,198 --> 02:01:31,039
when people, you know, give me credit

2730
02:01:29,118 --> 02:01:33,519
for the Chem Dog story and make it feel

2731
02:01:31,039 --> 02:01:37,359
like this is my legacy, it's like, well,

2732
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:39,760
if that's my legacy, I'm a loser. If my

2733
02:01:37,359 --> 02:01:42,079
legacy is I just drove this plant across

2734
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:44,239
country and gave it to some friends and

2735
02:01:42,079 --> 02:01:46,719
30 years later, that's that's all we can

2736
02:01:44,238 --> 02:01:48,799
talk about, you know. So, I'm I'm really

2737
02:01:46,719 --> 02:01:50,079
proud of this podcast. I think in a

2738
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:52,880
couple months, we've done some great

2739
02:01:50,079 --> 02:01:56,238
things. The other thing that I think is

2740
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:59,400
my real legacy is the garden spout, you

2741
02:01:56,238 --> 02:02:03,359
know, my grow shop. And I

2742
02:01:59,399 --> 02:02:06,198
taught so many people how to grow. And I

2743
02:02:03,359 --> 02:02:08,359
taught OG growers that were growing

2744
02:02:06,198 --> 02:02:10,799
outdoors how to grow

2745
02:02:08,359 --> 02:02:12,719
indoors. And so like those are things

2746
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:15,920
that I can be proud of and and feel that

2747
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:19,118
are my legacy. But the Chem Dog, that's

2748
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:21,760
not my legacy, you know? And so I just

2749
02:02:19,118 --> 02:02:23,759
wanted to put it out there to the world

2750
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:25,280
so that that people can get this

2751
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:27,199
straight, you know, but you know,

2752
02:02:25,279 --> 02:02:29,198
honestly in in your defense, I know

2753
02:02:27,198 --> 02:02:30,559
you're the one saying this, but um

2754
02:02:29,198 --> 02:02:32,158
without you, you still played an

2755
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:34,080
integral role, you know, with the Chem

2756
02:02:32,158 --> 02:02:35,719
Dog, you know, cuz part of the story,

2757
02:02:34,079 --> 02:02:38,319
right? Everyone has their

2758
02:02:35,719 --> 02:02:39,920
own everyone has their own little part

2759
02:02:38,319 --> 02:02:42,399
of it. That's that's the that's the

2760
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:44,719
beautiful thing about it because if

2761
02:02:42,399 --> 02:02:47,039
there wasn't if there wasn't if there

2762
02:02:44,719 --> 02:02:49,599
wasn't a Mike Klopp, if there wasn't a

2763
02:02:47,039 --> 02:02:52,319
Gabby, like everyone's got their own

2764
02:02:49,599 --> 02:02:54,800
little if there wasn't a Greg Chem Dog,

2765
02:02:52,319 --> 02:02:56,880
like everyone's got their own little and

2766
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:59,639
and and that's what makes this thing so

2767
02:02:56,880 --> 02:03:02,000
beautiful because it wasn't really

2768
02:02:59,639 --> 02:03:05,679
intentional. It is just something that

2769
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:08,000
came to fruition for you know like you

2770
02:03:05,679 --> 02:03:10,800
were you were doing what you had to do

2771
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:14,479
at that time to you were you know to to

2772
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:17,520
to better your life you know you you

2773
02:03:14,479 --> 02:03:20,479
know and so you know the decisions that

2774
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:23,119
we made in the past you know like we you

2775
02:03:20,479 --> 02:03:25,439
know doing certain things you know we we

2776
02:03:23,118 --> 02:03:28,799
were doing doing those things you know

2777
02:03:25,439 --> 02:03:30,319
to try to make ourselves better and to

2778
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:33,520
make you

2779
02:03:30,319 --> 02:03:37,118
you know, things overall, you know, just

2780
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:40,000
easier for, you know, people like that

2781
02:03:37,118 --> 02:03:41,920
that we knew. And you know, and just as

2782
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:44,719
a kind of like touching on on the

2783
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:47,000
Neville thing, like you know, Sam was

2784
02:03:44,719 --> 02:03:49,840
the one that brought all those genetics

2785
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:54,399
over and you know, Neville did, you

2786
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:56,960
know, like he he had an eye for for

2787
02:03:54,399 --> 02:03:59,759
certain things and, you know, like he

2788
02:03:56,960 --> 02:04:03,039
went outside of the the gene pool of

2789
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:06,719
what Sam had gave him. And when he got

2790
02:04:03,039 --> 02:04:09,679
the Northern Lights and he went to um

2791
02:04:06,719 --> 02:04:11,760
you know the Pacific Northwest and

2792
02:04:09,679 --> 02:04:15,800
started collecting different strains and

2793
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:18,320
stuff like that and so you know

2794
02:04:15,800 --> 02:04:20,320
um yeah a lot you know there's a you

2795
02:04:18,319 --> 02:04:23,118
know those guys were were were

2796
02:04:20,319 --> 02:04:25,439
competition back then so you know you

2797
02:04:23,118 --> 02:04:27,359
know they work they had work together

2798
02:04:25,439 --> 02:04:29,439
and and it's just like today when you're

2799
02:04:27,359 --> 02:04:32,158
working with certain people or whatever

2800
02:04:29,439 --> 02:04:35,118
and you know you you're good for a while

2801
02:04:32,158 --> 02:04:37,679
and then you have a falling out and you

2802
02:04:35,118 --> 02:04:40,000
know a discrepancy and then you know

2803
02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:42,719
that's how all of those all of those

2804
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:46,719
rumors and all that stuff you know start

2805
02:04:42,719 --> 02:04:49,719
to spread and everything and um

2806
02:04:46,719 --> 02:04:51,920
yeah I mean well I mean the the

2807
02:04:49,719 --> 02:04:53,599
allegations something I'm sorry to

2808
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:55,920
interrupt you the allegations are

2809
02:04:53,599 --> 02:04:59,520
serious no I know I know you know like

2810
02:04:55,920 --> 02:05:01,279
so like I don't want to minimize that

2811
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:03,440
there are serious allegations against

2812
02:05:01,279 --> 02:05:06,158
both these guys, it just doesn't change

2813
02:05:03,439 --> 02:05:08,719
that they contributed, right? And I

2814
02:05:06,158 --> 02:05:11,598
don't mention anything about what type

2815
02:05:08,719 --> 02:05:14,639
of people they are. Like I'm not saying

2816
02:05:11,599 --> 02:05:17,199
Sam is a great guy and I'm not saying

2817
02:05:14,639 --> 02:05:19,118
Neville is a great guy. It just doesn't

2818
02:05:17,198 --> 02:05:20,960
change that they contributed. Yeah. And

2819
02:05:19,118 --> 02:05:23,359
that's true. And the thing you got to

2820
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:26,480
remember is, you know, you know, since

2821
02:05:23,359 --> 02:05:28,158
can cannabis was illegal, like it

2822
02:05:26,479 --> 02:05:30,399
brought a lot of different people into

2823
02:05:28,158 --> 02:05:32,719
the scene, you know, that just weren't

2824
02:05:30,399 --> 02:05:35,118
there for the love of the plant. They

2825
02:05:32,719 --> 02:05:39,359
were there for more love of the money

2826
02:05:35,118 --> 02:05:43,839
because they had addictions or whatever

2827
02:05:39,359 --> 02:05:46,079
case may be, you know. Um, so you know,

2828
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:48,800
it kind of changes, you know, the whole

2829
02:05:46,079 --> 02:05:50,559
thing when uh it just becomes more

2830
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:52,560
cutthroat in the end. That's real,

2831
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:55,560
really the bottom line is when you bring

2832
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:59,840
a criminal element into

2833
02:05:55,560 --> 02:06:01,679
everything, you know, and you know, you

2834
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:05,279
can be both. You know, you could be, you

2835
02:06:01,679 --> 02:06:07,679
know, contribute to the community and

2836
02:06:05,279 --> 02:06:10,559
still kind of not be the best person in

2837
02:06:07,679 --> 02:06:12,158
the world. And even today, there's a lot

2838
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:14,560
of people out there like that. You know,

2839
02:06:12,158 --> 02:06:17,519
they're not their their interests aren't

2840
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:19,520
really with the community or with the

2841
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:22,719
plant is a lot of it is just kind of

2842
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:25,440
like financially driven and kind of

2843
02:06:22,719 --> 02:06:29,439
selfentered.

2844
02:06:25,439 --> 02:06:32,158
uh everything about me and uh you know

2845
02:06:29,439 --> 02:06:34,519
eventually you know that gets recognized

2846
02:06:32,158 --> 02:06:37,519
and you know if you want

2847
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:40,400
to you know have you know have longevity

2848
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:43,440
in the game you really can't you know

2849
02:06:40,399 --> 02:06:47,039
conduct yourself like that cuz you know

2850
02:06:43,439 --> 02:06:48,960
you know eventually you know you're the

2851
02:06:47,039 --> 02:06:50,560
only thing you know back in the day I

2852
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:52,520
like to say is the only thing that we

2853
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:56,079
had was our

2854
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:59,400
reputation and how good we on being like

2855
02:06:56,078 --> 02:07:02,880
I can vouch for this guy saying he's

2856
02:06:59,399 --> 02:07:06,399
good and the balls to do something. The

2857
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:10,279
balls to set up a grow. The balls to do

2858
02:07:06,399 --> 02:07:12,559
something illegal to know the

2859
02:07:10,279 --> 02:07:14,078
consequences if you get caught that

2860
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:16,400
you're probably going to go to jail.

2861
02:07:14,078 --> 02:07:18,559
You're going to go at the very least

2862
02:07:16,399 --> 02:07:21,359
you're going to get arrested and there's

2863
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:23,119
a good possibility to go to jail. And so

2864
02:07:21,359 --> 02:07:24,319
you got to know all these things going

2865
02:07:23,118 --> 02:07:26,078
in.

2866
02:07:24,319 --> 02:07:28,000
And you also got to know that you're not

2867
02:07:26,078 --> 02:07:29,519
going to be dealing with the most honest

2868
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,439
people in the world if you're doing

2869
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:33,760
something

2870
02:07:30,439 --> 02:07:36,559
illegal. So, you know, the, you know,

2871
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:40,480
the whole thing just becomes a becomes a

2872
02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:43,239
mess after a while once, you know,

2873
02:07:40,479 --> 02:07:46,319
things start getting, you know, out of

2874
02:07:43,238 --> 02:07:48,319
hand and and we're dealing with the same

2875
02:07:46,319 --> 02:07:50,000
[ __ ] today in my opinion on the

2876
02:07:48,319 --> 02:07:52,519
internet. you know, he's just, you know,

2877
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:55,639
back then, people would just make up

2878
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:58,079
rumors to disparrage other

2879
02:07:55,639 --> 02:08:01,599
people. And and it's the same thing

2880
02:07:58,078 --> 02:08:03,279
that's going on today.

2881
02:08:01,599 --> 02:08:06,239
And to me, you got to have proof. If

2882
02:08:03,279 --> 02:08:08,399
you're going to call someone a rat or or

2883
02:08:06,238 --> 02:08:10,158
whatever allegations you have against

2884
02:08:08,399 --> 02:08:12,000
them, you know, especially if you're

2885
02:08:10,158 --> 02:08:13,598
going to be called a rat, like you got

2886
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:16,560
to come up with the proof and the

2887
02:08:13,599 --> 02:08:19,480
paperwork and and such, you know, like

2888
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:23,639
otherwise and and even today, like, you

2889
02:08:19,479 --> 02:08:26,078
know, a lot of that back in the day,

2890
02:08:23,639 --> 02:08:28,639
like, you know, when we were on the

2891
02:08:26,078 --> 02:08:31,519
forums and and stuff, you know, there

2892
02:08:28,639 --> 02:08:33,599
was there was much more respect like,

2893
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:35,440
you know, if you got called out, you

2894
02:08:33,599 --> 02:08:37,920
could easily get black ballalled from

2895
02:08:35,439 --> 02:08:39,519
the community and nobody would have

2896
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:41,199
nothing to do with you. And that's just

2897
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:43,960
not the case anymore. You know, like

2898
02:08:41,198 --> 02:08:47,118
those kind of people, flourish,

2899
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:49,158
scammers, rats, you know, known rats,

2900
02:08:47,118 --> 02:08:51,439
should I say, you know, that are on

2901
02:08:49,158 --> 02:08:54,399
paper and they're still, you know,

2902
02:08:51,439 --> 02:08:56,719
accepted in the community. So, the

2903
02:08:54,399 --> 02:08:59,920
overall standard, I think, is really

2904
02:08:56,719 --> 02:09:02,639
kind of lowered now. And really, you

2905
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:04,800
know, you just got to try to, you know,

2906
02:09:02,639 --> 02:09:07,440
surround yourself with, you know, a

2907
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:10,400
likemind people that have the same kind

2908
02:09:07,439 --> 02:09:12,479
of morals that that that you that you

2909
02:09:10,399 --> 02:09:14,719
have. And really like a lot of the

2910
02:09:12,479 --> 02:09:17,198
younger kids now, they just don't

2911
02:09:14,719 --> 02:09:19,840
understand because you know all the

2912
02:09:17,198 --> 02:09:21,359
stuff that we kind of went through. You

2913
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:24,639
know, the only thing that they know is

2914
02:09:21,359 --> 02:09:27,679
legal weed in Instagram and and so I

2915
02:09:24,639 --> 02:09:29,679
mean it it it's it's much more than

2916
02:09:27,679 --> 02:09:34,118
that, you know, when it really comes

2917
02:09:29,679 --> 02:09:34,118
down to the substance of everything.

2918
02:09:34,319 --> 02:09:39,359
Are you a 91 guy or are you a Chem D

2919
02:09:36,639 --> 02:09:41,520
guy? I'm a chem guy and that's really I

2920
02:09:39,359 --> 02:09:43,118
know that's really what what my focus

2921
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:44,880
was from the beginning with the trade

2922
02:09:43,118 --> 02:09:48,399
dog, you know what I mean? So that was

2923
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:52,319
always been like and and the thing was I

2924
02:09:48,399 --> 02:09:55,679
had the n I had the um the D before the

2925
02:09:52,319 --> 02:10:00,559
91 because I got the D directly from

2926
02:09:55,679 --> 02:10:03,118
Greg like in 2004 2005 shortly after he

2927
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:06,000
popped and found it and he didn't have

2928
02:10:03,118 --> 02:10:08,000
the 91 then and at that point I don't

2929
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:10,719
think anyone had the 91 on the east

2930
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:12,560
coast. I think you guys had it out west

2931
02:10:10,719 --> 02:10:15,840
and brought it back. Well Klop had it,

2932
02:10:12,560 --> 02:10:20,239
right? No, he he he lost it. He lost it.

2933
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:22,599
He yeah he he lo he he went to uh

2934
02:10:20,238 --> 02:10:27,638
everyone started growing that

2935
02:10:22,599 --> 02:10:31,920
underdog and uh so yeah but then

2936
02:10:27,639 --> 02:10:34,159
um but you know a lot you know you know

2937
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:37,039
a lot a lot of my breeding comes from my

2938
02:10:34,158 --> 02:10:39,839
own personal tastes like the strains and

2939
02:10:37,039 --> 02:10:42,479
stuff like you know you're not going to

2940
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:43,760
find any tarpinolene in most of my stuff

2941
02:10:42,479 --> 02:10:45,519
because I don't personally like

2942
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:48,079
tarpenoline so I'm not going to breed

2943
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:50,239
breed with those kind of plants. I did

2944
02:10:48,078 --> 02:10:53,599
do a breeding with like a super silver

2945
02:10:50,238 --> 02:10:56,479
haze star dog, you know, something like

2946
02:10:53,599 --> 02:11:00,078
that. But, you know, it's not a a

2947
02:10:56,479 --> 02:11:02,799
particular uh turpp that I that I like.

2948
02:11:00,078 --> 02:11:06,158
And so, like a lot of a lot of my

2949
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:08,360
breeding is based on my personal uh

2950
02:11:06,158 --> 02:11:11,839
preferences. And so that's kind of like

2951
02:11:08,359 --> 02:11:14,799
where breeding almost becomes an art,

2952
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:18,880
whereas it's it's it's the it's, you

2953
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:22,800
know, it's what my personal uh tastes

2954
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:25,199
are and my interpretation of it and and

2955
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:26,960
such. And so, you know, you you know,

2956
02:11:25,198 --> 02:11:30,000
and that's where in the breeding you can

2957
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:32,239
kind of put that personal touch in on

2958
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:35,599
all of that on your selections and

2959
02:11:32,238 --> 02:11:39,198
everything because I and I do all of

2960
02:11:35,599 --> 02:11:41,440
that on my past experiences on smoking.

2961
02:11:39,198 --> 02:11:44,158
And so, like when I'm hunting for a

2962
02:11:41,439 --> 02:11:47,279
certain type of tie or a certain type of

2963
02:11:44,158 --> 02:11:50,158
haze or or whatever it is, it's because

2964
02:11:47,279 --> 02:11:52,880
I something that I had experienced

2965
02:11:50,158 --> 02:11:56,078
before. I want to try to recreate that

2966
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:59,118
for myself and to be able to offer that

2967
02:11:56,078 --> 02:12:02,238
for other people to experience. And so

2968
02:11:59,118 --> 02:12:05,078
that's really, you know, where it kind

2969
02:12:02,238 --> 02:12:07,759
of you almost become an artist in a

2970
02:12:05,078 --> 02:12:09,158
sense. I definitely think it's an it's

2971
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:12,880
an art.

2972
02:12:09,158 --> 02:12:15,638
And you know, the the best art is the

2973
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:18,319
art that the artist makes because he's

2974
02:12:15,639 --> 02:12:20,480
inspired, not like, oh, I'm going to

2975
02:12:18,319 --> 02:12:22,719
make something that other people like,

2976
02:12:20,479 --> 02:12:24,000
this is what's popular. I'm, you know,

2977
02:12:22,719 --> 02:12:26,840
you're never going to make the best

2978
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:30,078
product that way. If you make something

2979
02:12:26,840 --> 02:12:32,719
because it's what you love, well, either

2980
02:12:30,078 --> 02:12:35,039
either you lead or you follow, you know,

2981
02:12:32,719 --> 02:12:36,840
and so there's a lot of people that just

2982
02:12:35,039 --> 02:12:40,679
want to ride off of other people's

2983
02:12:36,840 --> 02:12:43,039
coattails and just, you know, and

2984
02:12:40,679 --> 02:12:45,118
so, you know, it is what it is. You

2985
02:12:43,039 --> 02:12:47,039
know, you you can't really focus on

2986
02:12:45,118 --> 02:12:48,799
that. That used to bother me in the

2987
02:12:47,039 --> 02:12:51,760
past, but now I can't, you know, I can't

2988
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:55,039
focus on that. I got to focus on on

2989
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:57,679
moving moving forward and doing what I

2990
02:12:55,039 --> 02:12:59,359
got to do and and block out all of the

2991
02:12:57,679 --> 02:13:02,719
noise around me, you know, and it's like

2992
02:12:59,359 --> 02:13:04,399
I try not to, you know, I try to keep

2993
02:13:02,719 --> 02:13:06,639
things relevant, but I don't really

2994
02:13:04,399 --> 02:13:08,479
focus on like what other people are

2995
02:13:06,639 --> 02:13:10,639
doing, you know. I try to focus on what

2996
02:13:08,479 --> 02:13:12,879
I'm doing. And if there's something I

2997
02:13:10,639 --> 02:13:15,039
feel that that something that they're

2998
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:17,359
doing that that might fit into what I'm

2999
02:13:15,039 --> 02:13:19,359
doing, then I'll gladly incorporate that

3000
02:13:17,359 --> 02:13:20,960
and give them credit for it. I have no

3001
02:13:19,359 --> 02:13:22,960
problem. I've used other people's

3002
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:28,039
breedings and stuff like that, you know,

3003
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:30,800
and so um, you know, I'm very open to,

3004
02:13:28,039 --> 02:13:32,800
uh, really, you know, if you don't pop

3005
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:34,719
seeds, the next best thing is is going

3006
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:36,400
to be found in the seed. You know, like

3007
02:13:34,719 --> 02:13:38,639
it's not anything that we're holding

3008
02:13:36,399 --> 02:13:40,879
now. So, it's like you got to keep

3009
02:13:38,639 --> 02:13:42,800
hunting, you got to keep breeding, you

3010
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:44,960
got to keep moving the genetic pool

3011
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:47,760
forward and then try to create while

3012
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:49,920
preserving. Exactly. While Exactly. You

3013
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:51,199
know. Exactly. And so you want to you

3014
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:53,199
want to bring things forward, but you

3015
02:13:51,198 --> 02:13:54,479
want to call on to the past too, right?

3016
02:13:53,198 --> 02:13:56,638
So I think Are you doing any tissue

3017
02:13:54,479 --> 02:13:59,519
culture? No, I've never done any of the

3018
02:13:56,639 --> 02:14:01,679
tissue culture. No, you know, um you

3019
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:04,639
know, I just do regular seeds. People

3020
02:14:01,679 --> 02:14:09,118
are always asking me about fems and

3021
02:14:04,639 --> 02:14:12,239
autos and this and that. And to me, uh,

3022
02:14:09,118 --> 02:14:15,118
a male and female, you know, when you're

3023
02:14:12,238 --> 02:14:18,319
looking in into breeding, you know,

3024
02:14:15,118 --> 02:14:20,078
you're looking for hybrid vigor, meaning

3025
02:14:18,319 --> 02:14:23,039
you're finding a plant that's better

3026
02:14:20,078 --> 02:14:25,519
than both parents, you know, and so when

3027
02:14:23,039 --> 02:14:28,078
you get opposites, sometimes opposites

3028
02:14:25,520 --> 02:14:30,400
attract, you put opposites and you put

3029
02:14:28,078 --> 02:14:34,639
them together and you find, you know,

3030
02:14:30,399 --> 02:14:36,719
better things. And so you genetics is

3031
02:14:34,639 --> 02:14:38,480
it's very, you know, complicated, you

3032
02:14:36,719 --> 02:14:39,920
know, and sometimes it's a crapshoot,

3033
02:14:38,479 --> 02:14:41,759
you know, and you sometimes you got to

3034
02:14:39,920 --> 02:14:43,840
have a vision on what you want to try to

3035
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:45,840
create. That doesn't necessarily mean

3036
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:48,239
it's going to happen, like, you know,

3037
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:50,800
but at least you tried, you know, and

3038
02:14:48,238 --> 02:14:52,399
just like I was explaining with the with

3039
02:14:50,800 --> 02:14:54,480
the trade dog where I was trying to

3040
02:14:52,399 --> 02:14:56,078
recreate the ChemD, it just it just

3041
02:14:54,479 --> 02:14:59,118
didn't happen, you know. But you know

3042
02:14:56,078 --> 02:15:02,479
what? the male that that I you know the

3043
02:14:59,118 --> 02:15:06,158
male that I used out of that you know it

3044
02:15:02,479 --> 02:15:09,519
became a a producer in itself with you

3045
02:15:06,158 --> 02:15:12,479
know became the foundation of of of my

3046
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:15,840
genetic library pretty much you know on

3047
02:15:12,479 --> 02:15:17,919
certain levels you know so that's really

3048
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:20,078
what you got to really focus on and you

3049
02:15:17,920 --> 02:15:23,279
know sometimes the glory doesn't come

3050
02:15:20,078 --> 02:15:27,359
till five or 10 years after you know I

3051
02:15:23,279 --> 02:15:29,359
can I can release a strain And you know

3052
02:15:27,359 --> 02:15:33,359
this that let's just take the African

3053
02:15:29,359 --> 02:15:35,078
haze for instance like I I released that

3054
02:15:33,359 --> 02:15:39,519
you know in like

3055
02:15:35,078 --> 02:15:42,559
2010 or somewhere in that area and you

3056
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:45,119
know a guy in named Bronson. He he

3057
02:15:42,560 --> 02:15:48,400
bought a pack. He found this African

3058
02:15:45,118 --> 02:15:50,799
haze number 11 up in Maine and he blew

3059
02:15:48,399 --> 02:15:54,559
it up, you know, and it became like one

3060
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:56,800
of his, you know, staple um strains, you

3061
02:15:54,560 --> 02:15:59,920
know, for himself, you know. But with

3062
02:15:56,800 --> 02:16:03,360
him blowing himself up, he blew me up in

3063
02:15:59,920 --> 02:16:05,359
in in, you know. So, you know, you know,

3064
02:16:03,359 --> 02:16:06,960
those things you can't really make

3065
02:16:05,359 --> 02:16:09,359
happen. You know, they just happen

3066
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:12,158
organically and you just got to be

3067
02:16:09,359 --> 02:16:14,519
thankful for it.

3068
02:16:12,158 --> 02:16:17,439
Yeah, for sure.

3069
02:16:14,520 --> 02:16:19,360
Um, the Stard Dog, was that yours? Yeah,

3070
02:16:17,439 --> 02:16:21,279
the Star Dog. Yeah. So, that was

3071
02:16:19,359 --> 02:16:22,880
actually Does this look like your

3072
02:16:21,279 --> 02:16:24,399
packaging?

3073
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:27,440
No.

3074
02:16:24,399 --> 02:16:29,118
No. No. Somebody's giving me these

3075
02:16:27,439 --> 02:16:31,598
seeds. They're probably, you know,

3076
02:16:29,118 --> 02:16:33,840
someone f to them or whatever. But, you

3077
02:16:31,599 --> 02:16:35,599
know, but but that was, you know, the

3078
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:39,040
Star Dog, you know, I took that same

3079
02:16:35,599 --> 02:16:41,280
Trey Dog mail and crossed it to Chem 4,

3080
02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:44,240
you know, and then, you know, I then I

3081
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:46,800
wound up giving um my friend some seeds

3082
02:16:44,239 --> 02:16:48,638
and he was friends with High Times and

3083
02:16:46,799 --> 02:16:51,358
he went to High Times. He gave Kyle

3084
02:16:48,638 --> 02:16:53,839
Kushman some seeds. He gave uh Andre

3085
02:16:51,359 --> 02:16:57,599
Grossman, the photographer,

3086
02:16:53,840 --> 02:17:01,439
uh some seeds. And uh Andre uh he wound

3087
02:16:57,599 --> 02:17:05,280
up finding the guava, the guava cam or

3088
02:17:01,439 --> 02:17:07,840
um and and then Kyle Kushman took those

3089
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:10,000
seeds out to California and they those

3090
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:14,239
guys grew them out and then they entered

3091
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:16,879
the San Francisco Medical Cup in 2010

3092
02:17:14,239 --> 02:17:19,280
and got second place. So that really

3093
02:17:16,879 --> 02:17:23,279
kind of put me on the map, you know, and

3094
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:25,920
those guys started, you know, uh, Leo

3095
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:27,599
uh, and those guys up in in Humbult,

3096
02:17:25,920 --> 02:17:29,200
they started growing some Star Dog and

3097
02:17:27,599 --> 02:17:31,599
it became a production strain up in

3098
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:33,599
Humbult there. So, you know, the, you

3099
02:17:31,599 --> 02:17:35,599
know, there's another instance where

3100
02:17:33,599 --> 02:17:38,079
where, you know, someone took my strain

3101
02:17:35,599 --> 02:17:40,159
and just blew it up and in the meantime

3102
02:17:38,079 --> 02:17:43,280
blew blew me up, you know, and so, you

3103
02:17:40,159 --> 02:17:44,879
know, I just got to give thanks to that.

3104
02:17:43,280 --> 02:17:46,800
Yeah, that you can't you can't make

3105
02:17:44,879 --> 02:17:48,558
that. You can't make that up and you

3106
02:17:46,799 --> 02:17:50,638
can't make that happen. You know, as as

3107
02:17:48,558 --> 02:17:53,438
much as you try, you can promote and try

3108
02:17:50,638 --> 02:17:55,598
to, you know, do as much marketing

3109
02:17:53,439 --> 02:17:57,439
behind your stuff and if there's no

3110
02:17:55,599 --> 02:17:59,439
substance behind it, man, people are

3111
02:17:57,439 --> 02:18:01,679
just going to smoke it and then it will

3112
02:17:59,439 --> 02:18:04,239
just get discarded, you know, and when

3113
02:18:01,679 --> 02:18:07,599
something's that good, this takes a life

3114
02:18:04,239 --> 02:18:10,398
of its own.

3115
02:18:07,599 --> 02:18:12,719
Well, before we go, I just want to do

3116
02:18:10,398 --> 02:18:15,358
something that I think is funny. So,

3117
02:18:12,718 --> 02:18:17,839
we're all brothers on this show, and

3118
02:18:15,359 --> 02:18:19,920
you're our brother, too, today and and

3119
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:22,920
always JJ. But take a look at this

3120
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:22,920
picture.

3121
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:29,439
You got You got to move it a little bit

3122
02:18:24,840 --> 02:18:32,558
over other way. Other way, that's Can

3123
02:18:29,439 --> 02:18:36,318
you see that? Yeah, I see it. Yeah,

3124
02:18:32,558 --> 02:18:37,920
man. I swear you and Klopp are brothers,

3125
02:18:36,318 --> 02:18:40,159
you know. What do you What do you guys

3126
02:18:37,920 --> 02:18:42,318
think? Cosmic and and Sasha. That that

3127
02:18:40,159 --> 02:18:44,959
that's Listen, that's a young Clop and

3128
02:18:42,318 --> 02:18:46,638
an old me. So Oh, you still look young,

3129
02:18:44,959 --> 02:18:49,039
bro. No, you still look young. Look at

3130
02:18:46,638 --> 02:18:51,518
me, bro.

3131
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:54,240
I I got to wear a hat to hide the glare

3132
02:18:51,519 --> 02:18:55,599
from the camera. So, and something else

3133
02:18:54,239 --> 02:18:59,439
I wanted to show you since I've been

3134
02:18:55,599 --> 02:19:01,120
looking at your um beautiful sour. This

3135
02:18:59,439 --> 02:19:04,318
is the

3136
02:19:01,120 --> 02:19:06,079
This is the new clone that I got. Nice.

3137
02:19:04,318 --> 02:19:08,638
Did you see the video that I posted on

3138
02:19:06,079 --> 02:19:11,799
Instagram about it? I don't think so.

3139
02:19:08,638 --> 02:19:14,159
No, I'm gonna have to look. So, so I

3140
02:19:11,799 --> 02:19:16,318
have, you know, what I've been

3141
02:19:14,159 --> 02:19:18,398
erroneously calling the original sour

3142
02:19:16,318 --> 02:19:20,398
because it's the cut that um, you know,

3143
02:19:18,398 --> 02:19:23,679
me and my friends have had and grown

3144
02:19:20,398 --> 02:19:26,000
for, you know, forever, for decades. But

3145
02:19:23,679 --> 02:19:28,239
like we were talking about before, it's

3146
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:32,718
gone through epigenetic changes and it's

3147
02:19:28,239 --> 02:19:35,519
just not um, it's just not that good

3148
02:19:32,718 --> 02:19:38,398
anymore. It's it's not it's it's good.

3149
02:19:35,519 --> 02:19:40,639
It's just not the same. It's not I know

3150
02:19:38,398 --> 02:19:42,718
what it is. It's is it's missing that

3151
02:19:40,638 --> 02:19:44,718
woof. You know what I mean? And it's

3152
02:19:42,718 --> 02:19:46,959
like that's the first thing when you

3153
02:19:44,718 --> 02:19:50,000
know and and you know I can say like

3154
02:19:46,959 --> 02:19:53,039
some of my some of my seeds have one of

3155
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:56,000
the back cross threes has the woof but

3156
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:58,399
it doesn't quite have the you know it's

3157
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:02,520
not doesn't smoke quite as strong I

3158
02:19:58,398 --> 02:20:05,519
would say you know. So, but in today in

3159
02:20:02,520 --> 02:20:08,079
today's, you know, kids now are just

3160
02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:10,560
they don't smoke to get high really, you

3161
02:20:08,079 --> 02:20:11,920
know, they smoke to look cool. So, they,

3162
02:20:10,559 --> 02:20:14,719
you know, they want to smoke some kind

3163
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:16,960
of candy strain in the blunt and they

3164
02:20:14,719 --> 02:20:20,079
want to smoke in a blunt and look cool

3165
02:20:16,959 --> 02:20:22,719
all day, you know, and you know, it's

3166
02:20:20,079 --> 02:20:25,439
kind of a status thing more or less

3167
02:20:22,719 --> 02:20:28,159
where where me, you know, just give me,

3168
02:20:25,439 --> 02:20:32,159
you know, a little butter chem and and a

3169
02:20:28,159 --> 02:20:34,799
party a little party. the 91, not the D.

3170
02:20:32,159 --> 02:20:37,359
And and uh you know, I could take two or

3171
02:20:34,799 --> 02:20:39,519
three hits off of off of a little pipe

3172
02:20:37,359 --> 02:20:41,680
and I'll be [ __ ] way more higher than

3173
02:20:39,520 --> 02:20:44,399
the guy that's smoking the big [ __ ]

3174
02:20:41,680 --> 02:20:47,200
blunt after blunt after blunt of [ __ ]

3175
02:20:44,398 --> 02:20:48,879
candy, you know? So, it's all personal

3176
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:51,040
preference, you know, and and what works

3177
02:20:48,879 --> 02:20:54,719
for me doesn't work for for everyone

3178
02:20:51,040 --> 02:20:56,960
else. So I can only go by what I like.

3179
02:20:54,719 --> 02:20:59,599
And you know the people that have the

3180
02:20:56,959 --> 02:21:01,599
same taste and appeal, you know, those

3181
02:20:59,600 --> 02:21:04,000
are the kind of people that that become

3182
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:06,800
your customers that are attracted to you

3183
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:11,280
because you know they have you know the

3184
02:21:06,799 --> 02:21:14,559
the same you know you know the same

3185
02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:17,359
thoughts that you have on cannabis or or

3186
02:21:14,559 --> 02:21:20,239
whatever. So, you know, you know, we we

3187
02:21:17,359 --> 02:21:22,720
find, you know, it's funny because, you

3188
02:21:20,239 --> 02:21:26,398
know, you you watch someone on Instagram

3189
02:21:22,719 --> 02:21:29,519
or on on social media or YouTube,

3190
02:21:26,398 --> 02:21:32,719
whatever, and you get a feel of who that

3191
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:35,840
person is, you know what I mean? And so,

3192
02:21:32,719 --> 02:21:38,159
you know, their likes, their dislikes,

3193
02:21:35,840 --> 02:21:40,719
and you know, you kind of have a you

3194
02:21:38,159 --> 02:21:43,439
kind of, you know, have a you build an

3195
02:21:40,719 --> 02:21:45,840
image of who that person really is, you

3196
02:21:43,439 --> 02:21:48,239
know, without really knowing them. And

3197
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:50,318
just like you had said before, like, you

3198
02:21:48,239 --> 02:21:52,079
know, you're you're picking sides or

3199
02:21:50,318 --> 02:21:54,639
you're liking people that you don't

3200
02:21:52,079 --> 02:21:56,359
know. You have no idea who they are. you

3201
02:21:54,639 --> 02:21:59,840
know, you're only seeing little little

3202
02:21:56,359 --> 02:22:02,720
little flashes of glimpses of their

3203
02:21:59,840 --> 02:22:05,280
lives on social media, and it's really

3204
02:22:02,719 --> 02:22:07,959
not who that person really is behind the

3205
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:11,680
scenes.

3206
02:22:07,959 --> 02:22:14,079
Well, I that's why we're doing this

3207
02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:17,280
podcast and that's why it's not a

3208
02:22:14,079 --> 02:22:20,079
10-minute podcast because we want to

3209
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:23,600
give our guests a chance to tell their

3210
02:22:20,079 --> 02:22:25,398
story and that way we can really get to

3211
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:28,720
know them

3212
02:22:25,398 --> 02:22:29,920
and Yeah. So, yeah. You know, yeah,

3213
02:22:28,719 --> 02:22:31,679
that's why we're doing the show. Yeah.

3214
02:22:29,920 --> 02:22:34,000
you know, and it's like you'd only be

3215
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:35,680
judged by the people that you surround

3216
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:38,318
yourself with. And those are the people

3217
02:22:35,680 --> 02:22:40,880
that who really know who who you are,

3218
02:22:38,318 --> 02:22:42,959
you know, and and and that's what I was

3219
02:22:40,879 --> 02:22:45,039
saying before where don't let anyone

3220
02:22:42,959 --> 02:22:48,239
tell you who you are because, you know,

3221
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:50,720
you tell people who you are.

3222
02:22:48,239 --> 02:22:52,159
Yeah, that that was great. Go ahead,

3223
02:22:50,719 --> 02:22:54,318
Cosmic. I know you got something else.

3224
02:22:52,159 --> 02:22:56,559

3227

that money Mike uh my partner he he he

3229
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:08,478

3230
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:10,559
he's not as active on social media he's

3231
02:23:08,478 --> 02:23:15,840

he doesn't really post too much he's

3235
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:27,760
very kind of private personal family guy

3236
02:23:25,760 --> 02:23:29,280
absolutely well I mean I love the turpps

3237
02:23:27,760 --> 02:23:32,000
that you work with and I was just, you

3238
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:33,439
know, as a fan of, you know, the the

3239
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:35,040
strings that you've put together, I was

3240
02:23:33,439 --> 02:23:38,318
wondering what are you working on right

3241
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:40,720
now and what are you most excited about?

3242
02:23:38,318 --> 02:23:43,279
Uh, I mean, right now I'm I'm kind of

3243
02:23:40,719 --> 02:23:46,478
like just kind of remaking the sour, you

3244
02:23:43,280 --> 02:23:49,920
know, I'm doing the F6s. Um, I I'm doing

3245
02:23:46,478 --> 02:23:52,920
a remake of the Stard Dog right now. Uh,

3246
02:23:49,920 --> 02:23:56,000
the dirty taxis have been really uh

3247
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:59,920
wellreceived. uh they're making a you

3248
02:23:56,000 --> 02:24:01,478
know big impact on on the concentrate

3249
02:23:59,920 --> 02:24:04,159
game

3250
02:24:01,478 --> 02:24:06,559
and you know finding its way through the

3251
02:24:04,159 --> 02:24:10,318
legal market some of the facilities and

3252
02:24:06,559 --> 02:24:12,799
stuff so that's exciting to me. Um I'm

3253
02:24:10,318 --> 02:24:15,840
you know been doing uh some haze stuff.

3254
02:24:12,799 --> 02:24:18,719
I'm always working on the hazes. So um I

3255
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:20,398
really been trying to um you know I just

3256
02:24:18,719 --> 02:24:24,559
did this new thing called the disco

3257
02:24:20,398 --> 02:24:27,920
haze. And so it's the cough times um

3258
02:24:24,559 --> 02:24:30,519
Chem D original haze. So that's more the

3259
02:24:27,920 --> 02:24:33,200
that original haze came from the Flying

3260
02:24:30,520 --> 02:24:36,640
Dutchman. And I believe that one's more

3261
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:38,800
of a Thai kind of a haze. And so the

3262
02:24:36,639 --> 02:24:42,719
cough is the same similar kind of a

3263
02:24:38,799 --> 02:24:45,199
haze. So that one um yeah, that one's

3264
02:24:42,719 --> 02:24:49,559
really good. I'm expecting that to make

3265
02:24:45,200 --> 02:24:52,399
some waves soon. And uh yeah, you know,

3266
02:24:49,559 --> 02:24:55,559
just going through, you know, different

3267
02:24:52,398 --> 02:24:58,159
things. Um but I

3268
02:24:55,559 --> 02:25:00,000
mean, seedwise, just you know, just

3269
02:24:58,159 --> 02:25:02,719
doing some hunts and stuff like that.

3270
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:04,719
And uh you know maybe I'm you know I'm

3271
02:25:02,719 --> 02:25:07,358
really maybe going to start maybe

3272
02:25:04,719 --> 02:25:09,519
starting to focus on uh some turpps a

3273
02:25:07,359 --> 02:25:13,040
little bit more but trying to stay

3274
02:25:09,520 --> 02:25:15,680
within my gene pool and maybe you know

3275
02:25:13,040 --> 02:25:18,399
maybe do a little out thing but I'm not

3276
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:21,200
really sure you know exactly on on that

3277
02:25:18,398 --> 02:25:23,358
direction yet. But it just seems like

3278
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:25,760
you know like I was explaining you know

3279
02:25:23,359 --> 02:25:31,200
before about the turpps and everything.

3280
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:34,559
I think that is it's so much more um in

3281
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:37,760
today's uh market on the way things kind

3282
02:25:34,559 --> 02:25:41,159
of smell you know and um like I said it

3283
02:25:37,760 --> 02:25:43,719
you know smelled a very you

3284
02:25:41,159 --> 02:25:47,840
know powerful

3285
02:25:43,719 --> 02:25:50,639
um sense and you know it's a big

3286
02:25:47,840 --> 02:25:53,280
determination on on the quality of the

3287
02:25:50,639 --> 02:25:56,279
flower where people are not looking for

3288
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:58,560
effect as mo as much you know

3289
02:25:56,280 --> 02:25:59,920
So, you know, you just got to kind of

3290
02:25:58,559 --> 02:26:02,239
Well, it's like you said, too, with

3291
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:03,680
Instagram, everything's visual based.

3292
02:26:02,239 --> 02:26:05,600
They're looking at what looks the

3293
02:26:03,680 --> 02:26:07,439
prettiest, you know, and that's in their

3294
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:10,159
mind that's what sells. And so, I I

3295
02:26:07,439 --> 02:26:12,800
necessarily don't I kind of march to the

3296
02:26:10,159 --> 02:26:16,000
beat of my own drum, but I'm always I'm

3297
02:26:12,799 --> 02:26:17,920
always, you know, conscious of what's

3298
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:20,719
going on around me and where the market

3299
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:22,719
is heading. And so I, you know, you

3300
02:26:20,719 --> 02:26:25,358
can't really lose sight of that even

3301
02:26:22,719 --> 02:26:27,760
though you want to do your own personal

3302
02:26:25,359 --> 02:26:29,439
things and everything and you know

3303
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:31,200
that's good in and everything but you

3304
02:26:29,439 --> 02:26:33,600
know you got to be you got to you got to

3305
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:36,479
be diversified I think in today's market

3306
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:38,960
where you got to do your own thing and

3307
02:26:36,478 --> 02:26:40,719
and you know your own niche thing and

3308
02:26:38,959 --> 02:26:43,759
then you can kind of touch on some of

3309
02:26:40,719 --> 02:26:47,358
the more popular things and you know you

3310
02:26:43,760 --> 02:26:49,680
just got to try to find a a nice rounded

3311
02:26:47,359 --> 02:26:52,079
program that's going to work for you

3312
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:53,920
depending on, you know, how many lights

3313
02:26:52,079 --> 02:26:56,398
you're running and how, you know, I wish

3314
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:58,439
I could [ __ ] run, you know, 100

3315
02:26:56,398 --> 02:27:01,439
lights and be doing like these big

3316
02:26:58,439 --> 02:27:03,280
population breeding projects and and

3317
02:27:01,439 --> 02:27:05,359
pheno hunts and stuff like that, but

3318
02:27:03,280 --> 02:27:07,120
it's it's just not possible, you know,

3319
02:27:05,359 --> 02:27:09,600
unless you're, you know, in in a

3320
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:12,560
commercial facility and, you know,

3321
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:14,559
things like that. So, um, that's not

3322
02:27:12,559 --> 02:27:17,199
really really what my main focus is

3323
02:27:14,559 --> 02:27:18,959
because the commercial game is just

3324
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:21,439
[ __ ]

3325
02:27:18,959 --> 02:27:23,679
it's just horrible over all around, you

3326
02:27:21,439 --> 02:27:26,398
know, just like working in those places

3327
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:28,960
and just it's just, you know, it's just

3328
02:27:26,398 --> 02:27:31,920
just not me. I'm more I'm more happy

3329
02:27:28,959 --> 02:27:34,959
just being kind of a small kind of a guy

3330
02:27:31,920 --> 02:27:39,359
and just do, you know, I would love to,

3331
02:27:34,959 --> 02:27:42,559
you know, be a legal brand and and all

3332
02:27:39,359 --> 02:27:46,079
that, but the way that, you know,

3333
02:27:42,559 --> 02:27:49,600
regulations and the licensing is set up,

3334
02:27:46,079 --> 02:27:51,200
it's just not set up for people to be

3335
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:54,559
profitable. And it's like if I'm going

3336
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:57,359
to invest my life savings in trying to

3337
02:27:54,559 --> 02:27:59,519
start, you know, a business, you know,

3338
02:27:57,359 --> 02:28:01,439
like, you know, I I'm going to I got to

3339
02:27:59,520 --> 02:28:03,680
make sure that it doesn't fail, you

3340
02:28:01,439 --> 02:28:06,559
know, cuz I, you know, at my age, you

3341
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:08,239
know, there's not any going back, you

3342
02:28:06,559 --> 02:28:10,398
know, so I want to keep what I have,

3343
02:28:08,239 --> 02:28:12,799
what I've, you know, I've worked all my

3344
02:28:10,398 --> 02:28:14,799
life for. And you know, I have a little

3345
02:28:12,799 --> 02:28:16,559
piece I could, you know, work with, but

3346
02:28:14,799 --> 02:28:19,119
like, you know, I'm not going to do it

3347
02:28:16,559 --> 02:28:21,840
unless I know I'm going to get instant

3348
02:28:19,120 --> 02:28:24,000
results. And the way things or at least

3349
02:28:21,840 --> 02:28:25,840
a safe result. Yeah. Exa. Exactly. You

3350
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:27,760
know, back in the day, at our age, we're

3351
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:30,159
not taking so many risks. No, but back

3352
02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:31,680
in the day, if things were like they

3353
02:28:30,159 --> 02:28:34,559
were back in the day where you could

3354
02:28:31,680 --> 02:28:36,079
[ __ ] sell wet weed and, you know, it

3355
02:28:34,559 --> 02:28:38,239
didn't matter what it was. I mean,

3356
02:28:36,079 --> 02:28:40,398
that's like a nobrainer. Like, that's

3357
02:28:38,239 --> 02:28:42,879
you know what I mean? like I'm all in on

3358
02:28:40,398 --> 02:28:45,358
a situation like that, but it was a safe

3359
02:28:42,879 --> 02:28:47,438
bet. Yes. Back then? Yes. It's It's not

3360
02:28:45,359 --> 02:28:50,800
a safe bet anymore. I I won't mention

3361
02:28:47,439 --> 02:28:52,800
anyone by name, but you and I both know

3362
02:28:50,799 --> 02:28:54,639
somebody that was at Mike's wedding that

3363
02:28:52,799 --> 02:28:57,679
we're talking about could have been his

3364
02:28:54,639 --> 02:29:00,318
best man if I didn't if I didn't do what

3365
02:28:57,680 --> 02:29:04,318
the priest said. And to be honest with

3366
02:29:00,318 --> 02:29:07,760
you, he grew [ __ ] weed. like, you know,

3367
02:29:04,318 --> 02:29:09,600
like it was but he always sold it, you

3368
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:12,960
know, like you were able to grow [ __ ]

3369
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:14,960
weed and and by the way, if he's

3370
02:29:12,959 --> 02:29:16,959
watching, I [ __ ] love this guy with

3371
02:29:14,959 --> 02:29:18,398
all my might. That's why I didn't say

3372
02:29:16,959 --> 02:29:21,279
that's why I didn't mention him by name,

3373
02:29:18,398 --> 02:29:25,239
but like um yeah, back in the day, you

3374
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:28,079
could grow [ __ ] weed and not cure it

3375
02:29:25,239 --> 02:29:30,760
properly and sell it for [ __ ] 6,000

3376
02:29:28,079 --> 02:29:33,600
to 10,000 a pound, you know? It was

3377
02:29:30,760 --> 02:29:36,880
insanity, you know? So, hey, I want to

3378
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:40,159
ask you, is this your Instagram? Can you

3379
02:29:36,879 --> 02:29:43,438
see that? The Real Top Dog Seeds. That's

3380
02:29:40,159 --> 02:29:45,680
me. Yeah. Um, so I just wanted to make

3381
02:29:43,439 --> 02:29:48,639
sure and give everybody an opportunity

3382
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:53,680
to check out JJ on Instagram at the Real

3383
02:29:48,639 --> 02:29:56,000
Top Dog Seeds and Do A WG. And actually

3384
02:29:53,680 --> 02:29:57,760
before we go, I I man, we'll keep on

3385
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:01,840
having more questions, but weren't you

3386
02:29:57,760 --> 02:30:04,800
the guy that originally called the dog,

3387
02:30:01,840 --> 02:30:06,960
you know, that spelled it D A WG? Yes.

3388
02:30:04,799 --> 02:30:09,679
Yes. And my really tell us about that.

3389
02:30:06,959 --> 02:30:12,398
It was the Trey dog that really and the

3390
02:30:09,680 --> 02:30:15,359
star dog that really And so I really did

3391
02:30:12,398 --> 02:30:18,318
that just to try to set myself apart,

3392
02:30:15,359 --> 02:30:20,559
you know, from from Greg and original

3393
02:30:18,318 --> 02:30:24,318
Chem Dog guy. And so I didn't really

3394
02:30:20,559 --> 02:30:26,879
want, you know, I, you know,

3395
02:30:24,318 --> 02:30:28,559
I'm not the one that credit, I can't

3396
02:30:26,879 --> 02:30:30,239
take credit for the chem, you know, I

3397
02:30:28,559 --> 02:30:32,478
can only take credit for working with

3398
02:30:30,239 --> 02:30:35,600
the chem. And I can only be, you know,

3399
02:30:32,478 --> 02:30:37,920
thankful that it was passed to me and

3400
02:30:35,600 --> 02:30:40,079
that I was able to do what I did with

3401
02:30:37,920 --> 02:30:43,040
it, you know, and so, you know, I I

3402
02:30:40,079 --> 02:30:45,439
can't really take any credit for for the

3403
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:48,000
chem or anything like that, but, you

3404
02:30:45,439 --> 02:30:50,800
know, I can, you know, take credit for

3405
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:54,000
what I've done with working with it,

3406
02:30:50,799 --> 02:30:55,199
though. And so I mean when we got it,

3407
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:57,920
you know, we knew it was something

3408
02:30:55,200 --> 02:30:59,840
special, you know, but back then like,

3409
02:30:57,920 --> 02:31:01,520
you know, we, you know, there was so

3410
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:03,040
many strains back then. You didn't

3411
02:31:01,520 --> 02:31:05,200
really know the we didn't really know

3412
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:08,240
the whole genetic pool like we know it

3413
02:31:05,200 --> 02:31:10,960
now. and like unknowingly like you know

3414
02:31:08,239 --> 02:31:13,520
it was the best weed that I ever got

3415
02:31:10,959 --> 02:31:15,438
back in the day but I'm sure that there

3416
02:31:13,520 --> 02:31:18,159
was other weeds that were just as good

3417
02:31:15,439 --> 02:31:22,159
if not arguably be better that that that

3418
02:31:18,159 --> 02:31:24,719
we probably lost you know and so um yeah

3419
02:31:22,159 --> 02:31:26,398
like I said I was just lucky to be at

3420
02:31:24,719 --> 02:31:28,239
the right place at the right time and be

3421
02:31:26,398 --> 02:31:30,159
able to get that strain not knowing that

3422
02:31:28,239 --> 02:31:32,478
it was going to be what it is today you

3423
02:31:30,159 --> 02:31:35,200
know which you know that that was just

3424
02:31:32,478 --> 02:31:37,199
dumb luck

3425
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:38,720
for Sure. And I see on your Instagram

3426
02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:40,640
you have a Discord. Is that a good way

3427
02:31:38,719 --> 02:31:42,559
to uh you know if someone wanted to put

3428
02:31:40,639 --> 02:31:45,279
in you know an order or something? Yeah.

3429
02:31:42,559 --> 02:31:47,680
Yeah. The Discord is a lot more looser

3430
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:49,840
and the way we talk and you know stuff

3431
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:53,120
like that. And I also have another

3432
02:31:49,840 --> 02:31:55,920
backup um Instagram account Top Dog

3433
02:31:53,120 --> 02:31:55,920
Siege

3434
02:31:56,040 --> 02:32:03,760
JJNYC. So yeah, uh the the the Discord

3435
02:32:00,398 --> 02:32:06,719
is um is is a little bit, you know, of a

3436
02:32:03,760 --> 02:32:09,359
more stable platform where we could

3437
02:32:06,719 --> 02:32:13,438
actually have like conversations. People

3438
02:32:09,359 --> 02:32:15,280
can show, you know, uh what what they're

3439
02:32:13,439 --> 02:32:18,639
and really the Discord is not even

3440
02:32:15,280 --> 02:32:22,000
really about me. is like mo it's mostly

3441
02:32:18,639 --> 02:32:24,318
about the users and they're the they're

3442
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:27,200
the ones that are posting what they're

3443
02:32:24,318 --> 02:32:29,039
finding in in in Top Dog Seeds and

3444
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:30,960
talking about other strains that are

3445
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:33,439
relevant and can you know just the

3446
02:32:30,959 --> 02:32:36,959
cannabis community and everything. So,

3447
02:32:33,439 --> 02:32:39,359
it's really kind of set up more for the

3448
02:32:36,959 --> 02:32:42,559
users and people that that buy the

3449
02:32:39,359 --> 02:32:46,079
seeds. And I try not to like get too

3450
02:32:42,559 --> 02:32:48,719
involved in in editing comments, good or

3451
02:32:46,079 --> 02:32:51,039
bad. You know, if someone pop, you know,

3452
02:32:48,719 --> 02:32:53,760
pops a pack of my seeds and they're not

3453
02:32:51,040 --> 02:32:56,240
happy, they say a [ __ ] or whatever the

3454
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:58,639
case may be. Like, you know, that that's

3455
02:32:56,239 --> 02:33:00,280
their opinion. You know, I'm not I'm not

3456
02:32:58,639 --> 02:33:03,279
going to

3457
02:33:00,280 --> 02:33:06,000
cherrypick comments that are uh that are

3458
02:33:03,280 --> 02:33:08,319
good and bad to to make myself look

3459
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:11,040
better. you know, uh, the proof is in

3460
02:33:08,318 --> 02:33:13,760
the pudding. And if 10 people say it

3461
02:33:11,040 --> 02:33:17,920
sucks, I would [ __ ] I would bet that

3462
02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:20,159
it probably sucks. So, you know, my at

3463
02:33:17,920 --> 02:33:23,439
the end of the day, my opinion doesn't

3464
02:33:20,159 --> 02:33:26,559
mean nothing. you know, whose opinion

3465
02:33:23,439 --> 02:33:29,439
matters are the people that are finding

3466
02:33:26,559 --> 02:33:32,478
the results, you know, and so if we want

3467
02:33:29,439 --> 02:33:34,239
to be honest about and and transparent

3468
02:33:32,478 --> 02:33:36,959
about everything, and that's the way I

3469
02:33:34,239 --> 02:33:38,398
I've always been, good and bad, you

3470
02:33:36,959 --> 02:33:40,000
know, you're not always going to hit a

3471
02:33:38,398 --> 02:33:42,959
home run. You're going to you're going

3472
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:44,239
to, you know, get a a couple uh ones

3473
02:33:42,959 --> 02:33:46,159
that aren't that aren't going to make

3474
02:33:44,239 --> 02:33:47,600
the cut or whatever. And, you know, you

3475
02:33:46,159 --> 02:33:50,000
just got to live. you start editing out

3476
02:33:47,600 --> 02:33:53,439
the bad comments, then people know that

3477
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:56,079
it's that it's not legit. You don't have

3478
02:33:53,439 --> 02:33:58,398
the like you don't want to edit out all

3479
02:33:56,079 --> 02:34:01,039
the comments, you know, all the bad

3480
02:33:58,398 --> 02:34:02,799
comments. It's just no, it's just and

3481
02:34:01,040 --> 02:34:04,720
even, you know, people can personally

3482
02:34:02,799 --> 02:34:06,639
attack me or say whatever they want

3483
02:34:04,719 --> 02:34:10,398
about me. Like I said, it doesn't mean

3484
02:34:06,639 --> 02:34:12,478
that it's true. I mean, but am I g, you

3485
02:34:10,398 --> 02:34:15,279
know, just because they said something

3486
02:34:12,478 --> 02:34:17,920
that I don't like, you know, am I going

3487
02:34:15,280 --> 02:34:20,640
to edit that that out? I may argue with

3488
02:34:17,920 --> 02:34:23,200
that person and try to, you know, prove

3489
02:34:20,639 --> 02:34:27,439
my point or whatever, but you know, they

3490
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:29,760
have an opinion and uh in a point also.

3491
02:34:27,439 --> 02:34:32,720
So, it doesn't mean that it's right, but

3492
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:33,920
you know, we can we can debate that.

3493
02:34:32,719 --> 02:34:35,438
Yeah. But opinions could be like

3494
02:34:33,920 --> 02:34:37,280
[ __ ] you know. We all got one and

3495
02:34:35,439 --> 02:34:41,280
they all stink. Yeah. No, some stink

3496
02:34:37,280 --> 02:34:43,600
more than others, you know. So, uh yeah,

3497
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:46,479
you're you're right about that. So, you

3498
02:34:43,600 --> 02:34:49,920
know, you know, to me, just trying to be

3499
02:34:46,478 --> 02:34:52,478
transparent and honest and you know, you

3500
02:34:49,920 --> 02:34:53,799
you you just got to, you know, operate

3501
02:34:52,478 --> 02:34:56,239
correctly

3502
02:34:53,799 --> 02:35:00,799
and, you know, everything will, you

3503
02:34:56,239 --> 02:35:03,039
know, take its place down the road.

3504
02:35:00,799 --> 02:35:07,438
Well, there's a reason why you have had

3505
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:09,920
the longevity you've had and I I think

3506
02:35:07,439 --> 02:35:11,439
it's because of that, you know. Well,

3507
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:13,120
people, you know, you could ask people

3508
02:35:11,439 --> 02:35:15,439
who know me personally and they'll tell

3509
02:35:13,120 --> 02:35:17,600
me, they'll tell you who I am, you know,

3510
02:35:15,439 --> 02:35:20,398
and those are the people who know me,

3511
02:35:17,600 --> 02:35:22,800
you know, and so your reputation kind of

3512
02:35:20,398 --> 02:35:25,119
follows you and the longer you you're

3513
02:35:22,799 --> 02:35:27,279
around, you know, the more people can

3514
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:28,280
vouch for you and, you know, it's just

3515
02:35:27,280 --> 02:35:31,359
something

3516
02:35:28,280 --> 02:35:33,600
that, you know, over time it just, you

3517
02:35:31,359 --> 02:35:36,600
know, it is what it is, you know, so you

3518
02:35:33,600 --> 02:35:40,720
just try to [ __ ] stay correct

3519
02:35:36,600 --> 02:35:43,640
and, you know, it, you And and if people

3520
02:35:40,719 --> 02:35:47,760
want to hate on you, then

3521
02:35:43,639 --> 02:35:49,279
then e even the best who if you're in

3522
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:51,880
the public eye, it doesn't matter who

3523
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:53,880
you are. If you're a singer,

3524
02:35:51,879 --> 02:35:57,119
entertainer, play

3525
02:35:53,879 --> 02:35:59,438
sports, anything, there's someone that

3526
02:35:57,120 --> 02:36:01,120
hates you. So there's someone that don't

3527
02:35:59,439 --> 02:36:03,200
like you for whatever reason. I don't

3528
02:36:01,120 --> 02:36:04,800
like their song. I don't like, you know,

3529
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:06,800
I don't like their team. I don't like

3530
02:36:04,799 --> 02:36:08,799
this. I don't you know so it's something

3531
02:36:06,799 --> 02:36:11,920
that you got to live with you know and

3532
02:36:08,799 --> 02:36:16,000
and if you got a thin skin and you can't

3533
02:36:11,920 --> 02:36:18,559
take hate and you know I would say you

3534
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:20,959
know being in the public eye is probably

3535
02:36:18,559 --> 02:36:23,680
not for you you know because do you

3536
02:36:20,959 --> 02:36:26,719
think it's do you think it's thin skin

3537
02:36:23,680 --> 02:36:28,800
or do you think that it could be caring

3538
02:36:26,719 --> 02:36:30,478
too much what people think about you

3539
02:36:28,799 --> 02:36:32,398
because well that too I mean I used to

3540
02:36:30,478 --> 02:36:35,199
think you know I don't think I have thin

3541
02:36:32,398 --> 02:36:37,760
skin but I do care what people think of

3542
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:39,439
you. I I do. I do too. And back in the

3543
02:36:37,760 --> 02:36:41,439
day, it meant something when you were on

3544
02:36:39,439 --> 02:36:43,280
the forums, you know? It really meant

3545
02:36:41,439 --> 02:36:44,960
something because that's all you had was

3546
02:36:43,280 --> 02:36:47,359
what people said about you. You know

3547
02:36:44,959 --> 02:36:50,079
what I mean? So, you could be be black

3548
02:36:47,359 --> 02:36:52,640
balled out of the community very easily.

3549
02:36:50,079 --> 02:36:55,039
In today's world, it's it's totally

3550
02:36:52,639 --> 02:36:58,000
different now. you know, it's just, you

3551
02:36:55,040 --> 02:37:01,200
know, it's like kind of anything goes,

3552
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:03,520
you know, with the scammers and copycats

3553
02:37:01,200 --> 02:37:08,560
and just, you know, just keeps going on

3554
02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:12,079
and on. Uh, so you just got to kind of

3555
02:37:08,559 --> 02:37:14,478
block all of that out and you know, you

3556
02:37:12,079 --> 02:37:16,879
know what's true and what's not true. So

3557
02:37:14,478 --> 02:37:20,079
when people are saying stuff that's not

3558
02:37:16,879 --> 02:37:23,358
true about you, you can't let that

3559
02:37:20,079 --> 02:37:26,318
bother you or show that person that it

3560
02:37:23,359 --> 02:37:28,359
bother you bothers you because they just

3561
02:37:26,318 --> 02:37:30,879
they'll just continue on and make it

3562
02:37:28,359 --> 02:37:33,040
worse. You know, it feeds the trolls

3563
02:37:30,879 --> 02:37:35,199
entertainment. Yes. you know, and and

3564
02:37:33,040 --> 02:37:38,319
some for some people that's what their

3565
02:37:35,200 --> 02:37:41,280
sole mission on the internet is to do is

3566
02:37:38,318 --> 02:37:44,318
just to try to, you know, ruin people

3567
02:37:41,280 --> 02:37:46,000
because their their life is sucks

3568
02:37:44,318 --> 02:37:50,879
themselves. So, they want to make

3569
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:50,879
everyone as miserable as as they are.

3570
02:37:55,000 --> 02:38:01,040
So, Oh, uh, Gabby, you're muted.

3571
02:37:59,040 --> 02:38:04,240
I said, "I I really appreciate you for

3572
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:06,960
coming on, JJ, and we could talk for

3573
02:38:04,239 --> 02:38:09,680
hours more and and we should we should

3574
02:38:06,959 --> 02:38:12,159
do it again. Um I think we probably

3575
02:38:09,680 --> 02:38:14,559
could do another show of two and a half,

3576
02:38:12,159 --> 02:38:16,639
three hours and and still not scratch

3577
02:38:14,559 --> 02:38:18,879
the surface." Yeah. No, there's just so

3578
02:38:16,639 --> 02:38:20,719
there's just so much out there now that,

3579
02:38:18,879 --> 02:38:22,478
you know, it's uh I mean, one thing

3580
02:38:20,719 --> 02:38:23,760
like, you know, I I do want you to come

3581
02:38:22,478 --> 02:38:26,799
back cuz I want to hear the stories

3582
02:38:23,760 --> 02:38:28,880
about how you were busted and, you know,

3583
02:38:26,799 --> 02:38:31,840
Yeah. There's no real behind any of

3584
02:38:28,879 --> 02:38:35,119
that. Well, it's not about glory, but

3585
02:38:31,840 --> 02:38:36,880
it's a it's still Yeah, it's part I

3586
02:38:35,120 --> 02:38:38,880
mean, it was part of our lives. It's

3587
02:38:36,879 --> 02:38:40,318
it's something that we had to deal with

3588
02:38:38,879 --> 02:38:41,358
on a regular. If you want to finish what

3589
02:38:40,318 --> 02:38:42,719
you were saying, and if you have

3590
02:38:41,359 --> 02:38:44,800
anything you want to say about the Yeah,

3591
02:38:42,719 --> 02:38:47,760
I mean I mean it is one of the best

3592
02:38:44,799 --> 02:38:50,239
strains that, you know, that that's out

3593
02:38:47,760 --> 02:38:52,559
there in existence today, you know. I'm

3594
02:38:50,239 --> 02:38:54,159
sure

3595
02:38:52,559 --> 02:38:56,318
that's a matter of opinion, you know.

3596
02:38:54,159 --> 02:38:58,879
But the thing about the 91, it it

3597
02:38:56,318 --> 02:39:01,519
doesn't have no taste to it. And I don't

3598
02:38:58,879 --> 02:39:02,719
think it's not it's not quite as strong.

3599
02:39:01,520 --> 02:39:05,520
Not quite as strong. That's what I think

3600
02:39:02,719 --> 02:39:07,679
it has. I don't think it's got the onion

3601
02:39:05,520 --> 02:39:11,280
garicky thing going on. How can you say

3602
02:39:07,680 --> 02:39:14,880
that? Yeah. But I I just want the chem

3603
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:18,720
the 91 taste is what my that's kind of a

3604
02:39:14,879 --> 02:39:21,839
more desires and and the chem I I agree

3605
02:39:18,719 --> 02:39:23,679
that the chem might be more potent but

3606
02:39:21,840 --> 02:39:25,520
for me it's all about the terms. I don't

3607
02:39:23,680 --> 02:39:28,000
know. To me it's a little more blandish

3608
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:29,920
the chem the 91. But I still appreciate

3609
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:32,318
it. I love it. You know what I mean? But

3610
02:39:29,920 --> 02:39:35,120
it's a lot harder to grow too than than

3611
02:39:32,318 --> 02:39:37,519
the n the chem. The 91 is kind of like

3612
02:39:35,120 --> 02:39:40,160
the the sour diesel. It's kind of

3613
02:39:37,520 --> 02:39:42,319
finicky and sometimes it can come out a

3614
02:39:40,159 --> 02:39:45,760
little bit a little bit different than

3615
02:39:42,318 --> 02:39:47,760
others, but like um like like we've been

3616
02:39:45,760 --> 02:39:50,159
growing it and it's kind of gotten like

3617
02:39:47,760 --> 02:39:53,120
this little kind of purpley tip to it

3618
02:39:50,159 --> 02:39:55,920
almost now in in in the in in the turpps

3619
02:39:53,120 --> 02:39:58,760
that are coming out on it. Like it it's

3620
02:39:55,920 --> 02:40:02,318
uh kind of t almost like a

3621
02:39:58,760 --> 02:40:05,960
little purpley grapey just a little

3622
02:40:02,318 --> 02:40:09,199
slight tinge in there, you know? But um

3623
02:40:05,959 --> 02:40:11,438
yeah, it's funny, you know, that I think

3624
02:40:09,200 --> 02:40:13,760
it's kind of changed over the years a

3625
02:40:11,439 --> 02:40:15,960
little bit. How does the four uh I mean

3626
02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:20,478
the four was kind of found

3627
02:40:15,959 --> 02:40:23,519
afterwards and um so I guess that that

3628
02:40:20,478 --> 02:40:25,760
uh Greg had seeds. Well, I guess he had

3629
02:40:23,520 --> 02:40:27,600
like 12 or 13 seeds originally. Then he

3630
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:32,079
popped I don't know how many maybe like

3631
02:40:27,600 --> 02:40:35,280
half of them or then he gave um the

3632
02:40:32,079 --> 02:40:38,559
other four seeds the Joe brand and he

3633
02:40:35,280 --> 02:40:41,680
found the chem one two three four and I

3634
02:40:38,559 --> 02:40:45,519
I wound up breeding with the the chem

3635
02:40:41,680 --> 02:40:47,840
four and that was the the one um that

3636
02:40:45,520 --> 02:40:50,920
was the best one out of the four and

3637
02:40:47,840 --> 02:40:54,719
like some people like to think that it's

3638
02:40:50,920 --> 02:40:56,879
it's not the same as a chem you know

3639
02:40:54,719 --> 02:40:59,438
that It's different than the Chem91 and

3640
02:40:56,879 --> 02:41:01,920
Chem D. And you know, they they might

3641
02:40:59,439 --> 02:41:03,439
have an arguable point there. It's kind

3642
02:41:01,920 --> 02:41:06,760
of hard to say, you know, because like

3643
02:41:03,439 --> 02:41:10,159
the one, two, three, four very all the

3644
02:41:06,760 --> 02:41:14,800
same. And whereas the 91 is kind of

3645
02:41:10,159 --> 02:41:17,280
stand on its own and the Chem the Chem D

3646
02:41:14,799 --> 02:41:19,279
and the Chemister were alike. So there

3647
02:41:17,280 --> 02:41:22,479
was like almost three different

3648
02:41:19,280 --> 02:41:26,000
phenotypes in there. And so with the

3649
02:41:22,478 --> 02:41:28,879
last four being popped last, you know,

3650
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:31,840
there is some controversy of people

3651
02:41:28,879 --> 02:41:33,920
saying that it might not be it might

3652
02:41:31,840 --> 02:41:36,398
have been seeds of the chem or something

3653
02:41:33,920 --> 02:41:38,799
like that like a cross of the chem

3654
02:41:36,398 --> 02:41:42,239
should I say and not the original chem.

3655
02:41:38,799 --> 02:41:44,759
But none of that can really

3656
02:41:42,239 --> 02:41:49,359
I mean that story kind of checks out

3657
02:41:44,760 --> 02:41:50,840
because you know Greg had four seeds of

3658
02:41:49,359 --> 02:41:54,000
the original

3659
02:41:50,840 --> 02:41:55,680
ones and then years later more but the

3660
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:58,318
thing the but but they said the same

3661
02:41:55,680 --> 02:42:01,280
thing about the about the Chem D and my

3662
02:41:58,318 --> 02:42:05,439
argument is like cuz he he he popped

3663
02:42:01,280 --> 02:42:08,319
them in 2005 or six or whatever in the

3664
02:42:05,439 --> 02:42:12,239
90 I mean the the Chem D and the Chem

3665
02:42:08,318 --> 02:42:14,959
and sister are almost exactly alike

3666
02:42:12,239 --> 02:42:17,439
other than one being more sativa and the

3667
02:42:14,959 --> 02:42:19,318
other one being more indiga but there's

3668
02:42:17,439 --> 02:42:21,920
no denying that they're they're not

3669
02:42:19,318 --> 02:42:23,840
sisters. Okay. So you can definitely say

3670
02:42:21,920 --> 02:42:27,120
that those are they're the same. And

3671
02:42:23,840 --> 02:42:29,600
then the 91 was in the same pop as the

3672
02:42:27,120 --> 02:42:30,920
sister. So those two are confirmed right

3673
02:42:29,600 --> 02:42:34,000
there.

3674
02:42:30,920 --> 02:42:36,079
So yeah, the last four seeds that were

3675
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:39,520
popped that were totally different from

3676
02:42:36,079 --> 02:42:44,318
those two. I guess you can argue that it

3677
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:47,280
could be that is can we prove it? It can

3678
02:42:44,318 --> 02:42:49,359
never be proven, you know, but I don't

3679
02:42:47,280 --> 02:42:51,439
know. It's just one of those. Yeah, I

3680
02:42:49,359 --> 02:42:53,040
was going to say is this one of those

3681
02:42:51,439 --> 02:42:56,079
things in cannabis that we'll never

3682
02:42:53,040 --> 02:42:57,520
know. We'll never know.

3683
02:42:56,079 --> 02:42:59,520
Right.

3684
02:42:57,520 --> 02:43:02,720
What Greg always said was, "You're

3685
02:42:59,520 --> 02:43:05,840
muted, cosmic." What What Greg always

3686
02:43:02,719 --> 02:43:08,799
said was that anything he grows is the

3687
02:43:05,840 --> 02:43:11,760
Chem Dog. Right. Okay. Cuz he's Chem

3688
02:43:08,799 --> 02:43:13,679
Dog. Yeah.

3689
02:43:11,760 --> 02:43:17,280
That if you were to rank those three,

3690
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:21,280
uh, yeah, I would say Chem D, 91, Chem 4

3691
02:43:17,280 --> 02:43:22,800
for me. You know,

3692
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:25,040
I'm growing Chem4 for the first time

3693
02:43:22,799 --> 02:43:27,599
right now. And Chem 4 is kind of funny

3694
02:43:25,040 --> 02:43:31,200
because for me when I grew Chem 4 it

3695
02:43:27,600 --> 02:43:34,559
always finished like 60 63 days. Other

3696
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:36,720
people are like I take it to like 77 or

3697
02:43:34,559 --> 02:43:39,119
something like that, you know. And so

3698
02:43:36,719 --> 02:43:44,438
and even my star dog, you know, which is

3699
02:43:39,120 --> 02:43:49,359
pretty much Chem 4. He's kind of chem uh

3700
02:43:44,439 --> 02:43:51,760
chem arguably Afghan, but uh all of

3701
02:43:49,359 --> 02:43:54,159
those come out finishing pretty much

3702
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:57,318
like the Chem 4, you know, they they're

3703
02:43:54,159 --> 02:44:00,799
all kind of kind of short squat uh big

3704
02:43:57,318 --> 02:44:04,318
buds uh finishes and usually like 63

3705
02:44:00,799 --> 02:44:06,398
days and stuff. So, um, yeah, it's it's,

3706
02:44:04,318 --> 02:44:08,799
you know, the Chem4, you know, the the

3707
02:44:06,398 --> 02:44:10,959
genetics are pretty dominant on on it,

3708
02:44:08,799 --> 02:44:13,679
you know, and it kind of has that piny

3709
02:44:10,959 --> 02:44:16,079
kind of little bit of fruiness to it,

3710
02:44:13,680 --> 02:44:19,600
you know, depending on the phenotype

3711
02:44:16,079 --> 02:44:21,719
and, you know, if it leans more chem,

3712
02:44:19,600 --> 02:44:25,720
which kind of like the Corey Star Dog

3713
02:44:21,719 --> 02:44:27,760
does, and or the guava, which is more

3714
02:44:25,719 --> 02:44:30,159
Chem4. So, that was kind of the

3715
02:44:27,760 --> 02:44:32,880
differences in in that in that cross

3716
02:44:30,159 --> 02:44:32,879
there.

3717
02:44:35,520 --> 02:44:39,279
Nice. That's very interesting. Yeah, I I

3718
02:44:37,840 --> 02:44:40,719
love all those trains. So, it's it's so

3719
02:44:39,279 --> 02:44:43,120
cool to hear the history, you know,

3720
02:44:40,719 --> 02:44:45,039
right right from you.

3721
02:44:43,120 --> 02:44:48,160
Well, like I said, JJ, we got to have

3722
02:44:45,040 --> 02:44:50,800
you come back on because we got we got

3723
02:44:48,159 --> 02:44:52,639
way more stories to tell. So, just just

3724
02:44:50,799 --> 02:44:55,358
let us know one's good for you and, you

3725
02:44:52,639 --> 02:44:58,959
know, and we'll get you back on. And I I

3726
02:44:55,359 --> 02:45:00,640
I really appreciate you spending 3 hours

3727
02:44:58,959 --> 02:45:02,959
of your day with us. I would like to get

3728
02:45:00,639 --> 02:45:06,159
on, you know, it' be nice to get on with

3729
02:45:02,959 --> 02:45:09,919
like Klopp or some, you know, get, you

3730
02:45:06,159 --> 02:45:11,760
know, Klopp AJ, you know, try to get,

3731
02:45:09,920 --> 02:45:14,398
you know, kind of a group thing of the

3732
02:45:11,760 --> 02:45:16,318
people that were, you know, were there

3733
02:45:14,398 --> 02:45:19,680
back in the day, you know, we if we can

3734
02:45:16,318 --> 02:45:21,600
get, you know, Vondo or Maxwell and try

3735
02:45:19,680 --> 02:45:24,318
to get, you know, some of this, you

3736
02:45:21,600 --> 02:45:28,559
know, the the the sour trying to sort it

3737
02:45:24,318 --> 02:45:31,199
out. Yeah. Sour diesel round table.

3738
02:45:28,559 --> 02:45:34,000
Yeah. I just don't qualify to be there

3739
02:45:31,200 --> 02:45:37,439
except maybe as a guest.

3740
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:40,398
But yeah, I'll I'll know that Mike will

3741
02:45:37,439 --> 02:45:43,120
do a a video with you. I actually

3742
02:45:40,398 --> 02:45:45,920
thought about having him come on to do

3743
02:45:43,120 --> 02:45:48,800
this one, but I just kind of wanted to

3744
02:45:45,920 --> 02:45:51,439
do one with with you first, but Michael

3745
02:45:48,799 --> 02:45:53,679
do it for sure. Um, and then we can call

3746
02:45:51,439 --> 02:45:57,279
these I you know, I don't talk with uh

3747
02:45:53,680 --> 02:46:00,398
AJ very much. I'm in I'm in I got his

3748
02:45:57,279 --> 02:46:03,920
number. I'm in, you know, um, usual

3749
02:46:00,398 --> 02:46:06,079
contact with him. Yeah, let's do it. Let

3750
02:46:03,920 --> 02:46:09,520
Let's do a Sour Diesel round table real

3751
02:46:06,079 --> 02:46:11,200
soon. And until then, I hope you have a

3752
02:46:09,520 --> 02:46:12,960
Yeah, you too. I appreciate you having

3753
02:46:11,200 --> 02:46:16,399
me on and everything and everything's

3754
02:46:12,959 --> 02:46:19,199
going good for you. Oh, I'm sure I had

3755
02:46:16,398 --> 02:46:23,159
the most fun of anyone here. Okay, take

3756
02:46:19,200 --> 02:46:23,159
care, guys. Thanks, buddy.

3757
02:46:23,950 --> 02:46:33,579
[Music]

3758
02:46:34,159 --> 02:46:36,239
Oh
