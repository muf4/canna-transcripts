00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:13,359
Hello and welcome to another episode of

2
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:15,759
the Way We Grow podcast, a production of

3
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:18,559
the Craft Growers Network. I'm your

4
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,960
host, Nick Wolf. Today, our guest is

5
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,799
none other than Dog Doctor. Um, you can

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,679
find him and his work at Dog Doctor

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,560
Official on Instagram, Grow Diaries, and

8
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,160
on YouTube. Uh, Mr. Dog Doctor, how are

9
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,919
you doing today?

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,520
And Nick, first of all, thank you so

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,120
much for having me here. It's an honor

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,680
and I'm feeling very humbled. Thank you

13
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,679
so much. I'm doing great. Enjoying the

14
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,519
winter and the range that uh we're

15
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:43,759
waiting for spring to come. Apart from

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,960
that, living life in the moment as most

17
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:49,119
as I can. Thank you. For sure. Yeah, I

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,640
feel like uh that's how a lot of us are

19
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,640
feeling. just waiting for spring to get

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,759
here so we can start to plan some

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,520
outdoor grows or uh you know I know that

22
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,839
for indoor growers you got to start to

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,600
think about a little more heat maybe uh

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,920
heat mitigation and stuff like that. So

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,280
that's definitely it's an important time

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,879
of year for growers in general. Um

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,118
yeah. What's new in your grow world

28
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,798
though? I feel like uh you know you

29
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,200
you're always doing something new in

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,520
your grow and um from every time that

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,439
I've listened to you talk about it on

32
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,759
like growing with my fellow growers or

33
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,118
just chatted with you on Instagram, you

34
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,920
know, you're always doing something new.

35
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:30,560
So what's new for you? At the moment I'm

36
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,640
um searching for that wrench again. I

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,400
lost that run that actually the one that

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,560
the photo that you took in the few days

39
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,240
ago on

40
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,759
Instagram two summers ago I lost her to

41
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:44,319
a heatwave and Zamnes started a contest

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,118
on grow diaries which they do a lot of

43
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:49,758
it and the seeds they were providing for

44
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:52,560
the contest were nonetheless the zamnes

45
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,040
so the runs so I decided to okay we have

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,519
the setup from troll master now I did

47
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,840
one run with it let's test the setup now

48
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,078
in a different way I'm changing a few

49
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,560
parameters in there because it's my

50
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:07,599
second time running under canopy lights

51
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,598
and the spectum tuning. So I like to

52
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,239
learn by mistakes. I see what others do

53
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:15,119
and try to learn by their mistakes also.

54
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,439
But I truly believe that um making the

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,280
mistakes ourselves.

56
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:23,680
uh we we learn in in a different way

57
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,598
than seeing others making mistakes of of

58
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,719
course I'm not chasing that mistakes to

59
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:30,639
be made but I know that when growing and

60
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,639
when everybody is growing in trying new

61
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,598
things that mistakes are there to be

62
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:39,359
made so lessons are there to be learned

63
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:42,560
and uh right now I'm learning how to

64
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,160
spectrum tuning and how to manage the

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,120
inner canopy lights. Last run I flipped

66
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:51,680
the them into flower and only at week

67
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,640
two more or less I connected the ender

68
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,080
canopy lights. This time instead of that

69
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:01,759
I connected uh straight away from uh the

70
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,400
moment I did the 48 hours dark. I do 48

71
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,399
hours dark before flipping into flower.

72
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,719
To my understanding, I'm not saying this

73
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,560
is the best way or the way to do it. To

74
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,359
my understanding, this helps triging the

75
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,560
plants into flower mode.

76
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,280
Meaning that instead of waiting one week

77
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,280
and something for that first pre flowers

78
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,439
to start showing that there are

79
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,959
flowering three four days only, I

80
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,759
already start to see the little bulks

81
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,519
and I tr I honestly believe it's that 48

82
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:33,679
hours dark that um make that happening

83
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,120
faster. I don't know. Yeah, I mean you

84
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,799
definitely see a lot of people using

85
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,640
practices like that. I know it was

86
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,480
really popular for a while and I've even

87
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,679
seen people in the commercial space use

88
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:45,840
it um because of of their belief that it

89
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,680
does help trigger the flowering process

90
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,479
sooner and uh if the end goal is to get

91
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,799
as many different um harvests as you can

92
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:59,840
then uh starting the flower cycle sooner

93
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,599
um when you initiate flower as well. You

94
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,039
know, it it should potentially bring

95
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:07,199
down the um the overall flowering time.

96
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,120
So, I could see how how that could be

97
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,839
beneficial. I've I've never really found

98
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,759
any success with it myself, but you

99
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,199
know, I think sometimes it's just based

100
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:19,599
on the on the space perhaps. Exactly.

101
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,759
What works here in my space may not work

102
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,680
in your space or in somebody else's

103
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,319
space because all space are conditions

104
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,720
are different. I encourage everybody to

105
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,478
try all methods that they feel that it's

106
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,840
something that they would like, not all

107
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,120
at the same time. Otherwise, if

108
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:37,439
something doesn't work, you don't know

109
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,759
what it is. But this way you can uh find

110
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,719
the better way for yourself, for your

111
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,240
space, for your grow, for your needs.

112
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,759
Some people have more time to be with

113
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,478
the plants, other don't have time to be

114
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,000
with the plants. So just in here, you

115
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,319
have to find different medium. For

116
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,439
instance, if you want to do cocoa and no

117
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:58,240
and do hand

118
00:04:54,439 --> 00:05:00,000
water, maybe you shouldn't you need to

119
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,600
be with your plants every day. If you

120
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,120
have a water system, maybe you don't

121
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,520
have to be with your plants every day.

122
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,759
If you're doing soil, it can be more

123
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,000
forgiving because it takes longer to dry

124
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,879
also. So, it retains the water longer.

125
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,639
So, every case is a different case. In

126
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,478
my opinion, home growers, they don't

127
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,680
need to

128
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:22,159
go hydroponic. Like, if you have a big

129
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,240
facility, I can see why you do that

130
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,479
because of the production and how fast

131
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,400
it is and how easy to it is to correct

132
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,478
everything. Something is wrong. Now I

133
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:33,519
just flush and start again and in in one

134
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:35,120
day plants are again thriving. If you

135
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,959
are home growing looking for better

136
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,399
quality for a better connection with the

137
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:42,719
plant for all of it the soil it's more

138
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,719
forgiving. In my humbled opinion the

139
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,759
flavor in the end is also better from

140
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,080
soil than it is from um rock poolool and

141
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,639
stuff like that. Again this is a

142
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,959
personal opinion.

143
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,319
There's no no test. I did not test.

144
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:00,239
Let's see this. So this is but no for my

145
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,279
experience and for my easy way of

146
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,360
growing I I am with my plants every day

147
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,279
but still sometimes from time to time I

148
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,160
don't have time to go there one two days

149
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,519
because life happens and something soil

150
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,120
and the auto pot oh my

151
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:19,198
god they were a bless coming in my life

152
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,519
and one that I really really appreciate

153
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,720
this this auto pot system is it's

154
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:27,359
amazing it's really amazing how easy it

155
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,960
makes one's life and it works on gravity

156
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,360
or on density or whatever you want to

157
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:34,079
call it, but the weight of the water

158
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,240
brings it down. Meaning even if there is

159
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:39,120
no electricity, plants will drink as

160
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,879
they please. And yeah, that's that's

161
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,319
definitely something that I um I've seen

162
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,478
a lot of home growers get a lot of

163
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,000
success with because it's it is easy and

164
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:47,680
it makes it so that you don't have to

165
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,680
worry too much about certain aspects of

166
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,918
the grow, especially if you are running

167
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,680
like some sort of living soil where you

168
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,240
need to maintain a certain moisture

169
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,720
content for the biological activity to

170
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,560
continue. Um, you know, in in some

171
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,479
cases, like with hydroponics and stuff,

172
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,598
I would say that maybe the auto pot

173
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:08,639
system isn't the most ideal because you

174
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:11,759
can't really control a good dryback uh

175
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,280
interval. Yeah.

176
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,800
Sorry. And you can probably build up

177
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,318
salts pretty quickly, too, if you're

178
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,560
feeding too high with something like

179
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,919
that. So, um, yeah, that's I I've seen a

180
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,360
lot of people use it. I haven't

181
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,598
personally tried them out, but I've

182
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,560
always been interested in them. Um, but

183
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:30,639
you know earlier in the conversation you

184
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,038
started talking about how you are on

185
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,519
your second run of under canopy lighting

186
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:37,759
and as a commercial grower I've been

187
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,758
using it for a little while now and I I

188
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:43,120
love them. So, I wanted to find out what

189
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,800
your um experience with them has been

190
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,680
considering it is kind of one of those

191
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,240
things that is

192
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:53,199
uh it's still fairly new in the cannabis

193
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,840
industry and the home growing space and

194
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,639
a lot of people are still fairly uh

195
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:01,279
hesitant to jump in to use them because

196
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,720
you do increase the heat, you increase

197
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:07,119
your overall like nutrient consumption

198
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,759
requirements for the plant. um

199
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,800
especially since it's LED. Uh but yeah,

200
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,879
what are what are some of your

201
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,598
experiences with that off of the first

202
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:19,960
run that you had with them? Honestly, I

203
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:23,038
loved it and um the results spoke by

204
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:24,799
themselves, but yes, once you plug them

205
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,279
in, there's a lot of new factors that

206
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,038
need to tune in. Heat will go up,

207
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,839
meaning that your humidity needs to go

208
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:33,918
up also because you need to keep your

209
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:36,079
VPD more or less. And you don't need to

210
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:38,399
to make the perfect VPD but you need to

211
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,839
keep your numbers close enough otherwise

212
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,639
they will be in balance on the

213
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,880
nutritions and then the plants will not

214
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:46,559
go and they will sweat more everything

215
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,039
will will be more meaning they will be

216
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:52,000
needing higher EC. So if you used to

217
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:54,000
work with lowers EC and you bringing in

218
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,080
canopy lights trust me you will have to

219
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,320
be be make bigger feedings because there

220
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,040
will be more plant mass needing needing

221
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,278
food. Let's let's thinking in basics

222
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,360
before I'm taking all my light from

223
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:07,278
here. Meaning all my grow is here.

224
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,120
Whatever it's down here, it's not

225
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,720
needing it. That's why we lollipop it

226
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,039
because it would not grow. It become

227
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,278
popcorn and stuff. Right now we have

228
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:17,199
light coming from here also. Meaning

229
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:19,679
that they growing here but they are also

230
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,680
growing down here. So that will require

231
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:24,319
energy that will require nutrients that

232
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:26,958
will require everything that the tops.

233
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,800
So you it's not doubling everything but

234
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:32,759
it's checking reading the plants and see

235
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:35,439
how much they are eating. Checking the

236
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:38,399
runoffs. I like to do the runoffs in

237
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,480
auto pot is difficult but I have the WCS

238
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,480
sensor that tells me what's in the soil.

239
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,680
So I know more or less that if I'm

240
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:49,278
feeding 1.5 EC and I'm 1.6 or

241
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:51,278
1.4, I know that she's eating more or

242
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,120
less what I'm feeding her. And from that

243
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:55,600
I can give her help more and not less

244
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,200
and see if she's building up and I'm

245
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,159
giving her more but she's not eating

246
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,560
more the numbers are going more are are

247
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,639
accumulating there. They're not they do

248
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,039
not want this is how I control my

249
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:10,399
runoffs in the auto pots. If I'm not

250
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:12,799
doing out of pots I just I water. If the

251
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,679
EC that goes in is 1.5 and the one

252
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:18,479
coming out is one, she needs more food.

253
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,159
If the EC that goes in is 1.5 and the

254
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,079
one coming out it's 2.0, you know, she

255
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,559
needs less food or just water for the

256
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,879
next one or something. And this is how I

257
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:30,559
balance or I try to balance the best I

258
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:33,120
can the nutrition into my plants. So you

259
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:38,119
always try to keep somewhat of a of a

260
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:41,519
consistent level of uh poor water um EC

261
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,600
um rather than having it you know do any

262
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,560
sort of like generative steering towards

263
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,759
a higher EC at the beginning of flower

264
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:52,719
and then reducing it towards the bulking

265
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:55,519
period or anything like that.

266
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,759
more or less I I I increase my I start

267
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,000
increasing my C in veg until flour and

268
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:02,559
then in flour I again increase it with

269
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,399
the with the peas and the case and all

270
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:07,119
the extra boosters that we are giving

271
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:10,000
them. this if I'm doing in an organic

272
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,560
way organic on mineral if I'm just doing

273
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,958
minerals which I I am doing now with the

274
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:17,679
trail master I'm doing the appto all and

275
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:20,479
clean program which is just minerals no

276
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:23,679
organic stuff in there this brings

277
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,240
higher ECS but plants seems to like it

278
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:29,599
um they started higher before I was

279
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,560
doing 0.8 in veg now I'm doing 1.3 in

280
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,440
veg and I'm doing I start flower with

281
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:38,639
1.5 and I finish around 2.0 You know,

282
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,200
this last year for me was unthinkable.

283
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,639
Unthinkable. I did not understand how

284
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,079
people would go with EC so high. Now I

285
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:48,319
understand it's everything else. It's

286
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:51,120
it's like if you go and train into a gym

287
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,440
full of oxygen and the best conditions

288
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,519
you will need more minerals, more

289
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,360
vitamins, more to keep up your body.

290
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,560
Plants are I believe that they work the

291
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,759
same. And to my opinion, they don't care

292
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:07,039
if it's organic, mineral, synthetic. The

293
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:09,759
plant itself needs NPK, macro,

294
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:13,919
micronutrients and everything else. If

295
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:16,399
you provide them in YX or whatever form

296
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,838
that you prefer to you, they will

297
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,200
receive it and they will thank you for

298
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,440
that. The end product honestly I also

299
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,800
believe that it's raw talk and it's our

300
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,360
way of thinking that makes us believe

301
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:32,078
that organic is better than synthetic or

302
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,519
mineral. But in the end, if I give you a

303
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:38,719
really good flower, synthetic, organic

304
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,399
or mineral, well cured, well proper, and

305
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,720
you will most will not know the

306
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,120
difference. I'm not saying that it's and

307
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,278
this, but

308
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,919
you will not know unless you grow, but

309
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,919
we as growers, we know, and I grow for

310
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,479
myself, so I like the organics and the

311
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:56,799
minerals. I don't go synthetics myself.

312
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,560
Yeah. I um I've always found that like

313
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:03,439
the best flower that I could ever grow

314
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:06,239
at home was um either in a like a really

315
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:11,600
large living soil pot like a 30-gallon

316
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:15,120
pot or better um or using

317
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:20,720
um cocoa quar and uh like a just a

318
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,799
really basic like Jax 321 or uh JR Crop

319
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,399
Tech

320
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:27,039
or any of these sort of like salt salt

321
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,759
based fertilizers that have all the

322
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:32,879
macro and micros in one side and then

323
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:35,039
the nitrogen and calcium in another. Uh,

324
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:37,278
and you just mix those up either in

325
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,519
equal parts or um depending on the

326
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:42,720
formula, whatever ratio it is. And then

327
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:46,078
adding some sort of biology to the

328
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:50,480
substrate like um

329
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:52,958
like an earthworm casting tea or um just

330
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,200
any other uh microbiology that you can

331
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,599
get in there to help kind of initiate

332
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:01,040
those responses in the plant. like

333
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:04,159
there's the the kiten response pathways

334
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:06,639
and then there's the oh what else? Um

335
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,639
there's like the salicylic acid pathways

336
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,799
that can be triggered if the plant comes

337
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,360
in contact with them in the root zone.

338
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,919
And from what I've always experienced is

339
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,919
that it tends to produce a more robust

340
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:22,159
cannibid cannabonoid and tarpine

341
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:23,519
profile. Um, and I always I really liked

342
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,759
it in the hydroponic setting because

343
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,480
then you get the speed of growth. You

344
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:31,278
can get the um potential for a greater

345
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,159
yield if you have the correct irrigation

346
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:36,799
and environmental practices in place.

347
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:38,719
And in my ca in like in a lot of

348
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,319
instances sometimes I think of all that

349
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,480
micro microbial activity in living soils

350
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,760
and if you do have any sort of

351
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,560
sporilation events where you have um you

352
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,639
know mushrooms that are growing or other

353
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:55,198
fungus that's growing and you get all

354
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,278
those spores up into the into the plant

355
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:00,399
matter then a lot of that you know there

356
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:02,639
there are potential for micotoxins and

357
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,399
stuff like that when you're combusting

358
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,000
cannabis but some of them are also

359
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:10,879
destroyed by combustion. So, um I always

360
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,360
just w went with the I I want to keep it

361
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:16,759
a little bit cleaner, but yeah, try to

362
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:21,000
throw a little bit of some sort

363
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:24,879
of microbial uh activity in the soil.

364
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,120
Um, but I and I've, you know, I was

365
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:31,240
always before I had to stop growing at

366
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:34,240
home, I um I wanted

367
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,639
to do those in auto pots because you do

368
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,560
get that benefit of the constant

369
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,480
moisture. And you can also feed through

370
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,879
it as well, like you're saying, at a at

371
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,079
a lower EC.

372
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:48,639
I'm feeling higher higher now. Also, uh

373
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:51,838
I with the whole system, the the pipes

374
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,360
were a little bit too too thin and if

375
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,199
you put too much stuff in there, it

376
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,159
would build up stuff. The organic would

377
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,838
not just not work very nice in there.

378
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:01,759
With the new lines, the blue lines,

379
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,480
black, whatever color you get, they are

380
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,320
they they are pipes. So, whatever you

381
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,000
put in there, organic or not, it will go

382
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,839
through. Of course, after one, you need

383
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,198
to clean it up. But this is normal

384
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,160
procedurement that you have to do with

385
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:15,679
any system, hydroponic or not. If you

386
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,480
don't want to, if you want to avoid

387
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:20,719
problems, you have to keep it all clean

388
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,759
from run to run and keep it cleaning if

389
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,278
needed during the run. And uh this is

390
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,800
one of the things that people don't do

391
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:31,600
that people don't they think that it's

392
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:34,399
not important. Oh, it's just one run or

393
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,800
no. So it's very important every run to

394
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:40,000
set up to zero in my humbled opinion

395
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:41,838
because you don't want to bring any

396
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,759
issue that it was not present in the

397
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,920
previous run but it was starting to be

398
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,680
present but it was a late present so you

399
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:51,039
did not see it and now you start this

400
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:53,198
one but it's there so like mildo mold

401
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:58,399
and stuff it stay there the spores man I

402
00:16:53,198 --> 00:17:00,879
I eonize this is how you say it I tent I

403
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,440
clean it I bleach it I clean it again

404
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:05,199
and in the And I have a yonzer. I can

405
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,000
show you. Actually, it's here. One

406
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:11,038
second. Put this in there. And what this

407
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,838
does is this divides the the oxygen

408
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,759
molecule in two. And this kills

409
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:18,000
everything inside. Bacteria, non

410
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:21,038
bacteria, mold, mildos, whatever spore

411
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,359
you have in there, it will be dead. It's

412
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:25,838
a like an ozone generator. Exactly.

413
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,359
Exactly. It's exactly that. So, you

414
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,200
cannot breathe it. But I close the tent.

415
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,439
I put the lights on so that it's very

416
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,120
hot inside it or the hotter I can. I

417
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,160
leave it there for half an hour and in

418
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:38,239
for a 4x4 it's more than enough. Cool.

419
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,919
There's

420
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,319
Yeah, there's commercial facilities that

421
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,480
use thermal protocols when they're

422
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:46,399
cleaning their rooms and they'll like

423
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,160
maintain a certain temperature for a

424
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,400
certain time frame and it will um help

425
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,519
destroy any sort of biology that's still

426
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,320
in there. Yes, sir.

427
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:01,960
Now we have

428
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:05,038
UV something UVC that they using to kill

429
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,960
the bugs and stuff and the mold and

430
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,119
mill. I'm not sure if it's UVC. I'm

431
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,759
speaking by

432
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:14,558
head but uh facilities are using and now

433
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:17,038
home growers are using it also. Future

434
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:18,879
of grow which is a brand of from Swiss

435
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:22,640
just released it and Grandmaster level

436
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,640
also did it. Um, you and it's it's

437
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,200
something that you just run half an hour

438
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,720
on the grow and it's supposed to kill

439
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,640
nets trips and everything. I don't know.

440
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:37,919
I did not try it, but I'm very curious

441
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:39,919
about the experiment the predator.

442
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,480
Well, yeah. You know, there are so many

443
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,640
new technologies that are kind of

444
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,240
popping up that are either like a

445
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,080
light-based uh pest prevention and then

446
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,000
you also have that ozone generator which

447
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:54,480
is nothing new, but I've definitely

448
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,319
start started to see people use it more

449
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,919
often because it is a very effective

450
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:02,319
tool. It is it is a crazy new tool and

451
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,160
people are using it and I'm curious to

452
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:07,119
to bring it into the grow actually and

453
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,600
to see because trips and nets it's

454
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,119
something that

455
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:12,959
um in the beginning I was paranoia when

456
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:15,359
I was growing in rockwool everything

457
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,519
needs to be sterilized and this and that

458
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:21,038
and over the years when I moved myself

459
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:23,839
to soil and completely to soil and in

460
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:26,079
organics I start to understand that it's

461
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:29,359
normal for us to have bugs they part of

462
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:31,199
the nature So I can't to accept them but

463
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:36,959
we need to control them. And what I do

464
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:39,279
to control it's um neat it's a bunch of

465
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,960
predators and this and that. It's

466
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:44,319
something that you keep and you need to

467
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,798
keep buying and getting. If I can get

468
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:49,200
now a lamp that I place it in the tent

469
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:52,160
and half an hour a day I run it and this

470
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,120
will do the exact same management. Man,

471
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,720
this is that's intriguing. It's

472
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,879
intriguing. I heard about machines with

473
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,679
lasers on big facilities that goes and

474
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,520
they ident with AI they identify the

475
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,840
trip in the past and they just killed

476
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,359
the that one. Yeah, my dad was just

477
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:09,439
talking about that to me. That's really

478
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,359
funny. That's uh yeah, it's something

479
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,360
that I've seen as well. You know, I feel

480
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:16,000
like it's still in the process of being

481
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:17,918
perfected though because if that was so

482
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,160
uh efficient, you know, drones are

483
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,160
pretty cheap nowadays and lasers aren't

484
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,720
necessarily the most advanced technology

485
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,279
and with the AI learning and stuff, it

486
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,000
doesn't seem like it would be

487
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:32,480
uh excessively cost prohibitive where

488
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,480
you know almost any commercial facility

489
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,200
if you can just buy something like that

490
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,319
rather than spray stuff and cuz the

491
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,880
sprays you know those are all

492
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:42,798
consumables so you have to continuously

493
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,400
purchase them. And they're not the

494
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:46,798
cheapest, especially when you get into

495
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,840
some of the uh different chemistries

496
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:52,000
that you might be using. So, uh yeah,

497
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:53,599
something like that. I if it did work, I

498
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,079
I feel like we would see it a lot more.

499
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:58,240
So, I'm still kind of hesitant to, you

500
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:00,158
know, does it work or is it something

501
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,279
that's still in the process of being

502
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,039
under like developed and and perfected?

503
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:08,000
Um

504
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:11,038
on paper sounds amazing. Yeah, on paper

505
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,558
it does sound amazing. Absolutely. Um

506
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,599
well, I'm I'm glad we kind of had this

507
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:16,960
little ramble here to start off the

508
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:18,798
conversation, but I'm going to kind of

509
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,720
uh steer us back into some of the

510
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:23,759
questions that I have for us today.

511
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,919
Let's go, please. Cool. So, um I always

512
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:28,400
like to find out where your journey with

513
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,799
plants started and whether it was with

514
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,880
cannabis or, you know, if you grew up in

515
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:35,279
a household that had a like a vegetable

516
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,799
garden or something along those lines.

517
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:40,319
Um, but what was your for sure what were

518
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,480
what were your first experiences with

519
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:46,079
plants and what led you into where you

520
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,599
are today with cannabis? So in my family

521
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:49,519
the they're the they're the farmers

522
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,678
also. I have farmers in a family but I

523
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:53,759
was I I was a city boy. I was raised in

524
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:57,440
the city going to the farm raised into

525
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:59,679
the city. Um so but I always had

526
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,840
contact. I'm not I was that kid that

527
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,679
when people ask what a tomato is or an

528
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:05,599
apple or a carrot or where does the meat

529
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,120
came from I knew for me it was normal I

530
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,639
grew I knew that the meat is from the

531
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:11,279
cow and that they killed a pig and that

532
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,679
the chicken. So this was always

533
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:17,720
something that was very into my blood

534
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:21,880
and still is I believe and still is and

535
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:26,159
um but cannabis came to me with came to

536
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:30,320
me I started smoking very early about uh

537
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:32,640
13 something like this and at 15 more or

538
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:34,319
less one seed came in the traditional I

539
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,799
know this is the cliche story but it is

540
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:39,279
what it is it cames with seeds we put

541
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:42,720
the seed in soil and bam it grows

542
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:44,879
something and oh okay it's this easy

543
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,200
let's try this and we started from there

544
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,280
and then there going up and overs and we

545
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,080
start looking for seeds and things and

546
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:56,319
time passes and

547
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:59,359
um about uh let's say so it's still in

548
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:02,000
the past about a few decades ago I

549
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:04,479
started growing for myself seriously

550
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,279
like okay I'm sick of everybody's else's

551
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,279
weeds each time I grow a plant mini

552
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:10,960
plant big plant it's always better than

553
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,720
anything that I buy commercial. At least

554
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,880
to me, it sounds better. I don't know if

555
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,558
it is or not, but I don't care. So, when

556
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,799
I started, one thing led to the other

557
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:20,798
and

558
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:22,960
um it's been a few decades now that I

559
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:25,599
I'm kind of engaged with this. When I'm

560
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,919
when I travel, I have to have somebody

561
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,839
taking care of them. That somebody needs

562
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,400
to be somebody from my family because I

563
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:34,879
don't talk with nobody else where I am

564
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,519
about this. Nobody really knows. I've

565
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,600
been doing this for decades and um a

566
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:42,558
handful of people knows because of the

567
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:44,480
situations that we live in here. Once

568
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:46,720
it's became like tomatoes or like

569
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,798
anything else, I don't care. But I have

570
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,960
to care for now. Not that I think that

571
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:53,679
I'm doing anything wrong, but they think

572
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,159
it is wrong. So, we living by their

573
00:23:53,679 --> 00:24:01,280
rules. And one thing led to the other.

574
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:03,280
And um then in about the 2000s, I start

575
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,359
becoming really serious. I start

576
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,599
investing in whatever and researching

577
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:09,359
and not just growing trying to

578
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:11,439
understand what I grow, what are the

579
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:14,759
genetics, why this genetic does this,

580
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,038
why that does that, what is a

581
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:19,519
phenotype and one thing led to the

582
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:23,038
other. This always was a solo journey

583
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:24,960
for myself. Then co and everybody stays

584
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,519
home. Nobody can goes anywhere

585
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,880
supposedly. Everything is going bananas

586
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:33,720
and I'm home. And what I do home, I grow

587
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,000
grow plants. you know, so I

588
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,200
get even more deeper into it. I start

589
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,038
researching like like it's like like

590
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,679
studying more or less and I start going

591
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:47,759
online. Something that for me was no I

592
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,000
never did forums. I never did anything

593
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:52,240
because man, why would I do that?

594
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,159
There's no point. And I started going

595
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,839
online. I found a few channels on

596
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,240
YouTube. In this case, I found the Let's

597
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:01,599
Be Buds and I

598
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:03,599
found uh GMLs. I started um getting

599
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:07,278
leads at that time was the first time I

600
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:09,240
get leads before it was all HPS and one

601
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:11,919
of the days I decided

602
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,400
to GML was saying oh if you guys want to

603
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:17,200
come in and ask questions and man why

604
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,320
not so I say my first time growing leads

605
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,640
that's where I met Spartan and my lead

606
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:25,038
online then from there I start following

607
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,400
him and I follow my fellow home grows

608
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:32,558
and everything else

609
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:35,120
and this was how I became to to go

610
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:37,119
online and uh since this this was

611
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,879
happening I decided okay so let's make

612
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:41,519
an Instagram account even if I don't

613
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,440
share any photos I can follow other

614
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,679
people specific because I cannot do this

615
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,000
with my private account because of of

616
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:51,759
the paranoas so I created an account on

617
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,278
Instagram and one thing led to the other

618
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:58,319
time start passing and um about a year

619
00:25:55,278 --> 00:26:00,720
after I had my Instagram account up to

620
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:04,158
all came to me and ask me why I did not

621
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,079
do any posts. Um because I was tagging

622
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,400
them in history stories and stuff like

623
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:10,879
that because that was the the nutrient

624
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,038
line that I was using. And he told me,

625
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,640
"Oh, if you start posting some photos or

626
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,158
some content the same way you're doing

627
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,640
on your stories, you don't need to do

628
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,799
anything else. We can sponsor you." And

629
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,880
that's when I realized, okay, this there

630
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:26,000
there might be something else more here

631
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,000
than just me growing. And the there this

632
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,798
passion can actually turn into something

633
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,880
bigger. I don't know. And I started to

634
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:37,599
post online. This was about uh 3 years

635
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,240
ago, I think. And then one thing led to

636
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:41,798
the other. And um honestly, everything

637
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,400
is happening so

638
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:46,639
fast. And I'm feeling very humbled and

639
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,000
blessed with not blessed because I don't

640
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,840
like the word blessed because it's be

641
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,759
less and I like to be more. And I like I

642
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:55,678
want everybody to be more not less. But

643
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:57,599
I feel very very grateful with how

644
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,600
things are coming because there's

645
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:02,319
podcasts happening. There's the

646
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,918
Instagram account is going up and and I

647
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:05,759
love to talk about these plants. I love

648
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,000
when people come to me and tell me

649
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,519
something that I did wrong because I

650
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,919
didn't know I did it wrong and I learned

651
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:14,798
from that. And I love to help people

652
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,880
when I see I know many take this as a

653
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:19,839
personal thing and oh I'm not

654
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,400
criticizing you. I'm I'm giving you the

655
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:24,399
way I do things and and and the

656
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,640
community is growing and now with the

657
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,880
YouTube is also growing a new community

658
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,038
that I was not expecting. Videos are

659
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,880
coming out and I'm loving this. This is

660
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:36,240
bringing me even more closer to the

661
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,240
plants that I was before because now

662
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,319
it's not just being there looking at the

663
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,079
plant, taking care of the plant. Now,

664
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:44,240
when I'm filming, when I'm looking for

665
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:46,960
details, I'm I'm seeing things that I

666
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,120
never saw before and I'm noticing things

667
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,159
in the in the way that plants grows, in

668
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:54,639
the way that everything evolves.

669
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,960
Especially when you make a time lapse,

670
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,360
you see how they move, how they grow,

671
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,159
how they spin, everything a plant does.

672
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:04,798
It just It's not just this. No, she's

673
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,440
moving all day around and changing forms

674
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:10,639
and goes and came. It's alive. It's

675
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,278
beautiful. And uh I'm loving this uh

676
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,159
this creating content and uh creating

677
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:17,679
things. That's awesome. I mean, it's

678
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,559
obvious you have a lot of passion for

679
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,399
the plant. And uh you know, it's there's

680
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:24,480
like an art form, I feel like, to a lot

681
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:26,719
of the content that you do show where

682
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,319
it's it's not just a picture of a plant

683
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,880
or some impressive yield or a a bag full

684
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:35,439
of of of awesome looking flowers or

685
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,640
something. It's it's more of the the

686
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,320
grow itself and how you're growing. Um,

687
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,159
what what are some of the the things

688
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,798
that you like to do in your garden that

689
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,039
you might think are unique to your

690
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:50,639
situation that other people might not

691
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:52,960
know about how you grow? Uh, currently

692
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,679
uh depending if I'm growing out of

693
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,038
flowers or if I'm growing uh normal

694
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,960
plant, not normal, they all normal,

695
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:01,599
sorry. If I'm going feminiz or regular

696
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,079
seeds, I grow different. For arrow

697
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:05,678
flowers, for instance, I don't top. Most

698
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,759
people like topping or not topping. I

699
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,519
don't top. Not because I don't top. It's

700
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,440
just because I don't like to touch them.

701
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:13,918
I see the out of flowers as something

702
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,080
that you grow and it's not there to give

703
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,320
you more work. It's just there to assist

704
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,798
you. So, what I do with out of flowers,

705
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:23,038
I lift bend. I only lift bend them. And

706
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:25,440
since I start only lift bend them, they

707
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:27,398
start to grow way more and bigger. And I

708
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,080
and I'm getting big big big auto

709
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:32,558
flowers. I really like this leaf bending

710
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:36,398
on the outflower. What What do you mean

711
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:36,398
by leaf bending? Okay,

712
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:46,798
so plants they grow and then the leaf a

713
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,200
new leaf came here that is covering the

714
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:51,359
end. Can you see this? No. Yes. That is

715
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,840
covering the the end. So, what I do, I

716
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:56,719
grab the leaf and I put it under the the

717
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:58,639
one that is done. Got it. Like, uh, leaf

718
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,240
tucking is another one that I've heard

719
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,960
people use for that where they'll

720
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,798
they'll tuck the leaves under the nodes.

721
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,159
I get it. Exactly. And this will bring

722
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:07,759
the nodes off. The leaves are still

723
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,799
there. You're not defoliating. They will

724
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:12,398
grow under it. And this helps out. From

725
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:16,079
my experience, that helps out flowers

726
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:18,158
grow more even canopy without being that

727
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,558
tree that everybody likes. And it's it's

728
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,278
a Christmas tree. It's nice. But then

729
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:25,278
you have this top up here getting 1,000

730
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:28,480
PPFD and have this one down here getting

731
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:31,359
300. This helps plants to grow more or

732
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,319
less all the same size and all the

733
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:38,240
canopy from one plant is will be

734
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:40,000
spearing the same PPFD sort of. Cool. Do

735
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,319
you do any like bending of the tip of

736
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,919
the plant where you like uh will bend

737
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:45,278
the top down? I know you say you don't

738
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,720
top it, but sometimes I've seen people

739
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:49,839
they'll just kind of like bend it over

740
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,679
lightly. Super cropping. I I do not on

741
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:53,199
autoflowers. On out of flowers, I think

742
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,080
that I believe that high stress

743
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,360
trainings in autoflowers is it's going

744
00:30:56,079 --> 00:31:02,798
to result in uh less weight, not

745
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:05,839
quality, but uh in not so many products.

746
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:07,359
Why? Sure. Because an autoflower, she's

747
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:09,599
doing what the [ __ ] she want. She's on

748
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:12,558
her on her roads. Whatever you you do to

749
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:14,719
her, she's on her own. Y if you stress

750
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:17,278
her, she will take time as other plants

751
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,000
have to to bounce back. But that time

752
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:22,558
that she's bouncing back, it's not it's

753
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,798
not on hold. Keeps going. Meanings her

754
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:27,599
veg time keeps going or her flower time

755
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:28,839
keeps going. In the end, that stress

756
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:31,759
it's it's something

757
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:33,839
that it did not make you more time. If

758
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:35,839
you're running feminiz or regular seats,

759
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:37,839
you can't stress her plants. You wait

760
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:40,079
for her to bounce back. You can't stress

761
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:42,480
her again. You wait. And when she's

762
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,558
okay, you flip it to flower. Out of

763
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,798
flowers, they will run whatever they

764
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:50,480
want. when they want to flip to flower

765
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:53,119
they will. So in my humbled opinion out

766
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,720
of flowers we are there to assist them

767
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:58,398
on their needs. So by looking at them by

768
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,960
leaf bending whatever techniques you

769
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:04,000
like to use it you're just there to

770
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,159
exist not to stress her for sure. Do you

771
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,839
do any up potting when you grow

772
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:12,399
autoflowers? I know some people will

773
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:14,398
um heavily push back against doing uh up

774
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:16,239
pots, but I always found that it worked

775
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:18,000
really well for auto flowers as long as

776
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,038
you didn't damage the roots when you

777
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,319
were trans. I do three three of them.

778
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:26,960
Yeah. Three ups and I like to put

779
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:29,678
microisal in the roots. If I don't do

780
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,360
transplants, I cannot do that. I either

781
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,919
use the promix soil which has the

782
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:34,918
microisal already in it. But I still

783
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:39,038
like

784
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:41,759
to gently see the roots and give a

785
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:43,759
sprinkle of extra of microisal in there

786
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:46,079
and then put it in the soil. And I

787
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:47,919
really see the roots bouncing big. And

788
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:50,079
they say bigger roots, bigger fruits,

789
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,600
which is not always the case. If you're

790
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:54,319
growing hydroponics, you can have bigger

791
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:58,240
fruits in small cups.

792
00:32:54,319 --> 00:33:00,278
So, but uh I grow soil, so bigger roots

793
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,960
in soil mix bigger fruits. and the

794
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:05,440
microisal it's a really amazing fungi

795
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,558
man it the network it creates there the

796
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,360
uptaking of the nutrients it also helps

797
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:14,639
breaking things in the soil plants get

798
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:16,639
more more susceptible the get they get

799
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,159
stronger also and then if you complement

800
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,840
this with for instance

801
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:24,480
monocyica we'll get a structure on the

802
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:26,558
on on their cells thicker will get them

803
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,038
stronger will create little layers that

804
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:31,200
yeah everything but and it's like some

805
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:33,519
people Oh, you don't need this or no.

806
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,960
Everything is just a tiny little thing,

807
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:40,159
but in the end it's 2% from this

808
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:42,000
monosyica, 2% from the microisal, 2%. In

809
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,720
the end, it's this much percentage. And

810
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,359
that's on the overall results to my

811
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,679
experience makes a lot of difference for

812
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:53,278
sure. Definitely in a uh in a living

813
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:55,679
soil situation, I I can agree with that.

814
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:58,720
Um, what microisal fungi do you like to

815
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:02,399
use? I I only use apples for everything.

816
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:05,440
I I I've converted myself to to actors 5

817
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:08,078
years ago. Then 3 years ago I get

818
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,639
sponsored. So now and I honestly don't

819
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,200
see myself uh going back to anything

820
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,838
else because I see this as a marriage.

821
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,838
When you find a good woman, I know

822
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:19,838
there's more goods in the in the world,

823
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:22,159
but why would I be looking at them? Why

824
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:23,838
would I be curious about them if I have

825
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,639
my my wife? You know what I mean? It's

826
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:29,440
it's my wife. So I see the nutrients and

827
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:32,960
my relation with app was like that also

828
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,960
and honestly and this this is really

829
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,639
this is really my my opinion. I was a

830
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,079
believer before being sponsored and I

831
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,559
keep being a believer. It works amazing.

832
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:45,760
It's not it's a concentrated product

833
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:47,440
meaning I'm not buying water. Most of

834
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,200
the bottles that you get in the market

835
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,599
on the labels I'm not saying they are

836
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:54,239
better or worse but the percentage of

837
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,039
water comparing to the nutrients is much

838
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:59,598
bigger. meaning you have to buy many

839
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:02,000
more times after this super concentrated

840
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,760
man you use tiny little bits it's it's

841
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,679
more expensive I was paying more for the

842
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,400
nutrients yes but they were going triple

843
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:11,118
the time that other levels were doing so

844
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,160
in the end it was not more expensive for

845
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:17,920
sure and and they have one thing that

846
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:20,719
for me it's crucial in any grow which is

847
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,599
the regulator which is for you you guys

848
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,919
have there as a facilitator on the apps

849
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,359
and you have something similar which is

850
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,800
power side. Basically it's

851
00:35:28,358 --> 00:35:32,480
monosyilica which is active and ready

852
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,519
for the plant. It's not silica but

853
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,280
because silica goes in the soil needs to

854
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:39,039
break down takes time to get available

855
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,200
to the plants. It's it's it's different.

856
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:44,639
It's good but it takes time. The

857
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:46,559
monosyilica formula it's straight away

858
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,239
available for the plant. Meaning that

859
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:49,599
she will drink it straight away and

860
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:51,919
straight away she will feel it. It's

861
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,000
like taking I don't know the steroids.

862
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,119
You'll feel straight away. You look I'm

863
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,800
not saying that it is steroids and uh

864
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,760
it's the first thing that goes in my

865
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,880
reservoir always. Always. And it it

866
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,520
should be the first thing in any

867
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,320
reservoir because uh nutrients they need

868
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:10,599
to go in an order, right? Oh, you're too

869
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,599
paranoid. No, I'm not. Try and put the

870
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:16,240
silica after you put the calm and tell

871
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,559
me what you see in the water and then

872
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:20,078
you're going to get precipitation. Yeah.

873
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,159
The other way around and you get a clean

874
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,920
water. So this means that there's a

875
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:27,358
chemic reaction. Everything needs to go

876
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:30,960
in the order. First goes Monostica, then

877
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:32,920
goes whatever the rest of your line is.

878
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,960
Yeah, definitely. I mean, I've

879
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:39,039
um I've experienced like uh mixing

880
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,280
something in the wrong order before and

881
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:43,679
just learned from that experience. And I

882
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,079
think one of them was I was making uh I

883
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:49,358
was using potassium silicut to make a

884
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:53,760
solution for a a pH down or an alkalizer

885
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:58,880
for my um my nutrient water. And I added

886
00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:02,320
a bunch of um sulfuric acid to the um

887
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,400
potassium silicut because we had uh I

888
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,079
think we just had some like acid spill

889
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,400
or something and we needed to clean it

890
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,839
up. And so we used the alkalizer to

891
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:15,358
counteract it and it turned into a gel

892
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:18,400
because the silica turned into silicon

893
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:20,319
and it um and it turned into that actual

894
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,639
like it had that chemical reaction and I

895
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,800
was like wow that's that's a huge

896
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:26,719
precipitation event and that would cause

897
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,720
such major clogging if anything like

898
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:31,199
that were to happen through some sort of

899
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:32,959
irrigation line or something. Obviously,

900
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:36,598
you you wouldn't be mixing bases and

901
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:40,720
acids in an irrigation line, but um but

902
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:43,519
but how important it is and how chemical

903
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:45,439
everything it is. It's it's it's like

904
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:46,960
this by itself, it's nothing. This by

905
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,280
itself, it's nothing. This by itself,

906
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:53,119
it's a bomb. Yep. And also the

907
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,720
concentration of of those different um

908
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,800
constituents when you're mixing them in

909
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,719
solution is also important. Uh like

910
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:02,480
another example that I've I've had is I

911
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:05,199
was we I would use uh magnesium sulfate

912
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,159
and calcium chloride when I would flush

913
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:10,480
the plants at the end of a cycle um for

914
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:13,199
just a couple days. But I wanted to

915
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,519
maintain the high uh calcium levels as

916
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:17,598
well as magnesium because it's in a

917
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:19,519
cocoa substrate. And there's just other

918
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:22,000
there's other reasons why there.

919
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:23,838
um to make to make a long story short,

920
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,519
you know, I would mix them in

921
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:27,039
individually and I was like, well, why

922
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:29,358
can't I mix these together? And I found

923
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:31,759
out, well, because it makes calcium

924
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:34,159
sulfate when you mix magnesium sulfate

925
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,200
with calcium chloride and calcium

926
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:39,440
sulfate is uh it it just precipitates

927
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:43,439
out of solution instantly almost and you

928
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,920
get this huge layer of uh like calcium

929
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,440
sulfate dust at the bottom. uh gypsum

930
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:52,159
basically at the bottom of the um of the

931
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,519
mix that you made. So yeah, different

932
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:55,440
things like that are really interesting

933
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:57,519
to to look at. And when you see

934
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,079
something so drastic like one of the two

935
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:02,239
examples I gave, you do realize that it

936
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,519
is important even in smaller amounts to

937
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:06,000
make sure that everything's mixed

938
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:08,719
properly. Um especially when you do

939
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,679
start to play with higher ECs. I don't

940
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:14,639
know about like 2.0 0 to 2.5. But if you

941
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:16,719
start to get up to like 3 to 4, then you

942
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,799
can definitely start to see different uh

943
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:22,159
chemical reactions take place if things

944
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:26,359
are mixed in um in the wrong order.

945
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:29,118
Yeah, it's pretty easy. I for me that's

946
00:39:26,358 --> 00:39:31,759
still I don't know. I might I might get

947
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,760
there with under canopy lights with a

948
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:38,440
with turning in and good with with

949
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:41,680
perfect conditions, but for now 2.4 4

950
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:44,079
2.5 was the the highest I went last run

951
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:49,440
and this was the highest I went ever on

952
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:52,560
on soil. Do you use uh supplemental CO2?

953
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:55,200
No, but I have um the heater on the

954
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:57,679
house is gas. So we are in winter time.

955
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,118
So for the most time that that turning

956
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:01,838
just having the heater on it's it's it's

957
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,519
it's enough to bring the numbers higher.

958
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:06,719
And then it's me, my family and the

959
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:08,559
dogs. And I I I I build this in a way

960
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:10,959
that the whole circulation from the

961
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:13,199
house came straight into the grow room.

962
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,960
Meaning that all that we breach doesn't

963
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:18,078
go out the other ways. The other ways

964
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:22,400
are to bring air in. So I always get the

965
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:25,920
minimum 600 700 ppms in there and if the

966
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,920
heater is on it goes up to 15 to2 and

967
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,680
they're happy with that. So oh that's

968
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,760
too high. No it's not too high. They can

969
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:34,960
take it up to three and four and five

970
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,119
and uh ppm. It's not perfect for them,

971
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:41,679
but they can handle it. It's like the

972
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:43,760
Oh, you giving them 1,200 ppfd. Dude, go

973
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:45,838
and take your measurement outside middle

974
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:49,200
of the day in the sun and tell me what

975
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:50,880
you reach. You go up to five, six,

976
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:53,598
seven, depending on where you are in the

977
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,680
world. Cool. Well, and also if you are

978
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,280
uh having higher than ambient levels of

979
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:59,199
CO2, then the plants can definitely

980
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,519
photosynthesize at a higher rate where

981
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:03,239
that's they're not going to really uh be

982
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:06,318
bothered by a higher

983
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:07,838
um a higher light level. And then also,

984
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:10,960
you know, that's that's also where a

985
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:13,199
higher EC of feed can come into play and

986
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,199
be handy because you will have just a

987
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:17,439
higher overall assimilation rate of

988
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:19,439
nutrients into the tissue of the plant.

989
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,920
So, you're going to need a lot more of a

990
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,880
dense nutrient package in the root zone.

991
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,480
Um, and uh, you know, don't if you do

992
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,559
have those parameters, don't be worried

993
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,440
about getting up in your EC, man. I

994
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:33,920
mean, I've I've been running lately, but

995
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,838
it is with supplemental CO2 at 1500

996
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,159
parts per million throughout all the

997
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:42,000
light cycles and a high PPFD. We've been

998
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:43,440
feeding at um, 4.5 EC and it works

999
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,079
really well, but you have to have a

1000
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,240
really clean nutrient to be able to run

1001
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,680
it like that. And I don't think you

1002
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,078
would be able to get away with that in

1003
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:54,559
an auto pot system because you do need

1004
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:57,599
some level of drain to waste where your

1005
00:41:54,559 --> 00:42:00,480
your runoff is. Yeah, your runoff is

1006
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:03,119
pushing off that extra salt buildup. Um

1007
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,880
yeah, but with the high level of

1008
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,519
nutrients that are available in the

1009
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,640
correct ratios at that EC, you can see

1010
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:13,318
tremendous bud growth and overall plant

1011
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:17,598
health with a really

1012
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:19,279
um a really well dialed in environment.

1013
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,200
Obviously, you can do it because

1014
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,880
facilities are doing it and you look at

1015
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:24,879
whatever they're doing and it looks

1016
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,640
beautiful. So they're not doing soil,

1017
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,400
they're doing rock, wool or cocoa,

1018
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:30,799
whatever. So it makes sense this what

1019
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,160
you're saying of the buildups because on

1020
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,440
the other pot you don't have the dry

1021
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:37,838
outs. It's myself that I close the pipes

1022
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,800
and I let it go for dry outs and if I

1023
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:42,799
want to do top fitting on something but

1024
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:45,800
uh the aqua valve the way that that

1025
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:49,440
thing works is he has it's kind of

1026
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:52,079
like he has one one one rubber here and

1027
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:55,280
one rubber down here. When this rubber

1028
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,440
hits down here, it's a this one

1029
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,680
releases. And when this comes and hits

1030
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,000
here, this one releases. Meaning the

1031
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:04,000
plants get the water, the valves go like

1032
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,079
this. Then she drinks the water. This

1033
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,159
comes down here. And once it's on it, it

1034
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:11,680
opens. It releases again. It will full

1035
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:14,159
again. But the soil is always wet.

1036
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:15,759
There's there's always

1037
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:18,239
I don't know the exact percentage, but

1038
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,400
there's always at least 10 15% moist in

1039
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:22,639
there. So for living soil, it's great.

1040
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,480
for soil. It's great. I don't know how

1041
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:27,679
this worked with cocoa because I did not

1042
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,400
do cocoa in here, but um yeah, you also

1043
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:32,399
said you're using substrate monitoring,

1044
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,559
correct? So, you're seeing the water

1045
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,599
content and the electrical conductivity

1046
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:40,159
within the substrate. And you know, when

1047
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,559
you have that data available, it really

1048
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:45,679
opens up your eyes to what's going on in

1049
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:47,599
the root zone and you can see more

1050
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:49,279
clearly as to how the plant is

1051
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:51,039
interacting with the nutrients that

1052
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,359
you're providing it as well as the water

1053
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:56,239
that you're providing it. And a lot of

1054
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:57,759
people do get scared running higher ECs

1055
00:43:56,239 --> 00:44:00,159
because they think it's building up in

1056
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,920
the soil. But if you can't see what's in

1057
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:04,879
there, then it the only way you're going

1058
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,000
to tell tell if you are building up, you

1059
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,039
know, things that you don't want in

1060
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,440
there is if you're doing like a

1061
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:11,838
saturated paste test or if you're

1062
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:15,599
sending off your substrate for analysis

1063
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:17,679
or if you're running uh uh runoff checks

1064
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:21,400
where you're gathering runoff data

1065
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:24,239
through EC and uh pH.

1066
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,838
Um, and and unless you have all that

1067
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:27,759
information, then it's really hard to

1068
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:29,920
tell what's actually going on in there,

1069
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,000
you know, unless you do have this uh

1070
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,800
substrate monitoring tool where you can

1071
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,199
follow a graph basically and it shows

1072
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,680
you the highs and the lows and the

1073
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:42,000
trends over time and you can see if it's

1074
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:45,519
been slowly raising up or slowly going

1075
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:49,199
down or staying steady. And you can make

1076
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:51,920
a lot of educated changes to what your

1077
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:53,919
inputs are based on that information.

1078
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,318
And it's unfortunate because so many of

1079
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,000
those substrate monitoring tools are

1080
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:02,639
extremely expensive. You know, it's like

1081
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,719
uh yeah, to anybody who's just

1082
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:07,838
listening, he's showing us his substrate

1083
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:09,439
monitoring just uh right here. So that's

1084
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:11,519
Yeah, it's it's right there. It's

1085
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,039
information that you can look at, but it

1086
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:15,280
is expensive. I don't know if you're

1087
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:18,400
using like a Trollmaster substrate

1088
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:21,200
monitor, like one of their WCS um the

1089
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:24,400
WCS2. Yes, monitor exactly what I'm

1090
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:27,598
using. Those are like really great

1091
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,039
pieces of equipment, but in a lot of

1092
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,240
cases, you know, they're really

1093
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:34,800
expensive to get even just one of them

1094
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:37,679
to move. You need to have 10X or an

1095
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,839
Hydro X or something. So, it's not just

1096
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:42,559
the piece of equipment like the the

1097
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:45,199
single item. I think Blue Labs has one

1098
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:47,358
that is just the item coming out now.

1099
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:50,000
There's Blue Love the the good ones is

1100
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:52,559
the Blue Labs and the Troll Master. But

1101
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,199
now Mars Hydro, it's done one. Spider

1102
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:58,000
Farm, it's done one. AC Infinity also

1103
00:45:55,199 --> 00:46:01,039
did one. And if you go Amazon and you

1104
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,159
look online, there's a lot a lot of lot

1105
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:06,480
of them from China. Of course, I don't

1106
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:08,480
know how good or bad they work, but uh

1107
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,199
there's a lot of options. meaning that

1108
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,519
sooner or later both draw master and all

1109
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,118
the the expensive labels they are not

1110
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:16,719
expensive they are just better

1111
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,480
construction so it's normal that it's

1112
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:22,000
more expensive you don't pay the same

1113
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:25,358
for a Maserati that you pay for a

1114
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:29,119
a Renault or for a Ford so things get

1115
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:31,440
different prices so yeah and I I used

1116
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,358
for our monitoring at the commercial

1117
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:37,760
facility and they did come out with like

1118
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:39,759
the Aoya go platform but even still

1119
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:45,359
the, you know, the startup price was

1120
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:47,520
like $1,500 or $2,000 US, and you, it

1121
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:50,480
came with like a a two-year subscription

1122
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:52,079
to being able to stay store your data,

1123
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,719
but after that, you would have to pay a

1124
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,960
monthly fee in order to maintain access

1125
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,078
to all the data that they're providing.

1126
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,838
and the, you know, the whole

1127
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,000
subscription service and not being able

1128
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:04,078
to just have that data based on you

1129
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,079
purchasing the equipment right there and

1130
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,920
and then just like using it locally, not

1131
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,318
even necessarily

1132
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,000
um like trying to use any of the other

1133
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:13,519
services that they provide, you still

1134
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,079
would have to pay for it. And that can

1135
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:18,880
just become even more cost prohibitive

1136
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,720
in a lot of ways for people because like

1137
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,318
even with some of the other shows that

1138
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:24,399
you've interacted with in the past like

1139
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:26,639
the cheap homegrow you know growing with

1140
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:29,119
my fellow growers show the whole point

1141
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:31,920
of that show is to help people grow

1142
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,200
cheaply because cannabis is really

1143
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,079
expensive when you're going and buying

1144
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:38,000
it at a dispensary. um in in the United

1145
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,839
States and you know anywhere else that

1146
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,400
does have access to either a

1147
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:44,639
recreational or medical market it's

1148
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:48,000
expensive and you can grow it for so

1149
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:50,759
much cheaper at home but you know a lot

1150
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,679
of people do struggle early

1151
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:55,520
on in the beginning when you don't know

1152
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:59,519
and you think you need more than you

1153
00:47:55,519 --> 00:48:01,519
think that you need it's very easy to to

1154
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:03,199
for a grow to become super expensive

1155
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:05,838
with the things that you buy and that

1156
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:07,679
you get Then with overtime experience,

1157
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:09,679
you're starting to realize that what you

1158
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:11,919
need and what you don't need and it

1159
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:14,639
becomes more cost effective and stuff

1160
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,480
like that. But it's still not a cheap

1161
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:19,358
hobby. It's not a cheap hobby,

1162
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,119
especially if you passionate about it.

1163
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:23,119
There's always something new coming out

1164
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:26,640
and you want to try this and see that

1165
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:28,720
and that. I don't know. Some people like

1166
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:30,799
cars, they buy cars. other people when

1167
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:32,879
when you like this you will go for the

1168
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:36,000
gadgets here for the controllers for the

1169
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:38,720
the little things that do you need them

1170
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
no you don't need them to grow but they

1171
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:43,279
will help your journey they will uh

1172
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,440
which we're trying to be better than

1173
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,920
nature which we will never be but that's

1174
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,760
that's our our goal it's to be better

1175
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,358
than nature to be better than nature

1176
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,520
which is impossible nobody can be better

1177
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:56,639
than god this is just my opinion of

1178
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:58,159
course but we go we best we try the lead

1179
00:48:56,639 --> 00:49:00,480
we try the extraction

1180
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:02,719
What are we trying to do? Mimic gods.

1181
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,719
We're trying to do what he does on the

1182
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:06,879
perfect way inside here with controls

1183
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:11,598
and with everything. And that takes

1184
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:14,559
money and um it's fun job. It's a fun

1185
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,720
not a job. It's a fun hobby, but it's an

1186
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:19,599
an expensive one. Honestly, when you an

1187
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:21,719
adult, any hobby that you have, it's

1188
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:24,400
expensive.

1189
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:25,838
Hobby. This is whatever you like. It's

1190
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,838
it's it's not it's going to be

1191
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:30,960
expensive. Yeah. Especially if you have

1192
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:33,119
some sort of passion or u real desire to

1193
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:36,000
want to like learn as much as you can

1194
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:39,838
within that hobby. It's going to it'll

1195
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,559
drain your wallet in most cases. Um

1196
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:46,159
so you you've you've been growing for

1197
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:50,319
you said over 20 years now.

1198
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:53,440
More. More. Cool. Yeah. More. Yeah. More

1199
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:55,440
than three decades now or and Yeah. And

1200
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,960
with the ideas in mind of what we were

1201
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,200
just talking about with new growers and

1202
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,838
how it's sometimes difficult for a new

1203
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:04,399
grower when they're starting off, um,

1204
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:06,480
how long did it take you to achieve your

1205
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,599
first harvest that you were extremely

1206
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,679
proud about?

1207
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,920
That that's a hard question and a very

1208
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:16,799
good one. Nobody ever did that. That one

1209
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,800
got me thinking. I don't

1210
00:50:17,318 --> 00:50:25,519
know honestly when I look back

1211
00:50:22,358 --> 00:50:29,920
now I'm really only happy happy happy

1212
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:32,280
with what I'm growing now for the past

1213
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:35,039
decade maybe it's maybe maybe not even

1214
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:37,359
that because before that was a passion

1215
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:39,318
but I love it was amazing it was better

1216
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:42,480
than anything else I could get it

1217
00:50:39,318 --> 00:50:44,719
anywhere but now I see what I grow now

1218
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,679
man I see what I grew last here and I

1219
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:49,598
see how I grow now and I see difference,

1220
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:51,919
right? I don't know if it's me growing

1221
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:54,800
better, if it's the me tuning in things

1222
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,800
better, if it's the everything else in

1223
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,720
conjunction that makes it but it looks

1224
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,680
better, it tastes better. So, I'm really

1225
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:03,519
proud of what I smoke now. But I was

1226
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:05,799
super proud of what I was smoking 10

1227
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:10,159
years ago.

1228
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:12,480
So I I think that we grow and we evolve

1229
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:13,920
in the same way when we somebody would

1230
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,079
come to you with weed and you were just

1231
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,000
a teenager and you will grab it ro and

1232
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:20,640
smoke and now when a friend comes to you

1233
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,760
with weed

1234
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:25,519
analyzing it and put it almost under the

1235
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,760
microscope and there's a law that you

1236
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:30,480
have to talk about that with I thought

1237
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:33,520
it was just weed. So we we ourselves

1238
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,760
also evolve into someone different that

1239
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:38,639
is more

1240
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:40,800
um picky more uh existent I don't know

1241
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:43,759
how to express it with with everything

1242
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,760
which lead us to grow better to to

1243
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:48,079
search for turppins something that 10

1244
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,559
years ago turppins turppins yes tpins

1245
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:52,240
yes what the hell is turppins I knew

1246
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:55,839
what was turppins but I would not

1247
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:58,078
growing for turppins for the past decade

1248
00:51:55,838 --> 00:51:59,519
I don't care about potency my friend I

1249
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,400
care. Of course, I don't want to be

1250
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:03,599
smoking and not feeling

1251
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:06,000
anything, but I care about the

1252
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:08,559
experience for for all of the experience

1253
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,039
from the moment that I open my jar.

1254
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:14,640
Sure. From the moment I open the groove

1255
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:16,719
bag and I take that first aroma that

1256
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:18,639
comes in my nose and then when I grab

1257
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:20,558
it, when I look at it, when I break it

1258
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:23,519
down, when I roll it and I smoke it and

1259
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:25,839
I like to do all of it, I don't like to

1260
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:29,358
do the cones. I like to feel it. And

1261
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:32,078
when when you do your first dry puff and

1262
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:34,880
it tastes the same as the smell. Yeah.

1263
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:37,200
For me that's already okay. Okay. We are

1264
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,599
running to something. We are running to

1265
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:42,558
and then you smoke and then you get that

1266
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,680
third profile coming into you and then

1267
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,760
something else different comes

1268
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:49,759
completely different outside and my mind

1269
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:51,920
keeps blowing and time. Sorry. No, it's

1270
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,520
it's all good. I I love the passion

1271
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,480
behind what you're saying there because

1272
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:59,599
it makes me think of someone who is an

1273
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:03,440
educated consumer versus an uneducated

1274
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:06,640
consumer, right? So, um with with like

1275
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:09,599
the US market, we have this issue where

1276
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:11,598
everything is based on THC. And I know

1277
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:14,240
that that's uh something that's

1278
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:16,000
widespread just across the the world of

1279
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:18,479
consumers with cannabis now that there

1280
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,559
is the ability to test for THC and that

1281
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,800
it's the largest constituent of the

1282
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,480
cannabonoids typically that that's the

1283
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,318
number that people are looking at. And

1284
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,318
now that they have access to tarpen

1285
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:30,318
testing, people are interested in that

1286
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:32,079
as well. But now they're saying I want

1287
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:34,239
something with a lot of tarpen and a lot

1288
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:36,480
of THC. And they're not necessarily even

1289
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:38,399
thinking, oh, what have I had in the

1290
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,318
past that has worked really well for me?

1291
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,440
they're just going for the, you know,

1292
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:45,679
the most. And it's it's really odd. And

1293
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,240
so it's almost like uh the term that

1294
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:51,440
comes to mind is the tyranny of numbers

1295
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:55,519
where because we can test for it, people

1296
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:57,480
now use that as the um the qualifier for

1297
00:53:55,519 --> 00:54:01,838
what is good

1298
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:03,838
versus experiencing something, you know,

1299
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:06,400
saying, "Wow, I really like this." and

1300
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:08,880
then looking at, you know, what it

1301
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:12,318
what's in it so that you can try to find

1302
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:14,240
that elsewhere. Um, you know, it's it's

1303
00:54:12,318 --> 00:54:15,838
not necessarily driven off of an

1304
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:19,598
experience-based thing. It's driven off

1305
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:22,400
of a perception of what they what they

1306
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:25,720
want to experience based on everything

1307
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:28,400
some weird number system uh that

1308
00:54:25,719 --> 00:54:30,480
we've it's it's unfortunate, but it's

1309
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,639
where we're at. It is. It is. and and

1310
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:36,559
and they also I think in the in the

1311
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:38,239
general weed right now it's way stronger

1312
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:39,800
than it was 20 years ago with the

1313
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:42,239
breedings with

1314
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:44,079
everything which is okay it's good I

1315
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:45,759
probably if I would smoke the same way

1316
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,359
that I would smoke 20 years ago right

1317
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:51,359
now it probably wouldn't do anything to

1318
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:55,039
me but on this process they're losing a

1319
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:57,838
lot of like the CBD 10 20 years ago we

1320
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:59,279
has a balance of THC a balance of CBD

1321
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:02,358
and then there was the tarpins and

1322
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:05,119
everything else. Right now there's zero

1323
00:55:02,358 --> 00:55:07,039
CBD. There's a big number on THC. And

1324
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,200
now the turppins are coming in lower

1325
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:10,639
numbers. It's three, five, 10% or

1326
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:12,239
something like this. It's the highest it

1327
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:14,960
goes on the turppins. I don't know. But

1328
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:16,558
it's really low numbers. And people are

1329
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,000
looking for that with the bigger it's

1330
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,839
better. Bigger it's better. Bigger it's

1331
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,400
it's not bigger it's better. It's the

1332
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:26,159
balance that it makes it better. It can

1333
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:28,200
be really low, maybe 10% THC, but those

1334
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:31,279
5% tarpins in

1335
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:34,000
there will make you experience that by

1336
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:36,640
itself the high will be much more

1337
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,719
pleasable and and and last last longing.

1338
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:41,279
And another thing that I noticed from

1339
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:44,799
old wheats I I like to call it like this

1340
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:47,798
and new wheats old wheat like the old

1341
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:50,359
skunk the old super skanks and all of

1342
00:55:47,798 --> 00:55:53,199
that they would last

1343
00:55:50,358 --> 00:55:55,920
for they would last I don't know for 2

1344
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:59,279
hours 3 hours but uh you would get that

1345
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:02,079
trippy feeling from the medicine for for

1346
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:04,400
a long time right now with the new it

1347
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:07,119
you may get that but it's 10 minutes

1348
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:10,559
peak 15 minutes peak And then you need

1349
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:13,760
to smoke again to keep that going. It's

1350
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:15,720
not I don't know if this is also

1351
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:19,839
because you are

1352
00:56:15,719 --> 00:56:22,798
now power tolerance also may may not

1353
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:25,039
help to this but but still I do a break

1354
00:56:22,798 --> 00:56:28,000
for a week for on smoking. It's very

1355
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:30,480
rare but it it it happens. And when I

1356
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,440
smoke again, I feel it's I feel it

1357
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:35,119
straight away. But it's not that uh two

1358
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,318
hours that I don't have to think about

1359
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:38,240
rolling another one. What are you

1360
00:56:36,318 --> 00:56:39,519
talking about? After 45 minutes, I'm

1361
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:42,479
already thinking about rolling another

1362
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:44,318
one and another one and and so on. And I

1363
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,880
think this was the breeding out of

1364
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:50,079
everything to put in the THC numbers in

1365
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:52,880
it that I don't know. This is just me

1366
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:54,318
thinking. I think that's definitely a I

1367
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,480
think that's definitely a part of it.

1368
00:56:54,318 --> 00:56:58,719
Um, another thing that I've talked about

1369
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:01,920
before on the show is that there's just

1370
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:03,598
more availability of different genetics,

1371
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,798
all of which are going to have different

1372
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:08,480
THC can overall cannabonoid and tarpine

1373
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:11,039
profiles as well as whatever other

1374
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:13,519
volatile organic compounds are in there.

1375
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:16,558
And due to the fact that we all have

1376
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:18,159
unique endockinabonoid systems, if

1377
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,079
you're sifting through a million

1378
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:22,879
different strains to try and find the

1379
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:24,640
ones or the twos that work for you, you

1380
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,960
know, then that's going to be a lot

1381
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:29,759
harder than sifting through the five or

1382
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:32,798
10 strains available in your local area

1383
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:35,760
at the time, uh, you know, 10, 20 years

1384
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:38,199
ago. So, you know, and I know that there

1385
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:40,400
is a lot more available, but not

1386
00:57:38,199 --> 00:57:44,078
necessarily at the level that we have

1387
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:46,798
now due to the more popularization of

1388
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:48,960
cannabis culture worldwide that we've

1389
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:51,039
been able to see through the different

1390
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,358
legal and recreational markets that have

1391
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:56,719
come online. It opened up just so much

1392
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:59,119
more access to information, uh, strains,

1393
00:57:56,719 --> 00:58:02,719
cultivars, the trading of genetics,

1394
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:04,640
whether it be seed stock or clones. And

1395
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:06,159
now with tissue culture, the ability to

1396
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:09,759
transfer a lot of those different

1397
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:13,440
genetics worldwide with ease and uh not

1398
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:16,559
risk exposure or you know incrimination

1399
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:18,960
due to those different uh aspects of

1400
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:21,599
what we can do now. It's a fascinating

1401
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:23,798
world. You know, it's it it opens up so

1402
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:26,720
much more availability for

1403
00:58:23,798 --> 00:58:29,199
different cultivars that you you know,

1404
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:30,798
there's the the benefit of it where if

1405
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:33,960
you find something that really works for

1406
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:36,719
you now, like you might be able to find

1407
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:38,480
something that works so well for you now

1408
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:40,078
that you may not have ever been able to

1409
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:43,760
find before because it just wasn't

1410
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:45,519
available. Whereas the sifting of

1411
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,119
getting through all those different

1412
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:49,599
strains now is going to take so much

1413
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:54,400
longer that it almost seems impossible

1414
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:56,920
to actually find that super unique

1415
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:59,200
um you know unicorns are getting more

1416
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:02,240
unicorns every day. Unicorns are

1417
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:04,000
becoming harder to find. Yeah. Yeah.

1418
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:06,959
Absolutely. That's true.

1419
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,679
There's there's way more options to look

1420
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:12,199
for it, but there's way less unicorns

1421
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:14,480
and and if you really see all the

1422
00:59:12,199 --> 00:59:17,759
options kind of came from the same

1423
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:19,599
parents for sure, you know, then they

1424
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,480
crossed and recrossed and Greek this

1425
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:23,640
this and that. But if you go to the

1426
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:25,880
base, there's northern

1427
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:30,719
lights, there's

1428
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:32,798
um uh Durban poison, there's Afghani,

1429
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:37,039
there's this, there's that. And from

1430
00:59:32,798 --> 00:59:40,079
this the crosses with those 10 maybe 10,

1431
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:42,880
maybe 20, there are thousands. Yeah.

1432
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,880
That were born right now. And um with

1433
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:47,280
legalization hitting all over the world

1434
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,599
as you were saying, more people also

1435
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:52,000
it's playing and uh which is great man.

1436
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:53,760
You see this is a beautiful thing

1437
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,440
because otherwise the plant would not

1438
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,880
evolve and tissue culture you were

1439
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:59,200
talking it's something that really

1440
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:01,039
fascinated me. I don't know exact I

1441
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:03,759
never went too deep of it but the fact

1442
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:06,798
that you can preserve the exact same

1443
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:09,920
thing without any pathogens without

1444
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:12,880
anything and a little thing like this

1445
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:14,720
for decades I mean it's crazy and then

1446
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,960
you can grow the same plant it's it's

1447
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:19,439
crazy and now there's AI also involved

1448
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:23,199
in in seeds here I don't know if you

1449
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:25,318
heard about it they can AI can identify

1450
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:28,960
the seed male or

1451
01:00:25,318 --> 01:00:30,719
female this is huge because uh I don't

1452
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,358
know if this is is something that will

1453
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:36,199
come up or not because there's a big

1454
01:00:33,358 --> 01:00:39,440
market for feminized seeds around the

1455
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:42,039
world but supposedly feminized seeds are

1456
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:45,838
weaker seeds than regular seeds. They

1457
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:48,159
say if the regular seeds take out the

1458
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:52,000
male problem which is for the home

1459
01:00:48,159 --> 01:00:54,639
grower I buy 10 seeds regular and then I

1460
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,239
have eight males. This is a problem for

1461
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:58,400
a home grower. If you're in a facility

1462
01:00:56,239 --> 01:01:00,479
that you're searching, okay, this goes,

1463
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:03,760
this keeps going.

1464
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:06,159
Like for now, I'm growing the mentado

1465
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:09,359
from the genetics. It's a mutant plant

1466
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:11,279
and it was 12 12 seeds from the 12. I

1467
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:14,719
have five females. All of the rest was

1468
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:17,200
to kill. I have space. I can do this. I

1469
01:01:14,719 --> 01:01:19,759
am playing. I don't mind if I'm losing

1470
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:22,159
time because I I like what I'm doing.

1471
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:25,599
But if I only have a closet like a 4x4

1472
01:01:22,159 --> 01:01:27,358
or something and this is my grow, if I

1473
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:29,760
put 10 plants in there, it's because I

1474
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:32,078
want the 10 plants out or if I put five

1475
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:35,440
in there, you know what I mean? So if I

1476
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:38,960
if if with AI we can identify that this

1477
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:41,519
seed is female exactly 100%. This is

1478
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:45,039
huge. I I have to see that to believe it

1479
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:46,960
because there's huge. Yeah, that that

1480
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:52,199
would be huge if it were something that

1481
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:55,318
that an AI software could do, but I am

1482
01:01:52,199 --> 01:01:59,039
very skeptical. Yeah, I have to see that

1483
01:01:55,318 --> 01:02:00,558
happen with a a proven regular pack of

1484
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:03,519
seeds and make sure they're not slipping

1485
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:06,160
a bunch of feminized seeds into the into

1486
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:08,639
the process to try and trick everyone

1487
01:02:06,159 --> 01:02:10,399
into thinking that it works. But that

1488
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:11,920
that's fascinating. I'm glad you brought

1489
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:15,200
it up. I'm going to have to look into

1490
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:17,519
that. Go, go, go. I can send you a few

1491
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:19,919
articles on it after it's with pleasure

1492
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:21,358
and you can look for it when it's a new

1493
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:23,599
thing. It's something that it's been

1494
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:25,679
talking about only for the past few

1495
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:28,318
months I believe. At least I only

1496
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:30,879
realized about it a few months ago. But

1497
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:33,519
if this really is true and if this

1498
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:36,480
really goes forward with it, I don't see

1499
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:38,079
why seed companies would not do this to

1500
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,358
them. I know there's a big market for

1501
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,839
feminiz, but dude, you're selling

1502
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:44,798
feminizes anyway. No, it's just regular

1503
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:47,039
that you were sure that it's a feminiz.

1504
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:48,960
So, let's see. Let's see what the future

1505
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,400
has for us on this one. But I'm

1506
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,798
definitely I won't say no. You know,

1507
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,039
like if it if it works, it works. But

1508
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:57,679
I'm not, you

1509
01:02:54,039 --> 01:02:59,279
know, I'm definitely trepidacious to to

1510
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:01,440
be like, "Oh, for sure. That sounds

1511
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:03,920
awesome."

1512
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,000
It's like the laser for the the bugs.

1513
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,920
Exactly. I would love to have like a

1514
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,159
mini drone like this big going in my

1515
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:14,079
tent killing bugs. Yeah.

1516
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:16,078
just set it off for 5 minutes a day. Um,

1517
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:18,640
what are uh what are some of the biggest

1518
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:20,798
setbacks that you faced as a grower? Um,

1519
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:22,558
you know, considering a lot of people

1520
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:24,719
that listen to this are home growers

1521
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:26,960
themselves and everyone faces different

1522
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:28,558
problems within their grow, but we all

1523
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,318
have to learn to kind of bounce back

1524
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:32,000
from them. What are some of those

1525
01:03:30,318 --> 01:03:35,440
setbacks that you've had to bounce back

1526
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,679
from? Honestly, the biggest one and that

1527
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,920
I struggle with still even with decades

1528
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:42,960
of growing I sometimes struggle with it

1529
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:45,519
is patience when we growing. I think

1530
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:48,358
this is the biggest thing on growing

1531
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:50,960
it's you have to be patient for

1532
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:53,598
everything in the beginning with the

1533
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:56,559
water especially if you are new new

1534
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:58,240
grower and there's a lot of things

1535
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:01,440
happening and you want to do everything

1536
01:03:58,239 --> 01:04:03,358
because uh it's everything is new. So in

1537
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,440
the beginning you overwater them then

1538
01:04:03,358 --> 01:04:07,119
then you realize you overwatering then

1539
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,960
you will be underwatering them. This is

1540
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:11,920
all the process for you to learn and for

1541
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:14,079
people to learn. But I honestly believe

1542
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:17,440
that the biggest setback that we have

1543
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:21,519
it's ourself with the hurry. We hurry to

1544
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:24,400
water. We we we hurry to trim to trim to

1545
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:27,199
defoliate. We hurry to harvest. And

1546
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,880
dudes, if you are months and months and

1547
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:30,960
month, not months and months, but three,

1548
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:33,039
four months surrounding a plants or grow

1549
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:35,440
or whatever and then in the end you

1550
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:37,680
harvested too soon, you're losing

1551
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:39,200
potential and you're losing weight and

1552
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:40,558
in my humble opinion, you're losing

1553
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:44,480
three or four months of work because

1554
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:46,160
this is not the the thing. So honestly,

1555
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:48,318
I don't know if this was the what you

1556
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:51,279
were looking back. I think patience and

1557
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:54,480
uh it's the biggest thing that we as

1558
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:57,680
growers need to learn and to accept and

1559
01:04:54,480 --> 01:05:00,719
to embrace that uh planting is believing

1560
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:02,879
in the future. So believe in it because

1561
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:04,798
it will take time. It's the same as a

1562
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:07,358
potato, a strawberry, whatever you're

1563
01:05:04,798 --> 01:05:10,159
putting on the ground. It will take time

1564
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:12,880
to grow and you cannot rush nature. You

1565
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:15,759
can you really can't. Now, I think

1566
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:19,039
that's a great uh sentiment to deliver

1567
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:21,680
to other growers is patience is key. Um,

1568
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:23,920
we have one of the fastest growing crops

1569
01:05:21,679 --> 01:05:26,719
growing for us uh either in our home

1570
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,960
grow or outdoor setting or whatever. Um,

1571
01:05:26,719 --> 01:05:31,118
and so, you know, we don't need that

1572
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:36,159
much patience with cannabis because you

1573
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:37,838
can have from seed to the the pipe or

1574
01:05:36,159 --> 01:05:40,798
bowl or whatever it is that you're using

1575
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:43,038
to smoke that final product with. Yeah.

1576
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:44,960
four months. Maybe four months you you

1577
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,640
can do it. Yeah. There's not not a lot

1578
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:49,199
of other plants that you can say, "Hey,

1579
01:05:46,639 --> 01:05:50,879
I'm I'm I'm planting this apple tree and

1580
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:54,159
I'm going to eat an apple in four

1581
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:56,480
months." That doesn't happen. Um so, you

1582
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:58,399
know, I feel like be appreciative for

1583
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,159
the fact that it grows so fast. But

1584
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:03,039
learn a little bit of patience is a

1585
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:04,879
definite good thing to uh relay to other

1586
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:08,319
growers. I do see people harvesting

1587
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:11,440
still too soon and um sometimes giving

1588
01:06:08,318 --> 01:06:13,279
it those extra few weeks uh it just

1589
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:15,358
makes for such a different product in

1590
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:18,720
the end.

1591
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:20,480
But you know that wasn't necessar that I

1592
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:21,919
guess that wasn't necessarily what I was

1593
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,920
thinking about when I asked the question

1594
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:28,000
of biggest setbacks. But maybe a better

1595
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:31,039
way to um to phrase it is one of the

1596
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:34,798
things that I like to ask growers is

1597
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:36,480
what are some of the biggest or what

1598
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:39,199
like what is a lesson that you've

1599
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,798
learned from a failure in your garden

1600
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:45,558
and then what is a lesson that you've

1601
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:45,559
learned from a success in your garden?

1602
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:50,480
lesson

1603
01:06:51,559 --> 01:06:57,839
from let me see so for

1604
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:59,880
failures over watering is it's really

1605
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:02,639
bad for you because you will stuck your

1606
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:05,039
plants I think it's it's worse to

1607
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:09,519
overwater than to underwater for the

1608
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:11,680
single reason that uh an a dry plant if

1609
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:14,798
it will look almost dead but if you give

1610
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:18,239
it water to heat it will bounce back and

1611
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:20,559
over water plants will have problems on

1612
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:23,919
uptaking nutrients. We'll have problems

1613
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:27,359
on root root raw. We'll have problems in

1614
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:30,720
a lot of things. So overwatering is

1615
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:32,639
definitely um a big big big thing a big

1616
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:35,118
lesson in the in the garden and and it's

1617
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:36,519
something that it takes time takes time

1618
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:40,960
to to

1619
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:43,280
to learn either it by weight on the on

1620
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:45,760
the pots. This is something that when I

1621
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:48,798
was not doing automatic wings with auto

1622
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:52,319
pots, I I was something that I found

1623
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:54,480
myself doing it is I know how much it is

1624
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:57,119
without watering. Now I water on how

1625
01:07:54,480 --> 01:08:01,358
much it is and then I will look for that

1626
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:05,760
same weight for me to water again. This

1627
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:07,038
was how I myself fight the overwatering

1628
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:10,079
because in the beginning I was

1629
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:12,160
overwatering especially in the in the in

1630
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:13,440
the first years everything was just

1631
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:16,880
water water water water water water

1632
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:18,399
water we would go in water water and the

1633
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,159
same plants they drink a lot and they

1634
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:22,559
don't mind that and if especially if the

1635
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:26,000
water goes away and it doesn't stay in

1636
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:28,880
the soil but most of the them they don't

1637
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,880
like over watering they they they will

1638
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,640
get stuck on growth they will get stuck

1639
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:35,199
on eating, they will get stuck on

1640
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:37,520
everything. That that I think this is

1641
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:40,158
one of the biggest lessons for me in in

1642
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:41,920
growing is the waterings. And you know

1643
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:44,639
what almost falls in line with patience,

1644
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:46,158
right? Like sometimes when you're when

1645
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,279
you first start growing, you're like, I

1646
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:50,000
got to make sure that the plant has

1647
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:52,000
water. And rather than being patient and

1648
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,079
allowing for it to use the water that it

1649
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:57,119
already has to a certain level so that

1650
01:08:54,079 --> 01:08:58,719
you don't create anorobic or hypoxic

1651
01:08:57,119 --> 01:09:02,158
conditions in the root zone and cause

1652
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:03,920
these different root health issues. Um,

1653
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:05,879
you know, having that patience to wait

1654
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:08,158
for that dryback, make sure that it

1655
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,440
happens. You know, I I do see a lot of

1656
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:10,798
growers where they're just like, I got

1657
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:14,079
to make sure that I get that water on

1658
01:09:10,798 --> 01:09:16,880
there like right now.

1659
01:09:14,079 --> 01:09:21,278
I I I stop rushing the waters. I I I

1660
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:24,079
actually prefer to to get into the room

1661
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:25,600
and see them like kind of drippy. Oh

1662
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:27,838
man, I forget to water for two three

1663
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:30,000
days. I need to water because I'm never

1664
01:09:27,838 --> 01:09:33,600
that time that longer away from them

1665
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:36,238
than to be to finding them droopy just

1666
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:39,120
because of the overwatering. That's for

1667
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:40,718
sure. For sure. Lessons learned when

1668
01:09:39,119 --> 01:09:42,798
mistakes were making. I don't know.

1669
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:44,480
Super crop. I learned myself from

1670
01:09:42,798 --> 01:09:46,319
mistakes. I did not learn. I did not

1671
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:49,358
know it. did not know it was super

1672
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:51,199
cropping until later on because

1673
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:53,440
supercropping happen when you're working

1674
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:56,079
and you break it and oh [ __ ] it started

1675
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:59,039
breaking and that suddenly that broken

1676
01:09:56,079 --> 01:10:01,519
branch becomes the best fruit in your

1677
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:03,920
garden. This was how I learned myself

1678
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:07,400
about supercropping and I started to

1679
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:09,679
implement this this a few decades ago

1680
01:10:07,399 --> 01:10:12,319
without reading or seeing anything and

1681
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:14,319
now day now I know it's super cropping

1682
01:10:12,319 --> 01:10:16,279
but this all begin with me breaking

1683
01:10:14,319 --> 01:10:19,359
branches and that

1684
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:22,639
branch making the best buds in the whole

1685
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:24,559
tent and then I okay wait this this this

1686
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:27,199
may be or may not be let's see and I

1687
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:29,840
start breaking them for myself now I go

1688
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:32,000
there I gently

1689
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:35,279
like I really I super crop them if they

1690
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:38,000
go too big. But this one was a mistake

1691
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:40,000
that took me to a lesson and one that I

1692
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,840
used till today and it's been a few

1693
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,479
years now. I know the names and the

1694
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:46,640
techniques for them. But this is how I'm

1695
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:48,879
curious about the new one. This one it's

1696
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:51,320
something that I'm I need to do it. I

1697
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:54,480
need to find time and courage to do

1698
01:10:51,319 --> 01:10:56,238
it because it happened to me two times

1699
01:10:54,479 --> 01:10:57,919
and on the two times that it happened I

1700
01:10:56,238 --> 01:11:00,479
will explain you in a second. I believe

1701
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:03,440
that plants grew better. What was this?

1702
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:05,359
Everybody has this big paranoia that the

1703
01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:07,678
little top root from the seed, the first

1704
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:09,519
one, cannot be touched, cannot be

1705
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:10,679
broken, cannot be nothing because it's

1706
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:14,000
very

1707
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:16,039
sensitive. The two times that I broke it

1708
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:20,000
in half and I still put it in the

1709
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:21,760
soil, plants grew amazing

1710
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,359
compared to the rest of it. So, what I

1711
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:25,360
want to do, this is this is probably

1712
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:27,759
something that I will be doing maybe on

1713
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:30,479
the next run on a few couple of runs, is

1714
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:33,840
I'm going to do 10 seeds and I'm going

1715
01:11:30,479 --> 01:11:36,319
to purposely cut five of them in half,

1716
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:38,319
the the tiny root, and the other five

1717
01:11:36,319 --> 01:11:40,599
I'm going to leave it normal. And I'm

1718
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:43,759
going to plant them. And I want to

1719
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:46,320
see if the five that I cut the the root

1720
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:48,719
in half, the the mini top in half, will

1721
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:50,559
all grow better than the other five. If

1722
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:54,319
that happens, then I will know for sure

1723
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:56,800
that uh this was just not a casual thing

1724
01:11:54,319 --> 01:11:59,039
that happened because the two times that

1725
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:00,480
this happened and I realized it happened

1726
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:02,640
because when I grabbed the seed, the

1727
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:05,119
half of the roots just stuck there and I

1728
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,480
still put it in soil, they grew amazing.

1729
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:08,800
So, I'm curious to do this test. It's

1730
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:11,839
fascinating. It makes me think of root

1731
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:13,679
pruning with bonsai where you um you

1732
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:15,920
know you have the bonsai in a small pot

1733
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:17,840
where the roots are constricted to a

1734
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:19,760
certain amount of substrate and then

1735
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:21,679
periodically you go in and you trim off

1736
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,679
the extra roots, add some fresh

1737
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:26,000
substrate, get it back in there and you

1738
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:29,199
get this explosive growth for the next

1739
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:31,600
uh amount of time. Um, I've even helped

1740
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:33,599
other growers where they've h have, you

1741
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,199
know, they have limited space and they

1742
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,120
have to keep all their moms in like a

1743
01:12:35,198 --> 01:12:39,678
onegon pot or something along those

1744
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:41,439
lines. So, they'll every few months

1745
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:43,679
they'll, you know, if they don't have

1746
01:12:41,439 --> 01:12:45,279
the ability to clone it, right? then or

1747
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:47,199
if they let it go too long so it's

1748
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:49,198
rootbound and you don't have really good

1749
01:12:47,198 --> 01:12:51,359
healthy growth. You go in, you pull the

1750
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:53,359
root ball out of the pot, you shave a

1751
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:55,119
quarter to/ inch off of all the

1752
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:57,599
different sides with like a bread knife

1753
01:12:55,119 --> 01:12:59,119
or something and then you just put fresh

1754
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,440
substrate in there and put it back in

1755
01:12:59,119 --> 01:13:03,960
and you get that new root growth um from

1756
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:06,879
the root pruning and you get uh you know

1757
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:09,039
healthy new uh upper growth and you can

1758
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:12,319
take a clone so that you can reset it.

1759
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:15,439
Um it and that's also what works uh or

1760
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:17,759
why fabric pots uh tend to work fairly

1761
01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:21,759
well where you can use a smaller fabric

1762
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:24,960
pot um for a larger plant uh where you

1763
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:27,679
might need a larger plastic or solid pot

1764
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:29,760
for the same size plant. Otherwise, this

1765
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:31,760
is because of the the roots getting into

1766
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:34,079
outside and sending the signal out. And

1767
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:36,239
then instead of going around the pot,

1768
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:39,519
it's it creates a bigger mass of roots

1769
01:13:36,238 --> 01:13:42,559
inside of the whole pot, filling up the

1770
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:44,800
the the soil better than obtaining

1771
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:46,640
better nutrients. I believe in plastic

1772
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:49,279
pot, this doesn't happen. The roots once

1773
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:51,119
it hits the hole, it will try to keep

1774
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:53,039
growing because it there's nothing there

1775
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:54,640
signal. There's no hair, there's no

1776
01:13:53,039 --> 01:13:56,800
there's nothing signal. So she keeps

1777
01:13:54,640 --> 01:14:00,079
searching for the deeper place. And this

1778
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:02,239
is why you get those pots with those big

1779
01:14:00,079 --> 01:14:03,519
roots. When you using fabric pots and

1780
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:06,399
you take the roots out, you take a

1781
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:07,600
block. Yep. It's a block of soil and it

1782
01:14:06,399 --> 01:14:09,439
looks like it doesn't have any roots,

1783
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,360
but there's a lot of roots in there. But

1784
01:14:09,439 --> 01:14:14,319
it's like a solid root. No, you get the

1785
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:15,920
big massive root down there, you get the

1786
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:19,559
roots going around and then in the

1787
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:22,158
center of it, there's roots,

1788
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:24,360
but it's not the same. It really is not

1789
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:27,198
the same. Yeah, the overall root mass is

1790
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:30,238
definitely smaller. Um, if you were to

1791
01:14:27,198 --> 01:14:32,960
grow the same plant in a fabric versus a

1792
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:35,279
plastic pot and at the, you know, the

1793
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:38,000
same time frame, you'd find a greater

1794
01:14:35,279 --> 01:14:40,158
root mass in the fabric pot by like the

1795
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,679
end of 30 days.

1796
01:14:40,158 --> 01:14:42,960
It's crazy. It's crazy. I don't know the

1797
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:44,560
name of it, but it's because of the

1798
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,480
sign. It's the same happens that when

1799
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:48,960
the plant gets to the soil, it's it's

1800
01:14:46,479 --> 01:14:50,959
it's his hair and it sing signals the

1801
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,880
roots to go down and she keeps growing.

1802
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:55,679
I think it works the same way with the

1803
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:57,199
with the fabric pot. Yep. Absolutely. I

1804
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:59,119
think that for the fabric pots and for

1805
01:14:57,198 --> 01:15:01,359
that that would be called air pruning.

1806
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:04,079
And then

1807
01:15:01,359 --> 01:15:06,000
and then you can also just physically

1808
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:07,920
prune the roots yourself if you need to

1809
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,079
accomplish the same thing in a smaller

1810
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,840
pot or if you need to remain in that

1811
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:14,880
smaller pot for a longer period of time

1812
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:16,960
for whatever reason. Um in veg it's no

1813
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:19,440
problem to do that. They will bounce it

1814
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:20,719
back. They will love if it's not enough

1815
01:15:19,439 --> 01:15:22,238
flower.

1816
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:23,840
Yes, absolutely. Don't do that with an

1817
01:15:22,238 --> 01:15:25,119
autoflower, folks. Don't do that with an

1818
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:27,840
autoflower. You're going to trigger it

1819
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:30,079
to flower. So, you know, that those

1820
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,840
being some of the the points where you

1821
01:15:30,079 --> 01:15:34,399
found, you know, you learned from

1822
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:36,319
something that went wrong, you know, in

1823
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:39,279
your grow where you didn't intend for

1824
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:41,359
the outcome to be what it was, um, but

1825
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:43,920
you learned from it. What are some of

1826
01:15:41,359 --> 01:15:45,599
the things where you went into the

1827
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:48,560
process of being like, I'm going to add

1828
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:52,400
this because I I think that it's going

1829
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:54,239
to increase X Y or Z. Uh so where have

1830
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:55,920
you found a success in your garden like

1831
01:15:54,238 --> 01:15:57,919
that where you you added something in

1832
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:00,520
and it did exactly what you wanted it to

1833
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:04,039
do? Microisal.

1834
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:07,280
Okay. Seriously. And

1835
01:16:04,039 --> 01:16:09,198
um when I first heard about microisal, I

1836
01:16:07,279 --> 01:16:12,000
could not believe it myself that it

1837
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:14,158
would do that. Then I start researching

1838
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,479
and I find out that I believe it's in

1839
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:21,799
Japan they use microiser to do the

1840
01:16:17,479 --> 01:16:24,158
subway meaning they place it the the

1841
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:26,000
stations and they put the microiser and

1842
01:16:24,158 --> 01:16:28,158
the microiser in the beginning make made

1843
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,800
the big mess and then it creates the

1844
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:32,719
perfect roads and they did the subway

1845
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:35,360
that way. I'm not sure if it was Japan,

1846
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:37,119
Taiwan, some somebody there did that.

1847
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:39,759
Yeah, they they used like a mcelium

1848
01:16:37,119 --> 01:16:41,519
culture to do that and this and I start

1849
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:43,880
researching and researching and I start

1850
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:46,880
realizing man this is the biggest

1851
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:48,640
network that exists on earth. There's

1852
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:51,199
nothing bigger than microisal in the

1853
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:54,239
world. We can think that no it's

1854
01:16:51,198 --> 01:16:56,559
connected from elsewhere to everywhere.

1855
01:16:54,238 --> 01:17:00,158
I I kind of believe that almost all

1856
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:02,080
plants in the world are underconnected

1857
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:04,479
because of the microisal. not the ones

1858
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:08,479
in the pot because they're by themselves

1859
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:10,959
but uh nature itself and when I first

1860
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:12,959
time I imple I implement the microisal

1861
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,359
in this case was appto the microisal in

1862
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:17,039
in in my

1863
01:17:14,359 --> 01:17:19,198
plants I did a side by side because I

1864
01:17:17,039 --> 01:17:21,840
wanted to make sure that uh it would

1865
01:17:19,198 --> 01:17:24,719
make big difference or no difference and

1866
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:27,719
it's crazy the the the big roots the

1867
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:30,480
white roots the channels a root without

1868
01:17:27,719 --> 01:17:33,198
microism it grows like this and it has a

1869
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:35,599
little tiny hair, normal roots, a root

1870
01:17:33,198 --> 01:17:38,839
with microisal, it grows like that and

1871
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:41,600
it's thousands of hairs going all over

1872
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:43,840
her and all of that things are are

1873
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,840
receptors are connectors that will help

1874
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:48,880
the plant improve. So I I really think

1875
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:52,079
that the microisal was definitely the

1876
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:55,520
biggest thing that I saw results and it

1877
01:17:52,079 --> 01:17:57,679
was exactly what I was looking for and

1878
01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:00,960
uh what I was expecting. All of the rest

1879
01:17:57,679 --> 01:18:03,359
it is but it is not. This was beyond my

1880
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:05,679
expectations actually. This and the

1881
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:08,719
ender canopy lights the end canopy but

1882
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:11,600
this is still a new factor. I'm still

1883
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:16,158
it's just my second run so I don't know.

1884
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:19,120
Y but for my first run that really was

1885
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:21,039
crazy man. I was expecting I was not

1886
01:18:19,119 --> 01:18:22,800
expecting almost double the harvest and

1887
01:18:21,039 --> 01:18:26,880
I get almost double the harvest that I

1888
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:29,279
would do on a 4x4. So that's awesome. It

1889
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:32,640
was crazy. It was crazy. And it was not

1890
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:33,960
double the power because the ICL 300

1891
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:37,280
they

1892
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:40,000
are 150 watts each one I believe. So

1893
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:42,319
it's 300 W more in the tent and on top

1894
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,880
it's 700 meaning it's not double. It's

1895
01:18:42,319 --> 01:18:46,799
not

1896
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:50,079
1,400. It's not supposed to go double

1897
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:52,079
and it went almost double which was I

1898
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:55,119
know it was first run. So I I don't

1899
01:18:52,079 --> 01:18:59,279
know. I still need to experience more to

1900
01:18:55,119 --> 01:19:02,000
see if this actually is over expectating

1901
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:05,119
what I was expecting or if this was just

1902
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,960
the perfect run and now I'm going to be

1903
01:19:05,119 --> 01:19:11,039
it's going to be hard to to do it again

1904
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:13,119
and to to to replicate the the results.

1905
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:15,039
Let's see. Let's see. Y cuz we've

1906
01:19:13,119 --> 01:19:18,319
definitely found that we are getting a

1907
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:19,840
lot of or a lot higher of a yield with

1908
01:19:18,319 --> 01:19:21,279
the under canopy lights, but it's

1909
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,039
definitely not double or anything. But

1910
01:19:21,279 --> 01:19:26,880
like you said, we're not adding double

1911
01:19:23,039 --> 01:19:30,560
the total uh you know, wattage input to

1912
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:32,800
that space. Um, and even still with the

1913
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:35,880
under canopy lights, you know, like if

1914
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:39,600
we're if we're adding uh an additional

1915
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:43,199
30% to the overall wattage input, we're

1916
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:44,880
not seeing a 30% increase in yield. Um,

1917
01:19:43,198 --> 01:19:47,519
but we are still seeing an increase in

1918
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:51,600
yield. And the the biggest thing that I

1919
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:56,159
see is you get an increase in overall

1920
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:58,480
uh uniformity of quality where the the

1921
01:19:56,158 --> 01:20:01,839
quality that you typically go for. For

1922
01:19:58,479 --> 01:20:05,198
me, uh my favorite flowers are typically

1923
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:08,000
about three or four nodes down from the

1924
01:20:05,198 --> 01:20:10,960
topmost bud. And because it's usually

1925
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:13,279
like picture perfect, it isn't grown

1926
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:15,119
into another bud. So when you dry it

1927
01:20:13,279 --> 01:20:18,000
down and snap it away from the stem, it

1928
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:20,559
gives you a really good um

1929
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,880
representation of the morphology of that

1930
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:26,000
plant and the flower structure and the

1931
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:27,920
tricom density and the brack development

1932
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,079
and you know everything about it. you

1933
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:33,600
get a really nice representation of the

1934
01:20:30,079 --> 01:20:36,158
plant where the lowers would always, you

1935
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:38,159
know, they'd either be with some

1936
01:20:36,158 --> 01:20:40,399
cultivars, they'd be dense still, but

1937
01:20:38,158 --> 01:20:42,079
they'd just be small popcorny. They

1938
01:20:40,399 --> 01:20:43,920
wouldn't have great color, you know, if

1939
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:45,679
if the plant up top turn nice and

1940
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:47,600
purple. Sometimes the lowers stay a

1941
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:50,319
little greener, or maybe they'll they'll

1942
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:54,239
be more of like a a light version of

1943
01:20:50,319 --> 01:20:56,559
whatever color you get at the top. Um,

1944
01:20:54,238 --> 01:20:58,319
and they, you know, won't necessarily

1945
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:01,719
always develop fully. So, they'll

1946
01:20:58,319 --> 01:21:05,279
sometimes still have white hairs

1947
01:21:01,719 --> 01:21:07,198
or, you know, just not not be there, not

1948
01:21:05,279 --> 01:21:08,639
mature, right? And but when I added the

1949
01:21:07,198 --> 01:21:10,479
under canopy lights, I noticed that

1950
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:12,480
everything across the canopy typically,

1951
01:21:10,479 --> 01:21:16,319
as long as I'm keeping that overall

1952
01:21:12,479 --> 01:21:19,519
canopy density um within the range of

1953
01:21:16,319 --> 01:21:22,559
what my irrigation can provide for it

1954
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:27,040
and what I can do for it based on

1955
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:29,520
environmental factors. Um, I can see

1956
01:21:27,039 --> 01:21:32,399
uniformity almost from that third or

1957
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:34,159
fourth bud down from the top cuz those

1958
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:35,839
tops still do what they do and they get

1959
01:21:34,158 --> 01:21:38,079
dense and packed together at the very

1960
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:40,319
end. But from about that third or fourth

1961
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:43,039
node down all the way down through the

1962
01:21:40,319 --> 01:21:45,840
plant, I see a very similar morphology.

1963
01:21:43,039 --> 01:21:49,679
And so I can turn a lot of what would

1964
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:50,880
be, you know, B's or C's uh in my in my

1965
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:52,480
buds. you know, if you're separating

1966
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,719
them out where you have A's, B's, and

1967
01:21:52,479 --> 01:21:58,319
C's in terms of the quality and the look

1968
01:21:54,719 --> 01:22:00,719
and the overall size and everything. I

1969
01:21:58,319 --> 01:22:03,359
turn a lot of the B's into A's, and I

1970
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:05,359
turn a lot of the C's into B's or A's

1971
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:08,399
even in some cases, as long as I'm okay

1972
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:10,639
with having smaller flowers in that A's

1973
01:22:08,399 --> 01:22:13,439
category. They still hold up when you

1974
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:17,039
look at it as color and tricom density

1975
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:19,599
and uh overall flower density. Um, so

1976
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:22,319
that's where I found like I'm super

1977
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:26,320
happy with that because typically I

1978
01:22:22,319 --> 01:22:28,000
would get like 20 to 30% of the overall

1979
01:22:26,319 --> 01:22:29,279
harvest wouldn't necessarily be

1980
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,840
something that you could in the

1981
01:22:29,279 --> 01:22:34,158
recreational market sell as this top

1982
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:36,159
quality flower. You could press it,

1983
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:38,399
sure, but that's a whole different

1984
01:22:36,158 --> 01:22:40,158
aspect that you you would need like a

1985
01:22:38,399 --> 01:22:43,920
specific license to do that in the

1986
01:22:40,158 --> 01:22:45,679
recreational market. And so, um, but if

1987
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:48,399
I can turn all of my flowers into A's

1988
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:50,399
and I can just make more pounds that are

1989
01:22:48,399 --> 01:22:53,039
resellable or kilos depending on the

1990
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:57,198
market that you're in, you know, that's

1991
01:22:53,039 --> 01:23:00,158
that's well worth it for me. Um, and I

1992
01:22:57,198 --> 01:23:03,119
feel like for home growers, if there is

1993
01:23:00,158 --> 01:23:05,519
an aspect to the consumption of cannabis

1994
01:23:03,119 --> 01:23:07,119
for, you know, any other grower out

1995
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:09,560
there, whether it be home grower or just

1996
01:23:07,119 --> 01:23:11,840
a consumer that's going to a

1997
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:14,239
recreational dispensary and picking up

1998
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:16,639
flour, you know, there's an aspect to it

1999
01:23:14,238 --> 01:23:19,039
about the flower itself and how it looks

2000
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:23,359
and how it feels and, you know, how it

2001
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:25,439
grinds up and how it breaks apart that

2002
01:23:23,359 --> 01:23:27,359
if you can make a little bit more

2003
01:23:25,439 --> 01:23:28,799
uniformity across the board that even

2004
01:23:27,359 --> 01:23:31,119
for a home grower, you're going to have

2005
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:32,639
more stuff that you're enjoying than

2006
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:34,880
it's going to it's going to last you for

2007
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:37,279
longer also because all of those

2008
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:39,359
popcorns that you use if you press you

2009
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:42,960
would press if you make RSO or if you

2010
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:45,439
make whatever you used to do it for that

2011
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:48,239
now there cease to exist there there

2012
01:23:45,439 --> 01:23:50,238
will be a very small amount of it if you

2013
01:23:48,238 --> 01:23:52,119
do the good pruning if you do a good

2014
01:23:50,238 --> 01:23:54,879
defoliations and if you

2015
01:23:52,119 --> 01:23:57,840
clean enough down there but leave enough

2016
01:23:54,880 --> 01:24:01,039
steel that that that that enough steel

2017
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:04,319
that you leave. It's bud now. It's it's

2018
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:05,679
it's smokable bud. It's not popcorn like

2019
01:24:04,319 --> 01:24:07,679
you were saying or it's not under

2020
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:10,399
development like you were saying. Now

2021
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:12,000
the plant finishes from top to bottom

2022
01:24:10,399 --> 01:24:15,599
pretty much at all at the same time.

2023
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:17,439
Well, before this run, I would think on,

2024
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,440
okay, maybe I harvest half of the plant,

2025
01:24:17,439 --> 01:24:21,279
but I will still leave that harvest half

2026
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:23,039
to finish because I see that there's

2027
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:24,279
potential over here for it to still

2028
01:24:23,039 --> 01:24:26,719
mature and

2029
01:24:24,279 --> 01:24:30,238
grow. This did not happen with the with

2030
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:33,520
the last run. I end up harvesting um two

2031
01:24:30,238 --> 01:24:36,799
top of the plants earlier, but this was

2032
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:39,040
because of bud raw trying to get in. And

2033
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:41,279
this was my way of saving the the

2034
01:24:39,039 --> 01:24:43,119
closets. This is a very important thing

2035
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:45,599
for everybody that is growing. It's when

2036
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:47,679
you growing a very dense and pocket room

2037
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:51,039
and that thing was really scrggrogged

2038
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:54,079
and super dense and buds get too dense

2039
01:24:51,039 --> 01:24:57,519
air flow is very important and even with

2040
01:24:54,079 --> 01:25:01,359
good airflow even with good conditions

2041
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:03,760
but raw can appear and early detections

2042
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:06,399
it's very very important because

2043
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:08,400
otherwise it's all your work going

2044
01:25:06,399 --> 01:25:09,759
bananas because it will spread really

2045
01:25:08,399 --> 01:25:12,399
fast.

2046
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:14,320
So I found one, I took it out. Then on

2047
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:16,479
the next day, I found another one coming

2048
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:18,319
here. So I decided all the big tops on

2049
01:25:16,479 --> 01:25:20,959
top of the ones that were affected, I

2050
01:25:18,319 --> 01:25:23,479
took them out. This was the solo reason

2051
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:26,719
why I harvest them before because

2052
01:25:23,479 --> 01:25:30,319
honestly the whole room in this case and

2053
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:32,399
or the whole plant was maturing at the

2054
01:25:30,319 --> 01:25:34,719
same level, at the same pace, at the

2055
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:36,479
same rhythm. And this was beautiful to

2056
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:39,840
see. This was the first time I ever saw

2057
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:42,399
this. It's it's a mature pop not popcorn

2058
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:44,960
as a mature ball down there at

2059
01:25:42,399 --> 01:25:47,198
conjunction with there the whole canopy

2060
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,639
to the whole room. This this was

2061
01:25:47,198 --> 01:25:51,599
something beautiful and then I'm curious

2062
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:53,359
to see if it will happen here or not.

2063
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:55,199
For sure. Yeah. I always will tell

2064
01:25:53,359 --> 01:25:58,079
people also if they're facing any sort

2065
01:25:55,198 --> 01:26:00,638
of potential bud rot scenarios or

2066
01:25:58,079 --> 01:26:03,920
betritis or you know anything that would

2067
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:07,000
affect the overall flower yield that you

2068
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:12,920
might get out of a a space due to

2069
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:15,439
um you know uh pathogens or or or other

2070
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:18,399
um I'm blinking on the word right now

2071
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:21,359
but uh you know these different micology

2072
01:26:18,399 --> 01:26:24,559
uh pathogens that you might face um

2073
01:26:21,359 --> 01:26:26,639
molds or mildew right? Uh that by

2074
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:30,159
topping your plants early on and

2075
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:32,880
producing more tops for that one pot,

2076
01:26:30,158 --> 01:26:35,759
you have the opportunity to make those

2077
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:38,199
overall top colas a little bit smaller

2078
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:41,840
each. You know, I feel like each plant,

2079
01:26:38,198 --> 01:26:43,519
and this is just anecdotal evidence, but

2080
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:47,520
I feel like each plant has a certain

2081
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:50,239
amount of potential for overall

2082
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:53,679
um yield based on the pot size that

2083
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:57,359
you're using. And if you dedicate all

2084
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:59,920
that um that whole plant into producing

2085
01:26:57,359 --> 01:27:01,599
one cola, you know, where you don't top

2086
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:04,000
the plant, so you still do have side

2087
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:06,239
branching. So it still does kind of

2088
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,479
disperse that energy across a large

2089
01:27:06,238 --> 01:27:10,079
canopy. But if you do have that one top

2090
01:27:08,479 --> 01:27:12,399
cola where it is going in and it's

2091
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:14,238
getting getting like a higher PPFD,

2092
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:16,559
maybe the environment there is a little

2093
01:27:14,238 --> 01:27:18,479
bit more ideal for overall growth and

2094
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:20,800
development, then you're going to get a

2095
01:27:18,479 --> 01:27:22,959
lot larger of a cola. But that's going

2096
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:26,159
to create a lot more potential for

2097
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:28,880
pathogens to get into it and to take

2098
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:30,479
hold and ruin some of the yield. So if

2099
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:32,880
you top your plant and you let that

2100
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:35,198
energy spread out across the canopy so

2101
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:37,440
that all the tops are kind of uniform,

2102
01:27:35,198 --> 01:27:40,559
then you can reduce that by having

2103
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:42,559
smaller buds. And even in some cultivars

2104
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:45,199
in a commercial space, I' I've found

2105
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:48,560
that you get a more desirable morphology

2106
01:27:45,198 --> 01:27:51,119
as well if you spread that energy around

2107
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:53,920
to a lot more upper bud sites rather

2108
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:57,519
than just one large upper bud site and a

2109
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:59,199
bunch of side branches. The only, you

2110
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:02,960
know, the only issue that I've ever

2111
01:27:59,198 --> 01:28:06,839
found with that is that I don't like

2112
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:11,480
topping for um any sort

2113
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:16,480
of any sort of growing style typically

2114
01:28:11,479 --> 01:28:19,599
because if you look at it as a top- down

2115
01:28:16,479 --> 01:28:22,879
sort of planular view of a given canopy

2116
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:26,400
space, if it's completely flat, let's

2117
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:30,239
say in a 4x4 tent, then you of 16 square

2118
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:32,679
ft of canopy that the light is hitting

2119
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:36,000
that you're able to absorb and and

2120
01:28:32,679 --> 01:28:39,679
photosynthesize with as the plants. But

2121
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:42,960
if you have peaks and valleys, so um you

2122
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:44,719
know if you keep those upper colas on

2123
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:46,960
but then you so you'll have almost like

2124
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:49,198
one upper canopy where all let's say you

2125
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:51,679
have nine plants in that 4x4 space. You

2126
01:28:49,198 --> 01:28:53,359
have nine upper colas, right? And then

2127
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:55,679
you have a lower canopy where all the

2128
01:28:53,359 --> 01:28:57,759
side branches kind of came up to. You

2129
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:59,359
have these peaks and valleys. And if you

2130
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:01,280
leave all the leaves on there, then

2131
01:28:59,359 --> 01:29:04,799
technically with those peaks and

2132
01:29:01,279 --> 01:29:08,319
valleys, you're spreading out that 4x4

2133
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:09,760
space into a larger footprint. And I I

2134
01:29:08,319 --> 01:29:13,679
don't have the math in front of me, but

2135
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:16,320
I believe you get about like 1.5 to 1.6

2136
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:18,239
times the overall canopy space. So

2137
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:20,559
rather than being 16 square ft, you

2138
01:29:18,238 --> 01:29:24,399
know, you're like over 20 square feet at

2139
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:25,880
that point of overall um like highly

2140
01:29:24,399 --> 01:29:29,359
photo

2141
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:32,159
synthetically potential um within that

2142
01:29:29,359 --> 01:29:35,119
canopy. So you can increase your overall

2143
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:37,439
yield by doing that by capturing more

2144
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:40,079
photons as they leave the light and

2145
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:42,559
enter the canopy. But like I said

2146
01:29:40,079 --> 01:29:43,880
before, it's very case dependent where

2147
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:46,560
if you

2148
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:48,480
have massive colas that are going to get

2149
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:50,800
rot because let's say you can't control

2150
01:29:48,479 --> 01:29:52,638
part of your environment or it's just

2151
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:55,039
too big and it just always happens or

2152
01:29:52,639 --> 01:29:57,760
there's some genetic potential for

2153
01:29:55,039 --> 01:29:59,760
different pathogens to take hold. Yeah.

2154
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:01,840
That's uh that's where you need to then

2155
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:04,079
potentially top your plants or or do

2156
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:07,199
something to manipulate the canopy to

2157
01:30:04,079 --> 01:30:09,279
create a more uh desirable flower

2158
01:30:07,198 --> 01:30:11,759
structure so that it doesn't have those

2159
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:13,759
potentials for pathogens.

2160
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:17,280
For for this one, I tried it all, my

2161
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:19,119
friend. This this uh this was a a closet

2162
01:30:17,279 --> 01:30:22,599
with six different genetics. So it was

2163
01:30:19,119 --> 01:30:25,519
normal for them to grow different and

2164
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:27,440
um funny enough the younger one the one

2165
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:29,760
that came later because two of them did

2166
01:30:27,439 --> 01:30:32,799
not germinate it. So I decided to bring

2167
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:36,480
the papayas up later on. So she was two

2168
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:39,079
weeks younger than the rest of the room.

2169
01:30:36,479 --> 01:30:41,599
Oh I'm making

2170
01:30:39,079 --> 01:30:43,760
balloons. She was two weeks younger than

2171
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,840
the rest of the room and she was the one

2172
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:49,199
that stretched or that bulk the most and

2173
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:51,760
higher. So I super crop her. I bend her.

2174
01:30:49,198 --> 01:30:53,359
I the scrog net on the top. She she was

2175
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:55,760
talked that I use on the top. I did not

2176
01:30:53,359 --> 01:30:58,399
use for support. I used the scrog net so

2177
01:30:55,760 --> 01:31:00,880
that after making the super crop to hold

2178
01:30:58,399 --> 01:31:03,519
her there because I would super crop and

2179
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:07,600
the next day I would super crop again

2180
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:08,600
and the next day. Yeah. So this one this

2181
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:11,679
particular

2182
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:14,560
one despite topping was growing this

2183
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:17,119
this like this much distance from the

2184
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:20,000
the the LED up there. She was I don't

2185
01:31:17,119 --> 01:31:22,719
know crazy crazy numbers down there and

2186
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:26,119
despite having hair flow she grew colas

2187
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:30,158
like this all of them. Yeah.

2188
01:31:26,119 --> 01:31:32,719
So I don't know if it was and I cannot

2189
01:31:30,158 --> 01:31:35,399
sacrifice the whole room just for that

2190
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:38,239
one. So I had to keep the

2191
01:31:35,399 --> 01:31:39,759
environment at 60% of humidity in my

2192
01:31:38,238 --> 01:31:42,079
case. This is what I like to do in

2193
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:44,560
flower actually. I know it's a risky

2194
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:47,760
thing for pathogens is this and that but

2195
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:50,320
um they like it and if you have no

2196
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:54,159
problems in there I do my whole flowers

2197
01:31:50,319 --> 01:31:56,840
at 60% maybe 55 by the end. Yeah. But I

2198
01:31:54,158 --> 01:32:00,198
don't do like the most do like 50

2199
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:03,279
45 sorry I I start at

2200
01:32:00,198 --> 01:32:07,198
77% relative humidity and then I'll work

2201
01:32:03,279 --> 01:32:09,279
it down over time to 60 55 and finish

2202
01:32:07,198 --> 01:32:11,439
with the daytime humidity being around

2203
01:32:09,279 --> 01:32:14,158
55 and the nighttime humidity being at

2204
01:32:11,439 --> 01:32:18,719
45 or so. Um because I I try to increase

2205
01:32:14,158 --> 01:32:20,559
that temperature differential too. Um

2206
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:23,760
sorry that's another thing I try to do

2207
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:25,679
the most when I can. It's to keep a a

2208
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:27,679
very similar temperature from day and

2209
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:32,158
night. I try to bounce it the least I

2210
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:33,760
can. I find that uh if I get 20 I will

2211
01:32:32,158 --> 01:32:36,799
be talking in Celsius, but I can

2212
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:40,000
actually tell you in Oh, 20 Celsius.

2213
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:43,039
What's that like? Uh 78°

2214
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:46,000
65. Yes. If I have it, let's let's go 24

2215
01:32:43,039 --> 01:32:48,960
because it's a good a good one for for

2216
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:52,158
cannabis to grow. So if I'm at 70, which

2217
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:54,560
is a good good uh temperature, I try to

2218
01:32:52,158 --> 01:32:56,638
keep it I I can only do this in in

2219
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:59,039
summertime. I try to keep it the daytime

2220
01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:01,760
and the night time same temperature.

2221
01:32:59,039 --> 01:33:04,000
Mhm. So if it's 70 at daytime, I will

2222
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:06,320
try and keep it 70 at night time. And in

2223
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:09,119
summertime, I can do this because I grew

2224
01:33:06,319 --> 01:33:12,000
during the night cycle. Sure. meaning

2225
01:33:09,119 --> 01:33:16,119
that daytime it's hot where I live. The

2226
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,119
temperatures goes up to

2227
01:33:16,359 --> 01:33:21,880
uh 90s, hundreds. It's normal to be

2228
01:33:19,039 --> 01:33:25,519
outside about 90s and 100s.

2229
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:27,119
So, they are sleeping and they have the

2230
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:29,040
temperatures from the outside hair that

2231
01:33:27,119 --> 01:33:31,119
comes into the house that keeps it warm.

2232
01:33:29,039 --> 01:33:35,439
So meaning that I c I get to in

2233
01:33:31,119 --> 01:33:39,760
summertime I'm able to grow at about 80

2234
01:33:35,439 --> 01:33:42,158
70 to 80 both day and night time. And I

2235
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:43,960
find out that uh they like that. They

2236
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:46,198
really like that. That's

2237
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:48,560
the that's why I like to grow in

2238
01:33:46,198 --> 01:33:51,079
summertime more than I like to grow in

2239
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:56,480
winter time. It's less humidity first of

2240
01:33:51,079 --> 01:33:59,960
all. And um they grow more uh stable.

2241
01:33:56,479 --> 01:34:01,919
they grow more

2242
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:04,000
beautiful. It's a little bit more

2243
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:06,319
expensive because of the AC that you

2244
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,800
have to run AC still to to keep things

2245
01:34:06,319 --> 01:34:11,439
on balance because um temperatures

2246
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:13,279
sometimes go really high and you cannot

2247
01:34:11,439 --> 01:34:15,759
do that. But then again, if you're

2248
01:34:13,279 --> 01:34:17,359
growing in the night cycle, this means

2249
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:19,760
you have to work at night instead of

2250
01:34:17,359 --> 01:34:22,079
working at day. Yeah. the temperatures

2251
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:24,079
from the night with balance but bounce

2252
01:34:22,079 --> 01:34:26,399
back with the leads with everything and

2253
01:34:24,079 --> 01:34:28,719
we you will create a more stable room

2254
01:34:26,399 --> 01:34:32,399
with less bouncing on temperatures and

2255
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:36,480
on everything. I think it's it's and I

2256
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:38,799
think that uh our medicine specifically

2257
01:34:36,479 --> 01:34:41,158
if she could grow always at the same

2258
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:43,760
temperature and always at the same

2259
01:34:41,158 --> 01:34:45,920
humidity that would be the perfect for

2260
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:48,800
her. I don't know because I could not do

2261
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:50,399
this from seed to harvest ever. Sure.

2262
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:52,960
But this is something that I would

2263
01:34:50,399 --> 01:34:55,439
definitely like to test and if if I had

2264
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:57,439
the meanings to do this,

2265
01:34:55,439 --> 01:34:59,599
I would I would do I would try this

2266
01:34:57,439 --> 01:35:01,960
actually for sure. You know, there's a

2267
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:04,800
lot of um research on temperature

2268
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:07,760
differentials in greenhouse settings

2269
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:09,520
where um with certain flowering plants

2270
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:11,760
and stuff and it it's been proven to

2271
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:13,520
work in cannabis as well, you can run

2272
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:16,480
what's called a negative differential.

2273
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:18,960
Um, so a negative differential being the

2274
01:35:16,479 --> 01:35:21,439
nighttime temperatures are greater than

2275
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:22,880
the daytime temperatures. A neutral

2276
01:35:21,439 --> 01:35:24,158
differential, which is what you're

2277
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:26,319
talking about, where the daytime and

2278
01:35:24,158 --> 01:35:28,158
nighttime temperatures are the same. And

2279
01:35:26,319 --> 01:35:30,158
then a positive differential where the

2280
01:35:28,158 --> 01:35:33,519
daytime temperatures are greater than

2281
01:35:30,158 --> 01:35:35,519
the nighttime temperatures. And so one

2282
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:37,760
thing that has been found with cannabis

2283
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:40,520
is that if you run a negative

2284
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:42,960
differential earlier in the flowering

2285
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:44,480
cycle where the nighttime temperatures

2286
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:46,639
are greater than the daytime

2287
01:35:44,479 --> 01:35:49,919
temperatures, you can actually reduce

2288
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:51,760
the overall stretch that the plant in uh

2289
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:53,199
goes through

2290
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:55,679
when you when you go through that

2291
01:35:53,198 --> 01:35:58,719
stretching bolting phase of the

2292
01:35:55,679 --> 01:36:01,199
flowering period for the plant. Um and

2293
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:04,800
then you know everywhere from that all

2294
01:36:01,198 --> 01:36:07,599
the way to a positive differential can

2295
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:09,159
adjust that stretch on the plant to

2296
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:11,840
where in an

2297
01:36:09,158 --> 01:36:13,719
extreme positive differential where you

2298
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:16,800
have

2299
01:36:13,719 --> 01:36:22,119
10 you have 10° or more in in Fahrenheit

2300
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:24,960
I'm talking uh 10° F then you will

2301
01:36:22,119 --> 01:36:26,719
um that's you you'll increase the

2302
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:29,119
ability for the plant to stretch by

2303
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:31,679
increasing that positive differential.

2304
01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:34,399
Um, so I've used that before in an

2305
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:36,639
indoor setting because I overveged my

2306
01:36:34,399 --> 01:36:38,879
plants, right? And so I had to reduce

2307
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:42,239
the overall stretch because I only had a

2308
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:45,118
certain canopy height that I could um

2309
01:36:42,238 --> 01:36:47,519
safely maintain for the the production

2310
01:36:45,118 --> 01:36:50,719
of those plants. Um, and it it does

2311
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:52,320
work. It's not a perfect thing. It

2312
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:54,239
doesn't there's there's different

2313
01:36:52,319 --> 01:36:57,759
research on it where you can do it for

2314
01:36:54,238 --> 01:37:00,479
like the first 15 or or 30 minutes after

2315
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:03,280
the lights are turned off uh or you know

2316
01:37:00,479 --> 01:37:05,279
initiating the dark period. And then

2317
01:37:03,279 --> 01:37:06,960
there's other research about doing it

2318
01:37:05,279 --> 01:37:10,000
right before the lights come on and

2319
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:12,719
doing this negative differential swing

2320
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:15,039
um but then maintaining a neutral or a

2321
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:18,239
positive differential through a later

2322
01:37:15,039 --> 01:37:19,920
period of the night cycle. Um, so

2323
01:37:18,238 --> 01:37:21,839
there's a lot more research that I feel

2324
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:23,760
like could be done with that as well as

2325
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:26,239
having more people try to apply this

2326
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:28,719
research that is done on other crop

2327
01:37:26,238 --> 01:37:30,879
plants to cannabis where it could

2328
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:34,000
actually help us as home growers and

2329
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:37,039
commercial growers um, you know, take

2330
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,560
advantage of the different seasons and

2331
01:37:37,039 --> 01:37:40,238
different temperatures and different

2332
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:43,119
changes within the environments that

2333
01:37:40,238 --> 01:37:45,919
we're facing. um and try to use them to

2334
01:37:43,118 --> 01:37:50,960
our advantage based on you know

2335
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:53,520
vegetative timing or um uh reduction in

2336
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:56,319
electricity if you can run the AC less

2337
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:58,719
at night or if you can run the heat less

2338
01:37:56,319 --> 01:38:01,519
at the daytime or at night or whatever

2339
01:37:58,719 --> 01:38:02,880
it may be situation is yeah there's

2340
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:06,560
there's a lot there that I feel like

2341
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:08,159
could be applied and I always am I feel

2342
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:11,039
like I'm saying on this podcast a lot

2343
01:38:08,158 --> 01:38:12,479
that you know this is just another crop

2344
01:38:11,039 --> 01:38:14,880
plant, you know, it's just another

2345
01:38:12,479 --> 01:38:16,799
agricultural product and we should

2346
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:19,760
definitely be looking at the research

2347
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:22,639
that's done for other agriculture and

2348
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:24,960
how it can apply to us rather than just

2349
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:27,679
trying to separate cannabis out

2350
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:30,399
completely because it is, you know, our

2351
01:38:27,679 --> 01:38:33,039
special plant. It's our special plant

2352
01:38:30,399 --> 01:38:34,799
indeed. It can take a little bit higher

2353
01:38:33,039 --> 01:38:36,719
numbers than most of the plants can

2354
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:39,039
take. And that's why people I think put

2355
01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:41,079
it in a special because if most of

2356
01:38:39,039 --> 01:38:44,079
plants can take 800

2357
01:38:41,079 --> 01:38:46,559
PPFD our plant can go up thousands and

2358
01:38:44,079 --> 01:38:48,559
something if they can eat this but their

2359
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:51,520
own plants in the end there seeds that

2360
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:53,840
grows and they'll take care. Take for

2361
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:55,800
instance tomatoes. I grow tomatoes the

2362
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:58,960
same way I grow

2363
01:38:55,800 --> 01:39:00,880
wheat. I I plant them and then I clean I

2364
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:03,039
clean the bottoms and I leave the plant

2365
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:04,880
grows up. And once the plant is up, I I

2366
01:39:03,039 --> 01:39:07,679
just I just let it grow. So it's pretty

2367
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:10,159
much the same as as we grows better. I

2368
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:12,239
find out that if I let it grow all over

2369
01:39:10,158 --> 01:39:16,238
the place that I don't have as many good

2370
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:18,158
tomatoes as I would have y and I find

2371
01:39:16,238 --> 01:39:20,399
myself with the problems that the same

2372
01:39:18,158 --> 01:39:22,479
problems that I have in here, which is

2373
01:39:20,399 --> 01:39:24,238
poor air flow, there is no light

2374
01:39:22,479 --> 01:39:28,079
penetration. there's this and that's

2375
01:39:24,238 --> 01:39:30,959
bringing me problems later on. But, uh,

2376
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:33,198
our plant is definitely special. She she

2377
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:36,158
can take some pretty damn high numbers

2378
01:39:33,198 --> 01:39:38,879
on everything, man. It's it's on food,

2379
01:39:36,158 --> 01:39:41,279
on PPFD, on I mean then the amount of

2380
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:44,000
photons that this girl can take, it's

2381
01:39:41,279 --> 01:39:45,759
crazy. But then again,

2382
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,639
you go outside in the sun in the middle

2383
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:50,880
of the day and you take your PPFD matter

2384
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:53,118
and the numbers are crazy and all the

2385
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:55,520
other plants are growing still, but you

2386
01:39:53,118 --> 01:39:57,839
do those numbers for them plants inside

2387
01:39:55,520 --> 01:40:00,159
of a greenhouse and you kill them all.

2388
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:04,000
Yeah.

2389
01:40:00,158 --> 01:40:05,920
Yeah. Nice. So, it's a unique plant in

2390
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:09,118
in certain ways, but it definitely does

2391
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:11,840
what other plants do. And uh yeah, we

2392
01:40:09,118 --> 01:40:13,759
shouldn't just try to limit ourselves to

2393
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:15,760
only what applies to cannabis through a

2394
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:17,840
cannabis lens. We should try to

2395
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:20,239
definitely look at it as as growers

2396
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:21,840
overall. Um because we can grow so many

2397
01:40:20,238 --> 01:40:24,079
different things with the same methods

2398
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:26,239
that we use for cannabis. And we can

2399
01:40:24,079 --> 01:40:28,399
improve our growing of cannabis by using

2400
01:40:26,238 --> 01:40:31,919
the same methods we use for other plants

2401
01:40:28,399 --> 01:40:34,000
as well. Um so, you know, I feel like

2402
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:37,600
this is a great place to start wrapping

2403
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:39,600
up the show a little bit. Um, one one of

2404
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:42,400
the questions that I did want to make

2405
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:44,239
sure that I ask you though is, you know,

2406
01:40:42,399 --> 01:40:46,479
for anybody that's watching this video

2407
01:40:44,238 --> 01:40:49,919
on YouTube, they'll notice that dog

2408
01:40:46,479 --> 01:40:51,718
doctor is wearing a mask to protect his

2409
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:55,199
identity.

2410
01:40:51,719 --> 01:40:57,760
And you know, we have a lot of listeners

2411
01:40:55,198 --> 01:41:01,439
in the US, but we do have listeners in

2412
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:03,760
the different uh countries of Europe as

2413
01:41:01,439 --> 01:41:05,279
well as um I I know that I've seen

2414
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:07,920
through some of the analytics we have

2415
01:41:05,279 --> 01:41:11,639
some viewers in Australia and South

2416
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:13,840
America and in South Africa.

2417
01:41:11,639 --> 01:41:15,840
And you know, there's a lot of different

2418
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:17,440
places in the world where cannabis is

2419
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:19,840
still

2420
01:41:17,439 --> 01:41:23,599
um not even just regulated, but fully

2421
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:26,920
illegal. and punishable by some severe

2422
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:29,679
yeah severe laws and legislation.

2423
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:32,480
And um you know coming from your

2424
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:35,118
perspective with with all that in mind,

2425
01:41:32,479 --> 01:41:37,399
where would you like to see change in

2426
01:41:35,118 --> 01:41:40,479
the cannabis community and the cannabis

2427
01:41:37,399 --> 01:41:43,839
industry and um you know just kind of

2428
01:41:40,479 --> 01:41:46,638
that that overarching

2429
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:49,360
uh group that is cannabis users,

2430
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:51,600
growers, and uh people that are

2431
01:41:49,359 --> 01:41:53,920
involved.

2432
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:56,079
I would love first of all I would love

2433
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:59,359
for this plant to be discriminalized all

2434
01:41:56,079 --> 01:42:01,760
over the place because uh it makes no

2435
01:41:59,359 --> 01:42:04,839
sense that people go to jail for a

2436
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:08,639
plants in my mind but

2437
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:10,719
uh in its natural state it's not like

2438
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:12,319
okay cocaine comes from no cocaine does

2439
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:14,319
not came from a plant comes from a plant

2440
01:42:12,319 --> 01:42:17,439
and from a chemical thing with this that

2441
01:42:14,319 --> 01:42:20,000
and that and they make it this is just

2442
01:42:17,439 --> 01:42:22,799
something that God gives us it grows you

2443
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:25,118
harvest for it's it's like a tomato it's

2444
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:26,719
like anything else so for the first I

2445
01:42:25,118 --> 01:42:29,198
would love to see this happening all

2446
01:42:26,719 --> 01:42:31,439
over the world which I will believe that

2447
01:42:29,198 --> 01:42:34,519
it will happen eventually but it still

2448
01:42:31,439 --> 01:42:38,000
will take time for this to to

2449
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:40,880
happen and I would like to see people to

2450
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:44,399
take up the step of even if it is mask

2451
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:46,480
like I am with a mask I know but people

2452
01:42:44,399 --> 01:42:48,719
need to be more open and need to be to

2453
01:42:46,479 --> 01:42:52,319
to talk with each other more about this

2454
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:54,319
plant and uh demystify it. Does I don't

2455
01:42:52,319 --> 01:42:57,559
know if the word exists. Demystify.

2456
01:42:54,319 --> 01:43:00,679
Yeah. Demystified what

2457
01:42:57,560 --> 01:43:02,880
uh they did really good

2458
01:43:00,679 --> 01:43:07,359
mystifying because if you really think

2459
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:09,920
about it 60 17 years ago this plant was

2460
01:43:07,359 --> 01:43:12,000
just a plant. Some people would smoke

2461
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:14,239
it, other would not but it was not a

2462
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:16,319
crime. And then with the hippie

2463
01:43:14,238 --> 01:43:19,118
selection and all the story that we all

2464
01:43:16,319 --> 01:43:21,439
know came the free vision cames this and

2465
01:43:19,118 --> 01:43:24,319
all the propaganda and they make it look

2466
01:43:21,439 --> 01:43:25,678
like most of the world right now like my

2467
01:43:24,319 --> 01:43:28,880
if you go and talk with the generation

2468
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:31,199
of my parents and my grandma they think

2469
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:32,880
of this as something really bad and

2470
01:43:31,198 --> 01:43:35,599
something because they painted in the

2471
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:37,359
really dark. This is the getaway drug to

2472
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:39,520
this. This is the start for that and

2473
01:43:37,359 --> 01:43:42,639
this is nothing of that. This is

2474
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:44,800
something that we all have inside of us.

2475
01:43:42,639 --> 01:43:46,800
We have an endocanabinoid system. We

2476
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:48,880
don't have a cocaine or metaphamino or

2477
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:50,960
whatever system. No, this is something

2478
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:52,239
bad or whatever. Everybody can do

2479
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:55,198
whatever they want. But I believe it's

2480
01:43:52,238 --> 01:43:57,359
bad. This plant is not bad. It's here.

2481
01:43:55,198 --> 01:43:59,599
It can be used in a bad way. Like

2482
01:43:57,359 --> 01:44:01,359
everything, anything can be used in a

2483
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:03,679
bad way. But this is not here to make us

2484
01:44:01,359 --> 01:44:07,839
bad. It's here to help us. And I would

2485
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:10,239
love to see people be more open and

2486
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:12,960
going online. The mask came from the GML

2487
01:44:10,238 --> 01:44:14,879
show. And uh I was going and covering

2488
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:17,520
the camera each time I go and I think I

2489
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:20,560
need to find a solution so that I can

2490
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:23,440
speak more openly but still show and if

2491
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:28,159
my face not coming. So I found at the

2492
01:44:23,439 --> 01:44:30,158
time uh sat mas mask from a dog because

2493
01:44:28,158 --> 01:44:32,638
my name was dog doctor and I start

2494
01:44:30,158 --> 01:44:34,799
wearing that and after a while I

2495
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:37,279
realized that I needed something more

2496
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:40,000
not so I don't know something better

2497
01:44:37,279 --> 01:44:42,559
looking to my mind and and I get this

2498
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:44,560
which which allows me to come like with

2499
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:46,560
you on a podcast for instance and be

2500
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:49,320
talking and sharing my experience and I

2501
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:52,840
I really think that people

2502
01:44:49,319 --> 01:44:56,960
should lose the scare because the most

2503
01:44:52,840 --> 01:45:00,279
people that do things like we do, the

2504
01:44:56,960 --> 01:45:04,079
more normal it becames and the the the

2505
01:45:00,279 --> 01:45:06,319
faster we will have this available for

2506
01:45:04,079 --> 01:45:08,679
everybody. I don't I by all means I

2507
01:45:06,319 --> 01:45:10,679
don't believe that cannabis is for

2508
01:45:08,679 --> 01:45:14,399
everybody. Not at

2509
01:45:10,679 --> 01:45:15,399
all. But I I do believe that not having

2510
01:45:14,399 --> 01:45:20,079
an

2511
01:45:15,399 --> 01:45:22,679
option, it's not a good thing. So yeah,

2512
01:45:20,079 --> 01:45:25,279
there's nobody died with from from from

2513
01:45:22,679 --> 01:45:27,118
weeds. I mean, now with the extractions

2514
01:45:25,279 --> 01:45:28,559
and all the abuses under foot, I'm

2515
01:45:27,118 --> 01:45:30,399
pretty sure that pretty soon we will

2516
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:32,080
have somebody died from not directly

2517
01:45:30,399 --> 01:45:34,638
from the weed because you need like 5

2518
01:45:32,079 --> 01:45:35,639
kilos of THC or something to for your

2519
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:38,560
body to

2520
01:45:35,639 --> 01:45:40,400
collapse. But uh the same way alcohol

2521
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:43,199
you can drink and drive and have an

2522
01:45:40,399 --> 01:45:45,679
accident, they will blame wheat somehow

2523
01:45:43,198 --> 01:45:47,519
on the aspects on this. But she's not

2524
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:49,600
really the problem. The problem is we

2525
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:52,960
make it the problem. We should be

2526
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:54,800
talking more openly about it and be more

2527
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:57,760
receptive about it. And I believe that

2528
01:45:54,800 --> 01:46:00,239
this will happen when people not came

2529
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:03,119
out of the closet. It is maybe not a

2530
01:46:00,238 --> 01:46:06,638
good word for it. Uh but when people

2531
01:46:03,118 --> 01:46:09,039
start to be open to at least understand

2532
01:46:06,639 --> 01:46:11,000
it and this is happening now with the

2533
01:46:09,039 --> 01:46:14,560
legalization happening all over the

2534
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:16,238
place. You have uh people that okay

2535
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:18,400
there's little children's actually

2536
01:46:16,238 --> 01:46:21,118
taking this there's this that if they're

2537
01:46:18,399 --> 01:46:23,039
giving this to a children with epilepsy

2538
01:46:21,118 --> 01:46:26,000
and it's actually helping this cannot be

2539
01:46:23,039 --> 01:46:28,479
that bad of a thing and things are

2540
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:31,118
opening but I I definitely encourage if

2541
01:46:28,479 --> 01:46:33,039
people are not shy to a point that they

2542
01:46:31,118 --> 01:46:35,679
don't mind talking they should

2543
01:46:33,039 --> 01:46:37,679
definitely go out and uh check out the

2544
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:40,239
forums because we have a huge online

2545
01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:41,679
community right now out and there's one

2546
01:46:40,238 --> 01:46:44,158
one thing that I love about this

2547
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:46,639
community. It's a very open community.

2548
01:46:44,158 --> 01:46:49,599
Yeah. So once you start talking, people

2549
01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:52,400
will talk back to you. It's not it's not

2550
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:53,679
like it's not like if you go for a

2551
01:46:52,399 --> 01:46:56,719
kitchen for instance for if you're

2552
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:59,359
working in the kitchens chefs they talk

2553
01:46:56,719 --> 01:47:01,118
but they don't share secrets.

2554
01:46:59,359 --> 01:47:03,519
You know what I mean? It's it's my my

2555
01:47:01,118 --> 01:47:04,880
secret, my family secret. It's my p I'm

2556
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:06,400
not telling you because after a while

2557
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:07,719
you will open your restaurant and I will

2558
01:47:06,399 --> 01:47:12,000
lose my sort

2559
01:47:07,719 --> 01:47:13,920
of and there is of course there is in if

2560
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,600
you work in big facilities probably

2561
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:19,039
there's the secret for the facility this

2562
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:21,440
and that but in general speaking we are

2563
01:47:19,039 --> 01:47:24,238
very open mind on sharing our knowledge

2564
01:47:21,439 --> 01:47:27,759
or on sharing uh our mistakes our

2565
01:47:24,238 --> 01:47:30,158
lessons our our learnings and this makes

2566
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:32,800
this community a very special one in

2567
01:47:30,158 --> 01:47:36,079
terms of possibilities on of growing and

2568
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:39,199
of becoming a wider thing than it is

2569
01:47:36,079 --> 01:47:41,279
right now. So, I definitely encourage

2570
01:47:39,198 --> 01:47:43,198
people to

2571
01:47:41,279 --> 01:47:45,198
to don't be afraid of being themselves.

2572
01:47:43,198 --> 01:47:48,158
I don't want them to be lying or to be

2573
01:47:45,198 --> 01:47:50,519
somebody else because I I think there's

2574
01:47:48,158 --> 01:47:53,039
too many people so for us to be

2575
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:56,000
them. But this is if this is something

2576
01:47:53,039 --> 01:47:58,560
that you like, talk about it with your

2577
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:02,158
friends, with your family. don't uh

2578
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:05,039
dismify it and uh help us all to get

2579
01:48:02,158 --> 01:48:08,238
this plant available to who may or may

2580
01:48:05,039 --> 01:48:10,000
not need because by all means I I have

2581
01:48:08,238 --> 01:48:11,759
friends of mine that cannot smoke weed.

2582
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:14,479
They get the paranoia, they get this,

2583
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:15,239
they get that. And I actually think it's

2584
01:48:14,479 --> 01:48:17,519
the

2585
01:48:15,238 --> 01:48:19,279
genetics. If you get the paranoia,

2586
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:20,719
there's probably some different genetic

2587
01:48:19,279 --> 01:48:23,118
for you that will work for your

2588
01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:26,000
endocanabonoid system. But again, it's

2589
01:48:23,118 --> 01:48:29,279
not for also this this is a different

2590
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:31,439
tip. I agree. I like my mom gets anxiety

2591
01:48:29,279 --> 01:48:33,599
from smoking anything with a high THC

2592
01:48:31,439 --> 01:48:36,238
content in it. But if she has a CBD

2593
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:38,639
gummy or an edible, then she's extremely

2594
01:48:36,238 --> 01:48:41,519
happy with the, you know, the results of

2595
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:43,440
of that. And um I've I've met plenty of

2596
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:46,000
other people that, you know, cannabis

2597
01:48:43,439 --> 01:48:48,319
just isn't for them. But, you know,

2598
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:50,960
that's no reason to maintain a stigma

2599
01:48:48,319 --> 01:48:52,639
towards people who use cannabis. Uh just

2600
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:54,639
as you wouldn't necessarily judge

2601
01:48:52,639 --> 01:48:57,359
someone for having a glass of wine or a

2602
01:48:54,639 --> 01:48:58,480
beer after you know, at the end of a day

2603
01:48:57,359 --> 01:49:01,519
while they're eating dinner or

2604
01:48:58,479 --> 01:49:04,158
something, you shouldn't uh be judging

2605
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:05,760
or or retaining that stigma towards

2606
01:49:04,158 --> 01:49:07,679
people who are using cannabis in the

2607
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:09,360
same in the same way. But like you said,

2608
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:11,520
it can be abused just like anything

2609
01:49:09,359 --> 01:49:14,319
else. You know, food can be abused,

2610
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:15,920
right? We have uh um all sorts of

2611
01:49:14,319 --> 01:49:18,319
different ways that people abuse things

2612
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:19,920
in life. So, you know, moderation, I

2613
01:49:18,319 --> 01:49:22,399
guess, would be a good thing to to put

2614
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:25,600
in there, but also understanding your

2615
01:49:22,399 --> 01:49:27,679
limitations and and using, you know, uh

2616
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:29,840
a cultivar or a strain of cannabis that

2617
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:32,158
works for you with the correct um

2618
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:33,360
cannabonoid and tarpine profile. all

2619
01:49:32,158 --> 01:49:36,599
these different things they you know

2620
01:49:33,359 --> 01:49:39,279
they they require so much more uh

2621
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:42,480
research on on the part of those who are

2622
01:49:39,279 --> 01:49:44,800
producing these products as well as um

2623
01:49:42,479 --> 01:49:46,799
understanding and research on the

2624
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:48,960
consumer's end of things where they they

2625
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:52,480
can try to find what works best for

2626
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:54,439
them. Um, yeah, I think that that that's

2627
01:49:52,479 --> 01:49:56,678
a great sentiment to have that, you

2628
01:49:54,439 --> 01:50:00,000
know, allowing for

2629
01:49:56,679 --> 01:50:02,359
more access in different parts of the

2630
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:05,198
world and and giving people an

2631
01:50:02,359 --> 01:50:07,759
opportunity to learn more about this

2632
01:50:05,198 --> 01:50:10,079
plant. Um yeah, you know, like that's

2633
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:12,800
why the show is called The Way We Grow

2634
01:50:10,079 --> 01:50:15,319
because I want to make sure that people

2635
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:18,239
um hear these different stories of

2636
01:50:15,319 --> 01:50:21,439
growers so that the community itself can

2637
01:50:18,238 --> 01:50:23,839
grow and become more knowledgeable and

2638
01:50:21,439 --> 01:50:25,839
have the ability to share that knowledge

2639
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:28,480
with people and show that there are just

2640
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:32,239
a lot of different,

2641
01:50:28,479 --> 01:50:34,399
you know, unique and and normal people

2642
01:50:32,238 --> 01:50:37,678
that use cannabis and that grow cannabis

2643
01:50:34,399 --> 01:50:39,519
and that are part of this world. Um, so

2644
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:43,039
I think I think that's a great answer.

2645
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:45,600
So, thank you so much. And we do just

2646
01:50:43,039 --> 01:50:48,079
have a couple of quick wrap-up questions

2647
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:51,600
that I always like to add in. So, what's

2648
01:50:48,079 --> 01:50:54,960
your favorite strain of all time?

2649
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:58,239
And I feel that that one has a no right

2650
01:50:54,960 --> 01:51:00,480
answer because I'm in a constant looking

2651
01:50:58,238 --> 01:51:02,079
for that run that I talked to you about.

2652
01:51:00,479 --> 01:51:04,638
It's something that it's still here in

2653
01:51:02,079 --> 01:51:06,719
my mind. So, it's definitely something

2654
01:51:04,639 --> 01:51:09,600
that I'm I'm looking for that unicorn

2655
01:51:06,719 --> 01:51:11,520
again. And maybe I find it, maybe I not.

2656
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:13,920
There was something special on the the

2657
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:16,320
passion fruit turppins in the in in that

2658
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:18,000
plant that uh I still think about it

2659
01:51:16,319 --> 01:51:19,079
today. So, it's probably among my

2660
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,840
favorites,

2661
01:51:19,079 --> 01:51:24,639
but I don't like to say I have a

2662
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:26,480
favorite for a single reason. I like to

2663
01:51:24,639 --> 01:51:28,560
have different jars with different

2664
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:32,319
varieties, different effects, different

2665
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:34,239
flavors. And I see this as as food. If

2666
01:51:32,319 --> 01:51:35,759
I'm eating bread every day, I'm gonna

2667
01:51:34,238 --> 01:51:37,759
get nauseous of eating bread. If I'm

2668
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:39,760
eating sausage, it's it's going to be

2669
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:41,599
the same with that. It's so and I like

2670
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:44,400
to eat in the same way I like to smoke.

2671
01:51:41,599 --> 01:51:46,000
So, I will need different effects. I

2672
01:51:44,399 --> 01:51:49,519
will need different paladars. I will

2673
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:52,079
need different everything. So, variety

2674
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:55,360
spice of life. Exactly. Depending on my

2675
01:51:52,079 --> 01:51:57,279
mood, on my day, I may need something

2676
01:51:55,359 --> 01:52:00,000
that it's couch locking or I may need

2677
01:51:57,279 --> 01:52:02,118
something that inspire me for me to grow

2678
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:05,639
and work and do whatever.

2679
01:52:02,118 --> 01:52:08,559
So I don't have a favorite. I have I

2680
01:52:05,639 --> 01:52:12,319
like it's not even more sativas because

2681
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:13,840
this is bro talk because but for the

2682
01:52:12,319 --> 01:52:16,000
general people they call it sativa or

2683
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:18,400
indicate effect which is which is not

2684
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:20,880
true because there's sativas super heavy

2685
01:52:18,399 --> 01:52:24,479
and there's indicas super super in

2686
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:27,118
spirals. So I like sativas for the day

2687
01:52:24,479 --> 01:52:30,319
sort of speaking the the the high

2688
01:52:27,118 --> 01:52:31,399
lifting and for working and I like uh

2689
01:52:30,319 --> 01:52:33,759
the

2690
01:52:31,399 --> 01:52:35,920
hindicas not indicas again but the the

2691
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:40,320
the couch lock for the night time and

2692
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:42,480
for relaxation. Absolutely. That that's

2693
01:52:40,319 --> 01:52:44,319
that's a great answer. I'm, you know,

2694
01:52:42,479 --> 01:52:46,718
I'm also in the same mindset of it's

2695
01:52:44,319 --> 01:52:48,479
hard to pick one strain that's your

2696
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:50,880
favorite because there's, you know,

2697
01:52:48,479 --> 01:52:53,678
there's I'm I'm always trying new ones

2698
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:55,599
and so it's hard to say that one was my

2699
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:57,520
favorite. I do, you know, look back in

2700
01:52:55,599 --> 01:53:00,639
the past and think of things that I

2701
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:05,280
really enjoyed that I kind of reminisce

2702
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:08,000
upon and wish that I had again. But I

2703
01:53:05,279 --> 01:53:09,599
think that that's just me uh you know,

2704
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:13,920
looking through looking at the past

2705
01:53:09,599 --> 01:53:15,920
three rosecolored glasses. Yeah. Um so,

2706
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:18,480
you know, the next question of course is

2707
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:21,279
going to be probably just as difficult,

2708
01:53:18,479 --> 01:53:24,279
but who is your favorite breeder of all

2709
01:53:21,279 --> 01:53:24,279
time?

2710
01:53:26,279 --> 01:53:29,279
Damn.

2711
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:36,960
Damn. That's a hard one. I mean, I like

2712
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:39,840
uh I like humbled the humble seed

2713
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:42,480
companies, they have a real, but this is

2714
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:45,279
because they look for turppins more than

2715
01:53:42,479 --> 01:53:48,079
they look for poty in their genetics.

2716
01:53:45,279 --> 01:53:50,000
So, every seed that I pop from them, it

2717
01:53:48,079 --> 01:53:52,399
was always almost like a keeper. I

2718
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:55,920
cannot keep them, but uh they're all

2719
01:53:52,399 --> 01:53:58,000
good. Cool. So, if I have to go for one,

2720
01:53:55,920 --> 01:54:00,399
I actually would go for that one because

2721
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,399
it was the one from the the the

2722
01:54:00,399 --> 01:54:05,198
everything that I tried from them. I

2723
01:54:02,399 --> 01:54:08,479
never had a bad uh a bad seed in there.

2724
01:54:05,198 --> 01:54:10,158
All of the rest, most of them, I didn't

2725
01:54:08,479 --> 01:54:11,439
like this or I didn't like that or

2726
01:54:10,158 --> 01:54:13,679
something. There's always something

2727
01:54:11,439 --> 01:54:17,598
happening there. And they were the more

2728
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:22,279
stable ones. in autoflower. I I have to

2729
01:54:17,599 --> 01:54:25,920
go to fast buds. Honestly, they are by

2730
01:54:22,279 --> 01:54:29,039
far but by far the best autoflowers I

2731
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:30,719
grew and I tried a bunch of different

2732
01:54:29,039 --> 01:54:32,800
seed banks and I'm not supposeding for

2733
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:34,198
them or anything. I'm this is just my

2734
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:36,639
personal

2735
01:54:34,198 --> 01:54:39,039
opinion and they are very therapy

2736
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:40,800
plants. They're doing something there.

2737
01:54:39,039 --> 01:54:44,158
The breeding they're doing it's it's

2738
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:46,400
they're doing and they are very stable.

2739
01:54:44,158 --> 01:54:48,158
you grow like the blackberry. It's one

2740
01:54:46,399 --> 01:54:51,198
of my favorites from them. It's very

2741
01:54:48,158 --> 01:54:54,319
peculiar one. It's it's almost like a

2742
01:54:51,198 --> 01:54:57,279
syrup mixed with fruits, but at the same

2743
01:54:54,319 --> 01:54:59,399
time has like this backstage of a on it.

2744
01:54:57,279 --> 01:55:02,559
I cannot really explain. It's really

2745
01:54:59,399 --> 01:55:04,719
unique. And each time I grow, the plant

2746
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:06,960
grows exactly the same. So, I have a

2747
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:09,198
feeling that if I grew 100 of them in a

2748
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:10,560
room, there will be like three or four

2749
01:55:09,198 --> 01:55:12,519
that would be different, which is

2750
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:16,000
normal. And

2751
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:17,760
um others don't do that. I grow now I

2752
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,359
grow a banana in six months. I grow the

2753
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:21,199
banana but it's taking like tangerine.

2754
01:55:19,359 --> 01:55:24,000
It's no longer the banana. Yeah. And

2755
01:55:21,198 --> 01:55:27,439
fast buds in in that terms they are they

2756
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:28,639
are really amazing. Cut to that for

2757
01:55:27,439 --> 01:55:30,638
sure. I I don't grow a lot of

2758
01:55:28,639 --> 01:55:31,639
autoflowers but I have grown fast buds

2759
01:55:30,639 --> 01:55:35,440
before

2760
01:55:31,639 --> 01:55:37,199
and they weren't bad. Um I just I never

2761
01:55:35,439 --> 01:55:39,439
liked auto flowers personally because if

2762
01:55:37,198 --> 01:55:41,359
I find something that's really good it

2763
01:55:39,439 --> 01:55:43,839
it's just so hard to find it again.

2764
01:55:41,359 --> 01:55:46,238
Yeah. And you can't keep it around. Um

2765
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:48,039
but you know if if you find a company or

2766
01:55:46,238 --> 01:55:50,559
a breeder that is

2767
01:55:48,039 --> 01:55:52,880
doing you know good work and and

2768
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:55,199
creating stable genetics where you can

2769
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:57,039
at least you know sift through maybe a

2770
01:55:55,198 --> 01:55:59,678
few different phenotypes for your your

2771
01:55:57,039 --> 01:56:02,079
setting. Um then you know maybe it is

2772
01:55:59,679 --> 01:56:04,079
worth it for whatever it is that you

2773
01:56:02,079 --> 01:56:06,158
might need it for. out of flowers. If

2774
01:56:04,079 --> 01:56:07,800
you're running for instance a perpetual

2775
01:56:06,158 --> 01:56:10,960
and you have

2776
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:13,760
always 24 or 18 hours place to place

2777
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:16,480
lights, why not put another flower there

2778
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:18,320
and you have a harvest in between. Sure.

2779
01:56:16,479 --> 01:56:19,919
Before they didn't have the turpps. Now

2780
01:56:18,319 --> 01:56:23,039
they are getting the turppies. They they

2781
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:26,399
getting good. So then it's in a taste.

2782
01:56:23,039 --> 01:56:27,760
But this not being able to keep a clone.

2783
01:56:26,399 --> 01:56:30,598
It's one of the things that in the

2784
01:56:27,760 --> 01:56:33,280
beginning on the other flowers was crazy

2785
01:56:30,599 --> 01:56:34,960
because I always clone and now I cannot

2786
01:56:33,279 --> 01:56:36,399
clone. Okay. So, I like this and the

2787
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:38,880
next season will not be this. That's

2788
01:56:36,399 --> 01:56:40,960
that's a unicorn. I feel you on that one

2789
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:43,279
completely. True unicorn cuz you can't

2790
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:45,118
find it again. Yeah. Um All right. Well,

2791
01:56:43,279 --> 01:56:49,800
last question. What's your most

2792
01:56:45,118 --> 01:56:49,799
memorable cannabis related experience?

2793
01:56:50,719 --> 01:56:54,880
you when you mean most memorable is the

2794
01:56:53,118 --> 01:56:57,359
one that when I think about something

2795
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:59,359
that happens that that memory comes it

2796
01:56:57,359 --> 01:57:02,158
was the one of the first times I ever

2797
01:56:59,359 --> 01:57:04,960
smoke super skunk okay it was not even

2798
01:57:02,158 --> 01:57:07,198
skunk was super skunk and it was the

2799
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:10,239
first time I realized in my life I was

2800
01:57:07,198 --> 01:57:11,399
about 17 maybe I don't know the age but

2801
01:57:10,238 --> 01:57:15,118
it

2802
01:57:11,399 --> 01:57:18,638
was around there and it was the I smoke

2803
01:57:15,118 --> 01:57:20,880
it and other weeds and other things that

2804
01:57:18,639 --> 01:57:22,719
I would smoke. You finished the the

2805
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:24,440
joints and you would feel it. And I

2806
01:57:22,719 --> 01:57:28,000
smoke and I didn't feel nothing. Oh,

2807
01:57:24,439 --> 01:57:29,598
[ __ ] I made another one. Nothing. I

2808
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:33,039
grabbed the rest of it and I make the

2809
01:57:29,599 --> 01:57:36,520
big fat one. And about half an hour

2810
01:57:33,039 --> 01:57:40,719
after that last one, I found

2811
01:57:36,520 --> 01:57:42,800
myself tripping like on acid, man. But

2812
01:57:40,719 --> 01:57:46,319
but really on acid. And at the times, I

2813
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:48,960
would from time to time take some acid.

2814
01:57:46,319 --> 01:57:50,719
And I I really it's it's people would

2815
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:52,480
come, are you okay, dog? Dog, are you

2816
01:57:50,719 --> 01:57:54,319
okay? No, no, man. I'm okay. I'm okay.

2817
01:57:52,479 --> 01:57:56,559
But just leave me here. And this was the

2818
01:57:54,319 --> 01:57:59,359
most intensive and it was the first time

2819
01:57:56,560 --> 01:58:02,639
ever that I realize that this is a

2820
01:57:59,359 --> 01:58:04,799
sacred plant. This is not here for us to

2821
01:58:02,639 --> 01:58:07,599
it is here for us to play and for us to

2822
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:10,119
please us, but it's also here to teach

2823
01:58:07,599 --> 01:58:13,520
us and to it's a serious plant. It's

2824
01:58:10,118 --> 01:58:16,639
it's and this was when I real and in

2825
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:20,400
from that moment on I believe that was

2826
01:58:16,639 --> 01:58:24,560
when I start respecting the plant as a

2827
01:58:20,399 --> 01:58:26,598
plant as a being has being part of us.

2828
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:29,039
Until then it was just something for

2829
01:58:26,599 --> 01:58:31,279
fun. It was just there. It was

2830
01:58:29,039 --> 01:58:34,158
recreational. It was this. And from that

2831
01:58:31,279 --> 01:58:35,920
point on I realized it's not just that

2832
01:58:34,158 --> 01:58:37,519
because it can take me places. It can

2833
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:39,800
make me see things. It can make me

2834
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:43,599
realize things.

2835
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:45,599
So, it's got to be sacred.

2836
01:58:43,599 --> 01:58:47,679
Are you sure? No, I mean that's a that's

2837
01:58:45,599 --> 01:58:51,599
a pretty powerful experience to have

2838
01:58:47,679 --> 01:58:54,158
where you know the sort of those um time

2839
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:56,039
delayed responses that some strains can

2840
01:58:54,158 --> 01:58:59,279
have and then if you do end up over

2841
01:58:56,039 --> 01:59:01,198
consuming you can have a very profound

2842
01:58:59,279 --> 01:59:03,679
experience that is going to leave a

2843
01:59:01,198 --> 01:59:06,079
lasting impression. So, I can totally

2844
01:59:03,679 --> 01:59:08,079
understand how that kind of changed your

2845
01:59:06,079 --> 01:59:10,719
perspective of the plant at the time.

2846
01:59:08,079 --> 01:59:12,158
That's really cool.

2847
01:59:10,719 --> 01:59:14,000
Yeah. Well, this has been an awesome

2848
01:59:12,158 --> 01:59:16,559
conversation, Dog Doctor. I really

2849
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:18,880
appreciate you joining me on the podcast

2850
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:22,159
today and telling more of your story so

2851
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:25,520
that more people can get out there uh

2852
01:59:22,158 --> 01:59:27,359
and grow their own plants or, you know,

2853
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:30,239
participate in this community in their

2854
01:59:27,359 --> 01:59:31,920
own way. Um, but you know, telling

2855
01:59:30,238 --> 01:59:36,158
stories like yours where you are still

2856
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:38,880
in a state or a state, a country that is

2857
01:59:36,158 --> 01:59:41,198
uh prohibitive on the use as well as the

2858
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:43,279
growing of this plant. And being able to

2859
01:59:41,198 --> 01:59:47,919
come on here and tell your story is

2860
01:59:43,279 --> 01:59:50,960
extremely uh it's brave, but also so

2861
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:54,560
necessary for us to be able to continue

2862
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:56,800
to grow this community. And um like I

2863
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:58,560
always say, that's the way we grow. So

2864
01:59:56,800 --> 02:00:01,119
again, thank you so much. I really

2865
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:03,039
appreciate it. No, I'm the one that

2866
02:00:01,118 --> 02:00:05,759
appreciate love you having me here and

2867
02:00:03,039 --> 02:00:07,439
everybody. And if you in Europe, uh, let

2868
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:10,079
me just bring up. I don't know when this

2869
02:00:07,439 --> 02:00:12,279
will go on air, but I'm doing a mini

2870
02:00:10,079 --> 02:00:15,039
cup. So if

2871
02:00:12,279 --> 02:00:17,840
you just want to grow some European

2872
02:00:15,039 --> 02:00:20,399
seeds, I will be sending some nutrients

2873
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:22,400
and some seeds and some groove bags to

2874
02:00:20,399 --> 02:00:25,118
give everybody the same chance. I want

2875
02:00:22,399 --> 02:00:27,359
to be I want to to to make this not the

2876
02:00:25,118 --> 02:00:30,319
traditional cup where you find the final

2877
02:00:27,359 --> 02:00:32,238
product is what it matters for me. This

2878
02:00:30,319 --> 02:00:33,759
will be the journey the the evaluation

2879
02:00:32,238 --> 02:00:35,598
will be on the journey because I'm

2880
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:37,840
giving everybody the same chance the

2881
02:00:35,599 --> 02:00:40,159
same genetics the same nutrients and the

2882
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:42,880
same curing. So the whole journey is

2883
02:00:40,158 --> 02:00:46,079
where I'm going to evaluate sort of

2884
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:48,079
speaking people and um I don't know if

2885
02:00:46,079 --> 02:00:49,760
I'm going to have 10 entries of 100

2886
02:00:48,079 --> 02:00:51,599
entries but I feel that this is

2887
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:53,199
something that uh if you in the

2888
02:00:51,599 --> 02:00:55,159
prohibition lands we'll be sending them

2889
02:00:53,198 --> 02:00:58,359
everywhere of course at at your own

2890
02:00:55,158 --> 02:01:01,359
risk. Please be be whatever you are be

2891
02:00:58,359 --> 02:01:03,439
safe but um it would be an honor and a

2892
02:01:01,359 --> 02:01:06,399
