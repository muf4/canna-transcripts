talked I've been really good I've been

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,480
happily

14
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,839
productive um and I often give that

15
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:45,640
answer to people actually when they ask

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,840
me how I'm doing uh and I've been really

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,520
happy uh to hear especially right now

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,199
it's February it's going to be for for

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,920
people who have seasons unlike myself

20
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:57,839
living in Southern California um you

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,280
know you you are still kind of either

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,199
it's still really cold and it's about to

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,079
be spring so is the perfect time um for

24
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:05,798
people to be re-evaluating how they go

25
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,400
about it what happened last year what do

26
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,080
we do this year that kind of um

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,439
reflection is really

28
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,400
important for sure and where where do

29
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:18,039
you find most of your um your

30
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,478
professional efforts Focus these days um

31
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,240
do you do you do a lot of uh cannabis uh

32
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:25,920
uh Consulting work or are you also

33
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:28,798
working with other like perennials or um

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,478
Nursery plants or anything like that I

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,360
do work in both of of those uh Fields

36
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:36,239
but most of my work lately has been in

37
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,239
cannabis and um in fact just today I was

38
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,719
working with somebody who was dealing

39
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:43,199
with

40
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:45,000
um uh a few different things actually um

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,118
but a lot but it was really execution on

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,680
a strategy that um should be working but

43
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:53,640
wasn't uh so it was really it was just

44
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:56,479
like a matter of kind of drilling into

45
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,599
the execution and um I think we figured

46
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:01,158
it out so that was good it's awesome I I

47
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,559
always like it when you get like a

48
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,200
little puzzle like that and you have to

49
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,719
figure out you know it seems all the

50
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,080
pieces fit but there's something that's

51
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:09,959
not that's not working you got to narrow

52
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,200
it down to something I I see that all

53
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,719
the time in

54
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:16,238
cultivation um so you know a lot of

55
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:19,239
people will know you for the

56
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,680
approachability of your um like press

57
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:25,159
pest primer videos as well as your other

58
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,680
integrated Pest Management resources

59
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:30,878
that you have on your YouTube channel

60
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:34,080
and then you do always provide a very uh

61
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:36,919
uh insightful look into Pest Management

62
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,920
when you do or are on the panel of the

63
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:43,280
growing with my fellow Growers podcast

64
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:46,799
and um but you know this this is the way

65
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,439
we grow uh podcast and you I really like

66
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,800
to dive into people's history with uh

67
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,120
growing plants in general whether or not

68
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,360
that be cannabis and considering that

69
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:01,680
your professional life is more heavily

70
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:05,000
focused on the um cannabis side of of uh

71
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,840
Pest Management applications um where

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,400
did you start with growing plants in

73
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,799
general was it something where um you

74
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,158
had house plants growing up or a

75
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,920
vegetable garden with Mom and Dad or

76
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:18,919
yeah take us take us back to when young

77
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,280
Matthew Gates was entering into the

78
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:26,359
world of

79
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:29,239
plants if you go before my existence um

80
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,080
into my parentage you've got uh my

81
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:36,120
father who grew up uh in

82
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,599
Kentucky uh zinzinnati Kentucky you know

83
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,878
as they would often refer to it when

84
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,438
because that's what it used to be called

85
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,079
now it's Cincinnati or I mean some

86
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:44,719
people would say that's not Kentucky

87
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,319
right but he would always say it this

88
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:50,598
way

89
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:53,560
um and and he you know he has a farm

90
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:55,719
background and so um although we didn't

91
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,719
really do any of that with me growing up

92
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:00,079
personally um I think there is some of

93
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:01,959
that influence that maybe should be uh

94
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:05,040
talked about a bit that sort of

95
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:07,920
appreciation but really you know my

96
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:10,479
enjoyment my like interest in like plant

97
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:14,078
biology and what eventually become like

98
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:18,079
an ecological appreciation too is um

99
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:21,120
through insect life mostly um I also

100
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,960
like to reference things like Pokemon uh

101
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,918
giving yourself for as a person born in

102
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:30,000
the

103
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:33,240
9s um I think having like a virtual ual

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,959
world that um you can kind of play

105
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:40,120
around with Concepts as a CH as a child

106
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:43,279
uh and also then reinforce those things

107
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:46,680
out in the environment um Satoshi Tajiri

108
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:50,079
who is uh the creator of Pokemon uh by

109
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,079
some regard uh got the idea for Pokemon

110
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:55,038
for doing exactly that going to caves

111
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:57,439
going to Fields catching bugs as a kid

112
00:04:55,038 --> 00:05:00,360
um so I think there's a thematic

113
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:02,079
relevance there um for sure uh but it be

114
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,520
but then but then as I like grew to I

115
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,719
enjoyed insects and things like that

116
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,000
because they have like this sort of

117
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,600
alien sort of physiology very different

118
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,279
than our our bodies and then because

119
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,960
most bugs eat plants that's where the

120
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:16,918
Avenue kind of comes into it so and I

121
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,719
think I've been benefited now like a

122
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:21,399
fungi and all all other kinds of life

123
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,000
forms you know it's all good all very

124
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:25,879
interesting to me but that's where it

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,800
kind of started so the the draw was

126
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:31,680
really through the aspect of insects and

127
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,478
their activity around plants not

128
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,120
necessarily plants uh at first exactly

129
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:39,279
you know I think that's what I think

130
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,519
that's what directed my attention first

131
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,879
yeah that makes a lot of sense I mean as

132
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:46,839
a someone else who was born in the 90s

133
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:49,478
Pokemon was a huge part of my early

134
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:51,478
childhood and still continues to remain

135
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:53,318
a part of my life even to this day I

136
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:55,079
still enjoy playing the games every once

137
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,439
in a while and you know they're very

138
00:05:55,079 --> 00:06:02,318
nostalgic but also I I see how there is

139
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:04,399
like the aspect of uh you know if you're

140
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,160
out in the grass and you find a bug and

141
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:09,159
you pick it up and you look at it that's

142
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,840
pretty much exactly what Pokemon or

143
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:16,240
these other you know uh

144
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:19,279
animated uh animal games are very

145
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,280
closely similar too so that makes a lot

146
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:25,719
of sense um so when you were then

147
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:29,198
growing up uh what other uh you know

148
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:32,039
taking the idea of uh you got brought

149
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:35,439
into plants through your enjoyment or

150
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:37,120
your uh your excitement with bugs um

151
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,478
where did that then kind of go from

152
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,038
there uh well basically I had a few

153
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:44,318
different options um you know growing up

154
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:46,519
for what I could do as a career uh that

155
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,039
I was planning on anyways uh but

156
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:50,000
eventually I came to the conclusion that

157
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:52,279
I wanted to work in agriculture since I

158
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,639
already had this affinity for was

159
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:58,559
essentially the enemy for so many

160
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,918
people um so fortunately because a lot

161
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,319
of people don't like or don't like

162
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:06,598
pathogens or that kind of a thing um and

163
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:09,639
they avoid even thinking about it uh you

164
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:11,478
know I was happy to take on that role

165
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:14,439
and be that limb that somebody doesn't

166
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:16,199
have you know um to sort of

167
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:18,719
efficaciously deal with something but

168
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,000
also I think you know growing up another

169
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,120
aspect of that a strong aspect for me at

170
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,439
least was like with cannabis for example

171
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,000
I had friends growing and I had friends

172
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,360
um who would ask me questions because

173
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,360
you know I'm the guy who knows those

174
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,439
sorts of things

175
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,919
um and so there was a happy Synergy

176
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:39,319
there too uh and especially

177
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:42,959
because a lot of times people get what

178
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,319
are by most regards really common pests

179
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,279
but sometimes people would get something

180
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,400
really odd and I was Happ I was I was

181
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:50,799
very interested I think to to see things

182
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,318
that were not as common um in other

183
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,840
crops and other plant life and that kind

184
00:07:52,319 --> 00:08:00,240
of a thing so um that is kind of where

185
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:01,799
that took off and I did spend a couple

186
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,439
of years in the People's Republic of

187
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,680
China in the early

188
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:11,240
2010s and I worked in tea and I worked

189
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:13,158
in um sorghum and a couple of other like

190
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,240
grain crops and vegetable crops too like

191
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:18,680
tomato I would go all around but I

192
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:21,680
mostly spent my time in Beijing tenen

193
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:25,319
and uh Shanghai and

194
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:28,800
hungo um which is like the North and

195
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:31,080
kind of the southeast part of China of

196
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,719
of the people

197
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:37,278
Republic for sure and um that was an

198
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,399
interesting experience too for sure no

199
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,799
not a lot of cannabis going on over

200
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:43,679
there for me at least I would imagine

201
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:46,319
not I did you see any hemp or anything

202
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:49,199
because I know that that was um somewhat

203
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,560
of a a large crop at one point in China

204
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,000
but I'm not really sure when that would

205
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:56,359
have been I don't really have my my

206
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,879
history that well down on that no I mean

207
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,639
there that exists and it's there and um

208
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:03,720
and I'm not I'm not totally read up on

209
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:06,240
all the details but there seems to be

210
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,320
like a gray you know some kind of a gray

211
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,720
Market uh for for example I know like

212
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,360
for research

213
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,160
chemicals um and like you know compounds

214
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,159
like that that are uh that people want

215
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:19,719
to obtain maybe for like a psychedelic

216
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:21,120
effect or for no Tropics or whatever um

217
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,959
as long as it's not on like the band

218
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,360
list you know if it's a slightly

219
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:27,639
different compound that has a different

220
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,959
name then suddenly it's okay or whatever

221
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:32,360
um so anyways like there's some of that

222
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:34,159
going on too uh but I I wish I could

223
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,919
make up some like really fantastic story

224
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,439
but I actually never got to see any

225
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:40,958
despite me being very aware um that it

226
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,640
was there and that's that's it's around

227
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:45,359
um you know sadly I just didn't have

228
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:48,559
that um I had I saw some like hemp

229
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,000
products in the past before and um if I

230
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:55,518
went to like places like

231
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,480
uh hjo which was very

232
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,240
uh um agrarian uh so I think like you

233
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,320
know more people it was interesting to

234
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,399
hear PE older people talk about it a bit

235
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,360
uh they would humor me a little bit um

236
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:11,278
through my translator I did learn

237
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:14,320
Chinese but but um uh not enough to to

238
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:16,919
talk about a kind of a a gray gray topic

239
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,519
I didn't really want to have any

240
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:22,159
miscommunication fair enough people fa

241
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,480
enough that I mean I feel like

242
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:27,240
especially when you connect through

243
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,959
something as uh Universal as agriculture

244
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,278
um and then you know being someone who

245
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:33,599
was there to help prevent the pest

246
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,958
damage to crops it I feel like that's

247
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,399
such a valuable role

248
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:41,518
um you know you you're you're like a

249
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:44,639
protector of sustenance at that point it

250
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,360
does feel that way I think that that's

251
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,200
really important and even what you said

252
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,200
before um where you said uh I forget

253
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,759
exactly the words that you used but how

254
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:58,800
we call them um are enemies right within

255
00:10:54,759 --> 00:11:03,639
the agricultural field and um how like

256
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:05,919
pest itself as a uh moniker is somewhat

257
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:08,759
um it has this negative connotation to

258
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:11,039
it but the you know these these insects

259
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:13,039
definitely developed over time alongside

260
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:15,879
of these different crops and we even

261
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:19,480
have things now where we have uh hemp uh

262
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:22,039
specific uh pests and cannabis specific

263
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,440
pests that that don't necessarily harm

264
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:29,519
other crops uh either to the same ex

265
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:31,680
extent or degree or not at all and so um

266
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,039
when when did you start to then so it

267
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,958
sounds like you were in in China for a

268
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:39,599
few years uh immediately I'm assuming

269
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:41,958
following College um or your your

270
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,360
education towards this career path

271
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:47,799
that's right and so two years two years

272
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:52,360
okay and and when you came back to the

273
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:55,399
States um what what sort of drove your

274
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,800
uh your path uh what what what did you

275
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:01,039
sort of follow in terms of the uh

276
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:04,359
integrated Pest Management

277
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:06,759
oh well had I basically um at that point

278
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:10,440
I had already established uh my personal

279
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:13,720
professional work um my business

280
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,240
zenthanol Consulting and so at that

281
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,639
point um I was fortunate enough to have

282
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,159
a lot of people I could contact or that

283
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:24,079
were contacted me about various issues

284
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:27,240
um so basically just kept going with

285
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:29,638
clientele that way I have a couple of

286
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,879
long-term uh people that would work with

287
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,440
as well one of them um I'm wearing the

288
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:38,240
shirt for

289
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:40,720
dramar um who put poetas on the

290
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,039
map um they're the reason why you think

291
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,800
of poinsetta as like a um sort of a

292
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:47,958
Christmas plant and there's a funny

293
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:49,759
story that goes along with it they were

294
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:51,359
um they had green houses since like the

295
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,639
they were like built in like the

296
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,839
1970s um long story

297
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:59,680
short said is used to only have a single

298
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:02,279
stalk and a single flower

299
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,879
but now uh they found one that they

300
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:06,360
found that one had multi branching and

301
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,320
so they were able to propagate a lot

302
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,120
quicker which allowed it to become more

303
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,440
successful as a plant but um is that the

304
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,399
same cultivar that they use

305
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:20,000
today yes but well here's the thing okay

306
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,360
sorry I didn't yes no here's the here's

307
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,440
the here's the interesting twist they

308
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,320
thought it was genetic right okay U

309
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,199
because the trait was vertically

310
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,320
transmitted not a lot of things do that

311
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:33,198
that one thing does though they found

312
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,639
that it was actually this it is genetic

313
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:39,719
but it's not endogenous it was a microbe

314
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:42,120
that was inside their uh body

315
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,040
phytoplasma phytoplasma is a really

316
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:48,480
interesting bacteria a lot of times they

317
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:51,278
are um really damaging and they are

318
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,519
often times they have to be vectored by

319
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:56,159
an insect so like we have a really

320
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,560
destructive one called uh honglong Bing

321
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,600
or Citrus Greening disease um or yellow

322
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:04,278
dragon disease if you want the Chinese

323
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,560
literal translation and that

324
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:10,320
um that just messes up Citrus uh in

325
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:12,919
California in Florida

326
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,600
elsewhere and uh

327
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:17,399
this uh this phytoplasma is really

328
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,360
detrimental but the one that was in the

329
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,519
poinsettas just had this um hormonal

330
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,759
effect essentially and it caused the

331
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:28,039
plant to sort of multibranch and because

332
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:30,360
it was able to even transmit through the

333
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:31,399
parentage people thought it was genetic

334
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,839
but it's

335
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:35,480
not that's I mean it makes me think of

336
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,240
something like hops Laten vroid or

337
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:41,360
something that is uh vertically

338
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:44,079
transmittable across um uh cuting uh as

339
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,600
well as even potentially uh progyny seed

340
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:49,078
stock and so but you know I guess it

341
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,639
sounds like you wouldn't have found this

342
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:54,039
in say a seed stock population from poas

343
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,680
where you were then trying

344
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:59,278
to uh narrow down this trait that you

345
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:02,039
were looking for uh but it was then

346
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:07,000
caused by the the virus or the the

347
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:09,198
bacteria you said um yeah exactly that's

348
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,320
super fascinating so what did they end

349
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:17,758
up somehow removing the

350
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:21,278
um the phytoplasma from the poinsetta

351
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,680
and lose this desirable trait or were

352
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:27,480
they able to narrow it down to what it

353
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:30,318
was and somehow stabilize that within

354
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,759
the plant further or or I'm just that's

355
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:34,360
so

356
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,318
fascinating I'm not sure of the details

357
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,959
but I do know

358
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:42,479
that um I think they found this out by

359
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:44,958
accident originally and I think it was

360
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,120
because if I remember right it could be

361
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:51,039
remembering wrong but I think that the

362
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:53,679
um part of the part of the reason it was

363
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:59,078
discovered uh by

364
00:15:53,679 --> 00:16:01,399
accident was because the um

365
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:04,399
the uh the ability to detect these

366
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:07,679
phytoplasmas recently became more common

367
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,039
or something and so so like when they

368
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:13,519
were going through some sort of um

369
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:18,318
indexing process they discovered

370
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:21,000
it wow and and but did they is this the

371
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:23,000
same then uh so it sounds like from what

372
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,039
I asked earlier that this is the same

373
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,639
cultivar that they're still using to

374
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:30,318
have the multibranch

375
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,440
poas and um it's is it still due to this

376
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:34,039
this

377
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,680
phytoplasma

378
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:38,919
um uh

379
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:41,159
bacteria yeah you know I'm not sure if

380
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:43,039
they make use of the phytoplasma still

381
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:46,759
or if they've been able to actually

382
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:50,399
achieve um a a like a genetic and

383
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:52,199
perhaps more reliable um mode of action

384
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,360
I'm actually not sure if it's the same

385
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:58,198
one uh and also um you know if they

386
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,839
breed with other cultivars and they and

387
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:03,359
some of the bacteria pass down um

388
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:06,318
perhaps it's still not the same cultivar

389
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,880
technically but um but I do I do not

390
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:11,959
know it could be that this is no longer

391
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:15,880
like the case anymore okay well I mean

392
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:17,759
along the same uh strand of questioning

393
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,959
just considering it has to do with

394
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:23,400
poinsettias um considering that they're

395
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:24,160
also a a scoto dependent plant similar

396
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,480
to

397
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,558
cannabis what would you are there any

398
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,519
other similarities that you see with

399
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:35,678
something that requires uh a specific

400
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:37,759
longer night cycle um when it comes to

401
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:42,240
Pest Management that you wouldn't

402
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:42,240
necessarily see in other uh crop

403
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:46,678
plants uh could you say that one more

404
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:48,639
time sorry I might have jumbled my words

405
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:50,798
a little bit but considering that both

406
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,280
like point setas and cannabis require a

407
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:55,679
certain amount of uh Darkness period in

408
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:58,279
order to trigger their flowering have

409
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,159
you seen any similarities within the

410
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:03,960
pest manag agement approaches between

411
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:05,440
those two in terms of uh specific pests

412
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,880
that you might find with something that

413
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,558
it has a longer night night

414
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,919
period

415
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:16,720
H I don't think scoto periodicity is a

416
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:18,600
big part of it but I think that um you

417
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,558
often like a lot of people who grew

418
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:24,359
ornamentals like cut flowers like Gerra

419
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:27,038
um which these people did uh Gerra you

420
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:31,879
can see there's a lily here

421
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:33,279
Cy um Ros is uh ornamentals in general I

422
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,840
think people have experienced with them

423
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:39,359
do it does lend themselves to um aspect

424
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:42,759
of cannabis biology like having you know

425
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:45,599
scod period dependent development um

426
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:47,158
often being annual although not always

427
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,158
um with some

428
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:52,520
manipulation

429
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:54,600
um and I would also say that like you

430
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:57,158
know there's some literature very old

431
00:18:54,599 --> 00:19:00,240
examples of like solitary isolated

432
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:02,799
literature that used to describe um

433
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,279
cannabis as being like in the con in the

434
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:08,918
in the capacity as hemp um pretty pest

435
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:10,879
resistant but um then I've also seen

436
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:12,320
more recent literature that has like and

437
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,320
the only reason I know about it because

438
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,798
they targeted these statements and are

439
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,119
like I don't know what they're talking

440
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:21,079
about that's not been our

441
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:22,959
experience um so but I do think what

442
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:25,879
what cannabis has going for it and what

443
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,159
I find very beautiful about the plant is

444
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:32,760
actually that it has a lot of the same

445
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:34,320
charm as a bamboo or uh for me at least

446
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:38,359
or like even like a

447
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:40,678
dandelion um or or similar type of plant

448
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:43,399
that like Hawk beard that grows really

449
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:47,519
vigorously or thistle um starts out kind

450
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:50,640
of herbaceous hardens off and becomes

451
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:53,519
like Woody and just grows really fast so

452
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,038
I find that trait really uh I don't know

453
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,639
I just think that's really cool that it

454
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,919
can grow so fast and something come if

455
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,080
like a cow or an animal comes in and

456
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,759
munches it down it can still like

457
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:07,918
outgrow it you

458
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:09,879
know nominally I agree it is one of the

459
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,038
coolest Parts about like the cannabis

460
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:15,039
plant where it it grows so rapidly when

461
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:18,119
given the correct environment and

462
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:19,960
conditions for growth it it'll you know

463
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:22,319
outgrow almost anything else in your

464
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,600
garden other than like a a really well

465
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,599
maintained tomato or something during

466
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,480
the summer but even those They Don't

467
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:30,319
Really necessarily get that Woody stock

468
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,200
they're not like a you can't really turn

469
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:38,200
them into a tree I guess the best you

470
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:41,600
can do is maybe a a a very long Vine but

471
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,440
um yeah it it is really fascinating with

472
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,558
cannabis how how quickly it grows and

473
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:50,200
you can see this entire life cycle in

474
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:52,639
the course of three months let's say um

475
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:56,038
right yeah so that is really fascinating

476
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:59,759
you know and how the traits are passed

477
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:02,798
from uh like the parent lineage down to

478
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:05,679
offspring in cannabis compared to things

479
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:08,400
like tomatoes or potatoes or corn or

480
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:12,600
things you don't see such huge vast

481
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:16,240
differences within the the progyny um to

482
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:18,359
in my experience um but maybe you have a

483
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,200
different experience with that I I I'd

484
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:24,199
like to actually get back a little bit

485
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:28,240
into where you then pivoted and

486
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,798
transitioned your focus into um cannabis

487
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,359
uh integrated Pest management

488
00:21:29,798 --> 00:21:34,440
application and then also ask about your

489
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:36,879
own personal experiences with growing

490
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,360
cannabis um I know that you have in the

491
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,159
past but aren't currently and so maybe

492
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:45,038
we can talk a little bit about

493
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,799
that well uh I mean cannabis was in the

494
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:51,038
beginning even like pre- beginning

495
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:53,440
through two degree okay um but uh with

496
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:56,720
regards

497
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,200
to like what I was growing myself or

498
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,640
like uh or like the kinds of things that

499
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,519
people were growing or or well let's

500
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,120
let's uh maybe make it a two-parter

501
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:06,720
let's talk a little bit about your own

502
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:10,359
personal experience uh just to get a

503
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,679
little bit of a grasp of uh what you've

504
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:14,119
uh personally experienced with growing

505
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,519
cannabis and then also what you um when

506
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:18,359
you transitioned into making that more

507
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:19,759
of your professional path with

508
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:23,199
integrated Pest

509
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:27,759
Management oh sure well I would say that

510
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,240
like my favorite example is I have three

511
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:32,960
I have three big stories for me

512
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,720
personally growing I actually had um you

513
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,000
know despite this is not necessarily

514
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,600
like how I I recommend uh people in a

515
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,480
commercial space or something quasi

516
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:46,678
commercial whatever you call all of this

517
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,360
um uh you know I wouldn't recommend

518
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:49,880
necessarily growing this way but I like

519
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:52,479
when it's just me and I don't really

520
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:55,039
care too much and I have other avenues

521
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,960
of access and that kind of a thing so

522
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:59,640
that's the context that I'm bring up

523
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:03,720
here I actually am a big over grow type

524
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:06,278
person I'm also a big like I I enjoy

525
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:10,079
having a plants kind of grow without a

526
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:12,519
whole lot of um interaction on my

527
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,359
part uh sometimes if I really care about

528
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:15,798
the produce or that kind of a thing like

529
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:18,519
like I have a low quat tree that I

530
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:21,599
planted when I was in my parents um uh

531
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:23,278
house when I was like a teenager and we

532
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:26,199
still grow we still take the low quats

533
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:27,798
out you know today as a big tree and you

534
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,080
know sometimes I've cut it back so that

535
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:33,038
I can get a certain yield or or whatever

536
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:35,119
but generally I'm actually kind of like

537
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:37,440
a uh said and forget it type person and

538
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:38,158
I also prefer to not like have a bunch

539
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,159
of

540
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,799
rigamarole um uh and like lights and

541
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,520
that kind of a thing myself personally

542
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:50,359
but I love visiting people who do that

543
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:52,679
kind of stuff um I would say that my my

544
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:54,879
my most um

545
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:59,480
informative uh growing was actually when

546
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:02,400
I was uh growing with my friends

547
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,919
um who were up in the high desert in

548
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,038
like do you know where Lone Pine

549
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:10,000
California

550
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:11,278
is I don't but is that like or Bishop

551
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,919
yeah

552
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:18,159
yeah yeah so it's by it's around that

553
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:20,080
area sort of the uh the Ino

554
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:24,039
um uh

555
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:26,000
land and um they had a river fortunately

556
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:28,440
they had access on the land to a river

557
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,640
that went down and they were growing the

558
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,960
the cannabis plants in the sort of high

559
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,840
desert high heat uh you know very high

560
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,759
solar

561
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:40,720
radiation context with a little bit of

562
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:43,879
shade from like some um oak trees I

563
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,120
believe they were uh and this like kind

564
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,880
of river that would irrigate it and that

565
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:51,158
was like a really cool but very

566
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,880
interesting um situation because in some

567
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:54,679
way when it was night time you get all

568
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,159
kinds of bugs people who've never been

569
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:58,679
in the desert and especially the high

570
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:02,080
desert of um California

571
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:03,720
uh Southwest North America in general is

572
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:06,439
um full of bugs that love to be

573
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,798
attracted to light some things um but

574
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:12,720
during during the day it can be really

575
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:15,000
hot um and some bugs will not be very

576
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,960
active and some bugs uh might actually

577
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,278
actually get there and but you are kind

578
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:23,120
of insulated because the only things

579
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:23,119
around you are scrubby

580
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:27,640
life for sure and so so were they like

581
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:29,519
growing the plants uh kind of like

582
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,240
directly next to the river and just

583
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:33,679
allowing the river to irrigate them that

584
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,440
way where they didn't have to water them

585
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,519
that's right it was really cool yeah I

586
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,519
mean it sounds a lot like your style of

587
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:42,240
set it and forget it you know you got

588
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:44,278
the shade there to take care of them so

589
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,278
that they don't necessarily get burnt

590
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:48,720
and they have plenty of access to water

591
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:51,480
and probably very nutritious water as

592
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,240
well considering all the different silt

593
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:57,759
and stuff that gets move down the river

594
00:25:53,240 --> 00:26:01,240
and any Biologicals from fish or frogs

595
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:03,839
or other uh Wildlife that kind of is

596
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,519
near the streams and whatnot so that's

597
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:10,639
that's super fascinating

598
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:12,278
um but I I do know about the California

599
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,960
high desert and the bugs that you can

600
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:17,240
get there you can get lots of um not

601
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,038
necessarily locusts but uh Grasshoppers

602
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,359
and um other things that'll just they'll

603
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:23,879
chew through a a crop of plants and no

604
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:26,639
time

605
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:29,440
flat and then you also have the

606
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:33,320
people uh you do have to account for

607
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:36,480
sometimes in uh in in desert locations

608
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:39,960
there can be some uh Wanderers who

609
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:43,200
are looking for something interesting to

610
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:45,519
do with their day fair enough and I mean

611
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,240
uh you know I feel like as human beings

612
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:51,359
if we see sort of a an outcropping of

613
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,679
trees or some Greenery in a vast

614
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:56,240
landscape of uh desert you're going to

615
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:59,880
be drawn to it regardless of what your

616
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:03,159
intentions are um absolutely it's very

617
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:07,120
beautiful I'll never forget my favorite

618
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:08,559
uh memory of that place is when it's

619
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:09,599
maybe like 10 it's been like 10 years

620
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:12,678
now

621
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:15,158
maybe um something like that maybe

622
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:17,399
longer and there was like this huge snow

623
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:19,960
event and despite it being like the

624
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:24,798
desert um you know there was like tons

625
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:26,240
of snow packed um uh away from the road

626
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:29,158
so like they had to like divert all the

627
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,599
snow off the road and you know it just

628
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:32,520
like stayed there for a very long time

629
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:35,639
it was crazy to see that and I guess it

630
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:37,599
it's very rare um but like yeah the the

631
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,360
mountains and everything is is very is

632
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:41,719
very peaceful um I find it really I

633
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:43,918
think people who have never experienced

634
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:48,919
it there's a desolate beauty of of the

635
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:51,679
area and I found that was very um

636
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:54,240
insightful I I could agree with that I

637
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,000
feel like you always see in uh in movies

638
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,720
and stuff the Trope of people who are

639
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,200
taking psychedelics and go out to the

640
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,600
desert to experience their their

641
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,200
psychedelic uh trip because it it is

642
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:07,678
like peaceful and there's just less

643
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,640
around you to distract you from whatever

644
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:13,320
that is that you're trying to

645
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:15,600
experience um and then so from from that

646
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:18,240
experience

647
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:21,158
um when you started to become more

648
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,200
heavily involved in the Cannabis uh

649
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:26,480
Market as an integrated past Pest

650
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,919
Management specialist what were some uh

651
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,480
what were some experiences you had there

652
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,679
that you'd like to share I mean there's

653
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,679
so many that I could I think that uh for

654
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,798
those who might be like listening and

655
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:42,559
wondering to get some like IPM

656
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:45,759
Insight um I think I would say that like

657
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:48,918
a big takeaway that's actually

658
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:51,839
surprisingly absent uh in a commercial

659
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:54,600
space too is actually to

660
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:56,839
like know what could be a

661
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:59,398
threat surprising how many people don't

662
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:02,079
even know some of these basic

663
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:05,158
um I wish I could say it was like really

664
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:07,000
I mean it gets complicated at scale and

665
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:09,200
different regions um and different

666
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,038
seasons can be different too I think not

667
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:15,440
appreciating that as much as you could

668
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:17,200
um which is like a really common problem

669
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,320
in all kinds of business right so it's

670
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,360
not unique to cannabis but I feel like

671
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:24,639
that's a really big aspect um many like

672
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:27,079
different stories and anecdotes of mine

673
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,600
could maybe be boiled down to this like

674
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:33,558
maxim of like Step

675
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:36,038
Zero learn the bugs and also learn what

676
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:38,440
people do about them and also learn what

677
00:29:36,038 --> 00:29:41,839
you can do about them for your unique

678
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:44,880
context um and it's hard to account for

679
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:48,558
like 50 plus possibilities and maybe

680
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,480
like 10 to 15 really common um things

681
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:52,558
that people will deal with but I think

682
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,319
if you know to be forewarned is to be

683
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:58,798
forearmed um and that's a message I like

684
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,798
to share for free to very people on my

685
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:03,798
YouTube channel uh that's why the pest

686
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:05,240
primer series um is what it is because I

687
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:07,918
would get all these questions from

688
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:10,440
people and I firmly believe in the

689
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,960
business statement that like you have to

690
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,759
be better than a Google Search and

691
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,480
that's something I've said many times

692
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:19,960
but uh up until just this very moment I

693
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:22,000
realized that it's out moded because

694
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,278
people now use um you know machine

695
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,798
learning and AI now with the search

696
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:29,038
engine

697
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:31,359
um uh ruaha that people have been

698
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:33,200
talking about so but you know

699
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:35,278
essentially people can find out

700
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,319
information your job is not to be a

701
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:40,640
knowledge Silo and be like give me money

702
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:42,798
for the secret technique um because the

703
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,440
ultimate answer is almost always it

704
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:47,000
depends on what you can or can't do and

705
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,558
it's under it's working under those

706
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,880
experiences and constraints that um

707
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:55,558
allows uh somebody to be I think

708
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:58,080
informative um but no one's had every

709
00:30:55,558 --> 00:30:59,319
single experience either right so right

710
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:03,278
right I mean it's like somewhere in

711
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:07,638
between education and intuition um that

712
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:10,319
makes the the human um approach to these

713
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:13,319
different problems and solutions much

714
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:13,319
more

715
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:20,960
um it it just it may it's I feel like

716
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:23,158
there's a more um I'm missing the word

717
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:27,000
right now but it it helps when it comes

718
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:30,799
to trying to figure something out if

719
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:35,679
rather than it being this rigid like yes

720
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:38,759
no uh like like deduction versus

721
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,600
induction type reasoning yeah yeah yeah

722
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:42,558
I agree with you you you have to put on

723
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:43,319
your think your like Sherlock Holmes cap

724
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:45,240
for

725
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:47,398
sure what what are some of the

726
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,120
experiences that you've had then with um

727
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:52,518
integrated Pest Management that you felt

728
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:55,319
were um some of the biggest learning

729
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:59,599
curves uh for yourself maybe that kind

730
00:31:55,319 --> 00:32:02,398
of fit into this idea of needing to um

731
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:05,519
find a solution that fits the problem in

732
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:05,518
a specific

733
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:14,079
scenario I think that like I think that

734
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:14,080
the biggest one could

735
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:19,599
be like learning what isn't a threat too

736
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:22,158
what I just maybe the converse of what I

737
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:24,678
just said like because I've had people I

738
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,240
mean I've had people bring in um you

739
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:28,840
know I've had people panic over nothing

740
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,440
and find out they spent a lot of money

741
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:31,918
time and effort on something that wasn't

742
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,919
an issue like some soul might or

743
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:37,360
something that was sort of Common Place

744
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:39,480
um as well uh but it comes from the

745
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:42,158
right place I think

746
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,839
also um something I've kind a bit of a

747
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,120
white whale for me and you tell me if

748
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:49,158
this is answering your question or if

749
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:52,719
you want me to be more um uh precise in

750
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:54,440
the in the answer but I feel as

751
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,159
though

752
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,720
uh like people will believe something

753
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:00,559
without

754
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,480
um looking at the data and that could

755
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:05,519
either be because they're ambivalent

756
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,798
about it um or they're desperate and

757
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,919
they don't have the time or even like

758
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:11,839
the technical knowledge to like make an

759
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:14,080
assessment that's what you're for you

760
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:15,798
know for example or some somebody

761
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:16,960
they've hired you know an employee or

762
00:33:15,798 --> 00:33:18,798
something like that in the commercial

763
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,440
space and if it's just you growing with

764
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:22,759
your friends it's still the same

765
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,120
scenario it's just you and your friend

766
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:25,759
who's helping you out with something if

767
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:28,959
you both don't know something it's

768
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:31,720
effectively the same problem

769
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:36,319
um uh so I feel

770
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:38,839
like feel like that is a an issue that

771
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:41,480
that's quite common and the only way you

772
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:43,038
amarate that is by you know being

773
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,079
open-minded trying to learn this stuff

774
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:47,919
and when people like give you a

775
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:50,918
solution you know

776
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:53,240
um at least try to like look try try to

777
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:54,440
find out you know just other people also

778
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,880
agree with this you know it's just

779
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,360
surprising to me how often I've come

780
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,360
across people who like I'll give you an

781
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:04,479
example have you heard people say

782
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:06,839
something like um py Milo is not a

783
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,679
problem of the pest as much as it's a

784
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:12,159
problem of like air flow let's

785
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,679
say right I've I've totally heard that

786
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,599
where then people think oh I I I just

787
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:19,838
need to adjust my airf flow and the

788
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:22,559
powdery mildew is going to go away or um

789
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:26,000
MH yeah I've I've totally ran into that

790
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:27,078
but it it's not I I I feel like I see

791
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,679
where you're going with this where it's

792
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:29,960
like if you already have powdery mildew

793
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,960
then the air flow isn't the problem

794
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,519
anymore the powdery mdeo is now the

795
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:37,358
problem

796
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:40,159
um maybe air flow was the reason why it

797
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:42,358
uh occurred but even that is kind of a

798
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,599
misnomer because you need to take into

799
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:50,519
account uh heat and humidity and airf

800
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:52,919
flow and um other uh either high

801
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:54,800
humidity events or low humidity events

802
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:56,279
that could cause a sporulation event and

803
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,359
it just requires all these different

804
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,760
angles to be looked at

805
00:34:58,358 --> 00:35:04,199
um rather than just oh it's airf flow

806
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,000
boom there you go take

807
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:08,838
that right because humidity is a is

808
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,400
actually like a cumulative factor of

809
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:14,400
things right right and also having the

810
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:17,880
pest is a factor of also other things

811
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,680
and those mesh together um so yeah

812
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,519
essentially because whenever I ask

813
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:23,000
people what do you mean by that they

814
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:25,519
can't really tell me what they mean by

815
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,320
that it's just an it's like a logical

816
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:32,358
amulet it's like this is my my you know

817
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:35,320
this is my anti- snake Mouse you can

818
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:37,799
tell because there's no snakes here yeah

819
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:42,320
it works exactly so like that kind of

820
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:44,760
stuff like violence and ice cream right

821
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,200
um yes exactly the coration yeah the

822
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,640
sale of ice cream goes up because

823
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:51,679
violence is high and it's like no it's

824
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:53,639
hot as hell out and people are agitated

825
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:56,919
and they like ice cream when it's

826
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:59,440
hot right right exactly right exactly so

827
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,480
like you know and again like you know

828
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,599
Are you seriously Matt you know basic

829
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:06,639
logical issues are the are the problem

830
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:11,079
sometimes yeah yeah actually because it

831
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:14,279
is complex it so the word the the most

832
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:16,280
um uh interesting might not be the best

833
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:19,000
word but like the the things where I

834
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:21,640
feel like I feel the most accomplished

835
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,639
or I feel like something really good

836
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:26,679
happened here wasc was situations where

837
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:28,318
people who were doing everything right

838
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:29,639
and they knew and they're like talented

839
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:31,679
and they've got an expert panel of

840
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:33,159
people and they're doing everything's

841
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:35,679
good but then like something something

842
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:37,480
that they thought was true is now false

843
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:39,960
or something I thought that was false is

844
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:42,559
now true perhaps and then it becomes a

845
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,440
forensics question because the system

846
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:48,159
worked fine until just now so something

847
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:50,358
has happened here and it's really um

848
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:53,318
knowing like a bunch of Niche

849
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:56,598
esoterica uh is really great in that

850
00:36:53,318 --> 00:36:58,639
scenario um where you have an entire

851
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:00,960
system of like hundreds of thousands or

852
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:04,480
millions of dollars grind to a halt

853
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,519
because uh there's a new fungus in town

854
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,280
um and maybe your protocols weren't up

855
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:09,838
to Snuff or they were but somebody was

856
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,680
doing something wrong because you hired

857
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:15,639
them new or recently or whatever um all

858
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:17,960
of these things can come together and

859
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:22,159
coales yeah absolutely it makes me think

860
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:25,079
of um like how there's the

861
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:28,000
uh there's a video of like a petri dish

862
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:30,440
where it has different layers of um

863
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,480
antibiotics on it that are at different

864
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:35,000
strengths and then they put the bacteria

865
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,559
at the one end of the petri dish and it

866
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,318
hits these antibiotics takes a while to

867
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:43,000
break through them but then eventually

868
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:46,800
breaks through them because of either uh

869
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,318
reproduction uh creating some sort of

870
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,599
resistance to that bacteria or to the

871
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:54,480
antibiotic like a selection pressure the

872
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:56,640
ones that survive right you know are 10%

873
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,240
but then those all survive so then it's

874
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:01,239
100% And you know yeah for sure yeah and

875
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:02,879
it just keeps going and so sometimes

876
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:06,759
when you when you do get into like

877
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:09,358
almost uh cuz growing is monotonous

878
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:11,000
right it it is the same process over and

879
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:12,679
over and over again and I feel like a

880
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,719
lot of people don't necessarily take

881
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:16,440
that into account when trying to enter

882
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:18,199
into the cultivation field they think

883
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,400
that it's it's fun they're going to be

884
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:22,559
feno hunting and they're going to be

885
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,920
having all this this cool weed that they

886
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:28,000
can test or try out and oh look at us

887
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,480
we're growing these awesome flowers

888
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,800
um but in the end like it when you get

889
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,760
you know 20 crops deep in one year and

890
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,640
then you get to the next year and it's

891
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,680
well you're maybe expanded so now it's

892
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:42,400
30 crops in that year and it's just over

893
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:45,519
and over and over again things are the

894
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,119
same and if you don't notice where those

895
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:50,960
different you know like maybe a standard

896
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:52,760
might falter because it wasn't you

897
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,920
weren't seeing an issue so you stop

898
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:58,160
paying attention to it then it falters

899
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,039
and then you go oh my my God yeah like

900
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:01,559
you said everything grinds to a halt and

901
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:04,480
they don't you don't know what it is so

902
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:07,759
you do have to be like I always say go

903
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,760
back to basics try to just restart um

904
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,240
and and and make sure that you do have

905
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,079
good plans in place and and Sops

906
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:18,199
especially when it comes to integrated

907
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:20,000
Pest Management that if you aren't just

908
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:21,960
trying to reset if you can't figure it

909
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,440
out then it's going to be something like

910
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:29,599
a cha tasing event that uh does kind of

911
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:33,800
hinder the the progress overall the grow

912
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:36,519
um so when you when you found these uh

913
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:40,240
or had these experiences where it was

914
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:43,440
satisfying because it was sort

915
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:46,598
of you know everything was working then

916
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,639
all of a sudden it were it wasn't um

917
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:53,920
what are some of those pitfalls that you

918
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:55,639
see you tend to see um whether it be IPM

919
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,639
or otherwise that you've been able to

920
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:59,639
help people identify with it their

921
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:05,679
grows uh I'm tempted to say that a lot

922
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:09,078
of times it's actually it could be like

923
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:10,919
a um I think this is true at any scale

924
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:13,640
actually whether it's like a large scale

925
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:16,480
commercial situation or it's a

926
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:18,199
relatively small cottage uh scale or

927
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,358
even just somebody growing for

928
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:23,399
themselves so it's scale it's scale

929
00:40:20,358 --> 00:40:25,400
agnostic but actually it's like you know

930
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,358
something changed with the Personnel if

931
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:30,000
it's one person you know then it's like

932
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:33,039
you are that person but in general like

933
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,119
changes in people in what you might call

934
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:38,400
like infrastructural wisdom or or like

935
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:41,559
uh infrastructural knowledge or

936
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,639
institutional knowledge um is really

937
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:46,159
important it's oftentimes hard to

938
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:47,598
quantify right uh and a lot of people I

939
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:50,118
think understand this in like their

940
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,119
heart of hearts uh that like you know

941
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:53,880
there's like this thing and like now

942
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:56,559
that that is not there anymore for

943
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,240
whatever reason somebody left or uh

944
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:00,400
maybe those people people who are

945
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:03,479
executing uh are having something going

946
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:06,039
on or maybe they're doing fine but the

947
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,079
equipment that they use you know didn't

948
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:09,239
get checked a certain way so the you

949
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,440
know the people who are applying

950
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:13,199
something were fine but unfortunately

951
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,159
the product wasn't mixed or you know

952
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:18,598
things like this where it's often times

953
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:22,118
like a sort of a cacophony of different

954
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:25,039
Small Things um sort of breaking down um

955
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:26,800
and you don't notice it uh for example

956
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:28,318
but potentially at least you don't

957
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,839
notice it

958
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:32,800
because um if you're doing preventative

959
00:41:30,838 --> 00:41:35,358
stuff and there just happens to be no

960
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,839
snakes you know to go back to the amulet

961
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:39,838
example um then you think everything's

962
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:41,078
fine but then as soon as it breaks down

963
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:45,480
uh when I was working with the Gerber

964
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:47,200
grower people here uh we had uh we had a

965
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,079
really big scare because there was

966
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:50,159
powdery

967
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:53,560
mildew

968
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:56,598
and uh we applied or we didn't I didn't

969
00:41:53,559 --> 00:42:01,119
but they applied um a fungicide for it

970
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:03,359
and there was no effect and pesticide

971
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,640
companies take this very seriously

972
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:06,759
there's a lot especially with powdered

973
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:08,318
mil do but a lot of other pathogens they

974
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,160
have have been known to develop

975
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:13,480
resistances within the season that a new

976
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:15,799
product is like introduced or even

977
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,800
beforehand uh because the selection

978
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,720
pressure is already there but we found

979
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,280
out that the product just wasn't

980
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:24,558
applied

981
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,559
oops oh but they claim that it was

982
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,280
applied well we thought that it was

983
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:29,760
applied and then they thought they

984
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,480
thought it was applied too like it

985
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,480
wasn't um subterfuge it was like oops it

986
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,039
just didn't like it

987
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,280
didn't job that called in sick that day

988
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:41,119
or something as simple as that yeah I I

989
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,640
do not remember exactly how it happened

990
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:46,599
but I think it has to do with um uh who

991
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:48,118
was mixing versus who was applying and

992
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:49,720
some kind of a some kind of an honest

993
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:52,119
mixup because they I think they found

994
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:54,279
the mixed up product oh well this was

995
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:56,240
obviously the thing uh cuz if it got

996
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,240
sprayed then it obviously it would be

997
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:00,159
out there and so else happened like just

998
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:02,519
with water and so that's what happen got

999
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:04,960
it but that kind of stuff happens and it

1000
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:07,920
costs like lots of money right and time

1001
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:11,559
and stuff I mean it it you know you do

1002
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:13,480
never think about it until um yeah you

1003
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:15,800
either lose that worker that's been

1004
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:18,199
doing all these little things to you

1005
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:20,039
know putting the gum in between this and

1006
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:21,799
that so they hold together for just long

1007
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:23,400
enough uh you know going and kicking

1008
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,160
this one piece of equipment right in the

1009
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,639
right spot every day to make sure that

1010
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:32,679
it kicks on um I mean obviously those

1011
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:36,598
are silly examples but I do true though

1012
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:39,838
yeah but very true um I know that CU I I

1013
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:42,519
manage a facility and there are so many

1014
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:45,000
little things that have to be done

1015
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:47,480
regularly and um some of them

1016
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,559
irregularly where it's more of a you

1017
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,318
have to notice that the water lines are

1018
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:53,720
starting to slow down to think oh I got

1019
00:43:51,318 --> 00:43:55,920
to go and clean out the filter for this

1020
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:57,759
one this one line that doesn't really

1021
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,039
need cleaning that often but only when

1022
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:04,599
it does start to affect the the flow of

1023
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:06,599
water for instance um stuff like that is

1024
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:10,720
very

1025
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:14,359
uh it's like you very user dependent

1026
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:16,838
almost where you have to have the The

1027
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:18,880
Experience uh or experience dependent I

1028
00:44:16,838 --> 00:44:20,799
guess um just to make sure that you are

1029
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,559
hitting all those or checking off all

1030
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,920
those boxes that need to be checked off

1031
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:26,480
just to make sure that everything is

1032
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,079
continuing to move in the direction that

1033
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:31,960
you want it to for the production of the

1034
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:34,359
facility

1035
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,838
um so what

1036
00:44:34,358 --> 00:44:38,318
uh maybe I'll I'll leave it open just

1037
00:44:36,838 --> 00:44:40,318
for a little bit here what are some

1038
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:43,400
other uh stories that you wanted to talk

1039
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:46,838
about perhaps um when it comes to either

1040
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:49,880
IPM or cannabis or

1041
00:44:46,838 --> 00:44:53,639
otherwise I think that uh something I've

1042
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:56,760
been on a kick on is Research

1043
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:59,000
into like I think having a respect for

1044
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,599
pest I suppose let me back up and say

1045
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,519
it's very important I think that like

1046
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,200
going back to the original reason why I

1047
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:07,039
even got into all this was having an

1048
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:10,919
affinity for something that a lot of

1049
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:13,440
times uh was a pest or a problem um for

1050
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,119
the plant maybe in the forest or in the

1051
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,800
ecosystem we don't really care as much

1052
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:23,000
but as a crop pest certainly a problem

1053
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:25,800
um and I think that like it lulls people

1054
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,639
into a sort of false sense of

1055
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,359
superiority necessarily security

1056
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:32,920
although they can derive that feeling

1057
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:35,480
from there uh but I think it is sort of

1058
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:38,480
like a feeling like you know I've heard

1059
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:42,000
all kinds of weird claims like um you

1060
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:45,199
know a a a plant at some weirdly

1061
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,199
Quantified level of Health whatever that

1062
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:51,399
means um you know just cannot get pests

1063
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:53,719
or it's not possible for it to succumb a

1064
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:56,240
lot of times it sounds if it sounds like

1065
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:59,799
U like vitalism if you've heard of this

1066
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:03,000
uh sort of um esoteric concept this like

1067
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:07,200
uh it's like uh like there's

1068
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,239
a a Vitality that just can't be um it's

1069
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:11,838
almost like a spiritual argument rather

1070
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:14,078
than like one that's maybe you know I

1071
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:16,159
don't know I'm not a specialist in that

1072
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:18,640
sort of thing but I think that if I had

1073
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:21,960
made that comment to a client they would

1074
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:24,078
laugh at me um and maybe like I don't

1075
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:27,079
know press charges

1076
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:29,119
like I don't think that's accepted um

1077
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:31,519
you know for a lot of people but some

1078
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:36,039
people um make these claims or they make

1079
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:38,280
something um around that and some people

1080
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:39,838
seem to find it convincing and it's and

1081
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,480
it's like the snake amulet you know it's

1082
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:43,318
fine until they actually deal with

1083
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:45,280
something where it wasn't fine enough or

1084
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:48,199
they were benefiting from something else

1085
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:50,559
potentially um another in this rut and

1086
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:53,799
so that kind of thing too is problematic

1087
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:56,920
I think and uh is why I try to be so

1088
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:59,079
empirical all the time sure I mean if if

1089
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:02,680
feels like another um confusion of cause

1090
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:06,200
and correlation um just like if you if

1091
00:47:02,679 --> 00:47:08,480
you go um oh I have uh the the

1092
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:09,799
healthiest crops the the most productive

1093
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,960
crops that I have are from the

1094
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:14,559
healthiest plants and my healthiest

1095
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:17,599
plants don't have pest problems so the

1096
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:20,559
health of my plants is causing the pests

1097
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:22,920
to go away and it uh not necessarily

1098
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:27,119
it's probably more about your either

1099
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:28,760
refined or um adequate integrated Pest

1100
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,280
Management applications that are causing

1101
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,920
the pest to go away which are causing

1102
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,400
your plants to be healthier which is

1103
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,280
causing your yields to go up or your

1104
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,318
quality to go up or or something along

1105
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:42,319
those lines I I see it all the time uh

1106
00:47:39,318 --> 00:47:45,000
especially um you know in facilities

1107
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:49,039
where people were battling pests of some

1108
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,480
kind and then they are able to either

1109
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:53,440
reduce them below the economic threshold

1110
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,079
or remove them all together and all of a

1111
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:58,720
sudden everything is working so much

1112
00:47:55,079 --> 00:48:01,960
better um and it does kind of show how

1113
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:03,919
important it is to have uh a really good

1114
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:07,039
integrated P Pest Management either

1115
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:09,720
specialist like yourself uh on call or a

1116
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:13,960
really good plan in place that can be

1117
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:18,078
applied by the staff already

1118
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:19,920
um what are some of the um the biggest

1119
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:24,079
things that you're seeing currently that

1120
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:27,039
people are battling with in uh in Pest

1121
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:30,240
Management um whether that be like pest

1122
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:34,159
themselves or the application of

1123
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:36,318
specific uh protocols or

1124
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:39,039
methods uh well it's kind of related to

1125
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:40,920
the one before I would say like um crop

1126
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:42,960
scouting like there's various pests that

1127
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,960
are really common again I've been on a

1128
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:48,280
kick on that respect for pests and part

1129
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:50,039
of that respect is like um you know like

1130
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:52,599
resistance capabilities like you had

1131
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:57,119
mentioned just now pretty Prett pretty

1132
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:59,079
eloquently um and the importance of like

1133
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:02,440
understanding that like maybe this

1134
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:04,798
season it was okay uh and maybe for many

1135
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,358
seasons in your particular area it's

1136
00:49:04,798 --> 00:49:09,559
just fine you get passed over like

1137
00:49:06,358 --> 00:49:11,279
that's just statistics it happens um

1138
00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:13,720
people ask me like like you just said

1139
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,160
with the IPM plan like oh what you know

1140
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:18,598
why don't use that why am I okay I don't

1141
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:20,118
know it just you know but maybe like

1142
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:21,519
maybe in if I can't tell you I can't

1143
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:25,039
prove a negative I don't know what to

1144
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:28,559
tell you um no maybe this maybe the

1145
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:31,039
amul's real okay but no um but my but

1146
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,880
the thing that I think a lot of people

1147
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:36,759
you know a big thing for me I think is

1148
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:38,559
is having the logistical bandwidth to

1149
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:41,000
evaluate your own crop at a regular

1150
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:45,160
interval uh seems to be like the start

1151
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,480
and stop of a lot of issues um again

1152
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:50,118
like people can do things like probably

1153
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:52,400
your experience has been this as well um

1154
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:56,000
you know you had the right plan it just

1155
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:58,519
didn't get executed as timely as maybe

1156
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,280
would have been IDE deal um and then you

1157
00:49:58,519 --> 00:50:03,679
have knockoff effects on that and so on

1158
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,839
the often times being able to sort of

1159
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:08,078
really ship that up the problem is that

1160
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:09,920
it does require investment of time it

1161
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:11,880
does require sometimes that you trust

1162
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,119
somebody or you are going to be the

1163
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,440
person who does it and then you trust

1164
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:17,440
somebody with something else that you

1165
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:20,679
couldn't trust somebody with before um

1166
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:23,639
so that's kind of like it's I think that

1167
00:50:20,679 --> 00:50:27,318
is like the the pre- barrier to even

1168
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:28,719
considering it so that is what do you

1169
00:50:27,318 --> 00:50:32,920
think about

1170
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:34,679
that um I I do find that especially when

1171
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:37,358
it comes to the commercial application

1172
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:40,679
of things that having

1173
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:42,679
a um a preventative measure in place

1174
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:47,000
rather than a reactive measure in place

1175
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:50,159
is always going to be your best bet and

1176
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,440
by yes putting that responsibility into

1177
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:54,639
someone else's hands you're saying that

1178
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:57,358
I I'm prioritizing this responsibility

1179
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:59,920
to someone other than myself hopefully

1180
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:03,199
that is due to the case that you're

1181
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:05,559
prioritizing higher or or more important

1182
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:08,838
things to your own

1183
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:10,760
responsibilities um but in some cases uh

1184
00:51:08,838 --> 00:51:13,119
I found like even even with some of the

1185
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:15,480
more simple tasks within a grow

1186
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:19,200
environment that by taking those on

1187
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:21,280
yourselves and passing on a more complex

1188
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:23,919
um aspect of the grow to someone else it

1189
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,880
not only teaches them but it also helps

1190
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:29,480
make sure that you can then rely on them

1191
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:32,280
further with uh even bigger more um

1192
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:34,358
important tasks in the future but it

1193
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:37,160
does mean that you have to trust them

1194
00:51:34,358 --> 00:51:41,159
and especially with IPM it's one of

1195
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:45,679
those things that if you don't

1196
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:50,440
uh I guess misplaced trust can be a huge

1197
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:51,480
huge downfall in um in certain aspects

1198
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,720
of

1199
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:58,199
cultivation uh one of the things that

1200
00:51:53,719 --> 00:52:03,480
I've experienced recently was we had a

1201
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:06,118
few aphids um in in the grow and they

1202
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:08,798
came in off of cuting that we took from

1203
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:12,680
an outdoor population trying to preserve

1204
00:52:08,798 --> 00:52:16,400
them from a feno hunt uh those aphids

1205
00:52:12,679 --> 00:52:19,598
came inside we tried to isolate them we

1206
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:22,119
then uh had a spreading event of some

1207
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:24,480
kind can't pinpoint it down to exactly

1208
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:27,400
when it happened but it did we were then

1209
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:30,159
able to Target and treat those pests

1210
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:33,599
while continuing to try to stay on top

1211
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:37,598
of the rest of the crop without applying

1212
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:39,960
harsh chemicals or a harsh chemistry and

1213
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:41,640
that eventually led to you know small

1214
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,880
populations moving throughout the

1215
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:48,159
facility and eventually ending up in a

1216
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:51,240
flowering room and uh you know making

1217
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:54,399
part of the crop um UNH harvestable

1218
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:57,078
basically uh

1219
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,680
which you know you you can't necessarily

1220
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:00,798
say well it's because we brought the

1221
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:02,679
cuting in from outside I mean yes you

1222
00:53:00,798 --> 00:53:04,559
could go all the way back to that and

1223
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:07,199
say that's the exact reason why we had

1224
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:10,119
aphids and of course that is the reason

1225
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:13,239
why we had aphids but there were other

1226
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:16,559
potential ways to prevent their spread

1227
00:53:13,239 --> 00:53:19,279
that necessarily either weren't

1228
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:22,119
addressed early enough or aggressively

1229
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:25,920
enough and we eventually had a little

1230
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:27,400
bit of crop loss um and you know that is

1231
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,480
also

1232
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:32,720
in mind keeping in mind that we we

1233
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,559
really did try to stay on top of it and

1234
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:36,759
we

1235
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:39,280
were I think the the biggest downfall

1236
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:41,680
was trying to bring clones in from

1237
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,960
outside um which is something that I

1238
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:46,318
don't plan on doing in the future but it

1239
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:49,519
was something that we at least can now

1240
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:53,119
say hey we did a lot to try and prevent

1241
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:54,838
the spread of both pathogens and pests

1242
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:56,798
and it didn't work so we either need to

1243
00:53:54,838 --> 00:53:58,838
try something different next time this

1244
00:53:56,798 --> 00:54:01,318
happens or we need to say we just don't

1245
00:53:58,838 --> 00:54:03,558
have it within our bandwidth to prevent

1246
00:54:01,318 --> 00:54:06,838
this from happening so we just should

1247
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:10,280
prevent it by not doing

1248
00:54:06,838 --> 00:54:12,798
it I feel like well like for example the

1249
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:15,960
fact that you even were was able to

1250
00:54:12,798 --> 00:54:18,798
recount you were able to recount all of

1251
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,599
that and maybe part of it supposition

1252
00:54:18,798 --> 00:54:22,159
you know like a lot of times you can't

1253
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:24,359
like you can't actually know you have to

1254
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:25,920
like trace and act like a detective and

1255
00:54:24,358 --> 00:54:27,838
kind of piece things together even

1256
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,680
though you can't like cast a spell and

1257
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:31,199
like know what happened I don't see

1258
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:33,279
their tracks through the grow right I

1259
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:35,118
don't see right exactly right but you

1260
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,640
know but like being able to kind of like

1261
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:39,960
forensically analyze yourself even and

1262
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:43,078
being able to have the team and and also

1263
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:45,039
the like you know wherewithal to do that

1264
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:46,880
even is like really important I mean

1265
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:49,079
that that's really commendable because

1266
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,318
that's what allows you to make those

1267
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:53,318
informed decisions afterwards and have

1268
00:54:51,318 --> 00:54:56,719
and hopefully maybe even have data

1269
00:54:53,318 --> 00:54:58,119
ideally you would like uh you know you

1270
00:54:56,719 --> 00:55:01,279
would you would

1271
00:54:58,119 --> 00:55:03,400
have you know tracked it like during a

1272
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,400
quarantine phase you know so like taking

1273
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:08,119
the cuting isn't necessarily the bad

1274
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:10,519
part like you said it's like is it the

1275
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:12,640
fault of you taking cuting I mean in a

1276
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:16,039
way it's the fault that the person

1277
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:17,239
giving you the plants head bugs oh but

1278
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:19,039
you shouldn't trust them well it's not

1279
00:55:17,239 --> 00:55:20,959
about trust it's about fault so

1280
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,558
sometimes I think people naturally also

1281
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,838
I think are a little denigrating there

1282
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:27,839
too when it comes to like whose fault is

1283
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:29,599
it um I mean it was it was all our fault

1284
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:30,960
right like it was all our fault there's

1285
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:33,039
all our fault there's no one else that

1286
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,920
there was many layers right there's this

1287
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:37,400
like there's this like survivability

1288
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:39,280
onion and the first layer wrapped away

1289
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,880
and the second layer went away and also

1290
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,640
the third and the fourth so there were

1291
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:45,440
multiple small failures um but the fact

1292
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:47,118
that you even had checks in the is

1293
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:50,920
better than most people

1294
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:55,240
anyways fair enough yeah we

1295
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:58,159
um I I really like our approach to IPM

1296
00:55:55,239 --> 00:56:00,719
uh at the facility I help manage um it

1297
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:04,078
was helped design by uh Suzanne Wayne

1298
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:07,639
Wright Evans and she's also uh you know

1299
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:09,798
really well educated and and um

1300
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:13,279
approachable uh person like yourself

1301
00:56:09,798 --> 00:56:14,519
when it comes to cannabis pests um

1302
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,240
because there are a lot of people that

1303
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:19,880
don't necessarily have the direct

1304
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:23,639
experience with cannabis crops and pests

1305
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:25,559
or um or they're just applying uh

1306
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:27,598
chemistries that might work in other

1307
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:29,680
crops that have similar pests you know

1308
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:33,960
like they oh it's a soft-bodied insect

1309
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:36,440
we can use this um so I I do really

1310
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:39,798
appreciate it especially considering

1311
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:42,679
from someone like yourself who um as far

1312
00:56:39,798 --> 00:56:47,280
as I know were and might still be uh a

1313
00:56:42,679 --> 00:56:48,919
user of cannabis products um that you

1314
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,519
know applying the wrong chemistries at

1315
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:55,760
the wrong times makes the end product

1316
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:56,759
sometimes uh unusable for people with

1317
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,480
either

1318
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:02,640
specific uh conditions or ailments or

1319
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:06,280
sensitivities

1320
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:10,199
um uh what I guess uh to get back though

1321
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:11,319
to some of your experience within the

1322
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:13,639
Cannabis

1323
00:57:11,318 --> 00:57:16,440
cultivation uh

1324
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:18,519
industry what what are some of the uh

1325
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:20,920
biggest successes that you've seen where

1326
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:23,519
you went into a facility they had a huge

1327
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:26,440
problem you gave them

1328
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:30,599
a maybe even like a simple plan and they

1329
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:34,880
followed it and boom took care of

1330
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:37,440
it oh uh my favorite example probably is

1331
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:40,039
from dramar again just because of the

1332
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:42,159
scale and one of my one of my earlier

1333
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:45,799
ones earliest ones where I felt like I

1334
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:47,000
was super valuable uh was um actually

1335
00:57:45,798 --> 00:57:49,480
one of the major one of the major

1336
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:53,000
reasons I was even contracted with

1337
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:54,400
them was because they had some people

1338
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,599
who had been growing they had some

1339
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:59,480
workers who had been there for like 35 5

1340
00:57:56,599 --> 00:58:02,760
years um and they didn't want to learn

1341
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:05,719
how to use new technology like an iPad

1342
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,640
uh to scout for plants um and if I'm

1343
00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:09,639
being

1344
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:13,078
honest uh you know they were extremely

1345
00:58:09,639 --> 00:58:14,598
talented people um and and I totally get

1346
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:17,640
not wanting to like learn something some

1347
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:21,160
new fangled thing but unfortunately you

1348
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:23,639
know they were duplicating data a lot um

1349
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:25,639
and so that took a lot of their time uh

1350
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:28,639
but the pest that they dealt with that

1351
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:32,759
we we together developed a system for

1352
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:36,000
was a leaf Miner fly in Gerra daisies

1353
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:37,520
not normally a pest of Gerra but um for

1354
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,719
those who don't know what Leaf Miner is

1355
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:44,199
it's a um it's a fly uh usually Lial

1356
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:47,118
Misa um they have a yellow black body

1357
00:58:44,199 --> 00:58:50,919
and they're kind of pretty mosa Pinta

1358
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:53,519
the painted fly in Spanish and um what

1359
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:55,838
would happen is that the larv are are

1360
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:57,639
laid in the leaf materials eggs and then

1361
00:58:55,838 --> 00:58:59,358
they as they grow together they create

1362
00:58:57,639 --> 00:59:01,000
these like patterns in the leaves cuz

1363
00:58:59,358 --> 00:59:02,639
they're they're mining through it

1364
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,199
creating these tunnels and then they

1365
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:07,038
come out they pupate become a fly and

1366
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:09,598
the cycle continues

1367
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:12,400
now uh their leaves had gotten

1368
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:16,039
skeletonized they were so full of leaf

1369
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:19,039
minor fly um and they got really bad I I

1370
00:59:16,039 --> 00:59:21,640
still remember the weeks um the peak

1371
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:25,160
time we would get them is week 29 so

1372
00:59:21,639 --> 00:59:26,920
weeks 29 through 32 was like I think if

1373
00:59:25,159 --> 00:59:29,159
I'm checking my name my time right

1374
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:33,159
that's like the dead of Summer like June

1375
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:36,000
or July somewhere um and we would see we

1376
00:59:33,159 --> 00:59:38,480
would use this iPad uh we would track

1377
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,679
the uh numbers of flies that we would

1378
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,318
get on the glue traps that we put in

1379
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:44,159
each greenhouse and somebody would come

1380
00:59:42,318 --> 00:59:46,880
around collect all of them literally

1381
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:48,440
count all of them input that information

1382
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:51,480
into a data program and then we wouldd

1383
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:53,599
see that data visualize very key not a

1384
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:57,240
lot of people do this but it's really

1385
00:59:53,599 --> 01:00:00,240
useful because when we release these

1386
00:59:57,239 --> 01:00:02,558
wasps called diglyphus which we've used

1387
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:04,399
um several times in the past uh we would

1388
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:06,200
get some effect but event but we were

1389
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,720
able to use the data to see exactly when

1390
01:00:06,199 --> 01:00:10,439
the leaf miners would go up I did a

1391
01:00:07,719 --> 01:00:12,838
regression analysis to kind of check the

1392
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:16,079
relationship and um basically long story

1393
01:00:12,838 --> 01:00:21,558
short we saved uh like

1394
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:23,720
$250,000 of um basically product loss a

1395
01:00:21,559 --> 01:00:26,319
combination of a product gain or getting

1396
01:00:23,719 --> 01:00:28,000
rid of the loss and uh more efficient

1397
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:29,960
use of the diglyphus which were pretty

1398
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:34,239
expensive at like 50 cents a wasp and

1399
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:35,240
you get like hundreds at a time um that

1400
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:39,078
is

1401
01:00:35,239 --> 01:00:41,679
expensive um as a as a you know if

1402
01:00:39,079 --> 01:00:43,960
you're releasing a mass population into

1403
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:45,919
a uh what I'm assuming is like a large

1404
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:48,559
Greenhouse area or something like that

1405
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:51,039
with you know active fans and stuff that

1406
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:54,599
are just going to decimate any bugs that

1407
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:57,920
get pulled into those streams and

1408
01:00:54,599 --> 01:01:01,039
um but was it just by adjusting the

1409
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:04,119
release date perhaps um in correlation

1410
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:06,200
to the population boom to help make sure

1411
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:09,079
that it kept it under

1412
01:01:06,199 --> 01:01:11,598
control yeah so like that that those

1413
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:14,480
like two or three weeks are like the the

1414
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:16,280
place where we get like the most damage

1415
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,039
because you're seeing the adults so the

1416
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:21,119
adults the adult population goes up so

1417
01:01:18,039 --> 01:01:22,240
the laral population is about to go up

1418
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:23,358
and then you don't see that because

1419
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:25,318
they're not in the sticky card and then

1420
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:27,558
you see the adult population next the

1421
01:01:25,318 --> 01:01:31,440
next week or two

1422
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:34,440
so uh being really successful here was

1423
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,798
allowed us allowed me to convince um you

1424
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,639
know my

1425
01:01:35,798 --> 01:01:39,798
collaborators the people who hired me

1426
01:01:37,639 --> 01:01:41,558
the admin staff were loved it the people

1427
01:01:39,798 --> 01:01:44,358
who had to who had to learn how to use

1428
01:01:41,559 --> 01:01:46,798
the iPad were not huge fans uh at the

1429
01:01:44,358 --> 01:01:48,480
beginning uh but then you know they just

1430
01:01:46,798 --> 01:01:51,798
couldn't look at that and

1431
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:53,798
go whatever uh so they were really that

1432
01:01:51,798 --> 01:01:56,119
allowed them to buy into a process that

1433
01:01:53,798 --> 01:01:57,838
actually made their lives really simple

1434
01:01:56,119 --> 01:02:01,039
once they learned how to use it and then

1435
01:01:57,838 --> 01:02:03,278
then they really liked it um and yeah it

1436
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:05,559
was adjustment of the timing for that

1437
01:02:03,278 --> 01:02:07,400
but then it also made us not have to buy

1438
01:02:05,559 --> 01:02:09,640
so many in the future too so it was kind

1439
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:12,079
of a double whammy and then we continued

1440
01:02:09,639 --> 01:02:14,679
to do that for the rest of that season

1441
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:16,160
and then moving into um you know because

1442
01:02:14,679 --> 01:02:20,038
like Valentine's Day and Mother's Day

1443
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:22,000
are the biggest flower days so we really

1444
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:23,559
couldn't we couldn't let the dam the

1445
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,358
plants get super damaged because they

1446
01:02:23,559 --> 01:02:27,680
were we would have them for multiple

1447
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:28,719
years so if they got really damaged in

1448
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:31,118
like

1449
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:33,278
summertime and then autumn and winter we

1450
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:35,480
wouldn't have as much sunlight so if

1451
01:02:33,278 --> 01:02:37,559
they come in they get stunted it gets

1452
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:39,639
cold and then they come into spring

1453
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:41,278
really raggedy and so that would have

1454
01:02:39,639 --> 01:02:43,199
this like multi-year effect

1455
01:02:41,278 --> 01:02:46,318
unfortunately so we were able to kick

1456
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:47,239
that um and it was really uh salubrious

1457
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:50,038
to their

1458
01:02:47,239 --> 01:02:53,318
health that's really cool I I do like

1459
01:02:50,039 --> 01:02:56,640
that sort of knock on effect of um when

1460
01:02:53,318 --> 01:03:00,199
when you can Target the pest early

1461
01:02:56,639 --> 01:03:02,358
um you know all of the ramifications of

1462
01:03:00,199 --> 01:03:05,399
that and the increase in plant health

1463
01:03:02,358 --> 01:03:08,400
over time um even in a short crop like

1464
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:10,720
cannabis is extremely beneficial um you

1465
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,880
know catching it early rather that's you

1466
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:15,278
know also why I had said earlier it's so

1467
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:21,039
much more beneficial to be preventive

1468
01:03:15,278 --> 01:03:21,920
than reactionary or reactive um so uh

1469
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:25,079
when

1470
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:28,559
when now with that being the the Gerber

1471
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:31,960
a daisies um have you had any sort of

1472
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:34,119
immediate uh successes where you you

1473
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:37,798
know you went and found the problem

1474
01:03:34,119 --> 01:03:40,039
analyzed the uh the what was causing the

1475
01:03:37,798 --> 01:03:42,559
problem and then were able to implement

1476
01:03:40,039 --> 01:03:45,200
a solution all within the course of

1477
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:50,160
perhaps one grow cycle within

1478
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:52,278
cannabis oh yeah oh yeah um uh for one

1479
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:56,159
example like rice through AIDS are

1480
01:03:52,278 --> 01:03:58,679
really common uh so like I I usually get

1481
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:00,719
like two schools of thought with people

1482
01:03:58,679 --> 01:04:02,480
one is people who have like one person

1483
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:04,798
told me recently it was like I'm going

1484
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:08,838
to paraphrase it but it was like my

1485
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:12,358
experience with aphids is um is like

1486
01:04:08,838 --> 01:04:14,759
small and harrowing you know like really

1487
01:04:12,358 --> 01:04:16,159
bad so the only experience I had was

1488
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,640
terrible but I don't have that much

1489
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:20,838
experience so you know people tell me it

1490
01:04:18,639 --> 01:04:22,400
can be dealt with can can we do this and

1491
01:04:20,838 --> 01:04:25,719
then we have people who have like kind

1492
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:27,760
of learned what works best for them and

1493
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:29,598
assuming that they like screen for them

1494
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:31,960
and they find them early there's there's

1495
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:33,400
no problem for them too so it's like it

1496
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:36,039
can be very different it can be very

1497
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:38,798
different but um I think my favorite

1498
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:42,720
example probably exists within a rice

1499
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:45,199
root aphid example where um I think my

1500
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:49,239
favorite one is when I was working with

1501
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:51,078
this indoor grow and they had been

1502
01:04:49,239 --> 01:04:53,558
dealing with rice through aid for like

1503
01:04:51,079 --> 01:04:56,278
two years at that point which I actually

1504
01:04:53,559 --> 01:04:59,079
wasn't aware of um at first

1505
01:04:56,278 --> 01:05:00,838
um they actually transplant they had to

1506
01:04:59,079 --> 01:05:04,160
bring all their plants from a different

1507
01:05:00,838 --> 01:05:06,719
location to this location um and they

1508
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:08,960
just kind of brought them with them um

1509
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:12,278
they were already aware of

1510
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:14,920
them uh and the main issue was basically

1511
01:05:12,278 --> 01:05:18,278
that I think it was it was really a

1512
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:20,559
matter of uh not getting enough

1513
01:05:18,278 --> 01:05:22,278
effectively coverage because they act

1514
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:24,319
well again kind of like other examples

1515
01:05:22,278 --> 01:05:27,000
I've mentioned like they knew some of

1516
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:29,880
the products to use um and they

1517
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,358
knew um that you had to apply it maybe

1518
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,798
more than once like that wasn't a

1519
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:35,880
mystery or anything uh but for whatever

1520
01:05:33,798 --> 01:05:38,199
reason it just wasn't enough and so we

1521
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:40,760
had to bump up the um we actually got

1522
01:05:38,199 --> 01:05:45,038
very creative uh we had to bump up the

1523
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:46,799
buvia basana produ uh use so for those

1524
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:49,680
who don't know that's a fungus that

1525
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:52,079
attacks various insects um in this case

1526
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:54,960
the rice root Aid and we actually ended

1527
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:56,318
up dunking I think a few times we

1528
01:05:54,960 --> 01:06:00,960
actually ended up like dunking the

1529
01:05:56,318 --> 01:06:04,440
entire pot in like a huge amount of like

1530
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:06,798
inocula and you could see all these AIDS

1531
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:09,960
get microsized like little furry puff

1532
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:11,679
balls all around the um the the pots and

1533
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:14,400
the and the roots and things when we

1534
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:17,798
would check and it was very significant

1535
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:21,240
it was laborious though um and we we had

1536
01:06:17,798 --> 01:06:23,960
to do it more than Thrice but it was

1537
01:06:21,239 --> 01:06:26,598
effective did you use any anything else

1538
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:29,199
with the Bavaria basana as a as a

1539
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:31,920
knockdown or anything um within that

1540
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:33,719
that root ball

1541
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:36,119
drenching yeah that's right we

1542
01:06:33,719 --> 01:06:38,358
alternated if I remember correctly uh

1543
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:41,440
between a pyin product and an aid

1544
01:06:38,358 --> 01:06:43,239
duratin product cool yeah those yeah

1545
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:46,480
which are usually my favorite one one

1546
01:06:43,239 --> 01:06:49,679
two punches yeah I I couldn't agree more

1547
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:51,278
those those three uh in conjunction seem

1548
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:55,159
to be the only thing that I've ever been

1549
01:06:51,278 --> 01:06:57,358
able to use in order to knock down um

1550
01:06:55,159 --> 01:06:59,358
rice rud AIDS cuz they're one of the

1551
01:06:57,358 --> 01:07:03,000
most pernicious pests that I've ever

1552
01:06:59,358 --> 01:07:05,598
dealt with in terms of that you think

1553
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,199
you get rid of them and then all of a

1554
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,720
sudden you see a flyer somewhere and

1555
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:10,399
you're just like [ __ ] that means

1556
01:07:08,719 --> 01:07:12,480
that there is a population somewhere

1557
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:16,440
that I have not been able to track down

1558
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:19,880
or eradicate and unlike

1559
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:22,119
um uh fungus nuts where you can pretty

1560
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:25,000
much you know scrape away the top layer

1561
01:07:22,119 --> 01:07:29,440
of potting mix that you're using uh

1562
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:32,639
apply something like bavia bosana or

1563
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:36,440
um uh is it basilis the andensis that

1564
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:40,639
works well on on um on uh fungus Nets as

1565
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:44,440
well oh yeah be basil is israelensis I

1566
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:47,639
think bti is the fly screen yeah exactly

1567
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:48,838
the mosquito dunks um yeah yeah so you

1568
01:07:47,639 --> 01:07:51,440
know you can get rid of those pretty

1569
01:07:48,838 --> 01:07:54,119
easily but then with with rice root

1570
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:56,798
aphids they seem to be able to burrow uh

1571
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:59,039
well into the pot and unless you really

1572
01:07:56,798 --> 01:08:00,719
get a good drench through the entire

1573
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:02,000
substrate it seems as though they just

1574
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:05,278
aren't

1575
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:09,159
necessarily uh they're just not easy to

1576
01:08:05,278 --> 01:08:12,760
get rid of um I recently found a product

1577
01:08:09,159 --> 01:08:15,879
botanigard Max where it is pyrin and

1578
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:18,759
Bavaria bosana and I have been really

1579
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:23,000
enjoying that for just uh preventative

1580
01:08:18,759 --> 01:08:26,319
um works well on

1581
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:29,198
uh uh fungus nuts as well so

1582
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:31,039
I but yeah finding the right chemistry I

1583
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:35,318
feel like that's and using the right

1584
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:36,838
Amounts is so important um it's uh what

1585
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:38,719
do I always hear the the label is the

1586
01:08:36,838 --> 01:08:41,880
law right so you have to make sure that

1587
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:43,560
you're following it correctly and um

1588
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:45,079
it's not just necessarily because they

1589
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:49,120
don't want it to be toxic because like

1590
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:51,439
some of these are are much safer than um

1591
01:08:49,119 --> 01:08:55,238
a lot of people are led to believe when

1592
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:57,039
the pesticide uh you know name is added

1593
01:08:55,238 --> 01:08:59,439
to to what it is you you feel like a lot

1594
01:08:57,039 --> 01:09:01,759
of pesticides I feel like just based on

1595
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:04,158
how media portrays them as being

1596
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:05,640
extremely dangerous even to humans uh

1597
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:09,399
but some of them are just very uh

1598
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:11,079
inocula to humans and uh but work only

1599
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:13,439
within the range that they're given you

1600
01:09:11,079 --> 01:09:15,880
know too much of it might eventually

1601
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:17,838
make uh some sort of resistance species

1602
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:21,079
in whatever you're trying to get rid of

1603
01:09:17,838 --> 01:09:23,158
or too little just doesn't do a thing um

1604
01:09:21,079 --> 01:09:24,719
you know speaking of selection pressure

1605
01:09:23,158 --> 01:09:28,318
you know that's that's actually a thing

1606
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:30,399
that I think Cu uh um although people do

1607
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:32,359
appreciate it I think sometimes they

1608
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:36,838
don't appreciate that that also is true

1609
01:09:32,359 --> 01:09:38,400
for things like Biologicals too um even

1610
01:09:36,838 --> 01:09:41,439
copper I remember I was reading an

1611
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:44,920
article from last year uh there was a

1612
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:47,198
type of aphid uh that was colonizing

1613
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:49,640
pepper plants in the Netherlands and

1614
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:51,519
other parts of Europe and the reason why

1615
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:54,560
copper made a statement was because they

1616
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:57,600
found that actually the aphid was um

1617
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:59,760
resistant to paraso wasp I'm not sure

1618
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:02,360
how they Quantified that or or anything

1619
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:04,600
but uh if they're talking about it then

1620
01:10:02,359 --> 01:10:07,279
you know I assume that they're willing

1621
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:08,960
to be for forthright you know because

1622
01:10:07,279 --> 01:10:10,800
you'd have no reason to mention that

1623
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:12,600
like kind of perversely incentivized not

1624
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,000
to mention that but it's very

1625
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,520
responsible thing to say if you feel

1626
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:19,359
like that's true and we know that

1627
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:23,920
there's aphids that have like little uh

1628
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:25,960
viral um symbient of their bacteria in

1629
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:28,000
their body that that create toxins that

1630
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:30,439
kill these wasy

1631
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,000
so yeah that's how it works so there's a

1632
01:10:30,439 --> 01:10:36,319
bacterio phage normally those kill

1633
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:38,679
bacteria but it's actually lysogenic so

1634
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:41,960
it's actually integrated into the Genome

1635
01:10:38,679 --> 01:10:45,480
of the bacteria and then that bacteria

1636
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:48,000
has is in the um hamiltonella defensa is

1637
01:10:45,479 --> 01:10:51,198
in the uh is one example at least where

1638
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:55,399
this process happens in a lot of aphids

1639
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:58,079
and um so when the WASP puts it I know

1640
01:10:55,399 --> 01:11:02,079
right puts this egg in the body uh the

1641
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:04,319
bacteria produces these um these toxins

1642
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:06,519
and they kill the The larva as it

1643
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:08,399
develops um and then also different

1644
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:11,400
bacteria fages have different mutations

1645
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:14,679
of these toxins that um make them more

1646
01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:17,599
or less survivable so it's really uh

1647
01:11:14,679 --> 01:11:19,359
really complex and um I think that

1648
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,960
although it's not really possible to

1649
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:23,479
check for this sort of thing in the

1650
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:26,359
field um it's the kind of thing where

1651
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:29,799
like like if you know this it Alters

1652
01:11:26,359 --> 01:11:32,399
your perspective on on ecology on your

1653
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:34,440
Sops so the more you know the better

1654
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:37,279
right it makes me think of the the

1655
01:11:34,439 --> 01:11:40,719
Marvel villain Venom where it's a like a

1656
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:43,719
symbiote that that helps the you know

1657
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:46,600
the wrong doings of this uh of this of

1658
01:11:43,719 --> 01:11:48,319
this villain almost like where the the

1659
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:50,280
uh the aphids are the villain in this

1660
01:11:48,319 --> 01:11:51,960
but of course just uh me

1661
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:54,439
anthropomorphizing

1662
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:56,880
them no but like no I get what you're

1663
01:11:54,439 --> 01:12:00,119
saying no it's true true it's a it's a

1664
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:01,560
deadly dance deadly dance it is it is I

1665
01:12:00,119 --> 01:12:04,639
I you know one of the things that I'm

1666
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:07,120
always so very concerned about is the

1667
01:12:04,639 --> 01:12:11,000
overuse of specific pesticides like

1668
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:14,119
pyrans where um considering it is just

1669
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,920
like a contact kill uh due to the I I

1670
01:12:14,119 --> 01:12:19,359
believe it interferes with the nervous

1671
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:21,399
system of the of the pest um that there

1672
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:24,119
can be resiliences that develop in

1673
01:12:21,399 --> 01:12:25,638
populations over time and so again

1674
01:12:24,119 --> 01:12:28,000
that's also why applying the correct

1675
01:12:25,639 --> 01:12:30,960
amount of chemistry is so important

1676
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:34,359
because if you don't kill them

1677
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:35,960
um rapidly uh or at least knock down the

1678
01:12:34,359 --> 01:12:38,238
population rapidly then you have that

1679
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:41,760
much more potential for them to gain

1680
01:12:38,238 --> 01:12:44,439
these different resiliences um are there

1681
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:46,840
any experiences uh like that that you've

1682
01:12:44,439 --> 01:12:48,439
faced where people were applying the

1683
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:50,440
same product over and over and over

1684
01:12:48,439 --> 01:12:53,439
again and a pest just eventually worked

1685
01:12:50,439 --> 01:12:55,839
its way back into their

1686
01:12:53,439 --> 01:12:57,599
settings uh yeah

1687
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:01,440
sometimes it's hard to

1688
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:05,120
confirm um it's hard to be like like

1689
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:07,198
really like epistemologically sure uh

1690
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:09,399
but sometimes it's a little bit

1691
01:13:07,198 --> 01:13:12,479
easier uh the example that always comes

1692
01:13:09,399 --> 01:13:15,879
to my mind was is a like La grower I

1693
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:17,718
worked with maybe six years ago now and

1694
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:20,840
they had

1695
01:13:17,719 --> 01:13:23,399
um they had a rice rud aord

1696
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:25,520
problem but they had they had

1697
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:27,079
ostensively they had gotten rid of it

1698
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:30,480
they had no problems for a long time

1699
01:13:27,079 --> 01:13:32,639
they checked everything and then uh I

1700
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:35,119
didn't find out this part until later

1701
01:13:32,639 --> 01:13:39,119
but we found that they had recently

1702
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:41,198
uprooted a bunch of like this like like

1703
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:44,279
Virginia creeper vine or some other kind

1704
01:13:41,198 --> 01:13:46,960
of Vine I forget now but like Ivy or

1705
01:13:44,279 --> 01:13:49,319
something that was all across their

1706
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:54,520
building and that's one of the hosts for

1707
01:13:49,319 --> 01:13:56,880
Rice fruit aphid oh no um yeah so so it

1708
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:59,239
seems like and also the reason why I was

1709
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:01,840
so sure was there was also like uh like

1710
01:13:59,238 --> 01:14:04,359
like feral barley or Rye or whatever

1711
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:07,319
that you see in cracks and sidewalks and

1712
01:14:04,359 --> 01:14:10,000
places you know everywhere and I pulled

1713
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:11,639
out the roots and it's like there's a

1714
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,359
rice rud Aid right there you know and

1715
01:14:11,639 --> 01:14:15,840
there were a couple of others that were

1716
01:14:13,359 --> 01:14:18,158
on like the plants and um you know in in

1717
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:19,960
the in the property space and they had

1718
01:14:18,158 --> 01:14:23,679
this

1719
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:25,198
door um going inside and it was like an

1720
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:28,199
inch

1721
01:14:25,198 --> 01:14:32,319
like of of like CLE clearance which is

1722
01:14:28,198 --> 01:14:33,919
you know spacious for Rice fruit Aid um

1723
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:36,039
and so I think that's what happened I

1724
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:38,719
think maybe even the rice perhaps the

1725
01:14:36,039 --> 01:14:41,600
rice AIDS were inevitable at some point

1726
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:43,359
um based on their proximity but you know

1727
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:45,320
you might have had a happier couple of

1728
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:47,000
Seasons um if you if that hadn't

1729
01:14:45,319 --> 01:14:49,399
happened so funny things that you don't

1730
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:52,198
think about can become a huge

1731
01:14:49,399 --> 01:14:54,319
issue and then the same thing is true on

1732
01:14:52,198 --> 01:14:56,439
a macro scale so if you accept that as

1733
01:14:54,319 --> 01:14:59,479
true you know we should also consider

1734
01:14:56,439 --> 01:15:02,279
that as people grow more whether it's at

1735
01:14:59,479 --> 01:15:05,158
their home or commercially or whatever

1736
01:15:02,279 --> 01:15:07,519
um you know things like certain budw

1737
01:15:05,158 --> 01:15:09,519
worms cannabis aphids rice fruit aphid

1738
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:12,360
other pests that are common other places

1739
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,920
too you know maybe for 15 years

1740
01:15:12,359 --> 01:15:17,000
everything was fine growing where you

1741
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:19,319
are um and then suddenly this influx

1742
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,319
eventually builds up this critical mass

1743
01:15:19,319 --> 01:15:23,960
maybe it takes multiple years but then

1744
01:15:21,319 --> 01:15:25,759
once that started you know now you get

1745
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:27,600
you know powdery mil d

1746
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:30,400
um every year when you used to only get

1747
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:32,280
it sometimes and you know people have to

1748
01:15:30,399 --> 01:15:34,238
consider that that can happen right

1749
01:15:32,279 --> 01:15:37,319
things don't St the CH the same

1750
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:39,198
Everything Changes in a dynamic system

1751
01:15:37,319 --> 01:15:41,679
right absolutely it's

1752
01:15:39,198 --> 01:15:43,479
um yeah it goes back to some of the

1753
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:45,960
earlier examples we were talking about

1754
01:15:43,479 --> 01:15:48,678
of um just be like if you stay

1755
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:51,119
complacent within a specific system and

1756
01:15:48,679 --> 01:15:54,079
you don't necessarily look for the uh

1757
01:15:51,119 --> 01:15:57,679
potential pitfalls then you won't be

1758
01:15:54,079 --> 01:16:00,359
prepared when you run into them and um

1759
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:03,000
things especially like um pests and

1760
01:16:00,359 --> 01:16:05,000
pathogens that can build up sort of that

1761
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,399
threshold before they spill over and

1762
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:10,158
become recognizable you know whether it

1763
01:16:07,399 --> 01:16:12,198
be uh through mold like the Spore count

1764
01:16:10,158 --> 01:16:14,559
within a facility if you're not

1765
01:16:12,198 --> 01:16:17,399
maintaining uh something as simple as

1766
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:19,840
cleaning your floors uh and then you

1767
01:16:17,399 --> 01:16:22,479
kick up a bunch of dust and dirt all

1768
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:25,079
those spores get a nice little ride on

1769
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:27,599
the Airways over to whatever plants you

1770
01:16:25,079 --> 01:16:30,279
have a nice humid night and boom now you

1771
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:32,840
have more more spores than you had

1772
01:16:30,279 --> 01:16:36,039
before because you have fruiting bodies

1773
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:38,520
um and so it it can definitely be a a

1774
01:16:36,039 --> 01:16:40,439
knock on event of just a

1775
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:43,000
continued

1776
01:16:40,439 --> 01:16:46,279
um you know continued maintenance and

1777
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:51,079
continued um upkeep of the little things

1778
01:16:46,279 --> 01:16:54,319
can make a huge difference in the end

1779
01:16:51,079 --> 01:16:57,600
um let's see what are what are um so

1780
01:16:54,319 --> 01:16:59,719
when you do deal with hom Growers um

1781
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:02,199
considering that you have a a presence

1782
01:16:59,719 --> 01:17:04,679
with the cheap hom Grow Show uh with the

1783
01:17:02,198 --> 01:17:06,879
growing with my fellow Growers and your

1784
01:17:04,679 --> 01:17:09,679
uh Instagram presence I know I

1785
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:11,480
personally have reached out to you for a

1786
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:13,319
quick question here and there about

1787
01:17:11,479 --> 01:17:15,399
something that I found within my grow

1788
01:17:13,319 --> 01:17:18,880
that I either couldn't find through a

1789
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:21,719
Google search or otherwise um what are

1790
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:25,199
some of the uh issues that you feel like

1791
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:28,679
new growers face that you could give

1792
01:17:25,198 --> 01:17:28,678
some advice on

1793
01:17:30,198 --> 01:17:35,399
here uh I already gave a couple of good

1794
01:17:32,639 --> 01:17:36,520
ones know your know your bugs know your

1795
01:17:35,399 --> 01:17:39,799
potential

1796
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:42,159
problems and also keep an open mind as a

1797
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:43,600
corollary uh that new things can happen

1798
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:44,879
too so you're not going to have the

1799
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,960
whole picture no one has the whole

1800
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:50,480
picture not even me um we just have I

1801
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:52,679
maybe I have one of the more whole

1802
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:54,919
pictures but um that's not the same

1803
01:17:52,679 --> 01:17:56,480
thing uh we're still learning things all

1804
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:59,399
the time with cannabis and that kind of

1805
01:17:56,479 --> 01:18:01,799
thing um I think that you also made some

1806
01:17:59,399 --> 01:18:06,599
really great points too uh just even

1807
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:09,880
basic hygiene is super invaluable um I

1808
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:11,320
think that having you know finding the

1809
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:13,719
time especially in a hom growth

1810
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:15,279
situation should be easiest in some ways

1811
01:18:13,719 --> 01:18:19,079
to be able to actually look over your

1812
01:18:15,279 --> 01:18:21,000
plants being very detailed um you know

1813
01:18:19,079 --> 01:18:23,519
looking you know don't just look at the

1814
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,920
leaves look under the leaves look if you

1815
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,960
can at the crown of the plant where it

1816
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:29,440
where it meets the substrate you know if

1817
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:32,399
you can up poot the plant and look at

1818
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:35,638
the roots do so um if that's

1819
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:40,039
tenable um you know be I would say make

1820
01:18:35,639 --> 01:18:42,800
a regular habit of looking for also um

1821
01:18:40,039 --> 01:18:44,960
typical signs of damage uh I have pest

1822
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:47,000
primer videos on my channel that goes

1823
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:48,198
over what they look like various pests

1824
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,679
and their damage and that kind of a

1825
01:18:48,198 --> 01:18:53,000
thing too but you know there's a lot of

1826
01:18:50,679 --> 01:18:56,239
really brilliant um

1827
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:59,238
academic um uh resources for people as

1828
01:18:56,238 --> 01:19:01,519
well so you know it's out there it's

1829
01:18:59,238 --> 01:19:03,039
it's very much out there um for free for

1830
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:04,920
people to learn so you just have to take

1831
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:07,079
a little bit of time and kind of learn

1832
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:09,039
some of those things that's super that's

1833
01:19:07,079 --> 01:19:10,840
like probably the best investment of

1834
01:19:09,039 --> 01:19:14,399
time you could you take like two or

1835
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:17,159
three hours even you know a day for a

1836
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:19,799
few weeks and you like really learn and

1837
01:19:17,158 --> 01:19:23,000
commit to memory some of these pests and

1838
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:24,800
their common um treatments and I think

1839
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,198
you'll you'll do really well uh

1840
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:29,639
especially if you're newer and that kind

1841
01:19:26,198 --> 01:19:33,198
of a thing um and I guess also like the

1842
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:35,279
the importance of um well I think I'll

1843
01:19:33,198 --> 01:19:37,759
I'll stay I'll I'll stop there H what do

1844
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:41,000
you think of that I think that's great

1845
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:42,960
um educate yourself absolutely is

1846
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,158
probably uh especially when it comes to

1847
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:48,399
pests and pathogens is going to be your

1848
01:19:45,158 --> 01:19:50,119
biggest tool um as a new grower uh if

1849
01:19:48,399 --> 01:19:53,079
you don't know what to look for uh you

1850
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:56,439
won't spot it when it's there and

1851
01:19:53,079 --> 01:20:00,840
sometimes catching Things Early is the

1852
01:19:56,439 --> 01:20:03,799
best way to um prevent a a an absolute

1853
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:05,760
loss in your crop as well as then you'll

1854
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:07,560
have that under your tool belt to say

1855
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,639
I've seen this I know what it looks like

1856
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:12,520
when it starts I might be able to catch

1857
01:20:09,639 --> 01:20:14,920
it earlier next time or if you did find

1858
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:16,480
a good way to get rid of it you can just

1859
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:18,399
say hey I'm just going to incorporate

1860
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:21,839
that in my preventative maintenance

1861
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:24,279
rather than um having to ever deal with

1862
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,920
this again but then you also have you

1863
01:20:24,279 --> 01:20:28,519
know the ability to deal with it if it

1864
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:30,199
comes up um so I I think that's great

1865
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:33,880
you know new new Growers especially when

1866
01:20:30,198 --> 01:20:36,359
it comes to pests and pathogens uh it's

1867
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:38,039
it's not necessarily a taboo subject but

1868
01:20:36,359 --> 01:20:41,319
it is something that people don't like

1869
01:20:38,039 --> 01:20:44,000
to talk about because um it's

1870
01:20:41,319 --> 01:20:45,920
frightening it uh to to think that you

1871
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,198
could lose all of this time and effort

1872
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:51,359
that you put into a grow uh just because

1873
01:20:49,198 --> 01:20:52,879
you miss the fact that there is some

1874
01:20:51,359 --> 01:20:55,158
bugs in there or miss the fact that

1875
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:59,000
there's some some mold in there

1876
01:20:55,158 --> 01:21:01,238
um and uh maybe maybe due to your

1877
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:03,479
circumstances if your plant has any mold

1878
01:21:01,238 --> 01:21:05,319
on it at all then you need to dispose of

1879
01:21:03,479 --> 01:21:07,559
it or turn it into Edibles or something

1880
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:11,198
like that um and that's not what you're

1881
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:14,080
Desiring in your end product um but you

1882
01:21:11,198 --> 01:21:16,839
know also considering just how big of

1883
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:18,479
a seems like a it like I don't know if

1884
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:19,760
taboo is the right word but it seems

1885
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:21,279
like it's just something where people

1886
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:24,039
don't want to talk about it they don't

1887
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:25,599
want to deal with it you know pests are

1888
01:21:24,039 --> 01:21:28,479
you know it's it's hard to deal with if

1889
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:31,120
you get them and it's um you know even

1890
01:21:28,479 --> 01:21:33,079
harder to anticipate sometimes how you

1891
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:35,119
need to prevent certain bugs at certain

1892
01:21:33,079 --> 01:21:38,000
times of years in certain environments

1893
01:21:35,119 --> 01:21:40,760
you know it's a lot to deal with um and

1894
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,639
with all that in consideration do you

1895
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:46,079
feel as though or what do you feel like

1896
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:48,880
maybe um swept under the rug a little

1897
01:21:46,079 --> 01:21:52,600
bit within the industry where people try

1898
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:55,639
to ignore perhaps the signs of issue

1899
01:21:52,600 --> 01:22:00,120
until it's too late

1900
01:21:55,639 --> 01:22:02,840
I think that sorry I think that a lot of

1901
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:04,519
uh I think a lot of it come I think an

1902
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:06,840
overs simple thing to say would be that

1903
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:09,320
it comes down to Ego but it's not really

1904
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:11,920
ego it's not really ego and here's what

1905
01:22:09,319 --> 01:22:15,359
I mean by that I think that that's maybe

1906
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:18,039
sometimes part of it but it's not like

1907
01:22:15,359 --> 01:22:19,599
it's not like a lot of people in my

1908
01:22:18,039 --> 01:22:21,679
experience not like a lot of people are

1909
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:24,039
growing whether it's cannabis or other

1910
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:26,359
crops um you know a lot of times you're

1911
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:30,238
not growing in a supportive environment

1912
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:31,519
so uh you know in a healthy relationship

1913
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:33,839
you're probably not going to get

1914
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:35,199
everything wrong ooh shocker but you're

1915
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:38,520
probably not going to get everything

1916
01:22:35,198 --> 01:22:41,119
right I should say ooh shocker um you

1917
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:43,440
will make a mistake at some point um the

1918
01:22:41,119 --> 01:22:46,158
question is how big of a mistake and the

1919
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:48,559
question also is you know are you know

1920
01:22:46,158 --> 01:22:50,238
does the company even appreciate that

1921
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:52,360
you did every all this other stuff saved

1922
01:22:50,238 --> 01:22:55,079
them tons of money did whatever talented

1923
01:22:52,359 --> 01:22:57,359
person um or you know I guess it depends

1924
01:22:55,079 --> 01:22:58,600
on severity of course but my point is

1925
01:22:57,359 --> 01:23:00,880
that a lot of times you're not even

1926
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:02,480
allowed to make mistakes a lot of times

1927
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:04,960
that is going to be a ding to your

1928
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:06,238
credibility or if something bad happens

1929
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:09,000
and it's not even your fault in the

1930
01:23:06,238 --> 01:23:12,158
first place a lot of times a

1931
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:15,119
Draconian um sort of overarching uh

1932
01:23:12,158 --> 01:23:18,119
perspective is the context and so that

1933
01:23:15,119 --> 01:23:20,158
causes and it's very common agriculture

1934
01:23:18,119 --> 01:23:23,198
um especially a lot of like super

1935
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:26,519
hierarchy right so if that's the case

1936
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:28,719
then there's not a perverse incentive to

1937
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:33,360
not admit that you either know something

1938
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:36,399
is a problem or that you um did anything

1939
01:23:33,359 --> 01:23:38,519
wrong sure and that doesn't create a

1940
01:23:36,399 --> 01:23:40,920
healthy system for

1941
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:43,960
flexibility no and and I feel like

1942
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:46,239
especially considering uh and maybe this

1943
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:49,000
might be more a cannabis specific

1944
01:23:46,238 --> 01:23:51,599
scenario but there is so much branding

1945
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:55,520
behind the different uh successful

1946
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:57,560
businesses within this industry that if

1947
01:23:55,520 --> 01:24:01,760
yeah like no one wants to be associated

1948
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:03,120
with improper practices um you know if

1949
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,600
if you say Hey you like the way that

1950
01:24:03,119 --> 01:24:06,519
that smokes awesome I've been spraying

1951
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:09,880
it with chemicals all the way up to week

1952
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:11,679
four of uh flour and it still had mold

1953
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:14,960
and some pests on it how do you like it

1954
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:16,359
now um you know some people are going to

1955
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,880
you know stare at you blank face because

1956
01:24:16,359 --> 01:24:20,119
they have no idea that cannabis was

1957
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:22,079
grown as a plant in a crop you know

1958
01:24:20,119 --> 01:24:23,719
scenario and then some people are some

1959
01:24:22,079 --> 01:24:24,880
people are going to be disgusted by that

1960
01:24:23,719 --> 01:24:27,679
and say

1961
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:30,159
oh well that's because you're growing

1962
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:32,279
non-organically uh that's because you're

1963
01:24:30,158 --> 01:24:33,799
you know you know this that and the

1964
01:24:32,279 --> 01:24:36,840
other thing that they can start to point

1965
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:40,760
fingers at um but yeah it's a p

1966
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:42,840
perception is huge um when it comes to

1967
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:47,600
uh branding and and the development of

1968
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:49,480
Brands and the ability to maintain uh uh

1969
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:53,320
you know a profitable business model

1970
01:24:49,479 --> 01:24:56,158
within what is currently one of probably

1971
01:24:53,319 --> 01:24:57,880
the I feel like it has like the the

1972
01:24:56,158 --> 01:25:00,279
biggest highs and the biggest lows right

1973
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:02,760
now out of an agricultural industry

1974
01:25:00,279 --> 01:25:05,840
within the country uh maybe not outside

1975
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:07,600
of the country but um for sure and

1976
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,520
through my experience it it seems like

1977
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,880
you know people want cannabis and they

1978
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:12,520
want really good cannabis but they don't

1979
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:14,400
want to keep spending more money on it

1980
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:18,520
if it keeps getting better they don't

1981
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:21,158
want to um learn more about it if

1982
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:23,760
there's more to be learned about it uh

1983
01:25:21,158 --> 01:25:26,638
they just want the product which is

1984
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:28,639
unfortunate Ely uh you know we are

1985
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:31,079
within this capitalistic economy that we

1986
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:33,400
live in and it's kind of par for the

1987
01:25:31,079 --> 01:25:36,079
course

1988
01:25:33,399 --> 01:25:38,079
um you know I keep hearing people say

1989
01:25:36,079 --> 01:25:39,800
that oh at some point this is going to

1990
01:25:38,079 --> 01:25:41,639
turn around the different the price

1991
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:43,159
points of the different pounds that

1992
01:25:41,639 --> 01:25:45,760
people can sell within the commercial

1993
01:25:43,158 --> 01:25:48,039
Market um or that you know things are

1994
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:50,239
going to get better uh but I I just

1995
01:25:48,039 --> 01:25:54,359
don't really see that happening I you

1996
01:25:50,238 --> 01:25:59,319
know as the as the cost of production

1997
01:25:54,359 --> 01:26:01,000
continues to go down the the product is

1998
01:25:59,319 --> 01:26:03,158
going to need to cost less as well and

1999
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:05,319
as there's more Supply the and the

2000
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:09,198
demand isn't necessarily going up it's

2001
01:26:05,319 --> 01:26:12,679
going to also Drive the price down and

2002
01:26:09,198 --> 01:26:17,319
so we're in for a reckoning of some kind

2003
01:26:12,679 --> 01:26:20,840
uh at you know to say the least um but I

2004
01:26:17,319 --> 01:26:23,118
do I do think that you know

2005
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:25,000
uh you know people don't yeah people

2006
01:26:23,118 --> 01:26:26,319
don't really like to talk about the pest

2007
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,520
aspect of things and they really don't

2008
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:32,559
want to be viewed as someone who has

2009
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:34,639
done something wrong um you know and and

2010
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:36,560
I see how you could say that it is ego

2011
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:38,960
but also how it it may not necessarily

2012
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:41,159
be completely tied to Ego because you

2013
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:44,800
know it is an ego that's selling your

2014
01:26:41,158 --> 01:26:46,439
product um it you know that may be I

2015
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:48,840
mean depending on the brand right maybe

2016
01:26:46,439 --> 01:26:51,759
your brand is entirely egotistical and

2017
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:53,360
all about yourself but um you know if

2018
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:55,199
you're if you're hurting the brand or if

2019
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:59,039
you're hurting the reputation of a

2020
01:26:55,198 --> 01:27:04,118
company then um ego does not help it

2021
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:06,158
become uh you know re-rated to the

2022
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:09,759
community yeah I I mean I think you made

2023
01:27:06,158 --> 01:27:12,759
a really Salient Point um and I mean

2024
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:14,400
also from your perspective is one of of

2025
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:16,239
information or of sorry of being

2026
01:27:14,399 --> 01:27:18,799
informed because you have this sort of

2027
01:27:16,238 --> 01:27:21,479
um you know this cultivation experience

2028
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:24,239
here right to draw from and like yeah

2029
01:27:21,479 --> 01:27:27,678
and I guess like I'm I guess I'm very

2030
01:27:24,238 --> 01:27:30,559
I'm very hesitant to

2031
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:32,920
blame uh like the individual for

2032
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:35,119
everything um I do believe in in you

2033
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:37,199
know individual like responsibility and

2034
01:27:35,118 --> 01:27:39,599
all that kind of stuff uh but you know

2035
01:27:37,198 --> 01:27:41,599
it's more like it's more like it comes

2036
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:42,800
from like a game theory perspective

2037
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:45,159
rather than you know like it's like the

2038
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:47,239
buck stops here like if I was taught you

2039
01:27:45,158 --> 01:27:49,679
know I there was a pathway we didn't

2040
01:27:47,238 --> 01:27:51,718
investigate this in this um talk but

2041
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:54,480
like there was a time in my life where I

2042
01:27:51,719 --> 01:27:56,520
wanted to join the US Army um up till

2043
01:27:54,479 --> 01:27:58,759
like middle of my teens and I didn't

2044
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:01,080
actually end up doing that of course but

2045
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:04,039
like I was taught I had Army instructors

2046
01:28:01,079 --> 01:28:06,479
and things um going to a military school

2047
01:28:04,039 --> 01:28:08,039
and stuff like that where uh you know

2048
01:28:06,479 --> 01:28:10,039
you were supposed to take that personal

2049
01:28:08,039 --> 01:28:12,479
responsibility so I get that I

2050
01:28:10,039 --> 01:28:14,719
understand that um but like at the same

2051
01:28:12,479 --> 01:28:18,638
time uh you you could be like the most

2052
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:21,679
rational person you know uh and like you

2053
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:24,159
understand that if I if I admit it to it

2054
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:27,000
and I'm in a system that's not rational

2055
01:28:24,158 --> 01:28:29,079
then I can't act in the rational normal

2056
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,719
way um I feel like I'm going to be

2057
01:28:29,079 --> 01:28:33,079
vulnerable and I don't actually think

2058
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:34,239
I'm going to be project like protected

2059
01:28:33,079 --> 01:28:36,238
and if you're in an environment like

2060
01:28:34,238 --> 01:28:37,879
that like a lot of people then it it's

2061
01:28:36,238 --> 01:28:40,279
the system you have to look at the

2062
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:43,480
system you look at the ecosystem look at

2063
01:28:40,279 --> 01:28:45,519
the cultivation system um it's all tied

2064
01:28:43,479 --> 01:28:47,599
together certainly um I don't think it

2065
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:50,639
takes uh yeah I don't think it takes

2066
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:53,239
like a um you know a member of Mena to

2067
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:55,400
see that so no I mean uh prior to

2068
01:28:53,238 --> 01:28:58,079
cultivating I was Chef for around a

2069
01:28:55,399 --> 01:29:01,000
decade and uh then just you know working

2070
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:05,639
in hospitalities for a bit longer than

2071
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:07,439
that but um yeah PE people don't you you

2072
01:29:05,639 --> 01:29:09,520
have so much of the burden of

2073
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:12,799
responsibility upon your shoulders

2074
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:15,199
within a setting like that um because

2075
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:18,320
you are semi- beholden to the customer

2076
01:29:15,198 --> 01:29:21,238
and and their experience with uh what

2077
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:24,158
you're providing them and um considering

2078
01:29:21,238 --> 01:29:27,238
that cannabis is also another product

2079
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:29,000
just like uh a nice uh you know a nice

2080
01:29:27,238 --> 01:29:32,198
dinner out at a fancy restaurant is

2081
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:34,760
technically a product um and you can

2082
01:29:32,198 --> 01:29:38,519
immediately see who is providing you

2083
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:39,960
that product right there uh and then in

2084
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:41,280
cannabis with Through The Branding and

2085
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:43,039
stuff and how people are trying to

2086
01:29:41,279 --> 01:29:45,920
connect themselves to these Brands

2087
01:29:43,039 --> 01:29:48,079
through social media and otherwise you

2088
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:50,279
are directly connected to that end

2089
01:29:48,079 --> 01:29:54,158
product and the experience that the user

2090
01:29:50,279 --> 01:29:55,639
has and uh one thing that um my partner

2091
01:29:54,158 --> 01:29:58,198
and I have even been talking about

2092
01:29:55,639 --> 01:30:01,679
recently is like the set in setting of

2093
01:29:58,198 --> 01:30:05,238
different experiences and how those can

2094
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:07,800
change your perspective and your view of

2095
01:30:05,238 --> 01:30:10,198
of something that may not even have to

2096
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:12,440
do with uh the product itself if you're

2097
01:30:10,198 --> 01:30:13,879
experiencing like a product or the nice

2098
01:30:12,439 --> 01:30:16,039
dinner you know you could be in there in

2099
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:18,079
a bad mood and it could be the best meal

2100
01:30:16,039 --> 01:30:22,960
in the world and it still would be a

2101
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:25,319
shitty meal um that's so true so yeah we

2102
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:28,800
we we do need to maybe take a little bit

2103
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:31,920
more perspective of um how we are all

2104
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:34,199
experiencing these things and uh

2105
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:36,639
especially being a little bit more

2106
01:30:34,198 --> 01:30:39,359
understanding because this is a plant

2107
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:42,279
right and plants do plant things plants

2108
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:45,880
have bugs that are attracted to them and

2109
01:30:42,279 --> 01:30:48,639
uh maybe a little bit more humility and

2110
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:51,880
openness uh in terms of telling people

2111
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:55,800
more about the process of cultivation

2112
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:57,679
and um even postprocessing like post

2113
01:30:55,800 --> 01:31:00,039
Harvest processing and stuff will

2114
01:30:57,679 --> 01:31:03,639
provide people with a

2115
01:31:00,039 --> 01:31:06,000
more uh beneficial understanding so that

2116
01:31:03,639 --> 01:31:08,400
you know the cultivator is maybe a

2117
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,279
little bit more better understood um and

2118
01:31:08,399 --> 01:31:12,399
and all the plights that they face

2119
01:31:10,279 --> 01:31:14,158
within trying to get this product to the

2120
01:31:12,399 --> 01:31:17,439
end

2121
01:31:14,158 --> 01:31:19,920
user yeah like the solution

2122
01:31:17,439 --> 01:31:21,399
is um you know it's like what you like

2123
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:23,158
what you said about like what the con

2124
01:31:21,399 --> 01:31:25,759
with the consumer what the person who's

2125
01:31:23,158 --> 01:31:27,599
going to uh receed the product end up

2126
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:29,320
getting is you know they just they don't

2127
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,560
really want to know all these details a

2128
01:31:29,319 --> 01:31:35,559
lot of times they just want to get the

2129
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:37,840
thing and then have the thing um which I

2130
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:40,159
get uh but then like similar but in like

2131
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:43,360
a very similar way if somebody if like a

2132
01:31:40,158 --> 01:31:45,719
cultivator has a problem you know they

2133
01:31:43,359 --> 01:31:47,238
don't want to like have to learn they

2134
01:31:45,719 --> 01:31:48,560
want the fish given to them they don't

2135
01:31:47,238 --> 01:31:49,879
want to have to learn how to fish

2136
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:52,960
especially I don't have any time to

2137
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:54,840
learn how to fish um in this particular

2138
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:58,880
moment right you

2139
01:31:54,840 --> 01:32:01,400
know you know give me yeah so so but

2140
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:03,560
like the but you know like a robust

2141
01:32:01,399 --> 01:32:05,158
answer is always like Superior and like

2142
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:07,679
you know it's like that saying like

2143
01:32:05,158 --> 01:32:10,399
every every problem has an answer that's

2144
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:14,800
uh simple and wrong or whatever and so

2145
01:32:10,399 --> 01:32:16,559
so true um and I just think that like

2146
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:18,440
everyone it is really I think an

2147
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:21,199
informed Citizen's responsibility to

2148
01:32:18,439 --> 01:32:23,359
know what's going on and and like if you

2149
01:32:21,198 --> 01:32:25,198
abscond from that responsibility to like

2150
01:32:23,359 --> 01:32:28,158
being forms like I don't know how to

2151
01:32:25,198 --> 01:32:32,039
help you uh with that that's beyond you

2152
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:32,960
know that's beyond my Ken but I think

2153
01:32:32,039 --> 01:32:36,238
that

2154
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:38,520
like I think that like people like I get

2155
01:32:36,238 --> 01:32:41,479
why it's like kind of a self-reinforcing

2156
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:43,600
vicious cycle where you know people

2157
01:32:41,479 --> 01:32:45,519
don't want to be open on one end and

2158
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:47,560
other people have had to for a long time

2159
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:51,840
not been open that was the Strat for a

2160
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:53,880
long time in growing cannabis and um

2161
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:55,679
yeah it's very and I think you're also

2162
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:57,760
so I want to say that I feel like your

2163
01:32:55,679 --> 01:33:00,520
perspective on the market is is

2164
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:02,840
realistic I also respect that cannabis

2165
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:04,760
is more than a market product and I

2166
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:07,840
think that's also an absolutely valid

2167
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:11,639
perspective is also my perspective too

2168
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:14,840
um but like obviously like the way that

2169
01:33:11,639 --> 01:33:16,279
most people acquire it is through a

2170
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:17,800
market

2171
01:33:16,279 --> 01:33:20,759
and

2172
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:22,800
uh you know people don't think about

2173
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:25,199
like the bugs that are on their radishes

2174
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:27,800
or their lettuce or or whatever and you

2175
01:33:25,198 --> 01:33:30,519
know um I you know it's like being a

2176
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:32,400
client doctor I've said before not a lot

2177
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:35,239
of people are like putting me on their

2178
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:38,759
gram being like hey everyone today we

2179
01:33:35,238 --> 01:33:41,879
had hash rice root AIDS and we got Matt

2180
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:43,880
here look at that stuff uh you know and

2181
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:47,359
usually and a lot of times when people

2182
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:49,920
bring me um it's not actually that bad

2183
01:33:47,359 --> 01:33:52,719
anyways uh um I'm usually pleasantly

2184
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:56,118
surprised not always but um it it does

2185
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:58,039
happen um um and it's kind of like with

2186
01:33:56,118 --> 01:33:59,439
you know digging in on farmers who are

2187
01:33:58,039 --> 01:34:01,920
like just trying to feed their families

2188
01:33:59,439 --> 01:34:05,238
and other people and are actually pretty

2189
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:07,920
decent people um you know a minority of

2190
01:34:05,238 --> 01:34:10,718
people or or or some amount of people

2191
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:12,319
who do maybe things that they shouldn't

2192
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:14,800
and are able to get away with obviously

2193
01:34:12,319 --> 01:34:18,439
have made people very skeptical about

2194
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:20,560
many things um but like you know I can't

2195
01:34:18,439 --> 01:34:22,719
I just can't knock most Farmers I

2196
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:25,639
actually really enjoy working in in food

2197
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:28,118
production and Agri culture um in

2198
01:34:25,639 --> 01:34:31,440
non-cannabis crops uh because I get a

2199
01:34:28,118 --> 01:34:33,359
genuine fulfillment like I feel like you

2200
01:34:31,439 --> 01:34:35,399
know it's like you know did you eat

2201
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:36,920
today you know think a farmer you know I

2202
01:34:35,399 --> 01:34:40,238
just feel like I'm

2203
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:43,679
enabling like yeah like the civilization

2204
01:34:40,238 --> 01:34:46,519
fundament practically um and so that

2205
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:48,880
gives me a lot of uh uh it makes me feel

2206
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:51,239
really good I felt best working in food

2207
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:53,440
crops and I felt the least fulfilled

2208
01:34:51,238 --> 01:34:55,198
working I'm sad to say in ornamental

2209
01:34:53,439 --> 01:34:56,198
crops because that's just going in a

2210
01:34:55,198 --> 01:34:59,359
vase

2211
01:34:56,198 --> 01:35:01,759
folks not a lot of people buying flowers

2212
01:34:59,359 --> 01:35:04,399
of my generation I also heard that a lot

2213
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:06,440
from these people how can we get younger

2214
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:07,479
people into flowers and I'm like I don't

2215
01:35:06,439 --> 01:35:10,039
know

2216
01:35:07,479 --> 01:35:13,319
man I think it's my capitalistic

2217
01:35:10,039 --> 01:35:15,639
conditioning as well but whenever I am

2218
01:35:13,319 --> 01:35:17,960
planning out like a a home Garden or

2219
01:35:15,639 --> 01:35:19,880
something every I'm like everything

2220
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:22,158
that's in there has to be working you

2221
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:23,760
know nothing's in there for free just to

2222
01:35:22,158 --> 01:35:25,679
look pretty I want to make sure that

2223
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:29,119
everything's doing something whether it

2224
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:33,279
be providing um you know some sort of

2225
01:35:29,118 --> 01:35:35,639
like Bane properties to a pest or a a

2226
01:35:33,279 --> 01:35:38,519
you know whether that be like bug or

2227
01:35:35,639 --> 01:35:40,960
rodent or otherwise that is around that

2228
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:42,639
I want to keep away or if it's something

2229
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:44,279
just for the pollinators to make sure

2230
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:45,960
that I have a good population of

2231
01:35:44,279 --> 01:35:47,359
pollinators in the area but then

2232
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:49,560
everything else I'm like yeah you're

2233
01:35:47,359 --> 01:35:51,118
you're working for me I need to eat you

2234
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:53,400
I need to make sure that you're you're

2235
01:35:51,118 --> 01:35:55,599
doing the things that I need you to do

2236
01:35:53,399 --> 01:35:58,759
um right and I think that's super valid

2237
01:35:55,600 --> 01:36:01,600
though that's like that's like a a a Sim

2238
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:03,440
uh they call it like sin biotic nowadays

2239
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:07,520
that's a new research term people will

2240
01:36:03,439 --> 01:36:09,079
sin bio synthetic biology or sin Eco

2241
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:11,400
synthetic

2242
01:36:09,079 --> 01:36:13,479
ecosystems uh but it's like I mean it

2243
01:36:11,399 --> 01:36:15,960
sounds like it sounds really like

2244
01:36:13,479 --> 01:36:17,678
extreme or weird or something but really

2245
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:19,840
it's the same as like having a fish tank

2246
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:23,840
or a greenhouse or a garden it's the

2247
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:26,319
same concept it's biodome exactly uh

2248
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:28,639
it's it's the same concept it's not like

2249
01:36:26,319 --> 01:36:31,359
the Terminator coming to kill all life

2250
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:34,159
it's um it's literally what's the most

2251
01:36:31,359 --> 01:36:36,479
holistic approach to the ecosystem I can

2252
01:36:34,158 --> 01:36:38,479
make and then also factoring the fact

2253
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:40,839
that people use money to make things

2254
01:36:38,479 --> 01:36:42,479
happen um and then that's just a

2255
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:44,600
resource in of

2256
01:36:42,479 --> 01:36:46,759
itself and then that's it you know it's

2257
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:49,600
normal even plants have to

2258
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:52,880
proportionally react to pest with the

2259
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:55,280
resources that they work for by

2260
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:58,480
quenching phons in their chlorophyll so

2261
01:36:55,279 --> 01:37:01,880
it's the same thing all the way down yes

2262
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:05,039
I agree and it does feel a little better

2263
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:06,679
um to know that I am also then trying to

2264
01:37:05,039 --> 01:37:08,639
provide this more holistic approach

2265
01:37:06,679 --> 01:37:11,158
rather than just saying I'm I am

2266
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:12,679
monocropping corn and I'm going to dry

2267
01:37:11,158 --> 01:37:14,279
some and I'm going to eat some fresh but

2268
01:37:12,679 --> 01:37:16,560
that's all I'm growing because then I

2269
01:37:14,279 --> 01:37:18,679
only have to focus on one thing it you

2270
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:22,560
know that's where we've gone wrong in a

2271
01:37:18,679 --> 01:37:24,158
lot of ways in agriculture and uh you

2272
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:27,800
know maybe there is more

2273
01:37:24,158 --> 01:37:33,638
opportunity in the future for this uh

2274
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:36,760
sin uh synthesized uh bio uh approach

2275
01:37:33,639 --> 01:37:39,239
that would allow for maybe

2276
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:42,280
um maybe even like something as as

2277
01:37:39,238 --> 01:37:44,759
Extreme as less ecological collapse for

2278
01:37:42,279 --> 01:37:48,198
certain species or other otherwise just

2279
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:50,800
by helping maintain the things that they

2280
01:37:48,198 --> 01:37:53,839
need to survive as well as what you use

2281
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:56,719
to survive as a human um yeah like that

2282
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:58,800
a lot um or even like or even like

2283
01:37:56,719 --> 01:38:00,760
isolating yourself I know that's a lot

2284
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:02,599
of times that's sort of anathema to how

2285
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:05,320
people like to do those sorts of to have

2286
01:38:02,599 --> 01:38:08,319
like an ecosystem approach but maybe in

2287
01:38:05,319 --> 01:38:11,118
some ways it is actually better to to be

2288
01:38:08,319 --> 01:38:13,679
responsible and like kind of keep things

2289
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:17,598
inside and you can still use like

2290
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:21,118
various microbial consortia and um you

2291
01:38:17,599 --> 01:38:23,560
know uh Predator insects and pollen and

2292
01:38:21,118 --> 01:38:26,319
Banker plants and all that stuff but

2293
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:28,400
maybe you like sort of internalize some

2294
01:38:26,319 --> 01:38:30,319
or all of those components so that

2295
01:38:28,399 --> 01:38:32,439
there's less spread

2296
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:34,238
or um that you know I just think that's

2297
01:38:32,439 --> 01:38:38,079
really interesting and and I love that

2298
01:38:34,238 --> 01:38:39,959
people of My Generation Um have really

2299
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:42,479
pivoted uh at least for those who do

2300
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:44,319
care um I guess it's a lot more than the

2301
01:38:42,479 --> 01:38:46,559
past but like people are pivoting

2302
01:38:44,319 --> 01:38:49,359
towards sustainability people are

2303
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:50,800
pivoting towards um you know just

2304
01:38:49,359 --> 01:38:53,238
general better understanding to be

2305
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:55,520
informed I do feel like there's more ad

2306
01:38:53,238 --> 01:38:57,319
more more people who could do that but I

2307
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:59,440
do think that people are raising an

2308
01:38:57,319 --> 01:39:01,679
alarm about things that maybe should

2309
01:38:59,439 --> 01:39:03,359
have even 50 years ago so it's a it's

2310
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:05,399
endearing to see that and I'm glad to

2311
01:39:03,359 --> 01:39:07,719
see that you seem to also be such a

2312
01:39:05,399 --> 01:39:09,679
person so that's always good to see for

2313
01:39:07,719 --> 01:39:13,639
sure I mean it feels like the communal

2314
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:16,000
approach uh in the long run does create

2315
01:39:13,639 --> 01:39:18,719
a a more positive benefit for a greater

2316
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:20,079
population than say an isolated approach

2317
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:22,239
where you're really just focusing on

2318
01:39:20,079 --> 01:39:24,599
what you need or what what you can get

2319
01:39:22,238 --> 01:39:26,039
the most out of something um that

2320
01:39:24,599 --> 01:39:27,960
there's a lot of privilege within

2321
01:39:26,039 --> 01:39:30,519
isolation as well that a lot of people

2322
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:32,198
don't have access to and Community is

2323
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:34,639
required in a lot of ways in order to

2324
01:39:32,198 --> 01:39:37,118
make sure the uh or ensure the the

2325
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:40,719
health and survival of of uh populations

2326
01:39:37,118 --> 01:39:42,799
of people um and you know if if uh the

2327
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:45,960
end goal of this is all to either

2328
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:49,000
potentially make make humans uh you

2329
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:52,000
know more happy more comfortable more

2330
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:54,359
healthy I don't know you know more uh

2331
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:57,319
than look at it through the communal

2332
01:39:54,359 --> 01:39:59,198
lens rather than the isolated lens does

2333
01:39:57,319 --> 01:40:01,158
feel like a much better approach I agree

2334
01:39:59,198 --> 01:40:07,799
with

2335
01:40:01,158 --> 01:40:09,638
that um so you've had uh you know not

2336
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:12,679
not so much homow experience but you do

2337
01:40:09,639 --> 01:40:15,000
help hom Growers all the time and you

2338
01:40:12,679 --> 01:40:16,719
have a lot of commercial experience both

2339
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:19,639
within

2340
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:22,198
um uh commercial agriculture for for

2341
01:40:19,639 --> 01:40:24,520
food production for cannabis production

2342
01:40:22,198 --> 01:40:28,399
for um um

2343
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:29,960
ornamentals uh maybe and and feel free

2344
01:40:28,399 --> 01:40:32,319
to take this in any direction that you

2345
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:34,840
want but as an integrated pest ma

2346
01:40:32,319 --> 01:40:37,238
management specialist where would you

2347
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:40,039
like to see changes within the

2348
01:40:37,238 --> 01:40:43,879
agricultural Community whether it be in

2349
01:40:40,039 --> 01:40:48,039
cannabis um or outside of

2350
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:50,920
cannabis I think that if I

2351
01:40:48,039 --> 01:40:54,920
had if I was able to direct that kind of

2352
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:58,599
thing at a huge level top down just be

2353
01:40:54,920 --> 01:41:02,760
like King for a Day we do this or these

2354
01:40:58,599 --> 01:41:03,920
things I think it would be actually um I

2355
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:07,760
think it would

2356
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:11,480
be like basically data driven basically

2357
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:16,679
make a lot of things are moving this way

2358
01:41:11,479 --> 01:41:19,079
uh a 4.0 fog Computing using autonomous

2359
01:41:16,679 --> 01:41:20,960
vehicles um being able to not only

2360
01:41:19,079 --> 01:41:22,880
aggregate a lot of data with sensor

2361
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:24,359
Imaging and other kinds of sensing

2362
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:26,760
systems

2363
01:41:24,359 --> 01:41:30,319
but then taking that massive amount of

2364
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:32,840
data crunching it analyzing it using

2365
01:41:30,319 --> 01:41:34,679
systems to make predictions for you and

2366
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:37,360
then merge that with your own decision-

2367
01:41:34,679 --> 01:41:38,880
making essentially uh what we see in

2368
01:41:37,359 --> 01:41:42,719
research being called a cyber

2369
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:45,560
agricultural system uh I think is really

2370
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:47,920
a good idea I don't I think it's

2371
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:49,960
way uh I mean I think that it solves

2372
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:52,800
certain problems that I've actually find

2373
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:55,399
um really disgusting in agriculture you

2374
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:58,239
know mainly being forced indention

2375
01:41:55,399 --> 01:42:00,679
servitude a uh basically Millennia old

2376
01:41:58,238 --> 01:42:02,759
tradition since agriculture has existed

2377
01:42:00,679 --> 01:42:04,599
I would say more or less whether you did

2378
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:08,880
it to your own people or other people's

2379
01:42:04,599 --> 01:42:10,800
people it's a thing and um I don't like

2380
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:12,880
it and I think that that could help with

2381
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:15,440
some of that kind of thing um at least

2382
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:18,000
it makes people use resources a little

2383
01:42:15,439 --> 01:42:21,198
bit more efficiently that's always good

2384
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:22,960
the problem is that and historically the

2385
01:42:21,198 --> 01:42:24,559
problem with doing things like this is

2386
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:27,439
that the Technologies just aren't

2387
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:28,639
democratized enough which is super

2388
01:42:27,439 --> 01:42:32,439
understandable reason why they haven't

2389
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:36,239
been adopted um um really expensive and

2390
01:42:32,439 --> 01:42:38,479
also maybe not as like capable as they

2391
01:42:36,238 --> 01:42:40,799
were in like 10 years 20 years before

2392
01:42:38,479 --> 01:42:44,039
whatever uh you know back when Game Boy

2393
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:46,320
was new right like but nowadays it's I

2394
01:42:44,039 --> 01:42:48,599
think a different sort of tune and I

2395
01:42:46,319 --> 01:42:51,759
think that specifically the

2396
01:42:48,599 --> 01:42:53,960
subsidization of that data like imagine

2397
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:56,079
if I've seen research coming out of

2398
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:59,800
China actually uh that I've been kind of

2399
01:42:56,079 --> 01:43:01,960
enamored with um but I understand why uh

2400
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:04,960
they get to do the things they do uh I'm

2401
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:06,158
not an advocate for it but um when you

2402
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:08,039
have a government that's just going to

2403
01:43:06,158 --> 01:43:10,000
direct and subsidize tons of money

2404
01:43:08,039 --> 01:43:11,560
towards something like that you can get

2405
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,279
certain benefits out of it and I think a

2406
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:15,719
similar thing like we've done in the US

2407
01:43:13,279 --> 01:43:19,639
and other countries could also adopt

2408
01:43:15,719 --> 01:43:22,599
this um uh subsidization of of regional

2409
01:43:19,639 --> 01:43:23,719
Data Tracking like for example for

2410
01:43:22,599 --> 01:43:25,360
budworm

2411
01:43:23,719 --> 01:43:27,800
you know knowing when is it that they

2412
01:43:25,359 --> 01:43:31,000
emerge in your area what's the degree

2413
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:32,800
day um intervals this kind of data we

2414
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,399
don't have to memorize it as people we

2415
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:38,440
can have systems that kind of figure

2416
01:43:34,399 --> 01:43:40,960
this out um a push notification say hey

2417
01:43:38,439 --> 01:43:42,118
go go apply this today because these

2418
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:46,000
events just

2419
01:43:42,118 --> 01:43:47,479
occurred 100% or did you know that like

2420
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,000
it's going to like you know even like

2421
01:43:47,479 --> 01:43:50,799
weather prediction that we have now is

2422
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:53,639
like having an Oracle in your pocket

2423
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:55,159
right like so and and they're not

2424
01:43:53,639 --> 01:43:57,760
actually getting high off of volcanic

2425
01:43:55,158 --> 01:44:00,158
fumes they're actually predicting stuff

2426
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:02,639
so so yeah so I mean that kind of stuff

2427
01:44:00,158 --> 01:44:04,279
is what I would say because then also we

2428
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:06,760
wouldn't have to necessarily even rely

2429
01:44:04,279 --> 01:44:09,519
on products you have to pay for um if

2430
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:11,679
you subsidize it some way and every

2431
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:13,480
everybody could like log into this data

2432
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:15,440
and get and then that data can talk with

2433
01:44:13,479 --> 01:44:18,759
other Ai and that kind of stuff and get

2434
01:44:15,439 --> 01:44:21,399
that um those sort of like U uh

2435
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:24,079
magnifying capabilities then I think

2436
01:44:21,399 --> 01:44:25,759
that it would do a lot to help people go

2437
01:44:24,079 --> 01:44:27,960
if there if their if their level of

2438
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:30,159
capability is one then it brings them up

2439
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:32,158
a level all of the other stuff they have

2440
01:44:30,158 --> 01:44:34,319
in their mind and their experience works

2441
01:44:32,158 --> 01:44:37,158
synergistically with that and then they

2442
01:44:34,319 --> 01:44:38,880
won't get Gob smacked um and blindsided

2443
01:44:37,158 --> 01:44:41,079
by something new potentially like that

2444
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:43,440
bio bioresistant aphid that we just

2445
01:44:41,079 --> 01:44:46,319
talked about you know so that kind of

2446
01:44:43,439 --> 01:44:48,439
stuff is what I'm excited about and um

2447
01:44:46,319 --> 01:44:50,599
it seems like it's more and more tenable

2448
01:44:48,439 --> 01:44:52,198
more and more capable and so I'm happy

2449
01:44:50,599 --> 01:44:54,319
about that but we'll see if it actually

2450
01:44:52,198 --> 01:44:57,719
gets implemented and if it's actually as

2451
01:44:54,319 --> 01:45:00,000
good as I think it will be for sure I I

2452
01:44:57,719 --> 01:45:03,520
couldn't agree more I feel like the the

2453
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:06,719
use of the technologies that we do have

2454
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:10,199
access to in order to gather data record

2455
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:13,800
data track data and help create these uh

2456
01:45:10,198 --> 01:45:18,439
predictive Maps um that allow you to

2457
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:20,800
kind of uh control more tightly the

2458
01:45:18,439 --> 01:45:25,198
different parameters of a growing

2459
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:27,079
environment and react uh more quickly as

2460
01:45:25,198 --> 01:45:30,479
well as more effectively to the

2461
01:45:27,079 --> 01:45:31,559
different um aspects of a grow um and

2462
01:45:30,479 --> 01:45:33,279
you know I've said it before and I'm

2463
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:35,280
going to keep saying it but it's a plant

2464
01:45:33,279 --> 01:45:36,960
and plants do plant things they don't

2465
01:45:35,279 --> 01:45:40,039
always react the way that you want them

2466
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:43,920
to um but by

2467
01:45:40,039 --> 01:45:46,760
providing uh more data over time you

2468
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:48,920
will have the ability to make more

2469
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:54,000
predictive models of how they should

2470
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:56,359
react to specific stimuli and it is um

2471
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:58,560
especially I could see within the Pest

2472
01:45:56,359 --> 01:45:59,759
Management world how that would be

2473
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:02,560
hugely

2474
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:04,000
beneficial considering I think um I

2475
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:06,000
don't know if it was you that said this

2476
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:09,039
or Suzanne way wri Evans that said this

2477
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:11,520
but in poinet is like the you know the

2478
01:46:09,039 --> 01:46:14,800
margin of error is a couple of pennies

2479
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:17,800
in order to make sure that that that is

2480
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:21,719
profitable and so if you have to apply

2481
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:24,119
some new chemistry that costs you know a

2482
01:46:21,719 --> 01:46:27,279
dollar more to apply and you need to

2483
01:46:24,118 --> 01:46:29,238
apply it a 100 days out of the year then

2484
01:46:27,279 --> 01:46:31,158
all of a sudden your entire crop is no

2485
01:46:29,238 --> 01:46:34,598
longer profitable and you can no longer

2486
01:46:31,158 --> 01:46:36,158
sustain that business model um so

2487
01:46:34,599 --> 01:46:38,599
something that allows you to then be

2488
01:46:36,158 --> 01:46:40,359
even more predictive about your needs as

2489
01:46:38,599 --> 01:46:45,199
well as you can

2490
01:46:40,359 --> 01:46:47,519
reduce uh applic you know how much of uh

2491
01:46:45,198 --> 01:46:49,359
chemical you're applying uh you're going

2492
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:51,920
to be able to save money and all through

2493
01:46:49,359 --> 01:46:53,439
the ability to to track this data

2494
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:56,239
analyze it more

2495
01:46:53,439 --> 01:46:58,638
effectively than a human sitting there

2496
01:46:56,238 --> 01:47:02,839
crop scouting and then thinking ah you

2497
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:04,840
know maybe 20% of these plants show you

2498
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:07,760
a problem that's above the economic

2499
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:09,679
threshold so we should apply this that

2500
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:13,000
that's a it's a lot to just do all that

2501
01:47:09,679 --> 01:47:16,560
math in your head and um so I could see

2502
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:18,520
that's a great one I I use data analysis

2503
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:20,920
all the time but it's usually for

2504
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:23,960
environmental factors and substrate

2505
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:26,199
monitoring and things along those lines

2506
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:29,679
but they're hugely beneficial we can

2507
01:47:26,198 --> 01:47:33,638
reduce our overall irrigation volume we

2508
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:35,679
can reduce our fertilizer applied we can

2509
01:47:33,639 --> 01:47:37,880
uh reduce our CO2 applied which is

2510
01:47:35,679 --> 01:47:41,039
another cost we can reduce our lighting

2511
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:42,800
that's applied it's the correct um the

2512
01:47:41,039 --> 01:47:45,238
correct timing which is an over like

2513
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:47,239
just an overhead reduction in cost and

2514
01:47:45,238 --> 01:47:50,279
all these different things where you can

2515
01:47:47,238 --> 01:47:54,439
slowly bring down how much input you're

2516
01:47:50,279 --> 01:47:58,039
actually putting in to the same output

2517
01:47:54,439 --> 01:48:00,399
um and uh I I don't see how there's

2518
01:47:58,039 --> 01:48:02,238
unless you have a massive team of human

2519
01:48:00,399 --> 01:48:04,238
brains working to try and figure this

2520
01:48:02,238 --> 01:48:07,799
out I don't see many other options other

2521
01:48:04,238 --> 01:48:10,799
than turning to these um either

2522
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:14,039
predictive models or uh like AI

2523
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:16,920
generative learning and and trying to

2524
01:48:14,039 --> 01:48:19,840
analyze all the data that's inputed and

2525
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:22,158
and create a more holistic view of what

2526
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:26,639
the potentials that that data could

2527
01:48:22,158 --> 01:48:29,559
cause within the crop um I I really like

2528
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:33,319
that I really I I'm a huge fan of

2529
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:36,639
Technology but um you know I always

2530
01:48:33,319 --> 01:48:38,238
think like sometimes it's it's about

2531
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:40,440
who's using it and how they're applying

2532
01:48:38,238 --> 01:48:42,359
it rather than the technology itself you

2533
01:48:40,439 --> 01:48:44,839
know sometimes it can be applied poorly

2534
01:48:42,359 --> 01:48:48,559
right and and be misinterpreted and

2535
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:51,440
cause even more damage um go watch the

2536
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:53,440
Terminator and and then we'll we'll be

2537
01:48:51,439 --> 01:48:56,519
on the same page right um just like you

2538
01:48:53,439 --> 01:48:58,158
said earlier so um yeah you know that

2539
01:48:56,520 --> 01:49:00,520
that kind of wraps up all the questions

2540
01:48:58,158 --> 01:49:02,238
that I had for you um were there any

2541
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:04,040
other topics that we didn't touch on

2542
01:49:02,238 --> 01:49:06,439
that you wanted to to bring up in our

2543
01:49:04,039 --> 01:49:08,920
conversation

2544
01:49:06,439 --> 01:49:12,319
today I think we went over a lot of good

2545
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:14,480
things um I I'll you know you asked when

2546
01:49:12,319 --> 01:49:17,599
you asked me to go and talk with you

2547
01:49:14,479 --> 01:49:21,158
here um you know you had mentioned like

2548
01:49:17,599 --> 01:49:22,920
you know homow situations and things and

2549
01:49:21,158 --> 01:49:24,359
plants you grow by yourselves and I had

2550
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:27,158
said that you know maybe I don't have a

2551
01:49:24,359 --> 01:49:29,000
whole lot of not as an experience but

2552
01:49:27,158 --> 01:49:31,000
like you know cool stuff to talk about

2553
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,719
but I will say this I want to I want to

2554
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:34,760
touch in on that point at the very end

2555
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:37,800
here as a bonus for anyone who's watched

2556
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:41,520
the end and that's that um I have a

2557
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:44,800
really cool plant that uh um I'm very

2558
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:46,520
proud of uh having planted which was a

2559
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:49,760
it's called Lizard tail I'm forgetting

2560
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:51,880
the binomial name the scientific name uh

2561
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:53,760
but sometimes called Fishman if you've

2562
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:56,920
heard of this if you type this into

2563
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:58,440
search you'll find it um this is a

2564
01:49:56,920 --> 01:50:00,440
Southeast Asian plant it's actually

2565
01:49:58,439 --> 01:50:05,638
pretty invasive I'm going to be honest

2566
01:50:00,439 --> 01:50:08,118
here um so keep it in a pot but um it's

2567
01:50:05,639 --> 01:50:10,480
uh it tastes like fish man the leaves

2568
01:50:08,118 --> 01:50:14,439
taste like fish and uh it grows really

2569
01:50:10,479 --> 01:50:16,399
well and it loves to be watered and um

2570
01:50:14,439 --> 01:50:18,319
you know you can put in your stir fry I

2571
01:50:16,399 --> 01:50:20,799
feel like it slept on a little bit so if

2572
01:50:18,319 --> 01:50:22,679
you've never heard of this um it's

2573
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:26,039
really easy to take care of and I

2574
01:50:22,679 --> 01:50:27,920
recommend it nice I feel like uh

2575
01:50:26,039 --> 01:50:31,238
probably be good in like Thai curry or

2576
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:33,199
something yeah exactly or like um egg

2577
01:50:31,238 --> 01:50:36,839
fried rice or something yeah sure that

2578
01:50:33,198 --> 01:50:38,279
sounds delicious um as a little bit of a

2579
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:40,679
I still like to cook even though I don't

2580
01:50:38,279 --> 01:50:43,158
really do it that much uh you know

2581
01:50:40,679 --> 01:50:45,158
professionally anymore but um oh sure

2582
01:50:43,158 --> 01:50:46,920
finding those little herbs and stuff and

2583
01:50:45,158 --> 01:50:50,078
and and you know finding the dish that

2584
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:51,039
they uh pair well with is always really

2585
01:50:50,078 --> 01:50:53,719
fun

2586
01:50:51,039 --> 01:50:55,920
and new flavor experiences are always

2587
01:50:53,719 --> 01:50:58,000
fun as well so yeah check it out fish

2588
01:50:55,920 --> 01:51:00,639
Min people go look it up

2589
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:02,439
fish cool well I have a couple of wrapup

2590
01:51:00,639 --> 01:51:05,199
questions that I usually like to ask all

2591
01:51:02,439 --> 01:51:07,439
of my guests and um considering that you

2592
01:51:05,198 --> 01:51:09,960
are a cannabis user I feel like you will

2593
01:51:07,439 --> 01:51:13,799
still have some good answers for this so

2594
01:51:09,960 --> 01:51:17,719
what is your favorite strain of all

2595
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:20,800
time very strain agnostic because people

2596
01:51:17,719 --> 01:51:24,719
you know how it is people say that this

2597
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:27,760
is that and other people say be wrong so

2598
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:29,520
I don't even know if I I don't even know

2599
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:31,360
if what I've had is what I've had or

2600
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:32,920
maybe somebody wants to dispute with me

2601
01:51:31,359 --> 01:51:36,920
about whether or not I had what I

2602
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:39,880
actually had or not um but

2603
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:41,880
uh one of my favorite strains I've ever

2604
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:45,078
had one of my favorite Cult of ours is

2605
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:49,719
um a death breath that Brandon rest um

2606
01:51:45,078 --> 01:51:53,118
had had bred and um uh Hog's Breath also

2607
01:51:49,719 --> 01:51:55,118
which is um Associated I'm told with San

2608
01:51:53,118 --> 01:51:56,920
Diego in particular and I got to meet

2609
01:51:55,118 --> 01:52:01,078
some of the people who create either

2610
01:51:56,920 --> 01:52:03,920
created it or continue its lineage um

2611
01:52:01,078 --> 01:52:06,479
here in Southern California so I really

2612
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:09,279
enjoyed them uh both because they were

2613
01:52:06,479 --> 01:52:11,759
really gassy um I felt like they were

2614
01:52:09,279 --> 01:52:15,118
very they had a lot of the uh sort of

2615
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:19,920
peppery turpis um kind of

2616
01:52:15,118 --> 01:52:23,479
like like a dark flavor you know kind of

2617
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:27,000
like not fruity not sweet but kind of

2618
01:52:23,479 --> 01:52:29,439
like gassy and um Piney and peppery and

2619
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:31,198
kind of these sorts of like Savory more

2620
01:52:29,439 --> 01:52:32,399
so kind of Aromas and flavors and I

2621
01:52:31,198 --> 01:52:34,519
think that's really cool when they're

2622
01:52:32,399 --> 01:52:36,799
really strong and and I enjoy that

2623
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:38,560
flavor profile I'm not enough of a snob

2624
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:40,440
to say that I'll turn down something

2625
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:43,800
else I don't think I'll I don't think

2626
01:52:40,439 --> 01:52:46,000
I've reached that point but uh I I did

2627
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:48,920
quite enjoy that and the history was

2628
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:50,679
kind of nice to to boot for sure I I

2629
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:52,960
feel like if you can have that sort of

2630
01:52:50,679 --> 01:52:55,960
uh enhanced experience

2631
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:57,639
of not just necessarily it being oh some

2632
01:52:55,960 --> 01:52:59,800
weed in the bag but you're like I know

2633
01:52:57,639 --> 01:53:01,840
the guy that grew this that put the time

2634
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:03,719
and effort into continuing the lineage

2635
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:06,319
of this and he chose it for these

2636
01:53:03,719 --> 01:53:07,679
purposes and now I'm here having a

2637
01:53:06,319 --> 01:53:10,599
little bit of flavor of it it's almost

2638
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:12,679
like going to Wine Country and going on

2639
01:53:10,599 --> 01:53:14,480
a a wine tasting experience and having

2640
01:53:12,679 --> 01:53:17,399
the the wine maker right there with you

2641
01:53:14,479 --> 01:53:20,359
talking about it it's a I know it's

2642
01:53:17,399 --> 01:53:22,598
Unique and and I feel like those uh

2643
01:53:20,359 --> 01:53:25,679
those experiences can be fairly well

2644
01:53:22,599 --> 01:53:29,199
cherished for uh their their uniqueness

2645
01:53:25,679 --> 01:53:31,560
and um sort of what what might be

2646
01:53:29,198 --> 01:53:32,799
referred to as uh authenticity within

2647
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:34,560
that specific

2648
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:38,599
environment

2649
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:41,880
um so uh you know we didn't get into it

2650
01:53:38,599 --> 01:53:45,880
but I know that you are a member of the

2651
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:48,319
is it the rare fruit uh tree Society in

2652
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:50,840
Southern Cali yeah the San Diego chapter

2653
01:53:48,319 --> 01:53:53,799
of the rare Fruit Growers Association

2654
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:56,000
okay California yes so considering that

2655
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:59,560
you don't personally grow a lot of

2656
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:01,399
cannabis um do you have and this you

2657
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:03,280
know this could totally be cannabis if

2658
01:54:01,399 --> 01:54:05,359
you if you want to go that route but uh

2659
01:54:03,279 --> 01:54:07,158
feel free to go outside of the realm of

2660
01:54:05,359 --> 01:54:11,719
cannabis for this question but do you

2661
01:54:07,158 --> 01:54:11,719
have a favorite plant breeder of all

2662
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:21,360
time uh I do it is outside of cannabis

2663
01:54:19,198 --> 01:54:24,000
um uh but you

2664
01:54:21,359 --> 01:54:26,519
know kind of forgetting their name

2665
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:28,800
unfortunately when put to the test but

2666
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:31,520
there's two people um that come to my

2667
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:34,119
mind both of which I'm now forgetting

2668
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:37,119
one of them was a really really famous

2669
01:54:34,118 --> 01:54:40,359
um agriculturalist in China who passed

2670
01:54:37,118 --> 01:54:43,559
away last year or perhaps a year before

2671
01:54:40,359 --> 01:54:46,559
um and he was very famous people made a

2672
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:48,320
big uproar about his passing uh I think

2673
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:50,079
he's very famous for bringing

2674
01:54:48,319 --> 01:54:52,880
specifically like different types of

2675
01:54:50,078 --> 01:54:56,759
rice uh and I think wheat too I want to

2676
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:58,679
say uh making it very like um adapted to

2677
01:54:56,760 --> 01:55:01,639
the various regions in the People's

2678
01:54:58,679 --> 01:55:04,319
Republic of China and basically

2679
01:55:01,639 --> 01:55:05,760
especially if you know their history um

2680
01:55:04,319 --> 01:55:07,719
you know not to make light of it but

2681
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:10,159
there are several famines in Chinese

2682
01:55:07,719 --> 01:55:13,158
history and so doing the opposite of

2683
01:55:10,158 --> 01:55:15,598
that is definitely a boon um and then

2684
01:55:13,158 --> 01:55:17,598
another gentleman who I'm also freaking

2685
01:55:15,599 --> 01:55:19,960
unfortunately but he's the a he's

2686
01:55:17,599 --> 01:55:22,440
actually the person who started up the

2687
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:23,880
uh rare Fruit Growers Association

2688
01:55:22,439 --> 01:55:26,479
I think one of the rare fruits that he's

2689
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:29,480
really po he's really famous for is

2690
01:55:26,479 --> 01:55:31,439
um um uh there's several apples that I

2691
01:55:29,479 --> 01:55:33,598
think he kept around even though they

2692
01:55:31,439 --> 01:55:35,118
weren't commercially viable that kind of

2693
01:55:33,599 --> 01:55:37,520
dedication I think is just really

2694
01:55:35,118 --> 01:55:39,559
amazing and I can't imagine somebody

2695
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:42,119
doing it especially in this day and age

2696
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:46,000
like it it's just who has the time

2697
01:55:42,118 --> 01:55:48,118
resources ability know how um and care

2698
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:51,238
to be quite honest the the actually

2699
01:55:48,118 --> 01:55:52,960
personal initiative to to do it even

2700
01:55:51,238 --> 01:55:54,399
though

2701
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:58,840
how many people are really going to have

2702
01:55:54,399 --> 01:56:00,719
this like black cherry cultivar of um

2703
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:03,800
you know Apple that with red flesh or

2704
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:05,639
whatever in a black rind you know uh I

2705
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:08,440
don't know I just think that's and and

2706
01:56:05,639 --> 01:56:11,719
the same sort of beauty of that uh

2707
01:56:08,439 --> 01:56:13,759
impermanence is also what I find there

2708
01:56:11,719 --> 01:56:16,359
was a guy who grew cannabis uh here in

2709
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:19,039
San Diego he made this cultivar he

2710
01:56:16,359 --> 01:56:24,359
called orange Tang like Tang the orange

2711
01:56:19,039 --> 01:56:27,599
drink and um it's gone now uh no more um

2712
01:56:24,359 --> 01:56:29,920
and uh when I smoked it it really tasted

2713
01:56:27,599 --> 01:56:32,360
like orange juice and not like other

2714
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:35,118
sorts of um citric flavors but really

2715
01:56:32,359 --> 01:56:37,198
did taste like orange um and I thought

2716
01:56:35,118 --> 01:56:39,920
that was really novel and cool and I'm

2717
01:56:37,198 --> 01:56:42,000
sure other ones are like that but I love

2718
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:43,760
um that I got to meet the guy and it's

2719
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,800
kind of interesting that it's no longer

2720
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:49,239
available

2721
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:51,719
anymore yeah I do really think that the

2722
01:56:49,238 --> 01:56:54,559
individuals who put the effort into

2723
01:56:51,719 --> 01:56:58,279
either uh you know preserving a specific

2724
01:56:54,560 --> 01:57:00,000
cultivar or creating novel cultivars for

2725
01:56:58,279 --> 01:57:02,479
the market um it makes me think of that

2726
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,399
guy uh I don't remember his name either

2727
01:57:02,479 --> 01:57:06,718
but he was I believe out of Pasadena

2728
01:57:04,399 --> 01:57:10,839
California and he did all the different

2729
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:13,078
stone fruit crosses like the um like the

2730
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:17,440
plum and the apricot cross and the

2731
01:57:13,078 --> 01:57:19,158
apricot and the uh you know the um I

2732
01:57:17,439 --> 01:57:22,638
think like you got like plats and

2733
01:57:19,158 --> 01:57:24,879
apriums and um all the different typ of

2734
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:26,239
peir uh peaches and stuff that were that

2735
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:27,800
were developed in that area and I think

2736
01:57:26,238 --> 01:57:29,439
he developed like hundreds of these

2737
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:32,239
different varietals that are even still

2738
01:57:29,439 --> 01:57:36,519
grown today but to have that dedication

2739
01:57:32,238 --> 01:57:37,678
and creating fun novel food stuffs is

2740
01:57:36,520 --> 01:57:40,360
pretty

2741
01:57:37,679 --> 01:57:43,520
cool the loquat tree I'd mentioned

2742
01:57:40,359 --> 01:57:46,359
earlier is the Big Jim cultivar and Big

2743
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:49,280
Jim I think was one of those people as

2744
01:57:46,359 --> 01:57:50,920
well who's like really popular um

2745
01:57:49,279 --> 01:57:52,800
basically I think he might have been the

2746
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:54,440
person who started the rear Growers now

2747
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:56,920
I think about it or he was associated

2748
01:57:54,439 --> 01:57:58,799
with it at least um and now tons of

2749
01:57:56,920 --> 01:58:00,840
people have it in their backyards and I

2750
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:02,599
just think that's parallels really well

2751
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:04,480
with the community that we think of or

2752
01:58:02,599 --> 01:58:07,199
at least I think of when it comes to

2753
01:58:04,479 --> 01:58:08,919
cannabis so I appreciate you um you know

2754
01:58:07,198 --> 01:58:11,158
searching out those Impressions I think

2755
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:13,399
they often don't get spoken by me or

2756
01:58:11,158 --> 01:58:15,118
other people so it's nice to get those I

2757
01:58:13,399 --> 01:58:17,359
usually have to keep it empirical but it

2758
01:58:15,118 --> 01:58:20,519
doesn't mean that I have no heart or

2759
01:58:17,359 --> 01:58:22,759
that I don't have a um more whim and

2760
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:24,320
fery approach to

2761
01:58:22,760 --> 01:58:26,119
life certainly I mean you're a fan of

2762
01:58:24,319 --> 01:58:27,719
Pokemon so that says something yeah

2763
01:58:26,118 --> 01:58:29,279
right exactly I don't play the games

2764
01:58:27,719 --> 01:58:31,679
anymore I do find that they're a little

2765
01:58:29,279 --> 01:58:35,000
bit rigid and Game Freak could probably

2766
01:58:31,679 --> 01:58:39,399
stand to be a little bit more Innovative

2767
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:43,439
um but you know what we had together

2768
01:58:39,399 --> 01:58:46,759
right I'll never forget I'll never

2769
01:58:43,439 --> 01:58:50,078
forget right on right on um well I just

2770
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:54,719
have one last question for you uh what

2771
01:58:50,078 --> 01:58:54,719
is your most memorable cannabis related

2772
01:58:55,520 --> 01:59:00,199
experience

2773
01:58:57,078 --> 01:59:02,599
H or just a good memorable cannabis

2774
01:59:00,198 --> 01:59:06,399
related experience doesn't necessarily

2775
01:59:02,599 --> 01:59:09,560
me to need to be the Apex of it I think

2776
01:59:06,399 --> 01:59:11,279
that if I go back to when I was help

2777
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:12,960
helping my friends in the high deserts

2778
01:59:11,279 --> 01:59:17,519
of Lone Pine

2779
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:20,000
California and um so I'm in my early 20s

2780
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:24,760
early to mid 20s

2781
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:26,158
um uh i' gotone back from China and it

2782
01:59:24,760 --> 01:59:28,719
was just this sort of beauty that I

2783
01:59:26,158 --> 01:59:30,519
talked about before it's like cold but

2784
01:59:28,719 --> 01:59:34,639
it's also hot from the Sun so it's like

2785
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:38,760
February winter time kind of um and I'm

2786
01:59:34,639 --> 01:59:41,239
smoking a joint and like at that point I

2787
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:43,920
had become more I started smoking joints

2788
01:59:41,238 --> 01:59:45,678
more often um you know I just been

2789
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:47,599
really getting into my work and

2790
01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:50,239
everything and it was amazing to just

2791
01:59:47,599 --> 01:59:53,520
kind of like walk down this like pathway

2792
01:59:50,238 --> 01:59:55,118
of like scrub land and and like a Ravine

2793
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:56,760
and there's all these like oak trees

2794
01:59:55,118 --> 01:59:59,479
creating some shade and it's just there

2795
01:59:56,760 --> 02:00:01,480
was like a a natural beauty uh that I

2796
01:59:59,479 --> 02:00:04,158
enjoyed in that moment and I and I and I

2797
02:00:01,479 --> 02:00:08,399
remember the sky was quite you know

2798
02:00:04,158 --> 02:00:11,519
Azure and blue deep of blue um no clouds

2799
02:00:08,399 --> 02:00:13,799
in the sky and also you know snow

2800
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:16,360
everywhere just kind of surprising to be

2801
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:18,800
in a desert with snow and so it was kind

2802
02:00:16,359 --> 02:00:22,799
of surreal and I think something about

2803
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:25,800
like the Mind space that I was in um not

2804
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:29,279
only smoking but also um you just

2805
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:30,719
hanging out with my friends um just uh a

2806
02:00:29,279 --> 02:00:32,960
really great

2807
02:00:30,719 --> 02:00:36,439
memory that does sound really nice I

2808
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:37,599
mean I I I forgot too about the snow

2809
02:00:36,439 --> 02:00:39,839
from when you had talked about that

2810
02:00:37,599 --> 02:00:43,760
earlier because not only are you in the

2811
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:46,440
desert where it's really dry and kind of

2812
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:48,199
uh vast and expansive so there's not a

2813
02:00:46,439 --> 02:00:50,399
lot of things to create noise but then

2814
02:00:48,198 --> 02:00:52,759
you also have this covering of snow

2815
02:00:50,399 --> 02:00:55,359
which just deafens everything else even

2816
02:00:52,760 --> 02:00:56,440
more so I'm you know I'm thinking of

2817
02:00:55,359 --> 02:00:58,719
something like that where it would

2818
02:00:56,439 --> 02:01:00,879
probably be very quiet if you didn't

2819
02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:02,880
move and if everyone else was being very

2820
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:06,239
quiet it would almost be

2821
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:08,840
deafening you get some long some uh fast

2822
02:01:06,238 --> 02:01:10,839
moving winds as well during the During

2823
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:14,520
certain Seasons but you're right it's

2824
02:01:10,840 --> 02:01:15,760
very it was very quiet uh and then but

2825
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:18,239
you would get sort of wind that would

2826
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:20,719
kick up sometimes too so there's like

2827
02:01:18,238 --> 02:01:23,198
yeah it's like it's like very peaceful

2828
02:01:20,719 --> 02:01:26,840
and um you know I miss it I hope to go

2829
02:01:23,198 --> 02:01:28,678
up to opening trout sometime in the next

2830
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:31,400
year or two where they have this this

2831
02:01:28,679 --> 02:01:33,480
event you can go and fish and my friends

2832
02:01:31,399 --> 02:01:35,759
often come during that time so maybe

2833
02:01:33,479 --> 02:01:38,158
we'll do that this year we'll see nice

2834
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:40,639
that sounds like fun well Matt again

2835
02:01:38,158 --> 02:01:42,439
thank you so much for joining me today

2836
02:01:40,639 --> 02:01:45,118
and I know that this is a little bit of

2837
02:01:42,439 --> 02:01:47,759
an unorthodox episode for our listeners

2838
02:01:45,118 --> 02:01:50,719
where we usually have people on that are

2839
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:53,520
um either dedicated homeowers or

2840
02:01:50,719 --> 02:01:56,880
commercial cultivators themselves but I

2841
02:01:53,520 --> 02:02:00,360
do believe that it uh by providing these

2842
02:01:56,880 --> 02:02:03,920
different um perspectives of Canabis

2843
02:02:00,359 --> 02:02:08,118
cultivation um yours being through that

2844
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:10,679
of uh someone who loves bugs that it is

2845
02:02:08,118 --> 02:02:13,960
it provides a more holistic approach and

2846
02:02:10,679 --> 02:02:15,719
people can I believe appreciate the

2847
02:02:13,960 --> 02:02:19,039
different aspects of cannabis

2848
02:02:15,719 --> 02:02:21,599
cultivation more deeply when we give

2849
02:02:19,039 --> 02:02:24,399
them the ability to see it through other

2850
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:26,000
people people's eyes um so thank you I

2851
02:02:24,399 --> 02:02:27,479
really really appreciate you being here

2852
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:29,078
today and I really think that people are

2853
02:02:27,479 --> 02:02:31,319
going to enjoy

2854
02:02:29,078 --> 02:02:33,960
this I appreciate it I look forward to

2855
02:02:31,319 --> 02:02:36,960
our mutual success yeah well thank you

2856
