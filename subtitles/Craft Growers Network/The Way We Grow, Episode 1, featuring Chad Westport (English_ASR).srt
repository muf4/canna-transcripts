29
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,479
kind of want to leave the first part of

30
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:15,798
the show open to just kind of ask if

31
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:18,519
there was anything that's on your mind

32
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:21,360
cannabis growing related today that is

33
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:24,078
something that's kind of like eating at

34
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,118
you or occupying your brain space and I

35
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:26,078
just wanted to see what you were

36
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:30,200
thinking

37
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:32,959
about always man 365 days a year year

38
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,920
24/7 my brain is typically on this plant

39
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,399
or something related to it there there's

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,920
a lot of thing a lot of directions that

41
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:39,399
could go there whether it be like grow

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,560
technology whether it be like the

43
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:43,680
direction of the industry but one thing

44
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,359
that I always like to really highlight

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,840
and you know I think this is probably a

46
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,040
theme that you touch on with a lot of

47
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,478
your guests and throughout the show I

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,600
personally feel that the people who are

49
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,399
doing it at home the people in the grow

50
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:56,879
tents people kind of on the smaller

51
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,399
scale are always going to be the soul of

52
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:02,359
this industry the soul of cannabis the

53
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,359
people will like move the plant forward

54
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:06,159
we're facing an interesting time where

55
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:08,800
there's going to be you know a lot more

56
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,640
exposure and a lot more availability

57
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,360
which is great but it's also going to

58
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,799
come with a cost however the people who

59
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,959
are doing it you know for finding that

60
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,599
next unicorn or you know helping their

61
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:21,200
sick neighbor those are going to be the

62
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,759
people that carry it forward so that's

63
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,719
what's always on my mind is you know the

64
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:27,439
homeg grower is always going to be the

65
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,639
soul of this plan I fully agree with

66
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,079
that um so like with with what you're

67
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,759
think you kind of brought up like

68
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,440
unicorns or like the um you know cuz

69
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,878
people are just always super excited

70
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:40,719
about the the really really nice looking

71
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:42,239
flowers so like what what is your

72
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:45,158
opinion cuz we we did have a talk

73
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:48,360
earlier in one of our episodes about um

74
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:50,318
between Gabby myself and Cosmic about

75
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,800
where the next sort of unicorns or like

76
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,799
the elite Cult of ours are going to come

77
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,560
from like do you have an opinion on that

78
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,120
yeah I mean it's it's it's probably

79
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,239
going to come from your your taste

80
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,920
makers your hit makers that's how a lot

81
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,719
of the things have just over time blown

82
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,439
up once we've gotten you know past 2012

83
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,680
once we've gotten into you know

84
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:10,199
Washington Colorado has like pretty

85
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,680
proper Med systems and they've gone

86
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,878
recreational we've seen H this word kind

87
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,280
of drives me nuts but the the Cannabis

88
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,798
influencer we we've seen the rise of

89
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,878
that and we all know like I was

90
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:24,799
listening to Cypress Hill Hits in the

91
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:27,199
bong you know got a in chronic the AK-47

92
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,400
the Alaskan Thunder those were like the

93
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:32,598
first strame names I ever heard back in

94
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:36,200
the s so it's been going longer since

95
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:38,000
2012 but I think the next you know the

96
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:40,919
next hotness is going to come from a

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,719
taste maker whether that has longevity

98
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:46,318
or not that's to be seen so something

99
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:47,759
with like longevity and legs I still

100
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,039
think that's probably going to come from

101
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,759
a hom grower or you know a small craft

102
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:55,759
grower when I say a small craft grower

103
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:58,519
I'm really thinking you know 100 or 50

104
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:01,078
or less plants for

105
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,000
sure there they're going to kind of have

106
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,840
that longevity to keep it going if

107
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,878
something has good medicinal effects if

108
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,000
something has the qualities that we're

109
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:13,078
after that's going to stand the test of

110
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,400
time and so when you say taste makers do

111
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,280
you think that like the people that have

112
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,519
this branding or recognition behind them

113
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,399
are the ones that are finding the

114
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,360
strains or just bringing them to the

115
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,839
attention of the public cuz one thing

116
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,800
that I like to think about is like

117
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,319
almost all the different strains that we

118
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,639
have that would be considered these

119
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,319
either hot flashes in the pans or even

120
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,478
if they did have those legs that you're

121
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:37,079
talking about and kept on going and were

122
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,478
very popular they don't seem to ever

123
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:41,719
come from the people who made them

124
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:43,560
popular yeah I mean I agree with that

125
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,400
you see you know a lot of people have

126
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,360
sourced to different companies or

127
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:49,319
different people within this industry

128
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,120
that we all know and they kind of you

129
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:53,319
know once they check mark give their

130
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,639
kind of seal of approval that's when it

131
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,199
takes off but that's just kind of basic

132
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,918
business in a sense like you have to

133
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,160
have distribution you can have the

134
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:03,680
greatest product in the world but you

135
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,880
have to have a way to expose people to

136
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,959
it you have to have a way to just get it

137
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:10,560
distributed and that's where those kind

138
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:12,399
of The Taste makers come in yeah I I I'm

139
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,959
convinced that not many of them are the

140
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:17,318
ones who actually find these things but

141
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:20,719
they have enough feelers out there

142
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:21,919
absolutely they're the ones we made a I

143
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,120
don't know if it was a short or

144
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:26,719
something like that where we asked the

145
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,199
question and I mean I I feel exactly the

146
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,639
same way as you do that you know

147
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,560
hopefully it's going to be a homeg

148
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,960
grower that finds the next Elite but

149
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,560
he's going to need some help marketing

150
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:41,318
it bringing it to the product uh to the

151
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,759
to the masses or else you know it'll

152
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:45,840
never be considered Elite if people

153
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,160
don't know about it right yeah it

154
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,318
doesn't matter if you grow the best weed

155
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,880
ever but if people don't hear about it

156
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:55,800
or know about it if you know it'll never

157
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:58,439
have that lasting time where people

158
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,439
recognize that as as such an important

159
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:04,120
strain something else I want to touch on

160
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:07,680
real fast is you mentioned cannabis

161
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,560
influencers and I want to be very clear

162
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:15,199
that that's not what wolf and I are

163
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,959
trying to be we want to tell stories and

164
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,080
we want to be cannabis

165
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:23,279
inspirers we want to inspire people to

166
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:25,598
grow about grow cannabis and think about

167
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,839
cannabis but you know we're not trying

168
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:30,839
to be the next influencers they're not

169
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:31,879
too far off but I see what you're trying

170
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,879
to say

171
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:36,319
Gabby

172
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:38,519
there's influencing

173
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,240
inspiring yeah there's a difference in

174
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:42,038
motives there you know one is kind of

175
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,680
more self-serving whereas the other is

176
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:47,399
really about you know propagating the

177
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,160
good for everybody the education that

178
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:50,879
that's so important it's been such an

179
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,800
underground industry for such a long

180
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,360
time now all of a sudden it's above

181
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,079
ground and we have you know corporate

182
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,960
and I hate to say the term Chads because

183
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,878
I'm a Chad but I'm not that kind of Chad

184
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,399
but there's a bunch of Chads out there

185
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:03,360
that have no freaking clue about the

186
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:05,519
plant but they're very good at marketing

187
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,759
and those people don't know the story

188
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,560
they don't necessarily know the roots so

189
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,479
important to know so that's why you know

190
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,280
the inspiration and like the shows I've

191
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:15,719
been watching your channel it's good to

192
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:18,159
get these stories out there before

193
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,759
they're just kind of like paved over and

194
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,240
it all started with cook you know yeah

195
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,000
we have any sort of cancel culture

196
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,360
within the culture we want to make sure

197
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,800
that all the stories are told and

198
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,160
remembered so something else that I want

199
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,038
to make sure we do excuse excuse me I

200
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,199
want to make sure that we early on in

201
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:37,120
the podcast have you tell about your

202
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,360
podcast because you know sometimes

203
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,160
people don't listen all the way to the

204
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,759
end and so I want to make sure that

205
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,080
people know like what you're doing today

206
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,960
and how to find

207
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:47,959
you yeah well thank you yeah I you know

208
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:50,878
like you I'm just kind of out there

209
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:53,638
trying to share the story and education

210
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,879
is really the Hallmark of what I'm doing

211
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,800
I want to get people growing this plant

212
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,360
has been in my life for a really long

213
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,120
time I realized after a while it's

214
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,598
medicinal benefits to me knowing that

215
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,240
and knowing that there's a lot of other

216
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:08,079
people out there that could benefit from

217
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,199
it I just want to get people growing and

218
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:12,758
so that's a lot of what I focus on on my

219
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,759
channel is just different ways you know

220
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,960
introduce you to different breeders I

221
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,520
grow a particular style but I'm open to

222
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:22,120
anything as long as it gets a person

223
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:24,680
growing so that's a lot of what I do on

224
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,439
my channel but I also do like to tell

225
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,720
the history I did a series with uh Tad

226
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:32,038
hassi from Kiss Organics it was called

227
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,120
history we went back we interviewed a

228
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:37,278
lot of people that I think today's like

229
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,479
if you're just turning 21 which is the

230
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,080
legal age and you're coming to cannabis

231
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,919
you probably don't know these people but

232
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:47,080
they've had such an impact and I saw you

233
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,919
guys te shorts with wolf the other Dayal

234
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,320
God that guy has an amazing story and

235
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:53,719
funny enough we ran the same streets

236
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,440
doing the exact same thing 30 years

237
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,920
apart that's really fascinating because

238
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,720
we did just have a a really like a

239
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:04,399
three-hour long interview with him

240
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:08,079
yesterday and uh yeah it was really good

241
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:11,759
um name of your podcast or like or any

242
00:09:08,078 --> 00:09:13,919
of that yeah the yeah sorry I a I am a

243
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,319
horrible self-promoter that is one thing

244
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,360
I just like to have a good time and

245
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,040
enjoy we're here to help you with that a

246
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:24,519
little bit I appreciate that on YouTube

247
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:27,159
Chad Westport is the name of the channel

248
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,759
chad. Westport on Instagram as Nick uh

249
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:30,519
had mentioned earlier but a couple of

250
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:32,838
the shows I you know there's a seed

251
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:35,039
collector show which I focus on just

252
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:37,079
showing off seed collections introducing

253
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,919
people to breeders different strains and

254
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:42,359
maybe some grow reports and profiles and

255
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,919
maybe they like it but I also do a show

256
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,399
uh it was called the best Grow Show just

257
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:49,199
because long time ago diesel boy was a

258
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,799
drum and bass DJ and he put America's

259
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,278
number one drum and bass DJ on a CD and

260
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:55,359
he wasn't but because he put it it stuck

261
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:56,879
and then all of a sudden now he's

262
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,759
America's number one drum and based DJ

263
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,799
so I put it as the best Grow Show but it

264
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,879
it got a little too egotistical towards

265
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:05,399
the end there not really but I'm just

266
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:06,958
like ah I can't say it with a straight

267
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,000
face so I just changed that to real

268
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,639
cannabis real cannabis is where I have

269
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,639
the conversations with those craft

270
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,879
Growers with those home Growers with

271
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:17,759
again the people that are going to be

272
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:20,120
keeping this tradition alive cool very

273
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,600
cool definitely sounds like we're doing

274
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,959
similar stuff but I don't see it as

275
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,639
competition I see it more as we we help

276
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:31,319
each other grow by generating interest

277
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:31,319
in these topics

278
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,278
collaboration absolutely and it's such a

279
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,480
big world I mean just even like

280
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:40,639
strainwise regionally you know we were

281
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,879
talking um a second ago about you know

282
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,000
that that hom grower needs that outlet

283
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,120
to kind of get it to people there's a

284
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,839
lot of strains like GMO is one that

285
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,078
always just pops into my head as an easy

286
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,120
example in I'm in Washington state I've

287
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:54,958
been part of the legal Market here for a

288
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,799
long time I didn't really start seeing

289
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:59,799
that show up to like 2018 2019 out here

290
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:01,559
and everybody's like ooh wow this is the

291
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:03,039
hot new thing and then I talked to some

292
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:07,278
friends in Michigan they're like yeah

293
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:09,120
that's so like 2013 bro so we need a lot

294
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,439
of people doing this we need people in

295
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,959
different areas because we're all again

296
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,399
from where or how we had to operate

297
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:17,439
before we were all just a bunch of

298
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,278
little clicks and that's how a lot of

299
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,160
famous strain started you know and they

300
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:24,720
kind of mov but now we can expand so I

301
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:27,759
enjoy you know again not looking at it

302
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,160
as competition we're just making a

303
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,879
thicker book for people to read

304
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:36,559
absolutely I like that and we learn from

305
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:38,278
each other you know I you know I'll be

306
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:39,958
honest with you I haven't gotten a

307
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:42,439
chance to watch too much of your stuff I

308
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:46,039
watched a little bit but I'm an advid

309
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,560
cannabis podcast Watcher you know like I

310
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,759
watch a ton of stuff on the future

311
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:54,159
cannabis project the first smoke of the

312
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:57,240
day you know I'm I'm trying to soak in

313
00:11:54,159 --> 00:12:01,000
as much of this stuff as I can and you

314
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,639
know to me like it's hard to get

315
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,600
enough it is and here's a perfect

316
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:08,399
example of of of why like I love

317
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,240
absorbing the content and you guys

318
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,399
probably love absorbing the content for

319
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,839
years with the story of sour I kept

320
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,679
hearing about this guy Staten Island

321
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:20,480
would we ever know who he is would we

322
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:22,799
ever hear from him I don't know years

323
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,519
that was the story well guess where we

324
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:28,278
are today so it's cool how things kind

325
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,560
of connect sometimes it's pretty fun

326
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:32,480
thing is is I I didn't know anyone

327
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,518
wanted to hear from me people were

328
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,680
talking about and then I was given this

329
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:39,519
nickname Staten Island I'm like yeah you

330
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,919
could tell I'm a little salty about that

331
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,399
but honestly the way it was told to me

332
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:46,278
was and I won't mention his name the guy

333
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,198
a guy on another podcast was like yeah I

334
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:51,519
heard you're really private that you

335
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:54,000
know and I and I said who told you that

336
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:57,959
because I've never been accused of being

337
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,399
private before I've been out in the open

338
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:01,359
you know since

339
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,720
the

340
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,039
latees you know and I've been talking to

341
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:09,360
people about growing cannabis and so the

342
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:11,958
idea that Gabby would be private that

343
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,240
was just like what are you talking about

344
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:16,679
but you know once I found out that

345
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,440
people were interested in hearing from

346
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:21,519
me and I started telling the stories

347
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,600
well now I can't shut

348
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,360
up no but it's that's why we have a I

349
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,360
feel like we have such a great following

350
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,199
already is because the stories seem to

351
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:34,000
be authentic with without it

352
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:37,719
being uh too much of of self-promotion

353
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,958
so I cuz I I do sometimes find that like

354
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,600
some of the other shows that I've

355
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,319
listened to personally when it does come

356
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,240
to like people with the self-promotion

357
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,519
you can really tell the difference and I

358
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,639
I feel like we have this little bit of

359
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,320
an authenticness coming about the way

360
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,839
that we tell our stories because it is

361
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,040
more towards like letting individuals

362
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,320
tell their story how they came to the

363
00:13:54,039 --> 00:14:00,000
plant or how the plant came to them and

364
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,240
um and and kind of just like the organic

365
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,320
nature of that so actually I do want to

366
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,198
ask you a question because this is the

367
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,480
way we grow podcast it's just a segment

368
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:12,000
of The Craft Growers Network I do want

369
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,480
to know how you grow but firstly I

370
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,958
really want to know what you grew first

371
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,959
and who taught you how to grow plants in

372
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,799
general and it doesn't even necessarily

373
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,599
need to be cannabis like for me for

374
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,198
instance my grandma taught me how to

375
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,320
grow a garden and then my dad also

376
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:30,278
reinforced that leave this uh but and

377
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,959
that was just more like a small tomato

378
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:35,320
or

379
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:37,159
um uh like tomato garden or cucumbers or

380
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,199
just other little produce things my

381
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:42,559
grandma actually had uh sorl from France

382
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:44,838
that she brought over and it I still

383
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:47,000
have the same cutting of it from the

384
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:48,720
same root stock that I've kept going now

385
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,919
for years and years and years and so

386
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,959
that's like one of the things that I tie

387
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:55,319
to my growing story but I want to hear

388
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:59,078
yours as it pertains to you know where

389
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:01,160
you where you yeah I mean I wish I had a

390
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:03,758
better story and I wish I had a mentor

391
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:05,639
but growing up like I was a city kid you

392
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,560
know I grew up in the city I did not

393
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:11,399
appreciate nature I had no interest in

394
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:13,319
growing or anything of that in my teen

395
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,879
years again I was in the Pacific

396
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,399
Northwest in the I do not know what

397
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:19,519
brick weed looks like so being pretty

398
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,198
spoiled

399
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:25,320
there yeah but you do know what some

400
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:27,879
shitty beaster look like oh God yeah oh

401
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,480
some some really crappy beaster yes we

402
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:31,639
were raised on beaster here but

403
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,560
apparently whenever I mention beers

404
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,120
people sometimes especially the East

405
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:37,958
Coast they're like wow that was the good

406
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,198
stuff that wasn't no Mexican but I I

407
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:42,838
didn't start my first pot plant I didn't

408
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:44,519
know anything about photo period I

409
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,440
didn't know anything about nutrients it

410
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,360
was just like a throw it in the dirt it

411
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,040
came up got maybe three sets of lease

412
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,440
and then I was like what do you do with

413
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:54,759
this and then I killed it between that

414
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,959
and then actually growing again I had a

415
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:59,480
cactus for two years and then I managed

416
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,958
to kill that as well I'm just like ooh

417
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,839
not a good sign but eventually

418
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:06,078
eventually when things were a little bit

419
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,880
more LAX in Washington state and I did

420
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,838
actually get my medical card I was able

421
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:12,360
to go into the medical dispensaries I

422
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:15,120
could pick up seeds I could pick up

423
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,879
clones and that's how I got started with

424
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,078
cannabis and unfortunately for me I

425
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:21,919
didn't have a mentor like it was all

426
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:24,120
kind of self-taught the there were

427
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:26,599
forums back in the day but that

428
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,959
information was like 5050 on whether it

429
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:33,480
was good or not so what

430
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:36,278
was this what's that uh around what year

431
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,920
was this like 2010

432
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:39,759
2011

433
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:42,479
okay there were you know there were a

434
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,639
few books uh Danny Dano he had the show

435
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,800
called free weed it was back on the old

436
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,480
High Times podcast Network so that's

437
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:51,120
where I got a lot of information to

438
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,639
start and some books but I just kind of

439
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,480
progressed from there I started you know

440
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,720
with your basic soil grow your Fox Farm

441
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,120
and your three part as you see other

442
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,600
people do and then just it's it's

443
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,318
progressed through a bunch of different

444
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,838
styles and you know they say cannabis is

445
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:08,318
a gateway drug it is it's a gateway drug

446
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:11,038
to gardening because now I have huge

447
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,838
beds outside where I grow vegetables I

448
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,959
grow all kinds of things things that

449
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:18,558
flower or things that finish faster than

450
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:21,279
cannabis sometimes which is nice right

451
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:23,558
but today I I'm I'm doing more of an

452
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:25,959
organic approach I'm not going you know

453
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:28,399
full hippie as I like to say with worms

454
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:31,440
and beneficial insects and adding in my

455
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,038
own poop to it no I like working with a

456
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,160
kind of almost a super soil a soil with

457
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:38,720
enough nutrients in it already but from

458
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,759
organic sources and then I just do a few

459
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,200
top dressings uh cuz again I wanted to

460
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:46,240
get people started and I know that if I

461
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,400
can take nutrients and that kind of

462
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,200
aspect out of someone's first grow they

463
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,400
may be able to pay more attention to the

464
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,840
plant and they may have more success

465
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,440
versus someone who's trying to measure

466
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,158
things so that's the road I've been

467
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,360
going down for years is trying to find a

468
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,320
simple soil for people to use what sort

469
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:03,639
of top dressings do you like to use and

470
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:06,480
like uh yeah like talk us through like

471
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:09,720
the the 15minute elevator pitch flower

472
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:13,000
cycle for a organic Gardener indoors

473
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,440
with top dressings yep okay so top

474
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,119
dressing is just a combination of I

475
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,519
could grab the bag but it's a bunch of

476
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:22,279
meals oh gosh I do you know the brand of

477
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,240
course I'm yeah it's a kiss Organics um

478
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:27,678
okay cool yeah do I have it let's see

479
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,919
here oh sorry stand up bone meal Alfalfa

480
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,759
potassium sulfate insect fras gypsum W

481
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:37,159
lastiny soy protein got my my little

482
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:39,599
notes there nice and so so for like

483
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:42,159
flowering what pot size is going to be a

484
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:44,038
big determining Factor also the length

485
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:46,120
of your vegetative period is going to be

486
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:48,480
a big factor when it comes to you know

487
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:49,918
like water only soils or super soils

488
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,798
bigger the pot means the bigger the

489
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,120
battery the longer it will last before

490
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:57,960
you have to feed it 5 gallon 7 gallon if

491
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:59,839
I'm going a 45 day vegge sometimes I'll

492
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,440
check things out which is a real quick

493
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:05,599
veg and I'll go uh a three

494
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,919
gallon

495
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,678
typically cuz with Organic ingredients

496
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,200
you have to think really two three weeks

497
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,240
ahead because it's not immediately plant

498
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,679
available like a synthetic nutrient

499
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,319
would be so a lot of times what I'll do

500
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:22,440
is a few weeks before the flip I'll put

501
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:24,480
on a veg top dressing which doesn't

502
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,519
really start to become effective until

503
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,798
that transition period I've already

504
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:30,519
switched it to 1212 but the plant

505
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:32,119
hormones are just starting to change I

506
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:33,798
find you know a little extra nitrogen

507
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:35,558
boost through that period feeding it as

508
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:37,119
if it were a veg plant is still

509
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:40,000
beneficial it just kind of kick starts

510
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:42,239
it off into the flowering phase and then

511
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,759
at about two weeks after flip you're

512
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,120
still a little bit in the stretch I'll

513
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:48,240
come back and I'll do another top

514
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,399
dressing with a with a bloom formula

515
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,720
because there's a veg and a bloom

516
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,080
formula for the dry amendments and then

517
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,919
I'll typically let it ride because what

518
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,240
I'm working with these days is I'm

519
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,240
really focusing on kind of like 60 days

520
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,839
or plants if it were to go 70 days I may

521
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,759
top dress again at week five just again

522
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,000
it takes a few weeks to become available

523
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,519
but that is typically how I approach

524
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,038
flour I do have some organic bottle

525
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:14,240
nutrients if I need a foler spray or

526
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:16,519
something that's a little bit more

527
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,720
immediate but yeah it's it's it's really

528
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:20,918
simple it's really hands off which is

529
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,480
good for a lot of people I think yeah I

530
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:24,720
totally agree that's kind of like the uh

531
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,038
the way that I've seen a lot of people

532
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,798
growing with uh with Organic amendments

533
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:31,519
especially with top dressing do do you

534
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:34,038
happen to like reuse your your substrate

535
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:36,720
afterwards are you remediating it in any

536
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:38,599
way and and uh replanting in it after

537
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,679
you let the the root stock Rod out or

538
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:43,599
anything like

539
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:45,840
that I'm going to start using reusing my

540
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,798
soil indoors typically what I have done

541
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:50,879
is I have brought it Outdoors to that

542
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:52,359
big bed that I have out there now like

543
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,440
nobody should have that much perlite in

544
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:58,240
their Garden but I do um I've been so

545
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,798
yeah you know actually I think it I

546
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,120
think it was wolf uh that told me if you

547
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:05,240
use black food coloring and you run it

548
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,719
through the soil it may dye some of that

549
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,000
perlite a different color so it's not as

550
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,319
obvious I haven't put it into practice

551
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,159
yet but logically I'm like all right I

552
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:18,439
can see it that's funny yeah but yeah I

553
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,600
I am going to start reusing it and and

554
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,120
amending it I'm working again with Tad

555
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:24,240
husy from Kiss Organics I'm working on

556
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:27,079
my own custom soil blend something that

557
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,038
works specifically well kind of

558
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:30,759
universally but specifically with my

559
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,240
genetics again to where somebody could

560
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:35,558
like pick up the genetics pick up the

561
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,400
soil follow my Sops that I've shown them

562
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:39,759
on the video and they should be able to

563
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,919
get a similar result but that does

564
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:43,519
include go ahead sorry when you say

565
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,240
pickup genetics are you talking about

566
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:50,798
from seed stock or a clone stock

567
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:53,798
or yeah I right now am just seeds Okay I

568
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:55,519
haven't done any clones um there there's

569
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:57,440
some different reasons for that again

570
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:59,519
you're kind of giving it all away when

571
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,759
you give out your special clone I have

572
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:04,079
the Westport grape juice is is like my

573
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:06,839
special thing um I do have that backed

574
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:09,399
up with one person is growace killer a

575
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:11,839
John he's out on the East Coast he's

576
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,400
wins Awards and he has won a few Awards

577
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:16,678
recently with that and his 818 headband

578
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,159
he he Blends the two rosins to make

579
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:21,679
hachimaki grape juice I took second at

580
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:24,960
davo in Massachusetts he took third at

581
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,360
the Pelle polar turp Wars recently but

582
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,400
yeah clones I'm kind of keep those close

583
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:30,678
to the chest right now but the seeds

584
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,038
people can get and that's what I meant

585
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:35,120
by you know pick up genetics pick up

586
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:36,879
genetics pick up the soil follow the

587
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,000
procedures and you should get the same

588
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,320
results so we're hoping could you

589
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,519
describe the Westport grape juice the

590
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:45,399
the breeder cut for people just cuz you

591
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:48,079
know I've seen it on Instagram a few

592
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,320
times but I've never actually heard the

593
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:51,918
the

594
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:54,240
description yeah so so the Westport

595
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,320
grape juice as far as effects people

596
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,200
like to go to effects something that I

597
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:01,038
typically go for in the evening it's a

598
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:04,000
little a bit more relaxing and sedative

599
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:06,278
without knocking your like intelligence

600
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,519
level down a few pigs kind of just lets

601
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:10,720
the muscles just kind of relaxed I

602
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:12,240
really you know I enjoy it I'm able to

603
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,640
have like you know how sometimes you get

604
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,480
into those deep conversations and then

605
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,799
it's like 45 minutes later and you're

606
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,079
like wow we went deep on that one but it

607
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:25,558
feels like two minutes that's kind of

608
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:27,519
how I get with it yeah um far as like I

609
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:30,399
you know I personally enjoy it the

610
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:33,240
profile though like taste and the aroma

611
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:37,038
so the aroma while it's growing you'll

612
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:40,440
get almost kind of like a carnival candy

613
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:43,240
grape to it but as it ripens and as it

614
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,759
dries and cures it matures into more of

615
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,000
a like wine grape almost like kind of

616
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:50,440
like a red like with body something with

617
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,119
body I can't think of a better word so

618
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,798
like like almost more like a like a

619
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:56,678
Cabernet grape or something where it's

620
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:59,480
it's a little more uh acidic almost

621
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:01,559
citrusy with the grape in it it whereas

622
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:05,319
like a conquered grape would be like a

623
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:07,798
pie grape smell okay more towards the

624
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:10,119
Cabernet but I don't really get Citrus

625
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:12,278
or acidity from it there is cream to it

626
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:14,599
so it has kind of a nice on the inhale

627
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:16,960
on the inhale you get that that mature

628
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:19,480
wine grape with some creaminess so it's

629
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,640
kind of smooth it it rolls off the back

630
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,159
and then when you exhale there's that

631
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,799
like little patch in the back of your

632
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:28,480
throat that always gets dry and you're

633
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:31,119
like that little patch just a hint of

634
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,038
gas touches that patch on the way out

635
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:36,359
okay so wow that sounds really good you

636
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:37,879
don't get it from The Upfront profile

637
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:39,158
you don't get it from the you know

638
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,399
initial hit but yeah when you're

639
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:43,200
exhaling it just that little bit of gas

640
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:45,719
tingles you there and that's kind of

641
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,240
made it stick out and was special for me

642
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,558
and then just the way that it grows it's

643
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,240
commercially viable like it stays short

644
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:55,798
it stays squat which for me is important

645
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,960
and for you know the people that I'm

646
00:24:55,798 --> 00:25:00,319
aiming towards home breeders and Tents

647
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,278
that's very important keep it short keep

648
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:05,000
it tight keep it squat it doesn't

649
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:07,440
stretch a whole lot I would say onetime

650
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,200
stretch if that and then just it just

651
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,679
chunks up with like nice thick golf ball

652
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,159
buds so it's from a commercial aspect

653
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:16,840
commercially viable but from an

654
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,278
enjoyment side yeah the the profile and

655
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:21,879
the effects are just something unique to

656
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:23,880
me and other people are enjoying it too

657
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,159
I mean that it sounds really great

658
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,080
personally love purple and grape

659
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:31,200
cultivars just growing up in the Bay

660
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:33,639
Area I had access to a lot of that and

661
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,600
so it's nostalgic for me I've I've been

662
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,600
running at the uh commercial facility

663
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,879
that I've been managing what uh it's

664
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:42,959
called Beach grapes from Oni seeds we

665
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:46,440
have a number 12 cut that we hunted and

666
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:49,600
it's uh very much conquered grapes with

667
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:52,440
that kind of like creamy but also like a

668
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:54,599
lot of fuel gassiness on both the front

669
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,080
and back end and so things like that

670
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:59,319
just always kind of they're really good

671
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:03,359
they they hit the pallette for me really

672
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:06,599
well yeah so let's see you said you

673
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:08,319
transitioned from Cannabis to vegetables

674
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:09,839
not the other way around which I always

675
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:12,038
find fascinating because it was the

676
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:14,398
opposite for me um

677
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:16,480
so when you first started growing

678
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:18,759
cannabis what was what was your first

679
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,360
successful grow like I had beginner's

680
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:24,798
luck like my first two or three grows

681
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:26,798
were were really beginners luck they

682
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:29,519
they went very well I didn't do much

683
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:31,440
feeding of them again Fox Farm that that

684
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,000
soil has a little bit of a charge so it

685
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,159
will get you through a little bit a

686
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,720
month or so of nutrients but I started

687
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:39,039
with the premise of like I just want to

688
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,319
see what the plant does again not having

689
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:43,359
that Mentor not having that background

690
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:44,960
of gardening I'm just like okay I need

691
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:46,879
to see what the plant is going to do

692
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,200
naturally before I start adding all

693
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,919
these other things in so I know when I

694
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,759
start adding these other things in it

695
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:55,000
did that so that's kind of how I got

696
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:57,079
started it all started with again bag

697
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,640
seed which most people will start with

698
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:02,079
and then you know I mentioned the the

699
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,559
Washington Medical system 2010 2011 uh

700
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,678
was when it really kicked off in

701
00:27:03,558 --> 00:27:09,079
Washington and I was able to get access

702
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:11,559
to you know professional seeds and I

703
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:14,918
always H my first professional cut was a

704
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:17,558
Jax cleaner to uh from TGA genetics at

705
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:19,799
the time subcool still to this day that

706
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:22,079
is what I judge every lemon strain off

707
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:24,759
of they hunt the the dispensary I got

708
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:27,199
the Jax cleaner too from they hunted it

709
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:29,519
they put out a killer clone like that

710
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,880
it's so good it's it was so and it was

711
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:34,398
like a lemon cleaner it wasn't like a

712
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,399
lemon candy there there was a lemon head

713
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:40,278
taste to it but it was so astringent it

714
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:42,839
ate the rubber ring around the top of my

715
00:27:40,278 --> 00:27:45,038
ball jars like that's how astringent

716
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:47,959
that Jack's cleaner 2 was so that was my

717
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:50,919
first Pro Cut as I like to say I you

718
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,798
know I have never had a great lemon

719
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,360
strain like the closest thing that I

720
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:56,319
could ever think of was like a really

721
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:58,639
good Jack herrer or something but that

722
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:01,480
was more on the floral end with the

723
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,480
Citrus to it and so I I've always been

724
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:06,399
like envious of either like the Jax

725
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,159
cleaner or the lemon tree or the lemon

726
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:09,879
up even i' I've heard great things about

727
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,960
lemon up I don't know

728
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:16,679
like cuz I got really tired of orange

729
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,600
flavored stuff it just seemed that it

730
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:22,519
eventually went from being like this

731
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:26,119
nice citrusy orange to almost this like

732
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:28,960
dirty kind of musky orange uh like the

733
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:31,639
rinds yeah like kind of almost weak old

734
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,159
weak old orange I did follow up that Jax

735
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,679
cleaner too with the agent orange from

736
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,480
TJ at the time and that one reminded me

737
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:40,519
of almost like the scratch and sniff

738
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,759
sticker type of orange like it was

739
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:44,679
friendly it was approachable that was a

740
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:46,278
good one and then you know like K but

741
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:49,038
then it went to like kind of like you're

742
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:52,720
saying it morphed a little bit into like

743
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:54,519
Tangi and mimosa and those two like I

744
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,480
personally enjoy them but they're

745
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:58,480
they're like black licorice nobody is

746
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,880
like yeah it's cool you either like it

747
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,120
or you don't absolutely that's a really

748
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,919
good comparison people are like yeah I

749
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:08,879
hate that and I'm like yeah I like it

750
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:11,240
it's cool so um with your the Westport

751
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,919
grape juice what or or actually any of

752
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,038
your strains cuz I kind of want to know

753
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:16,799
more about your breeding program what's

754
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:19,759
uh what's your breeding style like do

755
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:23,000
you like to do line breeding do you like

756
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:25,440
to do back crosses or are you making

757
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,119
feminized or regular seeds and sort of

758
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,679
like what generation have you taken

759
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:31,599
certain things to and and made these cuz

760
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,038
it sounds very stable what you're

761
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:36,119
dealing with to be able to provide a

762
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:38,359
soil specific recipe and even an

763
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:40,959
environment and irrigation strategy and

764
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:42,599
feeding strategy like I I find that to

765
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,240
be super impressive so I want to know a

766
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:48,000
little bit more about your your breeding

767
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,440
style yeah it's kind of a little bit all

768
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,798
of the above and things happen slowly

769
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,120
for me I'm just the scale that I'm able

770
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:58,079
to do it I have a lot of really good

771
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:59,918
testers so like I can run 500 of

772
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:02,398
something to get a good idea of what's

773
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:05,399
in it no problem I just can't do it

774
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:07,879
personally in house so that's a huge

775
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:09,918
thing so feminized though a lot of new

776
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,278
Growers like the feminized and with the

777
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,640
Westport grape juice know people have

778
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:16,960
seen it people heard people talk about

779
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,640
it they wanted it so I'm like all right

780
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,840
I'll do you know I'll do a S1 I'll

781
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,159
feminize it make a first generation of

782
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:25,918
itself I was hoping to get something

783
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,919
that was going to be like a spitting

784
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,600
image of it I did not get that it was

785
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:33,519
kind of shocked me there there were

786
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:35,319
basically five distinct phenos that came

787
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:37,480
from it whereas I really thought I would

788
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:39,599
get one maybe like one and a half I got

789
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,919
five distinct fenos from it there's I've

790
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:43,639
got a video up there which shows the

791
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,759
grow of all of them it shows all of the

792
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,360
fenos start to finish uh there's a lot

793
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:49,599
of also good feedback out there for

794
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:50,918
people interesting thing that popped up

795
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:52,439
with that one and then I'll talk about

796
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:54,360
back Crossing and lme breeding I

797
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,120
mentioned that gas that little bit of

798
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:59,638
gas on the exhale a second ago I easily

799
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:02,038
where that came from after doing the

800
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:05,119
selfing like three out of 10 are going

801
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:07,278
to be all gas single note nothing but

802
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:08,839
and the easy way to spot those very

803
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:10,519
easily is you know your leaves will

804
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:12,638
typically grow like this the tuck Leaf

805
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:14,480
you know it wants to grow like this all

806
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:16,719
of the leaves on those gas ones will

807
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,079
grow like that so that was kind of an

808
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,120
interesting surprise cuz I hadn't done

809
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:24,038
any selfing before on anything I've

810
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:27,518
always gone with like line breeding or

811
00:31:24,038 --> 00:31:29,319
bat crossing right now um I'm I'm doing

812
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,679
a little little bit of probably more

813
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:32,638
backat Crossing than Li braiding

814
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:34,639
although I do want to do lion braiding

815
00:31:32,638 --> 00:31:36,519
and and I say that because I'm working

816
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:39,479
with the Westport grape juice and I've

817
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:41,200
been working with other plants that I

818
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,079
like and that I'm very familiar with and

819
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,240
then I'll put them together and I'm I'm

820
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:48,119
going through and seeing what is really

821
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,278
dominant and what is seemingly recessive

822
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:53,479
about that plant compared to some other

823
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:55,798
ones and then I do have regular crosses

824
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,278
as well as the feminis with that so I am

825
00:31:55,798 --> 00:32:00,679
at one point going to be bringing back

826
00:31:58,278 --> 00:32:02,440
to the Westport grape juice to see if I

827
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:05,519
can lock that in more cuz I would love

828
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:08,159
to get that in like a solid stable seed

829
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,359
form I just don't have it yet so that's

830
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,799
kind of the goal I'm working to and

831
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:15,879
because it is feminized line breeding

832
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:18,918
isn't as easy but bat Crossing because I

833
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:21,159
have outcrossed it to Other M so regular

834
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:24,960
seeds that makes my life a little bit

835
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:26,120
easier just takes time though yeah no I

836
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,480
I've done a little bit of breeding

837
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:30,719
myself and I think the Fest I took

838
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,679
something to was an F2 and I found that

839
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,000
it was like stabilized between like two

840
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:37,399
different specific uh structural

841
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,159
phenotypes but then the actual chemotype

842
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:40,879
and that the tarpine profiles were

843
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:42,919
vastly different and the effects were

844
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,399
also vastly different amongst the

845
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:47,960
structural similarities so I was and

846
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:49,759
then I had to move and I lost a lot of

847
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,360
the space that I had for breeding so I

848
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,119
was like oh well this is going to go on

849
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:55,038
the back burner for a little bit but I

850
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:57,199
do like the idea of back Crossing just

851
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:59,359
because locking in those those traits

852
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,120
and and it does create some bottleneck

853
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:04,398
events in certain cases but it does also

854
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:06,678
kind of remove a lot of the recessive

855
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:08,719
traits or bring the recessive traits

856
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:11,120
forward that you're looking for so I I

857
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,240
can definitely appreciate that and it I

858
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:14,798
just want to know like so where where

859
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,720
did you get the idea of creating this

860
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:19,558
recipe specific soil for for your

861
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,399
specific strains and is it something

862
00:33:19,558 --> 00:33:23,359
that you're working on for just one

863
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:26,719
strain or are you trying to create it

864
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:28,879
for multiple strains yep um for multiple

865
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,440
strains it's you know it it should be

866
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,399
more of just like a general feed even

867
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,558
though it's specifically gonna work with

868
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:38,158
what I have nothing as far as my

869
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:40,319
genetics right now are outliers as far

870
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,120
as like oh it it you know it needs extra

871
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:45,519
phosphorus or like oh you have to like

872
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:47,239
cut this at a certain page they're all

873
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,240
basically General feeders so there's

874
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,679
nothing outside of the norm which is

875
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,599
good because that's going to catch the

876
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:54,720
majority of other strains out there

877
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:56,839
there will always be the outliers and if

878
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,919
I come across that we'll be able to you

879
00:33:56,839 --> 00:34:00,839
know easily tweak the recipe to do

880
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:03,559
something like that but yeah I I want to

881
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:05,158
kind of set people up for success and

882
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:06,918
and real quick back to the breeding

883
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:09,119
thing one one way that I kind of try to

884
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:12,280
make my life easier or set myself up for

885
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,960
success is I I cross it with a lot of

886
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,280
older stuff a lot of amster dam genetics

887
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:21,039
um I travel there every year those

888
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:23,960
things over there are not exactly sexy

889
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:26,239
but they're very stable in and that's

890
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,159
not sexual expression that just means as

891
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:32,279
like you plant 10 you're going to get

892
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:34,760
like 9.5 looking the same out of 10 for

893
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,960
sure so if I grow that and I'm familiar

894
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,560
with that and I've grown what it gets

895
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,720
crossed to and I'm very familiar with

896
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:44,519
that it makes my job a lot easier

897
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:46,959
looking at The Offspring versus if I Hot

898
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:49,480
Hot and Hot Hot where I'm just like oo

899
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,079
sweet 20 Expressions what do I do now

900
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,358
well and and working with a stock of

901
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:55,879
plants that are from hopefully a far

902
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:57,719
enough removed genetic population will

903
00:34:55,878 --> 00:34:59,319
also help create some stabilities in the

904
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:01,358
Offspring too so that yeah that's a

905
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,519
wonderful idea I really like that and

906
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:05,440
vigor absolutely absolutely that's a

907
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:07,639
wonderful idea I really like that so in

908
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,720
your growing time one one segment I'd

909
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:11,679
like to add into this show that I'm

910
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:14,838
going to try and sneak in here at this

911
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:17,838
point is what are some issues you've had

912
00:35:14,838 --> 00:35:20,880
with growing that you had like the most

913
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:22,559
learning curve adaptation from like what

914
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,280
helped you the most in your growing

915
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:27,880
Journey as it pertained to an incident

916
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,880
that you faced

917
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,680
you know sounds kind of funny but like

918
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,760
watering properly makes a big difference

919
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:37,039
there's growing throughout my years i'

920
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:39,400
I've come to realize like you can grow

921
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:42,039
and it will turn out good but when you

922
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,119
really nail everything like from your

923
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:47,519
watering from your lighting to your airf

924
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:49,880
flow you do see a really big difference

925
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:51,719
in results so the the watering was one

926
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,318
that I think it was that was my limiting

927
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:56,679
factor for a while Solutions like Auto

928
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:58,800
Poots or self-watering stuff or you

929
00:35:56,679 --> 00:36:02,239
could get like a blue m tensometer a

930
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:05,079
water meter and you you use it as a tool

931
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:06,559
to train your hands or to train your

932
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,400
eyes I mean we all know when a plant's

933
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:10,239
thirsty or it's overwatered but there's

934
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,639
still that like fine line where it still

935
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:15,199
looks good but it's thirsty so that was

936
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:17,039
one of them but to tie into that as well

937
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:20,039
probably the biggest thing that I

938
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:22,800
underestimated was VPD vapor pressure

939
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:25,318
deficit combination of your temperature

940
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,880
and your humidity the math between those

941
00:36:25,318 --> 00:36:29,559
is what kind of drives you know

942
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,720
transpiration plant sweat uptake from

943
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:34,039
The Roots that's a way to really drive

944
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:36,358
and steer your plant again without I

945
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:39,119
didn't know about VPD for over a decade

946
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:40,920
and I grew just fine but once I learned

947
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,079
about it once I really started to

948
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,400
control those parameters I started to

949
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:47,519
see differences and I was like wow I was

950
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,720
missing out all those years you can grow

951
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:52,358
without knowing it but when you know it

952
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:54,118
it's it makes a difference I want to

953
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:56,119
just emphasize that point for all the

954
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,280
listeners about VPD because I've heard

955
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:00,440
in a lot of other podcasts and other

956
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:03,079
other spaces that people will say you

957
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,679
know VPD is OV exaggerated and how

958
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:06,640
important it is and they'll say you

959
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:08,719
should just focus on making sure your

960
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:10,519
heat doesn't get out of control or that

961
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:12,759
your temp um or that your humidity

962
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:15,119
doesn't get out of control and I feel as

963
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:17,520
though the funny thing in saying that is

964
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,119
somewhat contradictory because by taking

965
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:20,800
both of those into account you are

966
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,000
paying attention to VP just without

967
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,960
doing the calculations and I feel as

968
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,119
though another huge aspect to the vapor

969
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,079
pressure deficit is also the interaction

970
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:33,000
with the radiation in input to the plant

971
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:35,160
from your lighting Source how so I I do

972
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,920
agree that the vapor pressure deficit is

973
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:39,000
kind of a determining factor of the

974
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,599
transpiration rate but the driving

975
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,639
factor for the transpiration rate is

976
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:45,480
going to be the photosynthetic uh

977
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:48,358
potential within the plant due to the

978
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,519
lighting at that point and so by you

979
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:50,960
know by increasing the lighting you're

980
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:53,519
going to in increase the need to

981
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,800
transpire and your limiting factor then

982
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:58,318
is the VPD within your environment of

983
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,720
how fast the plant can transpire and

984
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:04,318
have the active transport of nutrients

985
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:07,000
and so like what led you to um seeing

986
00:38:04,318 --> 00:38:09,279
that as such a important factor like

987
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,400
what did you notice in your plants that

988
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,760
made that uh sort of the discovery that

989
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,240
made such a huge difference for

990
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:20,119
you um kind of in the morphology and the

991
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:22,439
color of the plants the way that it was

992
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:25,000
able to handle nutrients the way that it

993
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,000
accepted the nutrients and utilized them

994
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,159
more effectively you know it almost

995
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,358
seemed like the leaves like the fingers

996
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:33,799
became wider they were happier to you

997
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:36,239
know just like stretch out and I'm a

998
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:39,039
happy leaf and again it's it's it's one

999
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:41,118
of those things that you can grow

1000
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:43,199
without paying attention to it and so

1001
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,838
many of us did for so long and that's

1002
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:48,480
why some people you know poo poo it as

1003
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:50,279
not being Uber important because well

1004
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,480
you can grow without paying attention

1005
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:55,160
but when you do pay attention to it you

1006
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,000
can notice differences and that's

1007
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:57,960
usually you know cuz I have commercial

1008
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,639
experience

1009
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,760
as well I've gone to school for some of

1010
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:05,000
these things as well a lot of a lot of

1011
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,440
the tips you know as as a hom grower or

1012
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,800
someone who coaches hom Growers I always

1013
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:12,079
say Size Matters and CO2 is is kind of

1014
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,920
an example I always use for this for a

1015
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:17,359
homeg grower that's like your last 3%

1016
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,318
when you're 97% dialed and you have

1017
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:21,039
everything working and it's just rocking

1018
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:23,000
and you're bored with life toss

1019
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:25,519
something new in there but there's so

1020
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,880
many things as far as like temperature

1021
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:29,559
intensity of your light that need to be

1022
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,880
in place otherwise it's not even going

1023
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:33,559
to work and if you don't have those

1024
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,559
basic things down first then it's all

1025
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:38,199
for not so a lot of the things that we

1026
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:40,480
hear you know again Size Matters is for

1027
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:43,480
commercial scale CU if I have four

1028
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:46,119
plants in a 4x4 and I get two extra

1029
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,760
grams off of each plant big whoop but if

1030
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:50,000
we go back to my commercial facility

1031
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,160
where you have over 60,000 plants and

1032
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,358
you're getting two extra grams that's a

1033
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:56,639
big freaking difference yeah so there's

1034
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:59,000
a lot of things out there that are meant

1035
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:01,000
for you know just fine-tuning it or

1036
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,639
commercial that it applies to your hom

1037
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,280
grow as well but it may not be as

1038
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:07,920
important but VPD is as important so

1039
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,920
yeah pay attention to that I agree

1040
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,440
wholeheartedly and and within that last

1041
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,480
3% or however many percent people are

1042
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:16,720
operating up to like you know what

1043
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,880
whatever they have that capacity of

1044
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:21,598
production for I feel as though there's

1045
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:24,640
also even stages in which to implement

1046
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:28,119
those last 3% items because like let's

1047
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:30,318
say you that CO2 is one of those last 3%

1048
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:32,760
items you don't want to implement under

1049
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:36,159
canopy lighting before you implement

1050
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:39,440
CO2 right or you don't want to implement

1051
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:42,440
like a higher uh EC feed if you're using

1052
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,880
Hydroponics or a more intensive feeding

1053
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,880
schedule for top dressing or like worm

1054
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,559
casting teas or sprouted seed teas or

1055
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,400
other things like that if you aren't

1056
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:53,400
getting enough lighting to the plan or

1057
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,720
giving it enough CO2 for the high

1058
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,440
transpiration rate that you're looking

1059
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:59,039
to get all those nutrients transported

1060
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,358
and so I I totally agree that's it I

1061
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:03,480
feel like a lot of people do think that

1062
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:05,838
implementing something cuz like you said

1063
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,679
bigger is better and it's I feel as

1064
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,480
though there's there's a positive way to

1065
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:11,719
spin that in the industry for hom

1066
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:16,039
Growers as well and then in some cases

1067
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:17,959
people overgo on things and and they um

1068
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:20,759
they'll they'll over Implement before

1069
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,679
they have the ability to sustain those

1070
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,720
implementations um I think that's a

1071
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:26,078
really great

1072
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:28,399
point and and you mentioned bigger is

1073
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,519
better too and that's another like

1074
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,318
keyword or like red flag that I always

1075
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:33,719
give to like home Growers when because

1076
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:35,759
companies always want to talk about

1077
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:37,439
bigger is better and oh I got you know x

1078
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,920
amount more yield I always say what are

1079
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,159
you growing for is it biomass or is it

1080
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,720
cannaboids because there are different

1081
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:45,440
things you can do some things will get

1082
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:48,078
you more biomass and if you're

1083
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,559
commercial or you know whatever cool

1084
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,760
biomass is what you're after

1085
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:51,920
cannabinoids though there's certain

1086
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,040
things you could do to increase the

1087
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,680
canabo I'm a big fan of drought stress

1088
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:59,239
at the end to try to increase cannaboids

1089
00:41:56,679 --> 00:42:01,639
absolutely as a personal consumer

1090
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:04,799
medicinal patient homeg grower I'm more

1091
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:06,719
interested in cannabinoids than biomass

1092
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,720
I agree wholeheartedly with that I think

1093
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:12,318
you know and then there's also a way to

1094
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:15,078
have a Best of Both Worlds scenario yeah

1095
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:17,519
but U that's also part of the last 3% I

1096
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:20,079
feel like like you want to push for

1097
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:22,039
quality and then you can push for yields

1098
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,839
but at one point you are going to see

1099
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:27,318
diminishing return on your quality uh if

1100
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:29,119
your yields are over pushed and uh I

1101
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:31,079
feel like that is an issue a lot in the

1102
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,119
commercial space But even for homeg

1103
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:34,800
Growers a lot of people are thinking how

1104
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,880
can I get the most out of this and they

1105
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,760
should just be thinking how can I get

1106
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,440
what I can do the best out of this yes

1107
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,640
and that comes from growing a plant

1108
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,800
multiple times which I don't necessarily

1109
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:48,159
see a lot of new Growers or home Growers

1110
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:50,000
doing you have to become familiar with

1111
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:52,000
your plant that's what people used to do

1112
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,920
back in the day they had whole rooms of

1113
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,880
monocrop one thing and they knew how to

1114
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,159
grow it well so yeah you have to take

1115
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:02,160
your

1116
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:03,639
failures yeah sorry I interrupted you

1117
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:05,799
but yeah I feel like you got to take

1118
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:08,039
your failures and stride too because uh

1119
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,920
o if if you just I've seen too many

1120
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:11,558
people go oh I've killed this plant I'm

1121
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,639
never doing this again and uh that's

1122
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:15,839
where I want to say no look look at how

1123
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:17,960
look at what happened and and and say

1124
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:19,719
hey I can not do that next time or I can

1125
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,800
figure out what happened and and do

1126
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:24,719
better so I do see that in the community

1127
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:27,920
as well mistakes make us better if we

1128
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:29,439
pay attention absolutely AB absolutely

1129
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,880
it's only a failure if you don't learn

1130
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,240
from it yes and I'm I'm big fan of that

1131
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,680
one cuz again it's not a fast growing

1132
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:40,279
plan which is why shows like this is so

1133
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:42,358
are so valuable you can crowdsource the

1134
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,359
knowledge you can squeeze a full year

1135
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:46,000
into you know three months or a few

1136
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:47,920
months of of just learning and paying

1137
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,800
attention so sharing the information is

1138
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,119
important well so I I kind of want to

1139
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:54,680
take us back to your cannabis Journey so

1140
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:56,599
you were homeg growing for however long

1141
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:59,239
and kind of tell us what transitioned

1142
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:01,400
your hom growing into the commercial

1143
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:03,358
space and what that looked like for you

1144
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,960
and whether you're still participating

1145
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:08,078
in it or why you exited that that space

1146
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:11,838
or or what you're you're looking at

1147
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:13,960
there perhaps even for the future y um

1148
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:15,599
well currently I'm looking I'm in

1149
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,679
Washington state but I'm looking for a

1150
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,400
license in Oregon there there's some on

1151
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:22,039
the secondary Market but nothing that

1152
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:24,200
makes sense to me Washington has pushed

1153
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:26,400
out the medical people it's pushed out

1154
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:27,838
the Mom and Pops the the licenses are

1155
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,639
capped they have Haven issued new

1156
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:32,960
licenses in years and they aren't going

1157
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:34,799
to issue them so I can't now that the

1158
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,920
medical system is gone in Washington I

1159
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:40,039
can't play which sucks looking at Oregon

1160
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,480
to that but my transition kind of

1161
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:44,639
started was I have a a background as an

1162
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:48,440
audio engineer and I worked in that for

1163
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:50,719
many years and in 2016 the company that

1164
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:55,000
I worked for was

1165
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:57,679
sold and it sold to a company uh out of

1166
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,239
China uh that basically bought the name

1167
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:01,838
and bought the reputation of the company

1168
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,039
and were just going to do things their

1169
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:07,199
own way but the owners were very

1170
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:09,358
freaking cool they were the most amazing

1171
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,279
job or time in my life ever long story

1172
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:13,358
short they set it up with the new owners

1173
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,640
because the majority of us at that job

1174
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:18,920
were so specialized in what we did

1175
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:21,000
there's no jobs in this country to do

1176
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:23,000
that so they set it up to where anybody

1177
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,880
who wanted to you could go back and the

1178
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,519
new company pays for two years of

1179
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,000
schooling so at that point point I had

1180
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:32,119
already been involved with music I had

1181
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,599
been making music but I went to school

1182
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:36,200
to understand why when I turn this it

1183
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:39,519
sounds good because I know when I turn

1184
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:41,759
this it's going to sound good but why

1185
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:43,639
and so in 2016 I had already been

1186
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,280
growing cannabis and I was getting

1187
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:48,598
pretty good results but short of having

1188
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,720
that Mentor Mentor I didn't really

1189
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:53,039
understand the why behind a lot of these

1190
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,239
things and as my audio teacher taught me

1191
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:55,880
that's always stuck with me he's like

1192
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:57,759
you have to know the rules before you

1193
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,280
can break the rules because once you

1194
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,920
understand how something works you're

1195
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,440
able to manipulate it to get the results

1196
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:06,599
you want and so 2016 I went back to

1197
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,519
school I went to uh sustainable

1198
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:10,559
agriculture and small farm systems it

1199
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:12,358
was a two-year program up here in

1200
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,920
Washington in the scaga valley which is

1201
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:17,880
actually a pretty Powerhouse as far as

1202
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:20,200
nation's um fruits and vegetables we're

1203
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:22,318
we're big on blueberries here and the

1204
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:23,598
cosmic crisp apple with Washington State

1205
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:25,920
University I was part of the field

1206
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:29,359
trials for that during that time so that

1207
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:32,318
was exciting that is really cool yeah

1208
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:34,639
and that's that's how I kind of I kind

1209
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:36,239
of forgot the original uh question but

1210
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:38,159
that's that's how I got into the

1211
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:41,279
commercial aspect or the deeper aspect

1212
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:43,598
of doing what I do is that 2016 career

1213
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,480
change and schooling for sure and and so

1214
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,318
once you went to school and and you

1215
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,639
gained this knowledge of the sustainable

1216
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:52,519
agriculture where did you go and and put

1217
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:57,239
those practices into use for cannabis

1218
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:59,480
yep uh so I don't say the name of the

1219
00:46:57,239 --> 00:47:01,719
company just because there are ndas and

1220
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,480
things like that okay but I don't say

1221
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:04,679
that because I typically trash their

1222
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,760
practices and how they ran their

1223
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:09,598
business so it's like I can talk about

1224
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:11,480
one but not the other well let's talk

1225
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:14,440
about your experience so that people

1226
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:16,519
know kind of how different aspects of

1227
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:18,159
the industry work and uh whatever you're

1228
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:21,039
comfortable with talking

1229
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:23,719
about yeah thank you and and again I

1230
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:28,679
it's I won't be too elusive it's you

1231
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:30,439
know 2017 2018 it was the largest indoor

1232
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:32,000
grow in the state of Washington and

1233
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:35,039
they're still one of the larger

1234
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,760
companies um out here they tend to

1235
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:38,920
change their name every couple years

1236
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:42,920
because what what they did

1237
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:45,639
is the funding was from a Russian

1238
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:47,559
fishing oligarchy so you could probably

1239
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:49,118
connect the dots there but they had a

1240
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:51,119
lot of money to invest and they would

1241
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,358
build these awesome facilities and then

1242
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:55,119
they got bugs so what they would do is

1243
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:57,199
they would build a new facility and then

1244
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,960
bring the [ __ ] plants from the old

1245
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:01,039
facility to the new facility so that

1246
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,318
facility had about 2 years before it was

1247
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:05,079
burned again it's when you take people

1248
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:06,000
who have been growing in a house and

1249
00:48:05,079 --> 00:48:08,079
then all of a sudden give them a

1250
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,199
warehouse that's what I was dealing with

1251
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:12,359
and I I I got brought in um I helped

1252
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:14,439
them bring in their first harvest that

1253
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:16,639
actually turned out good I was there

1254
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:20,200
from when they went from in the red into

1255
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:23,279
the black but just the the Sops there

1256
00:48:20,199 --> 00:48:25,439
were lacking the safety protocol was

1257
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,880
extremely lacking which is why

1258
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,960
ultimately I left but just also you

1259
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:33,039
can't give plant you can't give 60,000

1260
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,920
plants the same love I can give six

1261
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:37,000
there's a lot of things that you have to

1262
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:39,358
do commercially to protect your

1263
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,159
investment that I would never do at home

1264
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:43,279
but commercially you kind of have to do

1265
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:45,519
these things I like I can't tell you how

1266
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,240
many people have smoked my arm hair like

1267
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:49,639
that's just a fact people have smoked my

1268
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:52,000
arm hair out there so yeah I've smoked

1269
00:48:49,639 --> 00:48:53,279
my own arm hair you're just defoliating

1270
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,838
in these big beds and you're just like

1271
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,760
you come home you're just like sticky

1272
00:48:54,838 --> 00:48:58,519
and then eventually we did you know get

1273
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,319
leaves and stuff when when you were

1274
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:03,159
starting up there were a lot of things

1275
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:04,400
that were learned as you went along so

1276
00:49:03,159 --> 00:49:06,679
that was kind of fun to be there for

1277
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,960
that process too uh because a I got to

1278
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:10,279
play with other people's plants and B

1279
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,679
make mistakes on them because they would

1280
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,920
tell me to do and this turned out good

1281
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:16,598
sometimes they would tell me to do some

1282
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:19,039
like ludicrous stripping and I'm like no

1283
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:21,039
way I would do it and I'd come back

1284
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:23,239
three days later you would never tell I

1285
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:25,199
went in there and did it so I was able

1286
00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:28,399
to learn a lot of cool things that way

1287
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:30,439
too cool and were you was this company

1288
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,760
were you initially brought or attracted

1289
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:35,119
to this company due to the the growing

1290
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:37,280
style considering you went to school for

1291
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:40,358
sustainable agriculture I assumed that

1292
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:43,119
you um would look then for a company

1293
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:46,000
that applied or implemented like either

1294
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:49,599
living soil methods or some sort of

1295
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,440
organic or uh sustainable practices you

1296
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,559
know I wish I had the the option to

1297
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,200
choose from that there are a few good

1298
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:57,680
companies around here that do it that

1299
00:49:55,199 --> 00:50:00,199
way but they're typically small like

1300
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:02,239
three four people maximum run it and

1301
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:04,399
then they'll hire people for like the

1302
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:06,519
Harvest and for trimming this again be

1303
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,639
the largest facility it was a full-time

1304
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:11,960
job it was grow but I I I learned

1305
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:15,679
quickly the less you know the better

1306
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:17,519
they like you so I you know gung-ho as I

1307
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,558
was with the knowledge that I have the

1308
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:21,599
passion I do I came in there I was like

1309
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:23,319
oh you know you can make this change or

1310
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,640
like hey I spotted this little bit of

1311
00:50:23,318 --> 00:50:27,318
you know like sticky residue on one of

1312
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:29,719
your leavs that's probably something to

1313
00:50:27,318 --> 00:50:32,440
look at but they weren't necessarily

1314
00:50:29,719 --> 00:50:35,318
interested in that so okay work your way

1315
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:37,159
up from the bottom and the higher you

1316
00:50:35,318 --> 00:50:39,400
get the more they'll listen to you but I

1317
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:41,118
started down here so I just kind of went

1318
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,318
in as the grunt and they promoted me

1319
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,400
pretty quickly two different things but

1320
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:48,599
no it was never something where I was

1321
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:50,519
really able to implement my vision or a

1322
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:52,760
lot of the knowledge that I had learned

1323
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:55,639
but again it taught me new knowledge and

1324
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:57,520
new Sops of way of doing things so yeah

1325
00:50:55,639 --> 00:51:00,078
I wish I could find that that perfect

1326
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:02,000
marriage out here but it was really just

1327
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:04,400
like okay now what do I do I had worked

1328
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,358
at this Audio company for like 10 years

1329
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,160
I just gone to school for two years I

1330
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:11,119
don't want to go get a normal freaking

1331
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:12,759
job so I had to drive an hour away cuz

1332
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,440
where I'm at there's a moratorium so I

1333
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:16,440
had to drive an hour every day just to

1334
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:18,480
get to this job but it was worth it and

1335
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:20,798
I was only late once so I made the most

1336
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,798
of it I've definitely been there before

1337
00:51:20,798 --> 00:51:24,358
I moved recently I was driving to the

1338
00:51:22,798 --> 00:51:26,199
the same place I work at and it was like

1339
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:28,000
50 minutes every day there and 50

1340
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:30,639
minutes back and it does become the

1341
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,798
drive becomes tedious but podcasts help

1342
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:35,480
good audiobooks help right so it's uh

1343
00:51:33,798 --> 00:51:37,798
but I feel that it commuting is

1344
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:40,400
sometimes one of the the worst parts of

1345
00:51:37,798 --> 00:51:42,440
working did you uh happen to move on to

1346
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,720
any other commercial spaces after this

1347
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:47,880
one or was that kind of where you you

1348
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:49,919
left it after your experience there yeah

1349
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,798
I kind of left it there because I

1350
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,318
realized and again knowing some people

1351
00:51:51,798 --> 00:51:55,798
with other grows in the area I realize

1352
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:57,558
it's never going to be the way that I

1353
00:51:55,798 --> 00:51:59,519
want to do it it's never going to be the

1354
00:51:57,559 --> 00:52:01,559
way that I fully believe it should be

1355
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:03,159
done and there there's some good reasons

1356
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:06,000
for that and there's some crap reasons

1357
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:07,558
for that but it's never going to be done

1358
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,559
like the way that I want to do it or the

1359
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:11,480
way that I think it should be done with

1360
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:13,599
because I'm patient first like again

1361
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:15,880
coming from the medicinal days Patient

1362
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:17,359
First like you're not oh well what can I

1363
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,640
put on this just so we can get it to

1364
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:22,440
harvest or like H we we'll cut off this

1365
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:24,798
top Cola which we did we cut off hand

1366
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,200
cut the top Cola we hand Trimm that and

1367
00:52:24,798 --> 00:52:28,880
then we sent that for testing after

1368
00:52:26,199 --> 00:52:31,279
rolling it in ke so there's things that

1369
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,880
are just standard practice that I don't

1370
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,400
agree with I didn't want to play that

1371
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,920
game I transitioned from that grow

1372
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,680
through the connections I made into

1373
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:41,880
working at a dispensary I worked

1374
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:44,000
security there and basically was like

1375
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:46,160
the Chief Information officer so I could

1376
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,199
tell you anything about everything and

1377
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:52,039
that was for me more fulfilling because

1378
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:53,798
I got to help people who were new to it

1379
00:52:52,039 --> 00:52:55,639
people who older people there's some

1380
00:52:53,798 --> 00:52:58,000
cool stories but that I've never touched

1381
00:52:55,639 --> 00:53:00,199
cannabis before uh so for me that was a

1382
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,079
little bit more rewarding and then from

1383
00:53:00,199 --> 00:53:04,480
there like covid hit we were in

1384
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:06,798
essential industry so everything was

1385
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,358
closed but us and it just became a [ __ ]

1386
00:53:06,798 --> 00:53:11,519
show and I'm like I'm just going to do

1387
00:53:08,358 --> 00:53:13,519
my thing so here we are here we are here

1388
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:14,960
we are well that's I'm glad we kind of

1389
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:17,199
like brought the story up to where we

1390
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:20,880
are now for you so I do want to know

1391
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:23,719
though because you are kind of within um

1392
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:26,960
the space as an educator and as someone

1393
00:53:23,719 --> 00:53:29,318
who uh I I would assume keep their

1394
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:32,079
finger on the pulse of the industry and

1395
00:53:29,318 --> 00:53:33,679
how it both affects hom Growers and

1396
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:35,760
other things where do you see the

1397
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:39,039
cultivation industry going uh whether it

1398
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:41,160
be from a hom Grower's as uh from a hom

1399
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:43,279
Grower's perspective from a consumer's

1400
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:44,598
perspective or even in the commercial

1401
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,559
space because I'm sure that you still

1402
00:53:44,599 --> 00:53:47,920
have connections there just through the

1403
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,319
the interactions that you have within

1404
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,079
the community where do you where do you

1405
00:53:49,318 --> 00:53:52,039
feel as though it's going to be going

1406
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:57,119
over the

1407
00:53:52,039 --> 00:54:00,880
next 5 to 10 years so my my big picture

1408
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:03,798
optimistic Rosie Cloud's vision would be

1409
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:06,119
that it becomes federally legal which is

1410
00:54:03,798 --> 00:54:08,358
going to open the doors to the big

1411
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:09,838
players kind of like the anheiser bushes

1412
00:54:08,358 --> 00:54:12,078
it's going to push out a lot of the

1413
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:14,159
middle tier people that currently exist

1414
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:16,200
and dominate the market I'm not going to

1415
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:18,118
cry for them because they pushed me out

1416
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:20,759
they pushed the mom and pops out so it's

1417
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:22,920
like taste your own medicine but what

1418
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:25,119
that's going to do hopefully the federal

1419
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:27,440
legalization it will create those big

1420
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:30,519
players it will create the or bushes but

1421
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:33,079
that's when craft will succeed I think

1422
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:35,639
ultimately for small people like me for

1423
00:54:33,079 --> 00:54:37,318
those you know 10 lighters 20 lighters

1424
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:39,039
that's what we need to see because we're

1425
00:54:37,318 --> 00:54:41,400
never going to be able to compete on

1426
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:43,599
price it's a commodity uh you can do it

1427
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,358
on scale particularly if we allow

1428
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:48,200
imports from other countries the price

1429
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:50,239
is just going to it's quality and the

1430
00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:53,239
uniqueness that are always going to have

1431
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:55,759
a market and so hopefully that's where I

1432
00:54:53,239 --> 00:54:58,439
see it going that's that's the you know

1433
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:01,799
pie in the sky for

1434
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,838
sure if that doesn't happen um I think

1435
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:04,599
there's just going to be more

1436
00:55:02,838 --> 00:55:06,358
consolidation in the market I think

1437
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:09,160
there's going to be less interest

1438
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:11,400
commercially less interest in finding

1439
00:55:09,159 --> 00:55:14,159
the new thing versus something that

1440
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:17,079
works under these particular Sops that

1441
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:19,759
are cutting costs and basically an

1442
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:21,680
economic plan but then you flip that

1443
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,880
back to the homeg grower we're going to

1444
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:24,879
keep looking we're going to keep

1445
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,798
searching for those unicorns we're going

1446
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,240
to keep finding those different flavors

1447
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:30,400
and that's something that I think the

1448
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:33,318
the legalization as we know it now has

1449
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:35,480
been a big Catalyst for is to find all

1450
00:55:33,318 --> 00:55:36,920
these things cuz you went from you know

1451
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:39,119
let's just make up a number here you

1452
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:40,960
went from like a thousand people popping

1453
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:43,519
seeds to all of a sudden now you have a

1454
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,599
100,000 you can get through so many more

1455
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:48,119
things and pick out so many different

1456
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:50,119
varieties faster so hopefully that's

1457
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:52,000
what we see from the kind of the home or

1458
00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:53,559
the Craft Market is we'll continue to

1459
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
innovate we'll continue to push the

1460
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:58,240
boundaries of experience everything is

1461
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,559
going to get you stoned at this point

1462
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:02,679
pretty much everything is going to get

1463
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:05,119
you stoned so it's about the experience

1464
00:56:02,679 --> 00:56:07,239
to me so that's probably where I really

1465
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,960
see it going if it doesn't go pie in the

1466
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:11,199
sky but it's going to be more experience

1467
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,639
related for sure I agree wholeheartedly

1468
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:15,759
with that I you know I've always thought

1469
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:18,000
it kind of mimicked or uh mirrored the

1470
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:20,359
the transition from alcohol prohibition

1471
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,960
to the Beer industry but I I do feel as

1472
00:56:20,358 --> 00:56:23,598
though the timeline might be truncated

1473
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,838
on that a little bit where we're going

1474
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:28,039
to see kind of whether if it if it ever

1475
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:31,480
does go federally legal and I I put a

1476
00:56:28,039 --> 00:56:33,039
caveat on on ever because it's I feel

1477
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,440
like we've always seen it to be right

1478
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:37,119
around the corner um and it's that

1479
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,639
corner keeps getting further and further

1480
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:42,160
away so if if it ever does go legal then

1481
00:56:39,639 --> 00:56:45,118
I do feel as though there is going to be

1482
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:47,279
a huge takeover absolutely of corporate

1483
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:50,280
interests and then we'll see a lot of

1484
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,519
Home Growers or small craft Growers who

1485
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,079
are

1486
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:56,400
stilling the support to their local

1487
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:59,039
community and and local consumers to

1488
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,920
succeed while some of the mid-ranged

1489
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:03,520
ones or or where the production of

1490
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:05,880
quality is not as heavily regarded or if

1491
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:08,400
it just isn't there will be kind of

1492
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:10,680
gobbled up by the larger corporations to

1493
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,318
allow for more space for their probably

1494
00:57:10,679 --> 00:57:14,679
not terrible probably unfortunately

1495
00:57:13,318 --> 00:57:16,838
it'll probably be smokable you know

1496
00:57:14,679 --> 00:57:18,759
it'll probably be something where if

1497
00:57:16,838 --> 00:57:20,400
you're in a pinch in a state where

1498
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,240
you're like I don't have anything with

1499
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,440
me but hey it's legal now so I can just

1500
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:26,838
go to the gas station and pick up a pack

1501
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:28,880
of whatevers you know like I feel like

1502
00:57:26,838 --> 00:57:32,519
that it won't be terrible because there

1503
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:34,960
will be some standards in place like but

1504
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:36,679
I do I do see how like you're going to

1505
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,920
have your just like you have your Kors

1506
00:57:36,679 --> 00:57:40,078
drinkers you're going to have your

1507
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,599
people that are looking for what's their

1508
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:45,440
the local city is producing for them as

1509
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:47,519
well and I'm from the Pacific Northwest

1510
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,639
again we're this is where micro

1511
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:52,440
breweries came from like when it comes

1512
00:57:49,639 --> 00:57:54,920
to micro Brews it it really started here

1513
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:56,838
so I've had the example of that laid out

1514
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:58,920
for me for a long time

1515
00:57:56,838 --> 00:58:00,558
uh something that I paid very close

1516
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:02,760
attention to because I think it will

1517
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:05,760
mimic that but we still have to have

1518
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:08,119
that hurdle fall before we can have that

1519
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:11,319
farm totable experience where you can go

1520
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:13,160
into the brewery or you could go into my

1521
00:58:11,318 --> 00:58:15,079
grow and you can sit down and get a

1522
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:17,838
little tray with eight different strains

1523
00:58:15,079 --> 00:58:19,200
on it and you can try them all so yeah

1524
00:58:17,838 --> 00:58:20,759
I'd love to see that and particularly

1525
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:22,598
for the smaller people that's something

1526
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:24,920
we tried to get in the Washington market

1527
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:27,440
for tier one which is the smallest tier

1528
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:28,838
direct to consumer Farm to Table uh cuz

1529
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,039
that's really the only way the little

1530
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:32,960
guy can compete out here that didn't

1531
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:36,000
pass so you can't do it but that's still

1532
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:37,199
a hope and a dream I I kind of was I saw

1533
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,039
that and I was hoping that that would

1534
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:41,719
pass as well because I kind of had hoped

1535
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:44,280
that there would be a push in some areas

1536
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:46,439
to go back to Medical um with states

1537
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,480
rights being such a big issue as of as

1538
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:50,559
of late and allowing for people to make

1539
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,400
those decisions within that state I was

1540
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:53,960
kind of like cuz the Oregon Medical

1541
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,960
Market was really great as well I'm in

1542
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:59,519
Oregon and nice it was a Market at one

1543
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:01,519
point but where they kept the medical as

1544
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:03,599
just the ability for those patients to

1545
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:05,838
receive a discount at a dispensary but

1546
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:08,359
that no single producer could then still

1547
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:10,199
claim medical on their production of the

1548
00:59:08,358 --> 00:59:12,920
plant or that there would be any

1549
00:59:10,199 --> 00:59:15,159
standards to back that up kind of

1550
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:16,920
defeated the purpose in in my eyes but

1551
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:18,440
um I'd always hoped that something like

1552
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,079
that would come back but I do agree with

1553
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:23,240
you that that is a little bit of a pie

1554
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:26,160
in the sky hope at this point we we've

1555
00:59:23,239 --> 00:59:29,159
come a long way from just 10 years ago

1556
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:31,159
so 10 more years who knows keeping the

1557
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:33,798
fingers crossed and staying optimistic

1558
00:59:31,159 --> 00:59:36,000
but I'll be growing either way did

1559
00:59:33,798 --> 00:59:38,000
absolutely add a 5 to 10 your caveat to

1560
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,358
the question so you're completely fair

1561
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,559
in that assessment

1562
00:59:40,358 --> 00:59:45,558
absolutely did you just invite I kind of

1563
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:47,280
wanted to leave perhaps the last part of

1564
00:59:45,559 --> 00:59:50,559
this show here open was there anything

1565
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:52,640
more within the uh cannabis space that

1566
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:55,119
you wanted to talk about growing related

1567
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:56,440
or otherwise no this is this has been

1568
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:58,519
great I appreciate appreciate the

1569
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:00,440
questions it's been a fun conversation

1570
00:59:58,519 --> 01:00:02,079
and I think the theme that hopefully

1571
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:04,119
people take away which is you know what

1572
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:06,318
I would just reiterate is just continue

1573
01:00:04,119 --> 01:00:08,358
to share your knowledge continue to

1574
01:00:06,318 --> 01:00:11,159
share the experience because we're going

1575
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:14,279
to get so much further faster if we do

1576
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:16,519
that and if we build substance behind

1577
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:18,960
what we're doing not just a flash in the

1578
01:00:16,519 --> 01:00:20,880
pan not just a cool a myar not just you

1579
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:24,159
know the next hit song we build

1580
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:28,039
substance to it we're going to get a lot

1581
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:30,879
farther like 2012 I started out my first

1582
01:00:28,039 --> 01:00:34,079
like foray into public education senior

1583
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:36,440
MMJ Network seniors medical marijuana

1584
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:38,839
Network those are the people who have

1585
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:41,400
the biggest Reefer Madness stigma

1586
01:00:38,838 --> 01:00:43,078
associated with cannabis in my mind

1587
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:45,720
those are the people who could probably

1588
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:47,519
benefit the greatest from Cannabis

1589
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:49,639
whether it be aches and pains just the

1590
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:51,480
daily things but the education there is

1591
01:00:49,639 --> 01:00:53,118
so important because they think you're

1592
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:55,280
going to hell and you have to smoke it

1593
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:57,318
neither of which are true so through

1594
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:00,720
that education through that sharing

1595
01:00:57,318 --> 01:01:03,038
through providing substance real world

1596
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:04,719
practical applications for these things

1597
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:06,359
we're going to get a lot farther so

1598
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:08,239
those are the things we need to continue

1599
01:01:06,358 --> 01:01:09,920
to push now it makes me a little sick

1600
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:12,038
again I said earlier I'm like horrible

1601
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,680
at self-promotion because that's not

1602
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:15,400
what it's really about for me but

1603
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:18,879
there's some people who would much

1604
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:20,838
rather talk about you know the new myar

1605
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,440
or you know what event they're going to

1606
01:01:20,838 --> 01:01:25,558
and how many grams of this they had than

1607
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,920
actually building that substance so

1608
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:30,480
hopefully they're gone not all of them

1609
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:32,119
probably will be but yeah keep keep

1610
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,880
building that substance folks that's

1611
01:01:32,119 --> 01:01:36,318
what I would add to the conversation I

1612
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:38,000
guess for sure and honestly in my

1613
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:41,318
opinion I feel as though anything that

1614
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:44,318
helps end uh stigmatization to cannabis

1615
01:01:41,318 --> 01:01:46,719
is uh positive media in my eyes and so

1616
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:50,960
when people do get really into the whole

1617
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:53,759
myar thing or what what uh who's

1618
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:55,639
promoting who and on what platform and

1619
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:58,240
and all that you know it it does become

1620
01:01:55,639 --> 01:02:01,199
a a little bit monotonous at times but

1621
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:03,078
also it doesn't hurt the industry as

1622
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:05,038
much as it helps it in my eyes just to

1623
01:02:03,079 --> 01:02:07,039
help bring more awareness to the fact

1624
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:09,760
that people are trying to normalize this

1625
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:12,359
and so uh I do agree though I prefer to

1626
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:14,400
have more meaningful conversations about

1627
01:02:12,358 --> 01:02:16,400
it with people that are in this for the

1628
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,358
Long Haul and and about it for the

1629
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,880
medicine and the plant and the community

1630
01:02:18,358 --> 01:02:21,679
and the way that the plant and the

1631
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:23,838
people interact and how they help us

1632
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:26,199
interact with each other even in a

1633
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:27,440
greater way so I do wholeheartedly agree

1634
01:02:26,199 --> 01:02:30,078
with you on

1635
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:32,278
that and you make an you made an

1636
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:35,000
excellent point there this plant brings

1637
01:02:32,278 --> 01:02:37,119
so many diverse people together it's

1638
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,679
amazing it is it has blessed and changed

1639
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:41,680
my life just in that one fact alone so

1640
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:43,639
yes I'm glad you mentioned that for sure

1641
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:45,519
yeah um well I do actually have a couple

1642
01:02:43,639 --> 01:02:46,879
of little like wrap-up questions that

1643
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:49,239
are going to be a little bit of a

1644
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:51,318
quickfire because you know some of my

1645
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:53,639
favorite Canabis shows have those at the

1646
01:02:51,318 --> 01:02:55,639
end and I just feel as though it's worth

1647
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:57,920
it as a community to tie those things

1648
01:02:55,639 --> 01:03:00,558
together together ubiquitous what is

1649
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:02,519
your favorite strain of all time if you

1650
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:04,440
had to choose one and if you have to

1651
01:03:02,519 --> 01:03:06,920
choose a couple try and put them in

1652
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:08,880
order right okay I I'll go with the one

1653
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:12,798
that goes to the top of my head most

1654
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:15,880
most of the time is the cam 91 cam 91

1655
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:17,719
just a fantastic strain something that

1656
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:20,318
has been around for a long time

1657
01:03:17,719 --> 01:03:23,278
something that is often imitated never

1658
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:24,759
duplicated but I found a producer

1659
01:03:23,278 --> 01:03:26,760
actually there is one

1660
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:29,278
commercial cannabis that I will go out

1661
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:32,400
and buy and it's this this one company

1662
01:03:29,278 --> 01:03:35,358
they they call it pre 91 chem which is a

1663
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:37,920
little suspect to me but yeah 91 cam is

1664
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:41,480
is where I'm at as far as my uh desert

1665
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:44,720
island strain goes do you do you are

1666
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:47,039
you right on are you okay with sharing

1667
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:50,719
the name of that company I I assume it's

1668
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:52,240
a legal Washington recreational producer

1669
01:03:50,719 --> 01:03:54,719
just for people to know where they can

1670
01:03:52,239 --> 01:03:56,598
find Chad westports go to commercial

1671
01:03:54,719 --> 01:04:02,038
cannabis

1672
01:03:56,599 --> 01:04:03,680
yeah um so it was Elevate e v e l and

1673
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:05,880
then they changed the name of the

1674
01:04:03,679 --> 01:04:08,000
company oh God I have a jar in the other

1675
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:10,358
room I think just look for it it says

1676
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,838
pre 91 cem that's the only time I've

1677
01:04:10,358 --> 01:04:16,679
ever pre 91 cam it's weird red and black

1678
01:04:13,838 --> 01:04:18,519
graphics on the jar it's like 35 bucks

1679
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:21,159
for the called

1680
01:04:18,519 --> 01:04:24,159
plaid I know who you're talking about

1681
01:04:21,159 --> 01:04:26,000
but no no okay I don't think so plaid

1682
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:29,960
had the Melvin which was something that

1683
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:32,079
interested me too so that I score yeah

1684
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:34,199
that I did catch oh God I'm sorry I'm

1685
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:36,559
blanking it now I don't you know what

1686
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:37,960
when we when we post this uh I'll try

1687
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:40,480
and post like a short of this or

1688
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:42,679
something and you'll have to comment on

1689
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:45,240
it with the correct name fair fair

1690
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:47,078
enough cool um so after the favorites

1691
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:49,239
train who is your favorite breeder of

1692
01:04:47,079 --> 01:04:53,119
all time other than

1693
01:04:49,239 --> 01:04:55,118
yourself that's a dang good question so

1694
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:56,920
like James L is a person who I would

1695
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:58,599
probably consider like the mentor of

1696
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,318
today just cuz I've been watching his

1697
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:02,079
shows and following him and actually

1698
01:05:00,318 --> 01:05:04,440
having a rapport with him for about four

1699
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:07,200
or five years so I've probably learned

1700
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:08,880
the most directly from him as when it

1701
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:10,639
comes to breeding he's also got a really

1702
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:13,119
awesome book out right now but I also

1703
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:15,879
want to toss mean Jean from mesino

1704
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:19,240
freeorn selections out there that guy is

1705
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:21,838
an amazing Storyteller he's an amazing

1706
01:05:19,239 --> 01:05:23,759
librarian I can and I've talked to him

1707
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:25,798
many times I could listen to him for

1708
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,520
four or five hours talk about straining

1709
01:05:25,798 --> 01:05:30,798
history his processes because you know

1710
01:05:28,519 --> 01:05:32,079
it's like going to school helped me I

1711
01:05:30,798 --> 01:05:33,679
always say you know there's a lot of

1712
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:35,200
people it's like well education is the

1713
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:37,960
best there's other experience is the

1714
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:40,399
best education and experience is the

1715
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:42,480
best in my opinion because abut

1716
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:45,079
education you're going to miss out on

1717
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,679
those little nuances like you know me

1718
01:05:45,079 --> 01:05:49,240
and Jean would have that you only get

1719
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:51,199
through experiences you're not going to

1720
01:05:49,239 --> 01:05:53,639
be able to read that in a book and then

1721
01:05:51,199 --> 01:05:55,159
if you just rely on experience sometimes

1722
01:05:53,639 --> 01:05:56,719
that can turn you into a dinosaur

1723
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:59,798
because you're not catching up with the

1724
01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:02,239
current times so yeah experience

1725
01:05:59,798 --> 01:06:03,679
education are the two best but Jackson

1726
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:05,959
mean jeene from Menino Freeborn

1727
01:06:03,679 --> 01:06:08,318
selections that guy's like a thesaurus

1728
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:11,838
or a dictionary encyclopedia he's smart

1729
01:06:08,318 --> 01:06:13,838
how about that yeah he definitely is I

1730
01:06:11,838 --> 01:06:17,558
um I've

1731
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:19,480
always yeah yeah he is I've I've always

1732
01:06:17,559 --> 01:06:21,960
enjoyed listening to him whenever he's

1733
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:23,639
on a podcast uh he always has a wealth

1734
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:25,920
of knowledge and especially when it

1735
01:06:23,639 --> 01:06:27,920
comes back to goes back to like the

1736
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,880
different crosses and the lineages of

1737
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:32,519
different things and uh how they play

1738
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:34,760
into each other and I'm always just I'm

1739
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:37,480
always impressed by the any strains that

1740
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:39,359
use his his strains as the parent

1741
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:41,960
lineage especially with like black lime

1742
01:06:39,358 --> 01:06:43,880
Reserve that one I I feel like is in so

1743
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:47,119
many different things nowadays it's

1744
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:49,200
pretty ubiquitous it is I just popped a

1745
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:51,798
precursor to that too from him it was

1746
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:54,439
from 20121 but it's his black lime

1747
01:06:51,798 --> 01:06:56,400
number two so it's before the reserve

1748
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:58,559
but the black lime number two

1749
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:01,000
times his cherry limeade and I've been

1750
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:02,960
sitting on those been sitting on those

1751
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,278
for a couple years and I just popped

1752
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,760
them and they're you know their

1753
01:07:04,278 --> 01:07:09,159
seedlings This Tall right now so I'm

1754
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:11,680
super excited to see what comes to those

1755
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:13,480
and honestly I hope I get a mail that

1756
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:16,239
I'll be able to do some work with we'll

1757
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:18,679
see we'll see that that sounds like a a

1758
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:21,159
you know cherry limeade to Westport

1759
01:07:18,679 --> 01:07:23,318
grape juice sounds like a a juice bomb

1760
01:07:21,159 --> 01:07:27,440
if I've ever heard of one so I'm I'm

1761
01:07:23,318 --> 01:07:30,480
going to be interested to see

1762
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:33,240
Flor there I like it the 7-Eleven

1763
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:36,318
suicide yes exactly that sounds pretty

1764
01:07:33,239 --> 01:07:38,879
great so uh last question of these style

1765
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:41,239
of questions it's a two-parter so what

1766
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:43,640
was the first time you ever consumed

1767
01:07:41,239 --> 01:07:46,798
cannabis and then what is the most

1768
01:07:43,639 --> 01:07:48,960
memorable cannabis experience memory

1769
01:07:46,798 --> 01:07:52,480
whether it be smoking or seeing a plant

1770
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:55,920
or otherwise that you've had the first

1771
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:59,559
time smoking I don't exactly remember

1772
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:01,880
but I was a very early teen I'm pretty

1773
01:07:59,559 --> 01:08:04,200
confident it was in the the power line

1774
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:06,680
Trails the power trails out behind the

1775
01:08:04,199 --> 01:08:09,078
neighborhood with probably Tommy and a

1776
01:08:06,679 --> 01:08:11,038
couple other guys so seventh e8th grade

1777
01:08:09,079 --> 01:08:12,680
is really when we kind of got into it I

1778
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:15,880
remember actually getting busted with

1779
01:08:12,679 --> 01:08:18,238
pot before I had smoked it uh really

1780
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:22,039
with my friend uh my friend uh so my

1781
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:24,479
friend Greg rip he was a he was a

1782
01:08:22,039 --> 01:08:26,399
character I smoked cigarettes so I had

1783
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:28,119
camel cash and you in the camel cash for

1784
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:29,358
the Zippos and I had a cool camel Zippo

1785
01:08:28,119 --> 01:08:31,920
and he's like well I want it I'll give

1786
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:33,960
you five bucks and some weed I sure

1787
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:36,600
whatever I need five bucks and so we had

1788
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:38,239
gone into the bathroom at school to do

1789
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:40,679
our little deal and his brother was

1790
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:42,838
standing outside and his brother runs

1791
01:08:40,679 --> 01:08:44,520
inside he's like the principal's coming

1792
01:08:42,838 --> 01:08:46,039
and he totally like blew it cuz

1793
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,960
apparently he was just standing outside

1794
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:50,039
like this saw the principal ran inside

1795
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:51,880
and he knew what was up and so I of

1796
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:53,759
course had it in my hand at that time

1797
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:57,239
and I'm the one who got busted with it

1798
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:59,000
but uh uh a couple weeks later and

1799
01:08:57,238 --> 01:09:00,678
another detention I took it back from

1800
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,279
his drawer which he forgot to lock along

1801
01:09:00,679 --> 01:09:05,039
with some brass knuckles and a couple

1802
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:07,080
other cool things so I got my [ __ ] back

1803
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:09,920
um but that was the first stuff you

1804
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:11,519
smoked then too yeah well it was yeah

1805
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,920
the earlier time like I don't remember

1806
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:16,560
smoking weed I don't remember how that

1807
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:19,039
hit me but uh U yeah that was one of the

1808
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:21,480
earlier times and then probably the most

1809
01:09:19,039 --> 01:09:22,838
like memorable experience actually

1810
01:09:21,479 --> 01:09:25,519
before you get into the memorable

1811
01:09:22,838 --> 01:09:28,158
experience because your story spurred my

1812
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:30,319
memory and how similar it is to my first

1813
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:32,238
story I have to just throw it in here

1814
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:34,239
really quickly so when I was in high

1815
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:36,919
school cuz I actually didn't even know

1816
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:39,000
about cannabis I think until I was in

1817
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:40,838
like sophomore junior in high school

1818
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:44,319
which is really odd for growing up in

1819
01:09:40,838 --> 01:09:46,960
the Bay area but I I wanted to try

1820
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:48,480
cannabis cuz I also I smoked cigarettes

1821
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,640
and uh my one friend was like well you

1822
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:51,599
want to smoke something else and I was

1823
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:54,560
like like what and he's like oh you know

1824
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:56,480
weed man and so I was like oh well you

1825
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:58,360
know what I've heard of that I think but

1826
01:09:56,479 --> 01:10:00,439
yeah why not I mean I smoke cigarettes

1827
01:09:58,359 --> 01:10:01,839
and uh so he's like all right I need

1828
01:10:00,439 --> 01:10:03,639
like 20 bucks and I'm going to go get it

1829
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:06,279
from this guy in the high school parking

1830
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:07,600
lot at lunchtime and then uh do you have

1831
01:10:06,279 --> 01:10:09,719
something to put it in cuz we got to

1832
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:12,280
then keep it on us until we go home and

1833
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:15,000
so I went to like the army surplus store

1834
01:10:12,279 --> 01:10:16,800
and got one of those weatherproof match

1835
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,800
containers like it's a metal canister

1836
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:21,600
that like screws into itself and hinges

1837
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:24,039
out and we stuff like you know a couple

1838
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:26,280
nugs in there in in the dime bags and I

1839
01:10:24,039 --> 01:10:29,519
I put it back away in my pocket and I

1840
01:10:26,279 --> 01:10:30,880
carried it in my pocket all day and uh I

1841
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:33,280
get home at night because he's like all

1842
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:35,600
right we'll meet up you know like this

1843
01:10:33,279 --> 01:10:37,519
evening or or the tomorrow evening or

1844
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:39,400
something or before school the next day

1845
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:42,000
and uh so I get home and as soon as I

1846
01:10:39,399 --> 01:10:44,719
get home my my mom and my dad are like

1847
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:48,679
waiting in the front area of our house

1848
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:50,920
and they're like I've heard from my

1849
01:10:48,679 --> 01:10:53,239
friend I won't say his name from my

1850
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:55,679
friend's dad that you might have

1851
01:10:53,238 --> 01:10:57,919
purchased cannabis at school today and I

1852
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:59,520
was like uh you know and I don't know if

1853
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,760
you've seen the key and peel skit where

1854
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:04,080
they start sweating bullets I felt like

1855
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:06,840
that was me at that point just like what

1856
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:08,479
the what the [ __ ] how do you know cuz I

1857
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:10,600
didn't tell anybody other than the guy

1858
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:13,000
that I got it with but apparently he

1859
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:15,159
told some friends do look but I hadn't

1860
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,880
smoked it or anything and it's in this

1861
01:11:15,158 --> 01:11:19,359
like actually possibly the most

1862
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:22,319
smellproof container I could have chosen

1863
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:24,079
for that small amount and I was like no

1864
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:27,719
I don't even know what you're talking

1865
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:30,319
about and I walked my way out of it

1866
01:11:27,719 --> 01:11:32,679
somehow but I I count that as being

1867
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:35,359
caught because I

1868
01:11:32,679 --> 01:11:37,440
then you know I don't think I slept all

1869
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:38,960
night because I was trying to figure out

1870
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:40,238
what I was going to do with this little

1871
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,800
bit of weed that I thought was going to

1872
01:11:40,238 --> 01:11:44,599
end my life as I know it and I go back

1873
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:47,239
to school the next day and I knew my one

1874
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,960
buddy who had talked about weed before

1875
01:11:47,238 --> 01:11:50,678
where I think I even heard about it and

1876
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,480
I was like I'll just sell it to him I'll

1877
01:11:50,679 --> 01:11:54,399
just be like I just need to get some of

1878
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:56,238
what I sold it for back and at least

1879
01:11:54,399 --> 01:11:58,119
what my friend put into it I'll take the

1880
01:11:56,238 --> 01:11:59,638
loss but I got to pay my one friend back

1881
01:11:58,119 --> 01:12:03,840
and be like listen I lost it here's the

1882
01:11:59,639 --> 01:12:07,760
money and so I did that and then about 2

1883
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:10,600
weeks later we he found out my friend

1884
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:13,520
that had gone in on it with me found out

1885
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:17,079
that his uncle was like a big time

1886
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:19,040
grower and distributor out of humble and

1887
01:12:17,079 --> 01:12:20,639
got us some really good blue dream and

1888
01:12:19,039 --> 01:12:23,158
we smoked

1889
01:12:20,639 --> 01:12:25,520
that there you go and this was probably

1890
01:12:23,158 --> 01:12:27,799
like two that's one strain that I do

1891
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:30,120
miss it got so popular that people

1892
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:32,239
stopped growing it and still around it

1893
01:12:30,119 --> 01:12:33,559
feels like it's almost diluted now like

1894
01:12:32,238 --> 01:12:35,678
what's the good Blue Dream where's the

1895
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:38,600
original who's got the Santa Cruz cut

1896
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:41,000
who's got this other one so yeah I I do

1897
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:43,120
remember it though and everyone made it

1898
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,840
made a lot of people's careers you know

1899
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:46,359
like uh just with the yields that they

1900
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:48,480
could get without having to put too much

1901
01:12:46,359 --> 01:12:50,639
effort into it so let's let's go back to

1902
01:12:48,479 --> 01:12:52,158
the most memorable cannabis experience

1903
01:12:50,639 --> 01:12:54,000
for you like if you had to think back

1904
01:12:52,158 --> 01:12:55,879
what's the first thing that pops your

1905
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,000
mind or if you take a second what what

1906
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:01,000
is what is that memorable cannabis

1907
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,719
experience there's a lot of them that

1908
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,639
were involved cannabis as part of the

1909
01:13:03,719 --> 01:13:07,480
story but probably the two the two that

1910
01:13:05,639 --> 01:13:09,920
popped to my head that were specific

1911
01:13:07,479 --> 01:13:12,399
cannabis one is the interview that I did

1912
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:15,359
and I've got to interview him four times

1913
01:13:12,399 --> 01:13:18,158
now but Tommy trong like if you rewind

1914
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:19,839
to my teenage self watching Up and Smoke

1915
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:22,079
saying one day you're going to sit down

1916
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:24,279
and be friends first name basis talk to

1917
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:27,198
him every year with Tommy Chong wouldn't

1918
01:13:24,279 --> 01:13:29,439
have believed you um so that for me is

1919
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:32,279
is a cool one but actual smoking it

1920
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:34,399
plant experience itself is was in

1921
01:13:32,279 --> 01:13:36,880
Amsterdam again I've been going there

1922
01:13:34,399 --> 01:13:38,839
every year for quite a few years now I

1923
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:41,520
wish I was going back in the 90s and

1924
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:43,960
2000s when it properly was the hey day

1925
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:46,400
but I wasn't old enough for traveling at

1926
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:48,800
that point but I do and I have written

1927
01:13:46,399 --> 01:13:50,839
for centi seeds I have almost a 100

1928
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:52,840
published pieces on their website and

1929
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:54,800
their blog and one of the more memorable

1930
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:58,000
experiences was when I went to the hemp

1931
01:13:54,800 --> 01:14:00,239
and hash Museum in Amsterdam my buddy my

1932
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:03,158
boss Mark took me gave me kind of like

1933
01:14:00,238 --> 01:14:05,279
the private VIP tour but he took me down

1934
01:14:03,158 --> 01:14:06,799
stairs into the secret garden which is

1935
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:09,359
no longer there which is why I'm saying

1936
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:11,719
it but they had a grow down there and we

1937
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:13,158
got to just smoke look at all the plants

1938
01:14:11,719 --> 01:14:15,079
that were coming up plants that I was

1939
01:14:13,158 --> 01:14:16,960
about to write you know descriptions for

1940
01:14:15,079 --> 01:14:19,359
just sat there smoking and enjoying our

1941
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:21,279
time underneath the uh Museum that was

1942
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:23,198
probably one of the more memorable

1943
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:25,880
smoking related experiences with

1944
01:14:23,198 --> 01:14:29,399
cannabis that sounds quite memorable

1945
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:31,480
I can only imagine I I mean cuz uh you

1946
01:14:29,399 --> 01:14:34,799
know it made me even think like watching

1947
01:14:31,479 --> 01:14:36,638
old uh like cops like the show Cops

1948
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:38,239
where they would go in to the people's

1949
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:40,319
house and they'd be it' look like a

1950
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:41,759
normal house or everything would be fine

1951
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:43,359
and then they find the door to the

1952
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:45,960
basement they go down and it's like you

1953
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:48,599
know 20 HPS lights the whole place is

1954
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:50,119
red with everything fully flowered so

1955
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:52,360
I'm just that's what I imagine you

1956
01:14:50,119 --> 01:14:54,198
walking down into at the time is

1957
01:14:52,359 --> 01:14:56,960
something that is just like this fully

1958
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:59,678
HPS out basement where it's maybe you

1959
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:02,119
know 6 or 7 ft High ceilings or

1960
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:04,760
something like that kind of cramped but

1961
01:15:02,119 --> 01:15:07,439
filled with plants yep every and

1962
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:09,520
everything down there is is dank just I

1963
01:15:07,439 --> 01:15:11,119
mean the it's below the water table so

1964
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,120
it's like water kind of just like

1965
01:15:11,119 --> 01:15:14,760
absorbs in the concrete walls and you

1966
01:15:13,119 --> 01:15:17,198
just always have to deal with that sort

1967
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:18,880
of like moisture and humidity they had a

1968
01:15:17,198 --> 01:15:20,719
few different chambers because they were

1969
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:22,920
growing in different strains but you

1970
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:25,399
pretty much nailed the description like

1971
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:27,440
funny this place has heated floors

1972
01:15:25,399 --> 01:15:31,439
that's weird for the Netherlands no they

1973
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:34,039
just got about 20 HPS underneath it so

1974
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:35,759
yeah that's funny that's funny well

1975
01:15:34,039 --> 01:15:37,639
welcome back Gabby uh we actually were

1976
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:39,239
just wrapping up the last few questions

1977
01:15:37,639 --> 01:15:41,760
did you have any questions for Chad

1978
01:15:39,238 --> 01:15:43,839
before we um we wrap up the rest of the

1979
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:45,320
show it's nice that we've opened the

1980
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,600
lines of communication though because I

1981
01:15:45,319 --> 01:15:49,599

1984
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:55,279
awareness trying to introduce people cuz

1985
01:15:53,439 --> 01:15:56,599
I like what you're doing it's this has

1986
01:15:55,279 --> 01:15:58,319
been you know again a really fun

1987
01:15:56,600 --> 01:16:01,520
interview Nick thank you for these

1988
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:03,679
questions it again kind of gives me an

1989
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:06,320
idea of where you're coming from and

1990
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:08,840
what you'd like to see and and if you

1991
01:16:06,319 --> 01:16:11,319
haven't felt it yourself we we're we're

1992
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:12,800
walking the same road which is also

1993
01:16:11,319 --> 01:16:15,238
passion for the plan I definitely did

1994
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:17,079
feel that and I I really uh I appreciate

1995
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:18,519
that feedback as well you know this is

1996
01:16:17,079 --> 01:16:20,559
actually the first episode that we're

1997
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:22,560
doing of the The Way We Grow podcast

1998
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:24,600
where I'm hosting it trying to be a

1999
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:26,760
little bit more focused on the growing

2000
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:28,840
side of things and people's Journey as

2001
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:30,800
it pertains to Growing but also kind of

2002
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:32,079
mixing in their own personal story in

2003
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,800
there because I feel like it's very

2004
01:16:32,079 --> 01:16:35,960
important to get bring it as a little

2005
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:37,719
bit of a holistic approach and I I'm

2006
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:39,480
