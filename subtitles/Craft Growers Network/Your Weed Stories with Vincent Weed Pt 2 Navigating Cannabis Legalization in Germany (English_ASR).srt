further I wanted tell you we got a

29
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:37,959
tremendous response to our last video

30
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:42,118
and people were asking about the ball

31
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:44,000
Vapes I even went I went into my local

32
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:45,239
head shop that I've been shopping at

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,959
since

34
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:51,118
1991 and they knew what a ball Vape was

35
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:54,078
but they did not have one and so I

36
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:57,920
requested one I said hey look my buddy

37
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:59,559
Vincent weed said I need to have this so

38
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,118
uh I'm trying to get my hands on a ball

39
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,799
Vape and like I said everybody is uh

40
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,319
looking at that thing and like what is

41
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,840
that and I was like I you see the CLS

42
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,758
it's vaping it's not burning and do you

43
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,120
see the

44
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:17,159
clouds yeah it's so satisfying like I

45
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:20,120
said in the other episode when I have

46
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:25,159
been smoking 25 years

47
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:27,959
pipe and yeah this is my My Vegan My

48
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:32,359
Vegan pipe smoking now and the most

49
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:35,159
important thing is um what's what's uh

50
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:39,319
satisfying um a little bit of pressure

51
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:41,158
on the lungs and a huge amount of vapor

52
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:44,878
and um the good thing is with the wall

53
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:46,799
Vape it's a one hit on point termal

54
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,239
extraction so all the turbs and

55
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,719
cannaboids get really in once and it's a

56
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:57,598
beautiful way um yeah it's not really um

57
00:02:53,719 --> 00:03:00,560
something new new I think the the

58
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:04,199
technique behind that it's old but it's

59
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,239
fought in a new way and yeah in Germany

60
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:10,000
the ball Vape is it has really a hype at

61
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:11,878
the moment it's crazy because out here

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,840
people don't know what it is and we

63
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:16,518
think of California as and you know the

64
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,439
us as being on the Leading Edge of this

65
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:22,480
type of stuff but uh yeah people don't

66
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:25,680
know what it is the closest thing that I

67
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:27,959
had to it and it it's nothing like it

68
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,120
was there's a product from Vaper

69
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:34,519
Brothers you you might be familiar with

70
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:38,519
it it's a wooden box and inside there's

71
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:40,360
a an element that's covered with glass

72
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,438
and then there's a bowl that's glass

73
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,159
attached to a hose and you put the hose

74
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:49,959
right onto the heating element and you

75
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:55,318
draw on it and you get a nice um Vape

76
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:59,000
from flower which um you know I really

77
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:02,518
like it um what I do not like which is

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,799
more popular out here is the volcano

79
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,840
you're familiar with the volcano I'm

80
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:08,640
sure definitely the thing about the

81
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,598
volcano is the Smoke Gets stales you

82
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,359
know like it takes so long to fill that

83
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:15,719
bag and then by the time you consume it

84
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,879
I just feel like the flavor is

85
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:20,120
affected yeah I would say I'm very

86
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:23,639
interested in getting a ball Vape yeah

87
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:26,319
this is the the thing um a vape or the

88
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,879
the when we say the old school Vapes

89
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:32,719
they have a long session it takes like

90
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:35,800
five to 7 minutes to extract all the

91
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,880
cannabinoids and the tpin and for me

92
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,840
this is with my ADHD takes too long and

93
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:46,319
this is why I use like the ball Vape or

94
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:49,758
a dino VAP and these are all Vapes which

95
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,399
really extract everything quick and it

96
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,000
doesn't take seven minutes and the

97
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:59,159
volcano have also this uh balloon and to

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,120
be true I never um felt had the feeling

99
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,800
for this Vibe because when I'm sitting

100
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:10,000
and I'm enjoying cannabis when I get

101
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:14,120
this and the balloon is blowing up it no

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,120
it's not my type of consuming

103
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:20,799
cannabis and one thing I'm not a fan of

104
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:23,918
the volcano at all we spoke about

105
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,240
cartridges last time and do you know

106
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:30,599
what I have here this is

107
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:34,439
crazy this is crazy I don't if I have

108
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:39,199
light yes I have to show you the

109
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:42,759
quality I have Vape cards made by myself

110
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:47,400
in under 1 hour and now and this is why

111
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:51,000
it's so crazy it's not made from hash

112
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:55,038
Rosen it's made from flower Rosen from

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,079
pressing the flower till having a consum

114
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:01,399
consumable vape it took me 1 hour and 15

115
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:03,680
minutes and the the thing is which is so

116
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:07,839
mind-blowing is that when you see the

117
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:11,079
quality this is flower Rosen yeah and

118
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:13,879
the thing is that the German community

119
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:16,918
is pushing hard everybody wants to get

120
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:19,199
out of his free plans he can grow now

121
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,038
not with the legalization I call it

122
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,240
decriminalization um they want to get

123
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:28,318
out the maximum and my job as a cannabis

124
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,160
educator is also to onboard the people

125
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,520
as easy as possible

126
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,880
to different topics of cannibals and

127
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:40,159
when you tell somebody to produce to

128
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:43,918
wash ha to dry the it to dry the hash

129
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:48,120
properly then to press Rosen from hash

130
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:51,079
it's a long way then then to BU to make

131
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,120
your own cards but in Germany because

132
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:55,079
there is such a huge need to do it now

133
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,439
by yourself because it's the only legal

134
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:01,439
way people also have been looking for a

135
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:04,519
way to get get it out from flowers and

136
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,879
it's the fire in fire out game I took

137
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:09,959
some beautiful flowers from my buto

138
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:13,319
rainbow I pressed it really as flower

139
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:16,079
rosin and then I took a small jar and I

140
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:19,879
decarbed the rosin and

141
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:25,359
I the word in English I hom

142
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:27,000
homog I homogen in German um to H um how

143
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,160
you call it I don't can't pronounce the

144
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,120
word I don't know how to say it in

145
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:36,039
English either uh H uh um to to make it

146
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:39,840
homogen you know homogenize it

147
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:42,598
homogenizing it exactly and by that you

148
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:46,318
get a little bit more viscous

149
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:49,120
consistency and the new cards can handle

150
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,960
that because it's no coil it's nothing

151
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,478
inside it's a

152
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,000
ceramic um part which heats up the

153
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:56,918
flower rosin so you don't have the

154
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,560
problem with all the lipids and fats

155
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:03,839
which are also in flower rosin so this

156
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:06,319
pen from pressing flowers to consumption

157
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,519
in 1 hour and 50 minutes so I will drop

158
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,720
also a YouTube video about that soon on

159
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:15,598
my channel so I'm interested in um are

160
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:20,759
you using like a a rosin press like we

161
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:24,519
have out here yeah definitely I um using

162
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:27,560
a 10 ton press and I have it since four

163
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:30,359
years from one of my partners um graa

164
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:34,399

165
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,399
behind me so

166
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:43,718
yeah can you yeah excuse me because um

167
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:45,759
back in the day when rosin first began

168
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:49,160
we were using like hair straightening

169
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:51,120
irons to make rosin but you can't use

170
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:55,600
fresh flour in that you have to do it

171
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,839
with hash nope that's not true sorry to

172
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,759
to yeah look look you can do go ahead

173
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:05,480
tell me me

174
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:08,679
so when we recorded today the episode

175
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:12,440
for YouTube we thought

176
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:16,679
about okay if we make a video where we

177
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:20,240
use a Rosen press let's say 450 bucks

178
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:22,439
and then we also say we are using an

179
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,039
infusing machine which can hold the

180
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:30,920
temperature perfectly other 250 bucks

181
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:36,000
okay so we said ah the the onboarding

182
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:38,719
barrier 600 bucks is quite high so what

183
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:44,120
we did and this is like I try to educate

184
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:46,920
the people I told to my cameraman let's

185
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,560
try if we can make it with the hair

186
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,679
straightener because a hair straightener

187
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:55,958
10

188
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:59,838
bucks the cartridge under 10 bucks and

189
00:09:55,958 --> 00:10:02,479
you just need like a budget of € 30 to

190
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,360
make it with a with a hair straightener

191
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:10,000
and we did it also with flower without

192
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,000
Rosen bags we we took a

193
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,240
flower wait a

194
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:20,680
second we took a

195
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:25,639
flower and we pressed it to a small

196
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:29,958
ball and this ball helps you pressing it

197
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:32,679
without a b surrounding it so

198
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:35,638
this we put between perment paper and

199
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:38,958
the hair straightener and we pressed uh

200
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:41,039
four GRS and then we took all this

201
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,879
flower rosin which is a little bit dirty

202
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:46,159
because you don't have the filtration

203
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:48,720
through a bag and then we activated that

204
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:51,799
and that's now in my Rosen pants so we

205
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,160
really did it with a low entry barrier

206
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:59,319
for the German

207
00:10:54,159 --> 00:11:01,919
community did you decarb it yes um when

208
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:07,040
you press the flower it's not viscous

209
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:11,159
enough so we uh we placed it by 110

210
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:14,000
celus for 25 minutes and then um during

211
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:16,480
the cooldown time it was still so liquid

212
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,919
that we really could fill it in the

213
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:24,600
pan without a syringe or

214
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:27,559
something so this is how I love to

215
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:31,240
that's cool I can't wait to see the

216
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:31,239
video we'll drop next

217
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:38,439
week well send me a link and you know

218
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,039
this video will take that much time to

219
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,360
to get it up as well and and we will put

220
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,399
the link in the video hey you guys chat

221
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,360
one second I want to grab

222
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:51,679
something uh Vince what is the the

223
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,560
temperature you are using uh when you're

224
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,599
pressing with the with your uh Ros

225
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:59,919
impress what what what do where are you

226
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:05,879
normally with the temperature um I

227
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:10,919
press uh flower Rosen between 75 and 80

228
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:14,838
Celsius for let's say 200 to to 250

229
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:16,078
seconds and um there I use the Rosen

230
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,320
bags

231
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:22,399
between at the beginning I was using 120

232
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,519
but when you get more for Quality also

233
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,278
when we talk about flower rosin you can

234
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:30,240
also there go for a little bit better

235
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:35,439
quality you lower the Micron I would say

236
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:38,639
um my average B is now 72 Micron and if

237
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,040
I say okay the the return the amount

238
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,079
isn't important but the quality must be

239
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,799
high and I want to show somebody really

240
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:49,239
good good good good flower rosin then I

241
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:52,198
would say I also can lower it till 45

242
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:57,839
Micron but for sure the

243
00:12:52,198 --> 00:13:00,479
return drops yeah so and for hash I

244
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:05,320
would say there the thing is that the

245
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,920
thca get also into a liquid uh phase

246
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:11,440
over 70

247
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:14,479
celsus and with hash you also have the

248
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,279
possibility to press it through the

249
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,800
Micron sometimes with a lower

250
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:23,799
temperature like let's say 65 but also

251
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,838
for hash Rosen um I would say I go

252
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:31,000
somewhere

253
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:35,639
between 65 72 7 free so and then with a

254
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:38,240
25 micron double bag and

255
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:41,000
yeah the next question would be what is

256
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,480
the strains that you that you press

257
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,320
which which of those strains that you

258
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,920
are working on gives you the most or the

259
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,480
best uh do you have some favorites yeah

260
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:53,559
the problem is that I'm growing now

261
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,320
since the 1 of April again and I didn't

262
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:59,159
had um the time and I'm also not allowed

263
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,440
to have more than free free cannabis

264
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:04,958
plant so it's not possible for me to

265
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,759
build up a library at the moment um if

266
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,919
if there wouldn't be this barrier I the

267
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:13,600
first thing I would have done on the 1

268
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:16,159
of April to pop I would say all my seed

269
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,440
stash I was collecting over the last

270
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:21,480
over the last years and then making

271
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:26,000
instantly a pheno hunt before I start to

272
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:30,278
do other work but now I um I had really

273
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,440
to be quite selective so I popped some

274
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:36,879
beans from a bacho

275
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:42,920
rainbow and um from a Belgian breeder OG

276
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:44,759
n a j j yeah and um OG nut I I don't can

277
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:47,559
pronounce his new name I know that his

278
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,759
nickname usually is Tango on reverse but

279
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:50,739
um that's another story and his genetics

280
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:52,120
it's a

281
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:57,639
[Music]

282
00:14:52,120 --> 00:15:02,360
um the buto rainbow I think it's um a

283
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:04,320
buto it's a lato the the melon and

284
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,959
crossed with a rainbow bels crossed

285
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,800
rainbow bels so and this strain was a

286
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:14,559
really good washer I had luck from the

287
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:19,599
first seats I popped I had like 5.5

288
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:21,838
nearly 6% return by washing it so

289
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,959
definitely good genetic and also by

290
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,320
pressing it to Rosen beautiful

291
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:30,239
plant that's considered like super

292
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,519
high-end yield for for watching yeah and

293
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,399
this is why I keep this plant you have

294
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:37,318
to imagine I'm allowed to grow free

295
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,759
plants and I'm growing just in flower

296
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:43,479
too and having the the gelato as a

297
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:45,839
mother for sure I already spread some

298
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,440
clones to some

299
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:51,040
friends this will be a genetic I think I

300
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,519
wh constantly working on the next I

301
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:57,399
wanted to share something with you guys

302
00:15:53,519 --> 00:16:00,799
I got a new cut of Sour Diesel I don't

303
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:03,519
know how how good you can see that I see

304
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:06,439
the structure and I see the SD I see

305
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:10,240
immediately the sour

306
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:13,319

307
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,839
tailing kics coming out this is exactly

308
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:17,519

309
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,040

310
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,360
man so my friend came

311
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,559
over with this and he said hey you know

312
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,120
I want you to check out this Sour Diesel

313
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,559
and before he opened up the jar I was

314
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,039
like oh my God that's

315
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:37,518
that's the best Sour Diesel I've seen in

316
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:40,480
decades and uh so I got the clones and

317
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:43,318
um I've been smoking it every day and

318
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,480
honestly I I you know as I talked in the

319
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:48,360
other shows I I use my vape pen a lot

320
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,159
but ever since I got this sour I've been

321
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,560
smoking like five joints a day so I

322
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:56,480
really need to get a ball Vape really

323
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:59,559
need a ball VAP because that way I would

324
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,920
be like I'd be like Vince smoking the

325
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:05,798
ball VAP uh ball Vape on the show and

326
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:10,000
instead I'm gonna smoke these joints and

327
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:11,639
I want to do uh free advertising I

328
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,078
really like this product and I I know

329
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,439
you you're not big into smoking but this

330
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:19,240
is called King Palms I know them and

331
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,759
it's made from a palm leaf and when I

332
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,838
first saw it I was like there's no way

333
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,838
I'm going to like it cuz the leaf is

334
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:28,480
it's kind of thick yeah you know and I'm

335
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:31,000
used to smoking with thin rice papers

336
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,200
but I'll tell you they smoke so

337
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,119
smooth and and cool you know cuz it

338
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,279
doesn't let allow it to burn so fast I

339
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:39,959
really love it now it's a little bit

340
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:42,759
embarrassing because you got to pack a

341
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:46,440
pre-roll and I have this little funnel

342
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:48,359
that I use to to make my joints which is

343
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,720
it's embarrassing when you're in public

344
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,599
and you're doing that and people like oh

345
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,360
this guy can't roll a joint I can

346
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:57,959
actually roll a joint but I really

347
00:17:54,359 --> 00:18:00,678
prefer these King Palms I think they're

348
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,400
really nice and on top of everything get

349
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:06,000
them also in Germany um they're yeah

350
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:09,440
well known it's an elegant product you

351
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,679
know it's an elegant product so I'm

352
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,120
going to mute my microphone while I roll

353
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:17,120
my joints but in the meantime Vince

354
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,959
start telling us your weed Story start

355
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:22,439
telling us a little bit about the state

356
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:26,120
of cannabis in Germany and

357
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,360
Europe so you started the episode with

358
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:31,239
the legalization I can't call it a

359
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:34,558
legalization ation yeah um it's a

360
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:37,480
decriminalization so um

361
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:40,000
our in a lot of ways that's better in a

362
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,839
lot of ways that's better no no not not

363
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,558
I mean here in the US legalization has

364
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:46,879
destroyed the Cannabis Market um you

365
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:51,079
know making it not a

366
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:53,320
crime it brings in people and characters

367
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:55,599
yeah that's a much better angle I got

368
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:59,960
your your entire ball

369
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:02,158
Vapes so um yeah you you said at the

370
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,400
beginning uh how is going how is the

371
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:06,520
legalization going on on in Germany or

372
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,320
in Europe um I will talk today about

373
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:13,079
Germany uh it's not a legalization it's

374
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:17,678
a decriminalization but in a German way

375
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:22,759
so the law it's called Ki

376
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:27,200
cannabis c n g for cannabis gazettes

377
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:30,440
cannabis law in English and the the law

378
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:36,080
starts by the words cannabis is

379
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:38,840
forbidden but okay so it's just they

380
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:40,759
open they opened um or they

381
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:43,279
decriminalized

382
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:46,240
consumption consumption is now

383
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:49,519
legal and cannabis is still

384
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,159
illegal but under certain

385
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:56,158
circumstances it's allowed so the

386
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:59,159
circumstances are you are allowed to

387
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:04,720
grow free Plants but

388
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:09,520
you are just allowed to store at home 50

389
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:12,759
gs so how would you we know everybody

390
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:14,158
here in the podcast knows that just with

391
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:17,879
one

392
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:21,919
plant we will get illegal again so there

393
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:26,039
is like a um a tolerance like from 50 to

394
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:29,280
60 it's not um a felony you would say in

395
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:32,879
the states I think oh so it's not a big

396
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:37,399
crime but it's already a crime so

397
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,640
everybody who harvests more than 50 g is

398
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,559
still

399
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:45,840
illegal you are allowed to carry 25

400
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:49,119
grams on the street okay but what's with

401
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:52,720
the outdoor Growers who want to grow

402
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:54,839
completely holistic approach full cycle

403
00:20:52,720 --> 00:21:00,960
with nature using the energy from the

404
00:20:54,839 --> 00:21:03,158
Sun and store let's say a k at home for

405
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,400
the whole year the whole year to W to

406
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:09,080
wash some hash and all this stuff so

407
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,400
this is so what about hash is it the

408
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:16,519
same limit yeah so hash so extraction is

409
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:19,159
not allowed so now we have to be [ __ ]

410
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:21,599
German I don't call it extraction

411
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:24,760
Frenchy canoli also said it it's a

412
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:28,199
separation it's not an extraction we

413
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:32,200
don't pull out with a with a solvent

414
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:36,679
some out of the plant we separate the

415
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:39,400
tricomes with seing and water and cold a

416
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:43,200
technical process but that's called for

417
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:46,278
me separation now and this is allowed

418
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:50,159
but then we come to Rosen and there I

419
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:54,919
bent the rules to the maximum Okay Rosen

420
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:57,240
for me no solvent so what are we doing

421
00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:01,799
we are doing a heat

422
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:04,440
sing We take something and we heat it up

423
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:06,879
which we before we can heat it up we

424
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,558
cool it down and now we heat it up and

425
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,080
we press it again through a through a

426
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:17,639
mesh and what we separate is the waxes

427
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:20,599
and some residues in the hash so we can

428
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:23,400
produce rosin and to be completely

429
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:26,158
German we don't call rosin an extract

430
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,840
it's a concentrate so because to

431
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:32,159
concentrate something is the different

432
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:35,319
defination uh than extracting something

433
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,480
and having an extract because the German

434
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:40,720
law had in mind when you read the law

435
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:44,079
and bro we have been reading the

436
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:47,640
law hundreds of time each

437
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:51,119
word and there is

438
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:53,038
um one important thing in the in the

439
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,639
part where where they talk about

440
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:59,240
extraction it's also written in the

441
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:06,559
sentence something like to extract te H

442
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:10,240
C or CBD so the the um the straight um

443
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:13,119
mono component this is extracting so

444
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,558
yeah and this is how we we ended up with

445
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:18,239
we can talk a little bit more about that

446
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:21,359
with a law which is

447
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,599
completely unlogical it's not it it's

448
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:27,199
not fought from the perspective of a

449
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:29,399
cannabis consumer and from a cannabis

450
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,880
grower

451
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,559
and yeah

452
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,278
um like yeah this is why we have to be

453
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,879
German and we don't call it an extract

454
00:23:37,278 --> 00:23:41,880
it's a

455
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,480
concentrate but can you tell a little

456
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:48,440
bit about the you know how actually they

457
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:52,159
say I heard about it that it will be a a

458
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:54,640
few years of trying this law like zoa

459
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,120
they call zoa is the is the in English

460
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,278
you call it uh Vince can you tell a

461
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:02,319
little bit about how they actually

462
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:04,278
scheduled the the the law actually they

463
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:07,480
said it's going to be in three phases

464
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:10,839
like the phase one which already started

465
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,679
then uh it will because of five years of

466
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:14,839
trying the law and then they will

467
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:17,320
evaluate it and can you tell a little

468
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:20,079
bit about that that because I heard now

469
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:21,918
that they just don't want to go to step

470
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:23,839
two step three they just want to have

471
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:27,840
step one over you know

472
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,839
like okay

473
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,480
are we stressing you out asking you

474
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:34,319
these questions because you look like

475
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,839
your mind is about to explode yeah it is

476
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:40,319
you have to imagine um the last two and

477
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:45,599
a half years we have been um we have

478
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:49,599
been really in a law-giving process so

479
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:52,480
my daily thing was to read news and to

480
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:54,519
get headaches and

481
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,720
um

482
00:24:54,519 --> 00:25:01,879
it's it's a little bit messy this law

483
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:04,440
okay so and what Sasha was asking is

484
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,320
they had three pillars they wanted to

485
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:10,159
enroll afterwards each pillar so the

486
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:12,278
first pillar is De uh um

487
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,600
decriminalization or legalization of

488
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:18,519
consumption allowing the home grow

489
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:20,199
allowing clubs cannabis Social Clubs

490
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:25,119
also there we can we'll talk a little

491
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:27,399
bit about later and by that you have you

492
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,959
are not allowed to share cannabis with

493
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:31,519
your friends okay okay imagine that we

494
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,919
are not allowed to share I am not

495
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:36,398
allowed to to to trade or to give you a

496
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:38,960
present

497
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:41,599
okay completely nonsense when you think

498
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,278
about cannabis culture yeah and the

499
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:47,879
beauty of sharing butts with other

500
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:51,200
Growers or to share a joint or a pipe or

501
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,679
a vape or something so like what about

502
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,519
somebody that can't grow because they're

503
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:57,480
sick don't have a space so this is

504
00:25:54,519 --> 00:26:00,398
exactly the thing so if you are just

505
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:04,120
able to get weed legally by growing it

506
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:08,239
yourself or from a club in the First Act

507
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:09,558
of enrolling this law you have a problem

508
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,359
if you are not a

509
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:15,918
grower you can't get weed this way and

510
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:19,240
there are no clubs or now it's the first

511
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:21,240
Club opened but we will talk a little

512
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,839
bit deeper about the situation with the

513
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,759
clubs in a few minutes but there are no

514
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:29,678
clubs at the moment so it wasn't that

515
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:32,079
the clubs had time to pre start building

516
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,798
facilities growing so that from the

517
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:36,839
moment wheat became legal it was also

518
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:40,398
able to get it if you're another grower

519
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:44,720
in a club and to get member in the club

520
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:46,839
so because they also um said they

521
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,960
thought it will be quicker to enroll

522
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:53,480
enroll the clubs but it's such a huge

523
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,440
project to start canabus Social Club

524
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,679
where they cut the S out it's not

525
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,840
allowed to smoke together in the club so

526
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,720
it's not a so cannabis Social Club it's

527
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:04,798
a cannabis club yeah it's a at the end

528
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,960
it's a facility which grows the wheat

529
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,440
and people can pick it up and smoke it

530
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,480
alone at home and are not allowed to

531
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:17,558
share it okay

532
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:20,599
so and the second pillar of the law is

533
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:24,798
that they wanted to

534
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:28,599
start testing in different cities to

535
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:30,879
open dispensaries under a huge um

536
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:35,439
observation and

537
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:40,240
evaluation and um to see also how that

538
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:43,480
work and the third thing this is far far

539
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,440
away I would say 10 years in the future

540
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,960
maybe seven if it's quick but I said 10

541
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,159
years in the future that we will have

542
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,319
cannabis

543
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,600
dispensaries where you don't have to be

544
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,879
a member and where you can go

545
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:58,639
completely like in the states and some

546
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,320
states after work

547
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,600
bro what do you want yeah bring me some

548
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:06,319
sherbet okay I will pick up Sour Diesel

549
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:08,158
let's meet later so that's will that's

550
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:09,798
in the Far Far Future so what's going on

551
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,600
at the moment excuse me what's the

552
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:13,720
difference between a social club and a

553
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:16,759
dispensary I mean I understand a club

554
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:19,480
you have to be a member yeah but so what

555
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:22,679
I mean like that works in Spain

556
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:26,640
right uh the problem is in

557
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:32,240
Spain that the whole club thing also

558
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:37,080
have a lot of Black Market Vibe yeah um

559
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:39,240
if we talk true uh if we want to be uh

560
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:41,359
completely straight what's going on in

561
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:46,159
Spain they also are not allowed to earn

562
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:50,079
money so but they somehow get the money

563
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:53,080
out of the club for sure so the the

564
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:58,639
thing is that in Germany they wanted to

565
00:28:53,079 --> 00:29:02,558
prevent this by giving the clubs just a

566
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:06,559
small scalability a club in

567
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:09,200
Germany is limited by 500 members so you

568
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:12,480
can't scale it up isn't it the same in

569
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,759
Spain no I don't know how but orad told

570
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,000
me that there was a limit okay a lot of

571
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:18,480
clubs give a [ __ ] well they don't give

572
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,720
well I mean there's one thing about

573
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,519
having rules and then there's another

574
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,640
thing by abiding the rules I mean you

575
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:27,599
said something that you're not allowed

576
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,840
to give your friends weed well if he's

577
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,359
your friend

578
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:33,558
you know he's not going to tell the

579
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:35,119
police right I mean is something you

580
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:38,440
know it's like you're not allowed to

581
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:40,479
give weed away to a cop okay right but

582
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,240
you know if I'm in German let me just

583
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,720
say this if I go to Germany I hope

584
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,159
you'll give me some weed bro like you

585
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:51,000
know I

586
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:52,960
mean I'm kidding but you know it's like

587
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,599
you just can't get caught we have to get

588
00:29:52,960 --> 00:30:00,840
one step back why this law is possible

589
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:05,678
okay under German and European and

590
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:10,038
international law okay the the argument

591
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:15,038
the the the punchline is for this law we

592
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:19,038
want harm reduction for consumers and

593
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:23,759
Society okay then we have this is the

594
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:27,558
the the the um the spark for this law

595
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:28,558
okay but then we come immediately in

596
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:31,158
trouble

597
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:32,359
we can't legalize because in this moment

598
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:36,039
we get in

599
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:38,158
trouble in on the European level because

600
00:30:36,038 --> 00:30:42,359
there's also contracts that all the

601
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:44,360
European States um uh will try to

602
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:47,439
suppress drug

603
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:50,079
trafficking and blah blah blah blah

604
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,360
blah and on the international law it's

605
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:56,079
the same yeah so there's the single

606
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:59,000
convention and all the stuff where if

607
00:30:56,079 --> 00:31:01,398
you are deeper into legal ing movement

608
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,599
you know that countries who want to

609
00:31:01,398 --> 00:31:06,319
legalize have to get out of the single

610
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:10,240
convention Canada did that Colombia uh

611
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:15,000
did that for coke leaves and then they

612
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:17,919
um they bring the law into into uh work

613
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
and then they get back into the contract

614
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:24,278
and nobody says something but Germany

615
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,519
wanted to be German so they asked the

616
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:29,359
European Parliament if it's if it's fine

617
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:32,120
to legalize completely and they didn't

618
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:37,240
get the right response and they saw okay

619
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:39,759
if we want to get this law with the with

620
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,919
the fort of harm reduction for society

621
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,158
and and

622
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:47,720
consumers we have to make it like a

623
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:51,200
trial because then Germany was able to

624
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:54,679
go to the European Union and say okay we

625
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:58,720
will bring this law and we will evaluate

626
00:31:54,679 --> 00:32:03,278
after four or five years and our goal is

627
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:05,679
to test if we can reduce the harm by the

628
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:09,599
end consumers because of all the

629
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:12,880
ingredients hairspray and fertilizer

630
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:16,480
which are used to um to higher the the

631
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,440
the weight and there's so much stuff the

632
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,720
people here in Germany have been smoking

633
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:25,798
weed with hair hairspray and sand and

634
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:29,120
metals just to to have more weight on

635
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:35,798
the wage to get more money so it's

636
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:37,439
crazy and this will be evaluated so and

637
00:32:35,798 --> 00:32:41,158
I'm sorry you

638
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,679
know uh I've been around for a minute

639
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:47,320
and I've heard about a bunch of stuff

640
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:50,038
being added to weed but never hairspray

641
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:54,240
no look in in

642
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:58,919
uh uh Sasha maybe you can help me V what

643
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:00,558
means Bly in English uh can you maybe

644
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:02,840
have a look because this is something

645
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:05,119
really important to to tell the people

646
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:08,439
so this was the reason why I started to

647
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:11,638
grow 15 years ago

648
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:14,399
when 20 50 years a 15 years ago it

649
00:33:11,638 --> 00:33:17,599
started that they laced wheed with

650
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:22,759
hairspray they laced wheed with crushed

651
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:26,000
glass yeah they they crushed glass so so

652
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:29,119
dusty and then they covered the the

653
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,159
butts and it went till the thing that

654
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:33,918
the growers in the grow already were

655
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,159
putting stuff on the butts when they

656
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,960
were growing that it's inside the but

657
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:41,440
and that the weight of the whole Harvest

658
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,440
gets higher okay

659
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:52,038
and poisonous I'm sorry one more time le

660
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:54,199
le a whole city got got um poisoned by

661
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:58,480
Le in the

662
00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:00,880
wheat that it was in liik yeah and and

663
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,759
there was there was coming in a batch of

664
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,720
wheat into the city under the black

665
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:10,358
market which was laced with lead so it's

666
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,159
[ __ ] toxic people were smoking it and

667
00:34:10,358 --> 00:34:15,239
immediately the people went into the

668
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,240
hospital and this is the thing this is

669
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:20,199
what's going on or was going on in

670
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:21,439
Germany so and this is a good argument

671
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:24,078
for the politicians who wanted to

672
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,599
legalize hey we have to reduce the harm

673
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:29,679
we have to give the people access to

674
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:32,240
clean weed and this is what we are now

675
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,119
we we are it's not legal but it's

676
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:38,158
allowed the end consumer can grow it by

677
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:42,399
it by himself and now clubs are also

678
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:46,200
starting we have now 120 130

679
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:50,358
clubs in the making which will have each

680
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:53,759
500 members and we need like if we want

681
00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:55,759
to supply whole Germany let's take

682
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,480
calculate the hom Growers out and we

683
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:02,440
just would use clubs we would need like

684
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:05,320
5,000 5,500 clubs yeah we have in

685
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:11,880
Germany we say between 4.5

686
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:16,440
till five six million consumers so and

687
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:18,640
the clubs is not like bro do you want to

688
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:23,159
open a club with me you will bring the

689
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:27,039
lights I will bring my tent no it's it's

690
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:29,879
more bro do we want or do we we have to

691
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:33,920
open a compy or a structure which is

692
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,640
under the same problems and hustle as

693
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,800
building up a real company because there

694
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:44,000
are so many rules to build a club in

695
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:48,440
Germany ah the 500 members are just

696
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,079
allowed each person to pick up 50 grams

697
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,920
a month and not in once because on the

698
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:57,640
street in Germany you are just allowed

699
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:59,800
to run around with 25g in your pocket so

700
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:03,440
you have to go twice to your Club to

701
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:06,039
pick up your maximum amount of 50g in a

702
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:11,119
month and you have to sign that you are

703
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:13,159
not in the other club so it's really the

704
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:16,200
that the viewer of the podcast and The

705
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:18,879
Listener understands what's going on the

706
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:21,679
government the politicians who made this

707
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:26,039
law they fought it through the

708
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:28,440
perspective of how can we reduce harm

709
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:32,639
responsible consumption

710
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:37,639
and to push back the black market so

711
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:39,960
from their P perspective it's okay if we

712
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:42,440
if we just allow them 50 GRS which is

713
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:46,679
from my perspective from a non-smoker

714
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:48,679
bro 50 gr it must be a junkie yeah we

715
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:51,318
know it's different but if you smoke

716
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:55,480
pure 50

717
00:36:51,318 --> 00:36:58,039
g can happen and they I'm Smoke 50 GRS

718
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:01,079
in the next week so

719
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:03,880
and may probably more definitely more

720
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:06,680
yeah I'm smoking five joints of this a

721
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,519
day so I mean that's that's just a you

722
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:10,759
know couple of days and this is the

723
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:14,559
thing they wanted to to they thought if

724
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:17,480
we limit that and we do that and just

725
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:20,838
um then we will reduce the consumption

726
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:24,599
we know that a consumer consumes what he

727
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:29,519
consumes the most important thing is if

728
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:29,519
you if you allow the social thing

729
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:36,000
I think that in our community I just can

730
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:39,039
talk from what I am knowing surrounding

731
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,400
me if somebody has a problem with

732
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:45,239
cannabis and we think he should smoke

733
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,480
for a couple of weeks a little bit less

734
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:50,318
I can tell him that because for me it's

735
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,719
important and if he's a friend or

736
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:54,480
something like a friend this is nothing

737
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:56,480
which occurs when you are in a bar

738
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,880
drinking bro you maybe should drink a

739
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,358
little bit less you get drunken too

740
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,880
often but if I have a friend where I see

741
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:06,598
that he has some problems in his head

742
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,200
and I go to him and I tell him please

743
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:12,720
smoke less because I see him and if we

744
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:15,000
bring the consumption just that

745
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:18,799
everybody smokes by its own we

746
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:22,199
can't be together and uh have an eye on

747
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,400
our surrounding people so you know what

748
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:26,239
you're making me

749
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:29,440
realize you're making me realize I have

750
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:29,439
no friends

751
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,240
no one's no one's telling me to smoke

752
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:38,960
less you know I honestly I'm L you know

753
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:42,879
I I think about it

754
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:47,199
myself you know um and I'm pretty open

755
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:50,358
with the fact that I'm abusing

756
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:53,039
cannabis I know I am now it's like I

757
00:38:50,358 --> 00:38:58,358
just love it so much and always want to

758
00:38:53,039 --> 00:39:02,358
be with it you know but I know it's it's

759
00:38:58,358 --> 00:39:07,318
abuse you like because I I do

760
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:09,799
it like I don't have to have re to often

761
00:39:07,318 --> 00:39:11,279
huh maybe a little bit too often or

762
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,240
maybe sometimes you smoke a joint

763
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,480
because you love it so much even if

764
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:20,279
you're still high bro that's normal but

765
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:23,039
the thing is what I say if but that's

766
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:28,760
abuse right it

767
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:33,480
depends it depends so the thing is that

768
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:35,119
in in my friend Circle it was normal

769
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:39,760
that when we saw that

770
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:43,358
somebody wasn't on the line in his

771
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:46,480
life we as a friend we talk to each

772
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:49,480
other and sometimes it was also bro

773
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,639
maybe you should stop smoking for a few

774
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:56,480
weeks or lower it and I know that's

775
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:58,440
weird from our community it's not in

776
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,079
other countries that I have seen that

777
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,800
because I'm German I'm living here I

778
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:05,440
live here in the Cannabis culture but um

779
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,318
and that's something that kids will hear

780
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,159
from their parents yeah and look you

781
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:14,838
know but when when legalization was on

782
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:16,759
the horizon I realized that

783
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:19,400
something that there will come some

784
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:23,680
responsibility also with the

785
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:26,519
reach um content creators have and I was

786
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:28,838
quite lucky that I stopped combustion

787
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:30,838
it's not that I completely stopped I

788
00:40:28,838 --> 00:40:33,358
also smoked joints but not at home

789
00:40:30,838 --> 00:40:36,920
anymore like I said in the first episode

790
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:40,799
and by that I don't have to tell the

791
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:44,400
people what to do or not I I'm just as a

792
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,839
role model and they talk to me also in

793
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,720
streams and everything and then I just

794
00:40:46,838 --> 00:40:53,078
give them an inspiration to try a

795
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:58,199
different way consuming cannabis and it

796
00:40:53,079 --> 00:41:02,440
works and um for me man I have periods

797
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:04,799
uh like you yeah but it's important also

798
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:07,159
to have an eye on your buddies when they

799
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,359
get a problem with it so I say if you

800
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:12,679
are settled in life everything runs

801
00:41:10,358 --> 00:41:15,078
well it's your amount of cannabis you

802
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:17,480
need or you laugh to consume so go for

803
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:20,079
it

804
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:23,920
yeah yeah you know

805
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:26,000
um I have a quick change the subject

806
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,318
moment okay and then I want to get back

807
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:33,519
to it um do you know how many of your

808
00:41:29,318 --> 00:41:35,679
viewers or listeners are from outside of

809
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:37,480
Germany or Europe like how many people

810
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:40,679
are listening to your

811
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:43,358
podcasts um in the US is what I want to

812
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:45,318
know and before we go any further I

813
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:48,519
don't know that I properly introduced

814
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:51,239
Vince because he was on our last show

815
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:53,880

it's more like look you know maybe you

841
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,240
should consider not smoking so much weed

842
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,240
next week it's such a it's such a

843
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:20,039
delicate approach that honestly you

844
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:23,318
don't expect from Germans you know in

845
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:26,119
the US look um I would say something

846

847
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:29,640

851
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:54,599
um when I gave myself the name Vincent

852
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:57,639
wheed um I did it because I have also

853
00:43:54,599 --> 00:44:00,760
like like a code with my

854
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:05,480
Community 24/7 for

2710 yeah I have 247 cannabis and

856
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:12,679
cannabis concentrates in my

857
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:15,000
head and then when I told the story a

858
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:17,719
little bit in the last podcast so if you

859
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:22,440
want to have it a little bit deep deeper

860
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:26,159
list in the first episode I I am living

861
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:28,760
cannabis or like a legal person also

862
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:32,239
years before legal ization in Germany

863
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:36,520
and I stand for cannabis and then when

864
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:40,159
legalization came my work

865
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:44,559
load quad tripled yeah it it went

866
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:48,399
through the roof and I'm I I was

867
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:48,400
consuming so much cannabis that I

868
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:55,358
couldn't form on the level I needed and

869
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:57,440
I went straight into a small cannabis

870
00:44:55,358 --> 00:45:01,358
midlife crisis

871
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:03,000
I was feeling the first time in my life

872
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:08,318
that at the moment I'm smoking

873
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:11,119
definitely too much was like 100 grams a

874
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:12,759
month with a little bit side

875
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:16,000
extracts

876
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:19,480
and I wasn't functioning on point with

877
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:23,480
all the um all the

878
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:25,079
responsibility business second company

879
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:28,280
family

880
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:31,960
um all the stuff

881
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:34,280
and then I had the problem that okay I

882
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:36,720
can't lower my wheat consumption or stop

883
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:39,720
I'm Vincent wheat yeah this was my inner

884
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:41,558
inner dialogue I thought bro what's

885
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:44,358
going on wheat isn't good for you at the

886
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:46,400
moment and I think you have to stop weed

887
00:45:44,358 --> 00:45:49,440
smoking weed and what will the people

888
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:53,559
say you you are

889
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:55,679
cannabis and then I said okay I have to

890
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:57,559
take a decision I don't feel well so I

891
00:45:55,679 --> 00:46:00,519
have to lower my weak

892
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:03,599
consumption and I took the decision to

893
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:07,880
communicate that straight with my

894
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:10,079
community and what came out of that this

895
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:13,599
is the only moment I call myself an

896
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:16,480
influencer when I really Influence

897
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:19,079
People For A Better

898
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:22,400
Living this is where I call myself like

899
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:26,039
that the community feedback was

900
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:28,720
outstanding people said bro it's exactly

901
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:31,279
what I'm in at the moment and good that

902
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:33,439
you say that I will do the same and then

903
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,760
two three four five weeks later in my

904
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,760
streams I stream really regularly with

905
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:41,440
my community I'm really close to

906
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:43,520
them the feedback came in bro this was

907
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,800
the best thing I got a little bit

908
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:48,239
distance I didn't stop but I lowered and

909
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:51,480
my life is better and I see things from

910
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:54,919
another perspective and I used this

911
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:57,519
moment to stop combusting and all this

912
00:46:54,920 --> 00:47:00,280
and the feedback was really was feeling

913
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:02,719
on the other side of the of the of the

914
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:05,720
monitor in the Stream that there have

915
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:08,919
been people affected positive by being

916
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:12,480
completely truthful to myself and don't

917
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:15,440
hiding it I I'm I'm also truthful now I

918
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:18,119
thought okay maybe I just will do I will

919
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:21,599
tell them that I smoke and show it and

920
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:25,039
but that's not me I'm now seven years in

921
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:27,480
social media and I never changed

922
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:29,679
something for it for what I don't tell

923
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:32,199
everything no private is private but I

924
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:34,799
am the person I am yeah if you like me

925
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:37,759
you like me if you don't like me okay

926
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:40,480
that's totally fine yeah I kind of think

927
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:43,720
people that don't like you must be dicks

928
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,838
no bro I'm saying this as an outsider

929
00:47:43,719 --> 00:47:48,279
yeah I also have

930
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:51,199
personality and sometimes it doesn't fit

931
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:54,319
and that's fine I also had to learn that

932
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:57,439
my ego died so many times I'm surprised

933
00:47:54,318 --> 00:48:00,159
anyone likes me to be honest with you

934
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,679
cuz I being from New

935
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:05,000
York I just feel like most people in the

936
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:07,318
world would find that really offensive

937
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,199
the way New Yorkers act and talk even

938
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:14,279
though I'm far what the typical New

939
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:17,519
Yorker attitude that you think I can I

940
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:19,559
can sum it up pretty easily this is what

941
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:22,199
I think of a New Yorker when you live in

942
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:25,480
New York City you have to be prepared to

943
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:28,399
walk down the street somebody bump into

944
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:31,599
you and just not give a

945
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:34,358
[ __ ] because you're going to bump into

946
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:37,559
so many people that if you have to stop

947
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:42,199
and say I'm sorry or excuse

948
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:45,800
me it's a major life sucker it takes

949
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:48,000
years off it's just it's just so common

950
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:50,200
you know you are in a different city and

951
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,798
you bump some in somebody and you don't

952
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:54,318
and you give a [ __ ] and this person get

953
00:48:51,798 --> 00:48:56,039
offended because you didn't uh I mean I

954
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:58,838
can't even imagine anywhere else in the

955
00:48:56,039 --> 00:49:01,318
world where that be acceptable you know

956
00:48:58,838 --> 00:49:04,078
like if you bump into somebody and you

957
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:06,119
say excuse me it's all good yeah if you

958
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:08,519
bump into somebody and just keep walking

959
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:10,160
like nothing ever happened you're going

960
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:12,358
to get hit from the back of the head or

961
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:14,239
something you know it's just like that's

962
00:49:12,358 --> 00:49:18,558
even more rude than bumping into someone

963
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:21,239
is just not giving a [ __ ] yeah you know

964
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:24,160
um I have family in New

965
00:49:21,239 --> 00:49:27,039
York but besides I also have family in

966
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:29,798
New York yeah so I never really want to

967
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:35,400
go back except to see family okay and

968
00:49:29,798 --> 00:49:37,920
pizza the pizza's good yeah I I I I am

969
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:41,240
really this is on my list to visit New

970
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:43,798
York again I was maybe 15 20 years the

971
00:49:41,239 --> 00:49:43,798
last time

972
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:51,318
there I you know I want to get back to

973
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:52,759
the legalization stuff please but I at

974
00:49:51,318 --> 00:49:55,599
the same point I want to make sure we

975
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:58,920
have enough time for these stories too

976
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:01,798
because it's it's one thing to

977
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,318
tell about you know what the state of

978
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:06,480
cannabis is in

979
00:50:03,318 --> 00:50:08,599
Germany which we we do want to know and

980
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,760
it's another thing to get to know who

981
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:13,599
Vincent weed is and for me that's just

982
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,359
far more interesting so I want to make

983
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:18,798
sure that we spend a little time doing

984
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:21,159
both let me think about what is

985
00:50:18,798 --> 00:50:23,119
definitely look let me think about

986
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:25,838
what's definitely important that the

987
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:27,280
listener of your show should know about

988
00:50:25,838 --> 00:50:29,719
German legalization

989
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:34,200
what's going

990
00:50:29,719 --> 00:50:36,759
on first of all where my heart is

991
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:40,318
pumping because it's so beautiful to

992
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:43,040
see the hom

993
00:50:40,318 --> 00:50:44,079
Growers they are pushing out such a

994
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:45,759
beautiful

995
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:48,640
quality

996
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:52,119
immediately you saw the

997
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:54,639
culture getting through the surface yeah

998
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:57,358
and you like I said last time everywhere

999
00:50:54,639 --> 00:51:00,400
you see sashes

1000
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:02,159
people sharing having a great time and

1001
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,358
living the first time this feeling I

1002
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:06,358
don't have to

1003
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:06,358
hide

1004
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:13,358
beautiful and I we have a situation at

1005
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:16,598
the moment where the people are afraid

1006
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:23,480
that they will take that again away from

1007
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:23,480
us because the the government Who

1008
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:29,480
legalized they had huge problems we have

1009
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:34,240
problems in the world and these problems

1010
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:37,760
uh resulted in that they didn't finish

1011
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:42,118
their um their four years of how you

1012
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:45,319
call it the leg um legislation yeah so

1013
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:48,640
we have now new elections a little bit

1014
00:51:45,318 --> 00:51:51,679
earlier and we have the problem here

1015
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:55,400
also in Europe that

1016
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:57,519
the the politic political landscape

1017
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:01,480
became

1018
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:01,480
quite extreme in many

1019
00:52:01,639 --> 00:52:07,279
ways

1020
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:10,519
and we have the situation in Germany

1021
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:14,400
that we see a

1022
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:17,759
shift to and I don't want to go deeper

1023
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,760
into it to more

1024
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:23,039
conservative

1025
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:26,760
parties and this conservative

1026
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:31,318
parties they say we want to they really

1027
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:36,160
say that we want to uh re re uh how do

1028
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:40,358
you call it um rewind no um to make it

1029
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:44,798
backwards how you say that in English to

1030
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:46,519
undo yeah they want to to uh to to take

1031
00:52:44,798 --> 00:52:48,119
away the legalization again or the

1032
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:50,679
decriminalization how you say that in

1033
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:52,480
English in if logical

1034
00:52:50,679 --> 00:52:54,558
sentence just

1035
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:58,119
did

1036
00:52:54,559 --> 00:53:02,480
okay so and the thing

1037
00:52:58,119 --> 00:53:05,119
is I don't think that it's so easy

1038
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:08,519
because you have to think about also if

1039
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:13,240
and this is the beauty of uh democracy

1040
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:15,759
4.5 million people in a state of 85

1041
00:53:13,239 --> 00:53:17,879
million is what per definition a

1042
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,720
minority the Cannabis consumers in

1043
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:23,920
Germany are a minority but they became a

1044
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:27,480
huge law yeah it was a huge work for the

1045
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:30,960
politicians to implement this law okay

1046
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:33,119
and this is why democracy Works a

1047
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:36,639
minority the Cannabis consumers got

1048
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:38,119
their legalization to consume beautiful

1049
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:40,358
but

1050
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:42,640
now um with the new

1051
00:53:40,358 --> 00:53:45,318
elections the people think that the

1052
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:48,078
conservative parties will take it away

1053
00:53:45,318 --> 00:53:51,279
and I tell them

1054
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:55,079
look they also conservative people are

1055
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:58,400
smoking wheat and

1056
00:53:55,079 --> 00:54:02,760
when you will take the law away you will

1057
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:04,838
criminalize instantly 4.5 Millions oh

1058
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:07,799
people again

1059
00:54:04,838 --> 00:54:10,880
yeah and I don't think that this will

1060
00:54:07,798 --> 00:54:12,920
work with Society because now they saw

1061
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,240
that this that my neighbor where it was

1062
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:19,240
smelling like weed he and now he's legal

1063
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:22,519
and he's not becoming a crazy person by

1064
00:54:19,239 --> 00:54:25,399
smoking weed now he's a criminal again I

1065
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:28,960
think this will be a for also with a lot

1066
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:32,680
of people which don't consume

1067
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:37,679
cannabis and also to take a law

1068
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:41,279
away isn't that easy so we will get into

1069
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:44,719
rough water in the next

1070
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:47,200
years and we don't will get a

1071
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:52,439
Improvement of

1072
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:55,960
our unfinished cannabis law so what will

1073
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:58,079
be my perspective for the next years we

1074
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:02,639
will fight in the

1075
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:05,839
new room we got we can we just will be

1076
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:12,400
able to work with this law and this is

1077
00:55:05,838 --> 00:55:14,960
it so this is everything so now uh okay

1078
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,920
so you are back again I've been here the

1079
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,519
whole time okay I said I said that I

1080
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:24,440
heard we will have to work with this law

1081
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:27,159
for the next years let's say five 7 10

1082
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:29,119
and now it will be really a fight

1083
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:32,920
between the conservative and the

1084
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:36,920
Cannabis Community how to

1085
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:41,760
to interpret to interpret oh sometimes

1086
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:45,680
my English to um see how the words we

1087
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:48,559
have to um bro how can we say that in

1088
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:50,159
English

1089
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:55,400
um

1090
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:58,038
interpr how we see the written law yeah

1091
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:00,280
inter do we have to to push the

1092
00:55:58,039 --> 00:56:05,079
boundaries a little bit more to the left

1093
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:07,640
EXA the example is Hash an extraction or

1094
00:56:05,079 --> 00:56:10,960
is it a separation this will be stuff we

1095
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:13,719
will fight in front of the court yeah I

1096
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:16,199
TR listen to my words we will fight for

1097
00:56:13,719 --> 00:56:18,798
so many things there will PE will be

1098
00:56:16,199 --> 00:56:21,199
people sharing wheat and we will have to

1099
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:24,639
fight that this will become legal yeah

1100
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:27,279
we will have to keep fighting that hash

1101
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:29,358
not that hash but that Rosen stays legal

1102
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:33,039
it's not clear that it stays legal we

1103
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:36,358
have to fight for it yeah with

1104
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:38,319
arguments it will be crazy but yeah this

1105
00:56:36,358 --> 00:56:43,318
is a little bit the situation I don't

1106
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:46,400
think that we will get um taking away

1107
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:48,400
this decriminalization but I don't

1108
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:52,639
believe that we will have improvements

1109
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,639
in the next year so we have to deal with

1110
00:56:53,599 --> 00:57:01,720
that you know when legalization happened

1111
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:03,480
here or even prior to legalization when

1112
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:08,639
there was the medical

1113
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:12,679
marijuana there was silly rules as well

1114
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:16,679
and you know it it took time for for

1115
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:19,879
things to change so I think the fact

1116
00:57:16,679 --> 00:57:21,919
that they're being deliberate like the

1117
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,798
way you described it at the beginning

1118
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:27,079
that they're really trying to think

1119
00:57:23,798 --> 00:57:32,038
things through and and reflect on what's

1120
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:35,839
going on sounds positive at least um the

1121
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:40,359
rate of things happening is obviously

1122
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:43,119
painfully slow and I think the the

1123
00:57:40,358 --> 00:57:48,000
biggest frustration is like the EB and

1124
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:50,640
flow of what the politics wants for it

1125
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,400
you know like here in the US once the

1126
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:55,519
door is open it's so wide open there's a

1127
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:58,519
rush of people running through there you

1128
00:57:55,519 --> 00:58:02,480
can't close it and to me

1129
00:57:58,519 --> 00:58:06,358
it's it's hard to understand how a law

1130
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:10,119
could change so dramatically so quickly

1131
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:12,519
back and forth you know it's like that

1132
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:18,838
doesn't make any sense it's not

1133
00:58:12,519 --> 00:58:23,199
progress no and also in a in a sorry for

1134
00:58:18,838 --> 00:58:26,759
the listeners in other countries but in

1135
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:31,358
uh working democracy it's

1136
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:32,680
not that easy till close to unpossible

1137
00:58:31,358 --> 00:58:37,000
to

1138
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:40,399
re purpose a new law again backwards

1139
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:43,838
instantly yeah we don't have this

1140
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:47,480
institutional rights which where some

1141
00:58:43,838 --> 00:58:50,558
where a single person gets so much power

1142
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:52,280
to go there and say no that's not

1143
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:56,559
reality anymore

1144
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:59,680
sorry and um yeah I'm really

1145
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:02,960
uh fighting for democracy and this is

1146
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:05,038
why I'm a little bit relaxed because I

1147
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:10,318
know this is still working here in

1148
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:14,079
Germany yeah so I mean what's the deal

1149
00:59:10,318 --> 00:59:16,759
with you know in the US what drives this

1150
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:20,480
entire thing through

1151
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:23,240
legalization is money and the government

1152
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:26,159
makes money

1153
00:59:23,239 --> 00:59:27,838
so arent don't they want to get there

1154
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:29,558
taste and once they get their taste

1155
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:32,759
they're going to want to be drinking

1156
00:59:29,559 --> 00:59:35,480
like you know the gluttonous pigs that

1157
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:38,160
they are do you know that we used the

1158
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:41,199
money because look I studied economics

1159
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:45,639
and I studied economics because I wanted

1160
00:59:41,199 --> 00:59:50,279
a long time ago become a politician yeah

1161
00:59:45,639 --> 00:59:53,038
and I understood that we don't need we

1162
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:56,559
don't need uh we need everybody in the

1163
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:59,720
polit in the political uh area but but

1164
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:03,880
um we also need people who understand

1165
00:59:59,719 --> 01:00:07,598
economics laws Society everything yeah

1166
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:09,838
so and I said not that much people

1167
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:12,760
understand the economy and the economy

1168
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:14,599
is the most influential part for the

1169
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:18,359
politics

1170
01:00:14,599 --> 01:00:20,920
and it's by that I was saying all the

1171
01:00:18,358 --> 01:00:22,239
time we have to use the argument earning

1172
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:27,119
money for the

1173
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:28,798
government to our um benefit and there

1174
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:32,838
was a really important step in the

1175
01:00:28,798 --> 01:00:34,940
German legalized movement where the deaa

1176
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:36,078
the German hemp

1177
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:40,318
[Music]

1178
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:44,720
um group it it's a company but they make

1179
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:48,239
lobbying for cannabis yeah and

1180
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:52,879
they used

1181
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:56,519
money they raised to pay uh how can you

1182
01:00:52,880 --> 01:01:00,160
say that in English to pay um a

1183
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:04,119
consultant from the German government an

1184
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:06,519
expert in economics yeah who was already

1185
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:10,200
have been used the last years by the

1186
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:13,519
German government they raised money they

1187
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:15,439
went with this money to this expert who

1188
01:01:13,519 --> 01:01:20,159
is Consulting the German government and

1189
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:23,480
said to them please make a study how

1190
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:27,279
much money Germany would make when we

1191
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:29,920
legalized so this is a trick Why by

1192
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:32,000
using an expert the German government

1193
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:34,639
was using already by themselves for

1194
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,119
other topics they say okay he's an

1195
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:41,038
expert now because he comes with a new

1196
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:44,000
topic cannabis we can't uh tell um say

1197
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:48,240
no now you are not an expert anymore and

1198
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:50,719
he made a study that if we legalize I

1199
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:56,358
don't have the numbers in my mind at the

1200
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:59,959
moment that we will save like 4.5

1201
01:01:56,358 --> 01:02:05,880
billion a year with all the effects of

1202
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:09,480
tax um lowered um uh police work less

1203
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:12,680
work in the court less people in prison

1204
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:15,440
and all these effects and this was an

1205
01:02:12,679 --> 01:02:17,719
important thing also to show the people

1206
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:20,119
who maybe haven't been convinced by

1207
01:02:17,719 --> 01:02:22,879
social Improvement of Il

1208
01:02:20,119 --> 01:02:24,559
legalization by money Improvement for

1209
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:27,960
the

1210
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:30,519
government you the weapons from the

1211
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:32,440
government against them

1212
01:02:30,519 --> 01:02:34,880
yeah yeah I

1213
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:37,200
mean I'm pretty confident that that's

1214
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:40,000
the way it works in all countries that

1215
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:42,639
have it you know yeah the government

1216
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:45,079
makes money then they're interested if

1217
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:46,400
they're if they're not making money you

1218
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:49,240
know they're getting money from the

1219
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:51,680
alcohol lobbies here in the US you know

1220
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:54,399
I mean and

1221
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:58,440
pharmaceuticals so the the only reason

1222
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:01,278
why you know this this is allowed is and

1223
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:04,920
you know conservatives like money too

1224
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:08,278
yeah but I have to to

1225
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:09,838
highlight a few politicians the names

1226
01:03:08,278 --> 01:03:11,480
are Bart

1227
01:03:09,838 --> 01:03:15,480
binard

1228
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:18,519
um kmen veger and Durk Heiden

1229
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:20,400
blute this three politicians and also

1230
01:03:18,519 --> 01:03:21,880
there are more but this have been the

1231
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:25,358
visible

1232
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:26,880
politicians which did it really from

1233
01:03:25,358 --> 01:03:29,159
their

1234
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:32,838
from their bottom of their heart because

1235
01:03:29,159 --> 01:03:38,239
they understood that there are

1236
01:03:32,838 --> 01:03:39,719
people becoming criminals with no reason

1237
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:44,639
and there have been also some

1238
01:03:39,719 --> 01:03:47,639
politicians who fighted for our movement

1239
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:50,078
because they they they are no consumers

1240
01:03:47,639 --> 01:03:50,078
I think

1241
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:57,559
Oh I thought I switched it off I'm so

1242
01:03:54,719 --> 01:03:59,519
sorry no worries you have crickets yeah

1243
01:03:57,559 --> 01:04:03,839
these politicians really fighted for

1244
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:06,639
cannabis without the money in their mind

1245
01:04:03,838 --> 01:04:09,838
they did it because they believed that

1246
01:04:06,639 --> 01:04:12,879
we really have to reach the point of

1247
01:04:09,838 --> 01:04:12,880
harm reduction for

1248
01:04:13,719 --> 01:04:19,838
society I mean that's great and I I

1249
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:22,559
believe you know obviously they should

1250
01:04:19,838 --> 01:04:24,838
be more of those but it's just way

1251
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:27,798
easier to make the progress that we want

1252
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:31,199
to make when they have you know

1253
01:04:27,798 --> 01:04:35,679
government has the financial incentives

1254
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:37,358
you know yeah but unfort true it's uh

1255
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:39,838
this is something this is why I'm a

1256
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:44,038
little bit tired at the moment when you

1257
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:48,159
started to talk about the political and

1258
01:04:44,039 --> 01:04:49,880
legalization part I'm tired yeah and I

1259
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:51,879
have so much respect for people who are

1260
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:53,798
fighting since decades for this plan

1261
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:56,079
because I would say I'm fighting 10

1262
01:04:53,798 --> 01:04:59,679
years with

1263
01:04:56,079 --> 01:05:04,559
a a lot of investment of my energy and

1264
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:08,598
time and it's so drowning energy

1265
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:11,640
drowning and it's depressing to to to

1266
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:13,880
read all the time political stuff

1267
01:05:11,639 --> 01:05:19,159
because it makes something with your

1268
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:20,838
mind yeah um sometimes I I also prefer

1269
01:05:19,159 --> 01:05:23,118
not to know so much about the whole

1270
01:05:20,838 --> 01:05:26,278
thing I think some joints would be a

1271
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:28,240
little bit more relaxing and but yeah

1272
01:05:26,278 --> 01:05:31,960
sometimes they have to use cannabis to

1273
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:31,959
get through all this [ __ ] from

1274
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:38,358
politics but actually WIS I think it is

1275
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:41,000
very depending on the manipulation

1276
01:05:38,358 --> 01:05:43,960
aspect of politicians in this moments

1277
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:47,199
right now because you know uh as you

1278
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:49,838
said before it is very much impossible

1279
01:05:47,199 --> 01:05:52,399
to change the law back you know in a

1280
01:05:49,838 --> 01:05:55,000
fast way yeah that is impossible the

1281
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:56,200
next thing I would say is civil

1282
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,119
disobedience

1283
01:05:56,199 --> 01:06:01,879
that that will happen if this is going

1284
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:03,440
to be the case it will be much bigger

1285
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:06,200
problem for the government which they

1286
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:08,838
know they're just playing around with

1287
01:06:06,199 --> 01:06:11,598
with this is always politics does it all

1288
01:06:08,838 --> 01:06:13,679
the time they are like feeling time or

1289
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:16,960
filling time with manipulation all the

1290
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:21,759
time lying a lot and I think cannabis

1291
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:25,720
will the green wall will fall in Europe

1292
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:29,160
yeah um and this there are so many

1293
01:06:25,719 --> 01:06:32,078
connected effects also the states it's

1294
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:36,318
crazy I can remember when we had like

1295
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:38,798
two states in the in in the US yeah and

1296
01:06:36,318 --> 01:06:42,719
now you look on the map where have we

1297
01:06:38,798 --> 01:06:46,719
come where have we come today that it's

1298
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:48,719
nearly 5050 or a little bit more 52% of

1299
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:53,078
the states I don't know which is the

1300
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:56,519
situation now in America but and also in

1301
01:06:53,079 --> 01:06:58,400
Europe your home country is also

1302
01:06:56,519 --> 01:07:00,318
thinking about to change something you

1303
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:05,200
said okay you are waiting that something

1304
01:07:00,318 --> 01:07:06,798
happens but it's a it's such a

1305
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:10,639
small

1306
01:07:06,798 --> 01:07:14,559
development and changing the society and

1307
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:17,480
it's slowly step by step we never we

1308
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:21,039
never can start to run even if we want

1309
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:24,639
it's impossible it's really slowly steps

1310
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:26,079
then the grandma see that their nephew

1311
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:29,440
doesn't get

1312
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:32,318
Crazy by smoking a joint on the on the

1313
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:35,760
family party and then my parents the

1314
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:38,480
same at the beginning 25 years ago they

1315
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:40,680
thought I will ruin my life and they

1316
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:44,000
said to friends oh my son is smoking

1317
01:07:40,679 --> 01:07:47,480
weed and I am so afraid and today it's

1318
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:51,039
yeah my son is a successful family

1319
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:53,159
father working his ass off and yeah and

1320
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:56,079
he doesn't have a problem with cannabis

1321
01:07:53,159 --> 01:07:58,159
and it's working so it it's

1322
01:07:56,079 --> 01:08:01,240
went through the friend circle of my

1323
01:07:58,159 --> 01:08:03,519
parents and it changed here and there

1324
01:08:01,239 --> 01:08:06,479
opinions also from non-cannabis users

1325
01:08:03,519 --> 01:08:10,278
and this is what we need and slowly

1326
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:11,159
slowly I'm positive all the time also if

1327
01:08:10,278 --> 01:08:14,599
it's

1328
01:08:11,159 --> 01:08:17,198
hard my opinion also is that uh other uh

1329
01:08:14,599 --> 01:08:19,838
countries in Europe will follow German

1330
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:23,158
model you know they will this there is

1331
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:25,519
no way back uh and after that will

1332
01:08:23,158 --> 01:08:28,198
happen uh some years will take and

1333
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:30,279
Germany will see it and they cannot they

1334
01:08:28,198 --> 01:08:32,838
will have to Pro do the progress you

1335
01:08:30,279 --> 01:08:35,400
know and also the data will come out now

1336
01:08:32,838 --> 01:08:38,079
the data that CRI the criminality

1337
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:40,920
dropped that there is a lot how much

1338
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:43,119
money was was saved by not that the

1339
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:46,239
police does not do this rates anymore

1340
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:48,559
you know like this data will come now

1341
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:50,959
the politicians can lie on TV about it

1342
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:53,159
that it's not like that but when when

1343
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,600
when real experts will come out with

1344
01:08:53,158 --> 01:08:59,198
this data it will be over they cannot

1345
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:01,159
you know they will not lie more about it

1346
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:02,838
because they can't then you know but we

1347

1363
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:53,239

1364
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:53,239

1383
01:10:53,119 --> 01:10:58,920
craft do you know some people that are

1384

1392
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:18,600
innovation from the Germans in the

1393
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:21,119
upcoming years the same would

1394
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:24,679
have happened in all the other legal

1395
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:28,880
states in in the US but um the German

Germany with the Cannabis

1417
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:40,800

tourist it's a beautiful thing and yeah

1452
01:14:30,198 --> 01:14:36,399
one thing you didn't mention about um

1453
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:39,520
Barcelona is the people it's beautiful

1454
01:14:36,399 --> 01:14:42,920
so you know it's so warm yeah you know

1455
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:45,800
like I I love that place when I went to

1456
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:49,800
Barcelona I was like this might be the

1457
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:52,480
only city in the world that I could live

1458
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:55,320
in you know like I I don't live in the

1459
01:14:52,479 --> 01:14:59,479

1460
01:14:55,319 --> 01:15:02,399

1463
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:12,000

1464
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:16,079
biggest thing for me is the people there

1465

1475
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:51,599
June June is our biggest Expo in Berlin

1476
01:15:49,639 --> 01:15:54,279
if somebody wants to experience the

1477
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:58,719
German cannabis culture it's the best

1478
01:15:54,279 --> 01:16:00,880
moment to come to the Mary Jane so and

1479
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:04,800
go ahead Sasha I think you

1480
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:07,239
muted I wanted to ask you uh me as non-

1481
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:10,239
German if I come to Germany and smoke

1482
01:16:07,238 --> 01:16:13,678
weed is is it still I mean it's just for

1483
01:16:10,238 --> 01:16:16,119
Germans to have 25 GS with you or also

1484
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:18,840
me as a Slovenian hobit coming to your

1485
01:16:16,119 --> 01:16:20,760
place and having I mean that's you know

1486
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:23,840
it's it would be unconstitutional I

1487
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:26,920
think to not to just have Germans yeah

1488
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:29,480
no no you are legal as a human being

1489
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:32,920
yeah but the the thing is if you come to

1490
01:16:29,479 --> 01:16:36,759
Germany as a tourist and you have weed

1491
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:40,719
in your pocket and the police asks you

1492
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:43,119
where you got it from the best thing is

1493
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:45,840
yeah that that's the problem because

1494
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:48,119
they can say okay you are not living in

1495
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:51,159
Germany you haven't been growing it here

1496
01:16:48,119 --> 01:16:54,479
you are not allowed to be a club member

1497
01:16:51,158 --> 01:16:56,039
in Germany so you board it on the black

1498
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:58,519
market which is still

1499
01:16:56,039 --> 01:17:00,920
illegal but to be true nothing will

1500
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:03,840
happen uh

1501
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:08,639
so yeah you can

1502
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:11,600
smoke and if the police in the look in

1503
01:17:08,639 --> 01:17:16,960
in Berlin nothing will happen nothing in

1504
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:22,079
the in in the south in Munich maybe but

1505
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:25,520
it's more to to bully you because they

1506
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:27,399
don't will send something to your

1507
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:30,679
country's government that you have been

1508
01:17:27,399 --> 01:17:33,519
consuming cannabis there blah blah

1509
01:17:30,679 --> 01:17:35,600
blah so and one more thing I wanted to

1510
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:40,159
ask you that I've been contacted by a

1511
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:43,159
fair in Germany for for next year um if

1512
01:17:40,158 --> 01:17:45,679
I want to participate on the fair as a

1513
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:47,479
producer of you know as a cannabis shop

1514
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:51,560
and I said to them I'm a producer of

1515
01:17:47,479 --> 01:17:53,399
clones so how about this I I wanted to

1516
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:56,440
ask them if I can drive with like

1517
01:17:53,399 --> 01:18:00,479
thousand clones in my van to Germany

1518
01:17:56,439 --> 01:18:03,158
with with a PL pled passport that I have

1519
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:05,238
uh and they did not know me giving an

1520
01:18:03,158 --> 01:18:06,638
answer you know they they they it was

1521
01:18:05,238 --> 01:18:09,959
like tricky because if I go through

1522
01:18:06,639 --> 01:18:12,560
bararia you know with the van with with

1523
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:15,920
thousand clones in the back you know now

1524
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:18,480
we come again to the German stupid

1525
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:21,399
cannabis not we don't want to go too

1526
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:23,839
deep now no no just the

1527
01:18:21,399 --> 01:18:27,920
surface the definition of a cannabis

1528
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:30,679
plant is a

1529
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:32,639
plant with

1530
01:18:30,679 --> 01:18:38,480
pistols in

1531
01:18:32,639 --> 01:18:43,000
flower or with sex expression in flower

1532
01:18:38,479 --> 01:18:47,158
and we thought that a

1533
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:50,399
cutting or a clone is by this definition

1534
01:18:47,158 --> 01:18:52,158
not a cannabis plant just cannabis

1535
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:55,000
plants

1536
01:18:52,158 --> 01:18:59,719
are allowed in a circum way but not

1537
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:02,920
legal but seeds and cuttings should be

1538
01:18:59,719 --> 01:19:06,319
legal by the German new law the problem

1539
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:11,719
is in the moment you put the cutting

1540
01:19:06,319 --> 01:19:15,039
into soil even if it's just such a small

1541
01:19:11,719 --> 01:19:17,880
container we still thought that we could

1542
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:20,198
win the argument that it's not a

1543
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:22,079
cannabis plant because it's not

1544
01:19:20,198 --> 01:19:26,479
flowering and it's

1545
01:19:22,079 --> 01:19:29,719
small but the BS

1546
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:33,519
is that a lot of people got raided at

1547
01:19:29,719 --> 01:19:38,239
home and they had cuttings in small

1548
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:39,840
container and the the the court said

1549
01:19:38,238 --> 01:19:43,638
yeah it's a cannabis plant and now we

1550
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:46,079
are stucking in the fight with arguments

1551
01:19:43,639 --> 01:19:49,880
which the problem is we can't fight as a

1552
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:55,439
community on one point focusing our

1553
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:59,440
energy this fight is f um is f fight by

1554
01:19:55,439 --> 01:19:59,439
each individual which got in

1555
01:19:59,639 --> 01:20:08,319
problems it's so the to answer your

1556
01:20:03,399 --> 01:20:13,479
question to come to Germany with 3,000

1557
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:14,479
plants in small containers of soil would

1558
01:20:13,479 --> 01:20:18,879
be

1559
01:20:14,479 --> 01:20:18,879
illegal if you bring them in rock

1560
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:24,399
wool

1561
01:20:21,238 --> 01:20:26,279
maybe then the thing is if it's legal in

1562
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:29,559
your stay in your country where you're

1563
01:20:26,279 --> 01:20:31,840
coming from you don't have to expect any

1564
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:33,719
persecution even if you get something in

1565
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:37,159
Germany

1566
01:20:33,719 --> 01:20:40,560
so yeah it's the question if you go with

1567
01:20:37,158 --> 01:20:43,119
rock wool just

1568
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:45,719
rooted gray

1569
01:20:43,119 --> 01:20:48,158
area but they try to take it away from

1570
01:20:45,719 --> 01:20:50,399
us and and another question is which

1571
01:20:48,158 --> 01:20:53,519
where is following Li this how is it

1572
01:20:50,399 --> 01:20:57,960
possible that I as a non-german citizen

1573
01:20:53,520 --> 01:21:00,719
could sell clones in Germany but you as

1574
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:04,198
Germans cannot you know what I mean yeah

1575
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:06,960
because because when if I want to first

1576
01:21:04,198 --> 01:21:09,119
of all if the judge says also a small

1577
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:11,639
plant in the smallest possible container

1578
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:15,319
with soil is a plant we have a

1579
01:21:11,639 --> 01:21:18,920
problem and then is the other problem if

1580
01:21:15,319 --> 01:21:21,519
if if the judge says okay I get your

1581
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:23,880
argumentation that your plans are still

1582
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:26,840
in rock wo just rooted let's call it a

1583
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:30,400
cutting that's legal but where did you

1584
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:33,719
cut that from ah you have a mother plant

1585
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:37,439
yeah it's a old plant in a big pot it's

1586
01:21:33,719 --> 01:21:40,079
huge and even if oh I see preflower

1587
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:40,079
sorry it's

1588
01:21:41,238 --> 01:21:45,519
illegal but I thought you were allowed

1589
01:21:43,079 --> 01:21:49,479
to have a few I thought you were allowed

1590
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:52,639
to have three three but not four as a

1591
01:21:49,479 --> 01:21:55,839
private person at home not in your

1592
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:59,400
company facility for production and

1593
01:21:55,840 --> 01:22:01,719
economical purpose bro it's [ __ ]

1594
01:21:59,399 --> 01:22:04,559
Germany and it's ridiculous because

1595
01:22:01,719 --> 01:22:07,039
others other countries can sell clones

1596
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:09,520
to your country but you as German

1597
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:13,079
citizens are not allowed to do it I me

1598
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:15,239
that's it's in Europe we have a law if

1599
01:22:13,079 --> 01:22:17,600
something is legal in other countries of

1600
01:22:15,238 --> 01:22:20,799
Europe it should be legal to transport

1601
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:23,000
through whole Europe but with cannabis

1602
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,000
it's

1603
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:28,319
different what can I say

1604
01:22:25,319 --> 01:22:28,319
say

1605
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:35,279
prohibition yes Maria yeah and I don't

1606
01:22:32,279 --> 01:22:39,639
think we spoke about this what's the

1607
01:22:35,279 --> 01:22:42,519
penalties so like you know as far as if

1608
01:22:39,639 --> 01:22:45,039
you have more than that 50 some odd

1609
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:47,719
grams I think you said a little bit more

1610
01:22:45,039 --> 01:22:51,760
it's not a big deal but you know it

1611
01:22:47,719 --> 01:22:54,880
starts slow and it increases yeah

1612
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:56,760
um like you there are different type of

1613
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:59,279
penalties also for the clubs can get

1614
01:22:56,760 --> 01:23:04,199
penalties if they don't follow the rules

1615
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:07,238
and it's um I would say

1616
01:23:04,198 --> 01:23:10,919
if if you really stay between the 50 and

1617
01:23:07,238 --> 01:23:13,000
60 G it's

1618
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:17,639
more

1619
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:20,920
and when you are above 60

1620
01:23:17,639 --> 01:23:24,679
G the law still will

1621
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:29,359
try to [ __ ] you so

1622
01:23:24,679 --> 01:23:32,520
and there are Judges who got it and say

1623
01:23:29,359 --> 01:23:35,719
no I don't take the case yeah we let it

1624
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:38,920
fall it's fine but this is nothing you

1625
01:23:35,719 --> 01:23:41,039
can rely on so it's illegal still yeah

1626
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:43,600
so this is the situation we are living

1627
01:23:41,039 --> 01:23:46,319
in so the penalty is vague so for

1628
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:48,079
instance if you were growing five or six

1629
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:49,198
plants instead of the three plants that

1630
01:23:48,079 --> 01:23:51,519
you're

1631
01:23:49,198 --> 01:23:53,879
allow you don't really know what you'd

1632
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:55,679
be facing for penalties it depends on

1633
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:58,079
what judge you appear in front

1634
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:59,760
of maybe a

1635
01:23:58,079 --> 01:24:05,079
fine

1636
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:06,960
€700 something isn't that worth is yeah

1637
01:24:05,079 --> 01:24:12,639
isn't that worth

1638
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:14,399
it um no because they have they have a

1639
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:18,119
sneaky

1640
01:24:14,399 --> 01:24:20,879
way to fist

1641
01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:24,479
you in the moment you get in front of

1642
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:27,800
the court first of all they [ __ ] you

1643
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:31,678
they let you pay the fine but then they

1644
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:32,719
come from the back door with the [ __ ]

1645
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:34,760
driver

1646
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:37,399
license and they take your driver

1647
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:40,079
license away because they make a test

1648
01:24:37,399 --> 01:24:41,839
and then you have um more than the

1649
01:24:40,079 --> 01:24:43,559
allowed amount in your blood because

1650
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:46,600
it's the level is really low and then

1651
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:49,880
they say okay yeah just €700 everything

1652
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:53,159
is fine but um you a cannabis consumer

1653
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:56,560
ah yeah um we we think you are not

1654
01:24:53,158 --> 01:25:01,118
capable of differentiate between driving

1655
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:04,119
sober or driving high and yeah um prove

1656
01:25:01,118 --> 01:25:07,759
us that you are capable

1657
01:25:04,118 --> 01:25:10,238
of um separating that and that you are a

1658
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:12,960
responsible consumer and they take your

1659
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:14,599
license away and the whole process uh is

1660
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:19,760
not just the fact that you are not able

1661
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:23,280
to drive to work or to um drive your

1662
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:27,000
kids to sport or to make the grocer

1663
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:32,399
grocery then also it cost you

1664
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:36,479
between let's say three till sometimes 6

1665
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:37,799
7,000 to make tests to pay the lawyer

1666
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:39,479
all this

1667
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:42,560
BS

1668
01:25:39,479 --> 01:25:44,799
so yeah this is still the problem more

1669
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:47,320
it's more than the 700 bucks yeah it's

1670
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:49,800
more than the 7even it if if you don't

1671
01:25:47,319 --> 01:25:53,238
have a driving license it's just a just

1672
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:55,800
that alone but you can understand that

1673
01:25:53,238 --> 01:25:58,638
it's but in Germany you're allowed to go

1674
01:25:55,800 --> 01:26:01,679
to October Fest all weekend long and

1675
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:03,560
then Monday get on the autobound when

1676
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:07,239
when they when they stop you and you

1677
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:11,520
have 100 bottles of vodka in the

1678
01:26:07,238 --> 01:26:14,559
trunk they don't assume that you have a

1679
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:19,360
alcol problem if you don't smell you can

1680
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:21,719
say it's for the party I um I buy it for

1681
01:26:19,359 --> 01:26:26,839
the next three years and nobody will

1682
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:26,840
question that in the moment you oh

1683
01:26:29,118 --> 01:26:35,118
man yeah uh in the moment in the moment

1684
01:26:33,198 --> 01:26:38,000
you have a little bit too much

1685
01:26:35,118 --> 01:26:39,839
cannabis you are a criminal again and

1686
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:43,639
yeah by the way my wife is waiting for

1687
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:46,719
dinner this is now my wife called me oh

1688
01:26:43,639 --> 01:26:49,440
well we let you go to dinner hey yeah we

1689
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:52,319
could talk for hours and I hope we can

1690
01:26:49,439 --> 01:26:53,960
again I hope we can talk for hours again

1691
01:26:52,319 --> 01:26:56,519
definitely do it again and then talk a

1692
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:59,960
little bit more about genetics growing

1693
01:26:56,520 --> 01:27:03,440
smoking dabbing all this

1694
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:06,079
stuff what we love and this is the the

1695
01:27:03,439 --> 01:27:08,759
the reason why we do all and get all

1696
01:27:06,079 --> 01:27:11,840
through this pain of legalizing movement

1697
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:14,039
and everything else can you can you put

1698
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:16,079
me through one more like I just want to

1699
01:27:14,039 --> 01:27:18,760
go back and ask the one question and

1700
01:27:16,079 --> 01:27:21,760
then I'll let you go you never answered

1701
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:24,800
how much of your audience is from the

1702
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:27,440
US uh not

1703
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:28,440
um on YouTube not really that much maybe

1704
01:27:27,439 --> 01:27:31,799
you have

1705
01:27:28,439 --> 01:27:34,319
some some people living in the states

1706
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:37,279
they all in it's all in German all in

1707
01:27:34,319 --> 01:27:41,399
German look I took a decision seven

1708
01:27:37,279 --> 01:27:43,840
years ago when I started YouTube I

1709
01:27:41,399 --> 01:27:46,519
YouTube wasn't that what it is today but

1710
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:49,800
I asked the question ah on English the

1711
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:52,840
English Community has already so

1712
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:54,760
much and for sure it was okay if I do it

1713
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:59,159
in English which isn't perfect

1714
01:27:54,760 --> 01:28:03,320
by the way um I will compete with the

1715
01:27:59,158 --> 01:28:07,399
hall English creators and I will miss

1716
01:28:03,319 --> 01:28:12,319
out my local community so the decision

1717
01:28:07,399 --> 01:28:15,118
was quite fast set German lower reach

1718
01:28:12,319 --> 01:28:16,039
internationally definitely but serving

1719
01:28:15,118 --> 01:28:18,479
my

1720
01:28:16,039 --> 01:28:20,880
community and it was the best decision

1721
01:28:18,479 --> 01:28:24,118
of my life so definitely to make it in

1722
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:27,159
German yeah well I I won't argue with

1723
01:28:24,118 --> 01:28:29,079
the second half of what you said about

1724
01:28:27,158 --> 01:28:31,479
you know giving to your community doing

1725
01:28:29,079 --> 01:28:34,079
it for your community and

1726
01:28:31,479 --> 01:28:37,678
also the time that it would take to do

1727
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:41,198
it you know in other language I just

1728
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:43,480
feel that um I'm enjoying talking with

1729
01:28:41,198 --> 01:28:47,198
you and hearing what you have to say so

1730
01:28:43,479 --> 01:28:52,158
I think other people would too and the

1731
01:28:47,198 --> 01:28:54,638
reach is important not like for a you

1732
01:28:52,158 --> 01:28:58,000
know Financial response but

1733
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:59,520
just so earlier you said something and

1734
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:02,679
I'm going to end the show with this you

1735
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:04,920
said that there was one time that you

1736
01:29:02,679 --> 01:29:09,000
were an actual

1737
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:12,079
influencer and I'm going to say what I

1738
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:14,679
said the last time is that you inspired

1739
01:29:12,079 --> 01:29:17,679
people because when you influence

1740
01:29:14,679 --> 01:29:20,239
something that's just like a minor push

1741
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:22,520
it's temporary but when you inspire

1742
01:29:20,238 --> 01:29:24,759
people that's something that's

1743
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:29,239
longterm you know

1744
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:32,600
and you know I'm a podcaster in the US

1745
01:29:29,238 --> 01:29:35,678
would I see you as competition here no

1746
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:37,560
never I would see you as inspiring no

1747
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:42,560
okay and so and

1748
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:46,080
so personally want to see you do more in

1749
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:48,080
English Okay because I think you I think

1750
01:29:46,079 --> 01:29:51,158
it's important to you know you have a

1751
01:29:48,079 --> 01:29:54,039
valid perspective to give to people so

1752
01:29:51,158 --> 01:29:55,439
selfishly I'd like to see you dedic

1753
01:29:54,039 --> 01:29:58,238
dedicate a little bit more of your time

1754
01:29:55,439 --> 01:30:00,238
to English and if you want to be you

1755
01:29:58,238 --> 01:30:03,599
know if you wanted to be on our show

1756
01:30:00,238 --> 01:30:05,678
that would be great but you know I like

1757
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:07,960
I said I'm enjoying listening to you I

1758
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:10,760
appreciate you coming on I hope we can

1759
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:12,960
schedule it again real soon because I

1760
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:16,320
don't feel like we ever come close to

1761
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:18,800
finish you know it's like when you're

1762
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:22,238

childish passion which is burning all

1772

1776
