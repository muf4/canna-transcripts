00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,559
Hey, what's up everybody? This is Gabby

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,359
Staten Island coming to you from

4
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:26,640
beautiful California and I've got

5
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,199
another video that I want to make for

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,200
you.

7
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:35,679
Um, many of you may have seen

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:40,520
the short that I put on Instagram. I

9
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:45,039
made a hourong podcast about the whole

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:48,640
story. But before I get into it, I

11
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:51,839
wanted to make this video. So, I I made

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,480
the video about me and VA a couple of

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,840
weeks ago and didn't release it. Um, I

14
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,119
wanted to make sure that I got it all

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,320
right.

16
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:02,558
And like I said, the other day I made a

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,159
short video

18
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:10,640
um 15 seconds on Instagram which got a

19
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,880
pretty huge response and most of it was

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,478
positive. Positive in the sense of

21
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,839
people were glad that I was getting the

22
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:19,319
news out there. Um, obviously the topic

23
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,000
is kind of negative and people were

24
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:26,879
disappointed in VA skunk, but um, I did

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,560
get a small amount of people that said,

26
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,438
"Hey, you know, I don't know that

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,000
Instagram or YouTube is the place for

28
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:36,478
this." And people were saying that they

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,920
didn't know if I should do it on the

30
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,599
craft growers network because they felt

31
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,799
that I've been keeping it positive and

32
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:47,118
having good stories and that this would

33
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,680
bring it down. So I wanted to respond to

34
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:53,599
those couple of things prior to putting

35
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,479
out this video. So when I made this uh

36
00:01:53,599 --> 00:02:00,158
podcast channel, my goal was to tell my

37
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:04,000
story because people like Noto Dog, who

38
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:07,118
I love dearly, were quoting me or giving

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,840
my opinion and not doing it exactly as I

40
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:12,318
would have. And so I decided to make my

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,280
own podcast. I decided that I wanted to

42
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:18,399
tell my story and have a place where it

43
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,120
lived forever. And then of course this

44
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,640
grew beyond my wildest dreams where it's

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,520
become a place for many people to tell

46
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,679
their story. But like I said the

47
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,840
original goal was to have a place to

48
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,439
tell my

49
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,640
story.

50
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:35,199
And you know something that you guys

51
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,919
don't know is that I'm also recording

52
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:40,079
with my family. Something that I thought

53
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:44,000
would be really good to do would be to

54
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,080
have my dad and my grandma and my aunts

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,159
and uncles, you know,

56
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,400
record podcasts, which would be private,

57
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,318
where we talk about our family history,

58
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,879
and the whole idea would be to pass it

59
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,639
to future generations. For example, my

60
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,840
seven-year-old daughter never got a

61
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,919
chance to meet my mom, and we want her

62
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,200
to know about my mom. I can tell some

63
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:09,679
stories, but I also wanted my mom's mom

64
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:13,679
to tell some stories and her sister

65
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:17,200
about them growing up. And so I have I'm

66
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,519
lucky I have a 98-year-old grandma and I

67
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,359
asked her if she would do this with me

68
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,200
and she said yes. She got really

69
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,760
emotional about it and was crying. But

70
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:28,479
one of the things that she said was that

71
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:30,239
she didn't want to tell the whole story.

72
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:34,158
That she wanted to leave certain parts

73
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,599
out because they were sad stories. And

74
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:36,878
to be honest with you, I don't even know

75
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:38,479
what she's talking about. I don't know

76
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:41,280
anything about my great-grandparents on

77
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:43,199
my mom's side. Um I don't really know

78
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,280
much about my grandma's life when she

79
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:49,039
was growing up.

80
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,519
And I told her, I said, "Hey, you know,

81
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,079
you know, I understand that it's

82
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:56,879
difficult, but I reminded her that on my

83
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,680
dad's side, pretty much everyone was

84
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:02,000
wiped out in the Holocaust. Um, my

85
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,719
grandfather and his brother and my

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,280
grandmother and her sister were the only

87
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,680
ones from a very large family that were

88
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,318
able to escape the Holocaust."

89
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,639
And so what I told my grandma was, hey,

90
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:18,319
you know, the sad stories are important,

91
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:20,280
too. We can't just not tell the stories

92
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:24,000
about the Holocaust because it's sad,

93
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:27,478
right? And she agreed. And so we're

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,918
doing this together. And so in regards

95
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:35,599
to me telling my story, the stuff that's

96
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:40,159
not positive, it's the same thing, you

97
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,720
know, like I can sugarcoat my story or I

98
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,120
can tell my story accurately. And that's

99
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,800
what I want to do, okay? I want

100
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,439
to I want to tell my story. I want to

101
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,759
document it so that I can remember it

102
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:57,279
and so that anyone that's interested can

103
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:00,919
hear it. But I I can't just leave out

104
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:04,959
negative stuff or drama

105
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:07,758
because people think it brings down the

106
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:10,399
vibe. It just sucks. I I don't feel like

107
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:14,080
I can do that and be true to myself and

108
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:16,560
and that's what I want to do. And you

109
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,159
know, when I made this podcast, one

110
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,079
thing that I told myself, and I think it

111
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,919
was a little bit of a defensive move,

112
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:23,959
was I said, "I don't care if people like

113
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:28,560
it. I'm making this for

114
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:32,359
myself. And you know, my opinion is that

115
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,120
the podcast became like a runaway hit

116
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,360
and I've gotten pretty much nothing but

117
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,959
positive

118
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,560
feedback.

119
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:41,519
Um,

120
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,280
so, you know, now it's a little bit

121
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,439
different. I don't have that defensive

122
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,879
mode like, oh, if people don't like it,

123
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,600
you know, there's already so many people

124
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:52,399
that enjoy it and I don't want to do

125
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,320
anything to turn people off.

126
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:58,799
But like I said, I can't be true to

127
00:05:54,319 --> 00:06:03,360
myself and be true to my story if I

128
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,280
decide to leave the sad parts out. So,

129
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,199
you know, I decided I'm going to release

130
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,559
this

131
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:11,080
podcast. And, you know, if you guys

132
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,319
don't want to listen to the drama, don't

133
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:15,918
listen. Um, I hope you guys will respect

134
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,240
what I'm trying to do here. Something

135
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:20,478
that I've some of the feedback that I've

136
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,000
gotten from my podcast is that people

137
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:26,639
have told me that they feel that I'm

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
genuine and that they're getting to know

139
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,478
who I am.

140
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,759
And this is who I am. You know, if if

141
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:38,240
I'm not happy about something, if I'm,

142
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:42,800
you know, upset at somebody, those are

143
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:46,879
all real feelings. and how I react and

144
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,680
express this. This is who I am. So

145
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,478
that's what I want to do. I want to be

146
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:57,360
genuine. I want to be true to my

147
00:06:51,478 --> 00:07:00,240
story. And I I hope you guys will will

148
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,199
listen to it and not think that I'm

149
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,800
bringing down the channel or my show too

150
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:11,439
much because I kind of feel like it's

151
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:14,038
what I got to do. And It's unfortunate.

152
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:18,319
I've known Jason since

153
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:20,478
1993 and he means a lot to me still even

154
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,960
with all this. Um, you know, something

155
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:26,000
that I tell my kids, it's only people

156
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:28,318
that you care about that can hurt you,

157
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,120
right? So, if somebody was talking [ __ ]

158
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,560
if somebody wronged me and I don't care

159
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,439
about them, then it doesn't affect me.

160
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,519
But when you care about somebody the way

161
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:44,560
I do for VA skunk and they hurt you,

162
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,799
then it hurts much more. And and that's

163
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:51,519
just the reality. And so I'm going to

164
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,199
tell this story. I hope you guys um will

165
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,038
appreciate it for what it is. I made

166
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,038
this channel to tell my story and I

167
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,959
haven't had a chance to do it because

168
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:02,079
I've been so involved in interviewing

169
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,839
people like Jorge Cvantes and Kevin Jri

170
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,918
and you know all the great people that

171
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,318
we got to interview. But I am going to

172
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,399
try to put a little bit more effort into

173
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,240
telling my

174
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:14,318
story and um I'd like to say I'd

175
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,280
appreciate I appreciate all you guys for

176
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,680
all the support and I hope you'll

177
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:24,159
continue listening and supporting our

178
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,160
