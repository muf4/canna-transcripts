I'm doing really well it's a beautiful

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,359
sunny day here in uh Eastern

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:41,000
Canada and the snow is

13
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:44,039
melting nice yeah I'm out in uh Western

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,878
us and Oregon and it is a a dreary

15
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:49,359
Oregon day out there so okay I'm jealous

16
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:52,079
of the sun actually but it's probably a

17
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:54,159
little colder it is a little colder but

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,679
we do get a bit more sun in the winter

19
00:00:54,159 --> 00:01:00,398
time I think than you folks out there

20
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:02,320
just based on my experience in BC but oh

21
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,439
definitely yeah I mean if it's anything

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:09,799
like uh like Seattle then it's yeah

23
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:13,118
dreary and gray all the time yeah a fun

24
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:16,000
fun fact is when I turned 40 which was

25
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:19,920
uh almost seven years ago now my treat

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,719
to myself it was 2018 and California had

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,960
just become recreationally legal so I

28
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:29,400
went down there for 420 to San Francisco

29
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,478
with my jeep that I currently have now

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,280
rented pod through on the back drove up

31
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:35,599
to Victoria from Edmonton CU that's

32
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,439
where I was living and then down the

33
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:42,118
coast so Oregon became one of my

34
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:44,078
favorite places and I definitely want to

35
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:47,359
go back there because it was just like

36
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:52,359
driving down that um that Highway that

37
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:54,599
Coastal Highway through Oregon like man

38
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:57,039
gorgeous the driveth through Oregon is a

39
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:58,919
lot nicer in my opinion than the drive

40
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:01,960
through California on I think it's

41
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,599
Highway One or um I think it's sometimes

42
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:05,839
101 I'm yeah I get them confused but

43
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:08,799
that's why I didn't say it because I've

44
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,118
only been down it once I don't ask I've

45
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,599
lived here my whole life and I don't

46
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:15,400
know but it's um the the parts in

47
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,280
California can be kind of treacherous

48
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,280
along some of those

49
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,400
extremely like hairpin turn backs

50
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,439
through the like the the hilly mountain

51
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,680
side there it's it's like all sheer

52
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:28,280
Cliffs and stuff and I always get like a

53
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,400
almost like a panic attack driving

54
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,680
through there it's a that's a lot like

55
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,400
BC and you're right I it was a lot like

56
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,239
that like just uh we went through at

57
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,519
night to like those big

58
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:41,039
redwoods uh just like all of a sudden

59
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,239
you come up right up to one and you

60
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,359
could literally if you're not paying

61
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:49,120
attention go right into it which I'm

62
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,440
sure happens all the time but yeah yeah

63
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,879
all right so what's new in your grow

64
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:56,199
World um I know that uh for a while

65
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:57,639
there I I'm not sure if you're still

66
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:59,958
working with the same commercial

67
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:01,559
facility but um you kind of went went

68
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:05,560
from a home grower to a commercial

69
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,519
grower in somewhat rapid succession very

70
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,120
close to around the same time that I did

71
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,080
personally so it was really fascinating

72
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,360
to watch but um yeah what's new in your

73
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,519
grow world thank you uh for watching it

74
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,080
has it's been exciting um from what I

75
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:24,000
here to watch but also to experience so

76
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,680
um the quickest recap would be like pre

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
2018 I was a social worker working in

78
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,920
the city of Edmonton in Alberta which is

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,199
on the western side of Canada um kind of

80
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:37,119
hobby growing and like blasting into the

81
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:39,438
space um so much that I moved into

82
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,759
corporate Canabis so jumped around in

83
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:44,719
Alberta at a few spots and then was

84
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:47,679
transplanted out here for a really good

85
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:51,759
opportunity and did that thing for a few

86
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,439
years um it was like a crash course in

87
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:58,919
in corpor cannabis really like I was

88
00:03:54,438 --> 00:04:00,799
managing B2B um sales uh not just

89
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:04,158
domestically but

90
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:07,040
internationally um I helped basically

91
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:09,598
mold and bring that team from we were

92
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:12,959
just little weaklings to like all the

93
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:15,759
way up into all the best provinces in

94
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,759
Canada as far as recreational so BC and

95
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:21,959
Ontario with a craft grower designation

96
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:25,840
um I chose that pheno that was winning

97
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:28,240
Awards around Canada um The Daily grape

98
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:30,599
and um pretty much made the cultivation

99
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,319
Department what it is that day da grave

100
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,360
awesome so so much so that we had other

101
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,719
partners so is managing other micro

102
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,840
cultivation sites across Canada so as

103
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,680
far as BC so Western to Eastern allies

104
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:48,879
and then throughout Atlantic Canada so

105
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,199
when I moved out here I got to travel

106
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:54,279
everywhere in Atlantic Canada so it's

107
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,319
been a really cool experience um I did

108
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:58,839
resign from that position at the end of

109
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:00,439
last year because it was really burnt

110
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:02,879
out and that

111
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:06,879
um I just needed to recognize that I'm

112
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:10,038
an older lady going to be 47 soon um and

113
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:12,159
so I know and recognize those those um

114
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:15,879
signs and symptoms and I pushed through

115
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,639
it for a good year um and honestly like

116
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:21,000
built out that cultivation and post

117
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,840
Harvest Department it was very

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,439
successful a Grower's success really is

119
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,679
like when you can't grow enough of the

120
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:31,000
product that the people want right like

121
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,360
that's a problem in it myself um but

122
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,560
that was the biggest problem so at that

123
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,038
point

124
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,360
I down to the young man that I was

125
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:42,959
mentoring and he does amazing and and

126
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:46,840
it's it's awesome so that's kind of what

127
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:50,599
I what I'd like to do continually is

128
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:52,679
just find another spot where I can learn

129
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,560
things for myself so I had do have a

130
00:05:52,680 --> 00:06:00,038
specific list of things that I'd like to

131
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:02,000
experience in in at scale um and make a

132
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:05,038
little bit of money this time I haven't

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,199
done that yet I've been working strictly

134
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:11,680
for passion and honestly the

135
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,439
industries the best word I can use is

136
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,160
raped it out of me like my creativity

137
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:20,160
like you know like just a lot of things

138
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,240
where uh intellectual property just like

139
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,360
you really learn lessons as you come up

140
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,720
and in through any probably fast-paced

141
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,120
um Ever Changing industry with so many

142
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,680
transient people like the companies I

143
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,560
worked for don't even exist in Alberta

144
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:38,400
you know like so it's so and that was

145
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,160
only a few years ago so I mean it sounds

146
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,638
a lot like the restaurant industry yeah

147
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,400
a lot of people compare it to that for

148
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,038
sure I used to work um in hospitality

149
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:50,120
and restaurants in the city of Edmonton

150
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:53,000
which is a huge over million people city

151
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,439
um funny enough at Atlantic or east

152
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,598
coast bars and I'm I wasn't even from

153
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:00,879
the East Coast but now this this is me

154
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:04,680
um and yeah it is it's a lot like that

155
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:06,800
it's like money is the number one thing

156
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,639
and it's ever changing and over

157
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,520
regulated you know I was working in the

158
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,079
bar industry and serving industry when

159
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,959
the rules were still a little bit more

160
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,240
laxed and it was a little bit more fun

161
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,598
and there was culture to it and this and

162
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,879
that and then it started getting over

163
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:23,878
regulated and I dipped out and so coming

164
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:26,039
back into that corporate scene has been

165
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:29,879
a little bit trying at times but you

166
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:32,918
have to learn what you do is you learn

167
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,439
to work with that type of mindset and

168
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:38,120
those types of

169
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:41,279
people definitely yeah I um I was a chef

170
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:44,918
for like 10 years and worked on the west

171
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:47,399
coast and the east coast and it is uh I

172
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:49,799
feel like there's a lot of similarities

173
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:51,758
because there's a lot of passion within

174
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,879
the people that want to get into those

175
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,319
Industries um you know there's a lot of

176
00:07:53,879 --> 00:08:01,280
like glamour as well uh in the

177
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,280
restaurant industry bar industry

178
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:07,240
exactly like industry events like you

179
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,280
probably know that would get put out Red

180
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,680
Carpet

181
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:14,158
Events yeah yeah you're right yeah it

182
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,800
they're they're very glamorous and um I

183
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:19,079
feel like a lot of people think that you

184
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,280
know by working hard or working with the

185
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:26,079
right people that they're going to be

186
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:29,598
the next you know sensation or uh um

187
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:32,319
have some sort of like big payout for

188
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:35,639
from from just being raked over the

189
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,680
coals consistently for years but usually

190
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:40,679
I mean for the masses that those

191
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:42,918
accolades sorry for cutting you off but

192
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:45,039
if you this some real steaming about it

193
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:49,600
if you work towards those accolades for

194
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:52,000
example and win Top grower 2023 in

195
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,080
Canada people don't give a [ __ ] in

196
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,799
Canada they're either telling you you're

197
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,120
paying to play which I didn't cuz I'm

198
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:01,519
poor as F and so was the

199
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,639
company or or you don't deserve it right

200
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,839
so it's like well what do I need to show

201
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:09,958
you to prove that I deserve this award

202
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,600
you know it's not based on just growing

203
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:16,199
good weed it's based on like leadership

204
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,720
and other skills right so right maybe I

205
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,560
don't know if it's just cuz I'm a female

206
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,800
but these accolades just get pushed

207
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:24,239
aside you know I've won awards for my

208
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:27,958
strains and my feno hunting you know

209
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,959
Canada wide and in New Brunswick and in

210
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:32,679
Alberta when it was Elite legal I was

211
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:35,479
winning homeg grow Awards but people

212
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:37,679
just don't care you know so I don't

213
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,839
usually mention them except on podcast

214
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:43,599
to validate myself for sure well I think

215
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:47,120
it is important to bring up what you

216
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,600
what you were saying there is you know

217
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,200
accolades there's like so much more to

218
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,040
it at this point now where you have to

219
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,959
be like marketing yourself and and doing

220
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:00,679
it in a very specific way to follow

221
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:05,278
whatever people are like in out of that

222
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:07,159
but that kind of reduces the you know

223
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,958
like the essence of why you're doing it

224
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:12,399
in the first place almost to like to

225
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:14,278
meet these demands of the the consumer

226
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:18,039
and the public and it's not necessarily

227
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:20,360
sustainable for like a mental state or a

228
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:22,480
you know even just like doing what you

229
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,200
want to do or doing it because you have

230
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,519
like the passion for it or something

231
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:30,560
like that it's it can be muddied very

232
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,879
quickly that way and I yeah it's it's

233
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,559
hard

234
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:36,799
to you know if you're chasing Awards and

235
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:40,278
stuff it doesn't sorry it's hard to stay

236
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:42,479
authentic that's what I'm hearing um

237
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:44,078
because there's no payoff for it you

238
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,240
know that's what the people say they

239
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:51,439
want and I've provided it but there

240
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:55,600
hasn't been much reward whether

241
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,480
it's the reward is likes or engagement

242
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,079
or

243
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,839
um pay money would be nice you know like

244
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:04,799
it just hasn't been rewarding so you

245
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:07,839
scale back on that naturally as a

246
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:10,519
Creator because you want to get paid or

247
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,240
you want some sort of win-win I think

248
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:15,720
most people probably and so it's

249
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,959
happening really fast too where it's

250
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,639
like almost and I don't want to be

251
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:23,078
Associated as an influencer either right

252
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,159
like that's a Dangerous Ground too with

253
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:27,000
all these different documentaries coming

254
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:29,958
about not even cannabis related but you

255
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,278
know um sure like I I don't want to

256
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:36,319
influence other people I I'm just trying

257
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:39,278
to portray or show um authentic

258
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,360
um life you know just like these are the

259
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:44,120
struggles of trying to get through this

260
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,240
corporate

261
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,600
world right and this is what we do at at

262
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,560
the job that I'm at wherever that job is

263
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,120
so before this job I was dancing in

264
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:57,000
rooms with plants in a vertical spec you

265
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:01,200
know like um it I'm looking for the I

266
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,078
guess the next place to go dancing and I

267
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,839
um do I've started to get some interest

268
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:08,479
so I have been looking at um outdoor

269
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,560
opportunities and so relocation will

270
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,399
probably be in my near future in the

271
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:14,958
next couple years I've turned down a

272
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,120
couple things already that just don't

273
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,759
align and when you've been in the

274
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,320
industry even though it's only been six

275
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:24,879
years it's a small

276
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:27,519
short um I guess what am I trying to say

277
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,600
it's not a small industry but it's a

278
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,480
it's a baby still it hasn't been around

279
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,680
that long so the industry is still

280
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:38,000
really young that's the word I'm looking

281
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:42,719
for um but a lot has happened right and

282
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,600
so I I guess I I want to make sure that

283
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,759
yes I'm jumping back into corporate

284
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,159
cannabis but I want to make sure that

285
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:53,399
it's going to be something that I can

286
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:55,958
also put some passion into as well right

287
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:58,480
for sure absolutely I mean if that's I

288
00:12:55,958 --> 00:13:01,439
feel like everyone has their own sort of

289
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,920
drive for what they're Desiring in a in

290
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,959
a position if it's for um you know the

291
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:11,639
unfortunate capitalistic means that we

292
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:14,039
all are currently surviving off of um I

293
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:16,000
I think that if there's like part of it

294
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:18,519
where you know if if you love what you

295
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,639
do you won't work a day in your life is

296
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:23,198
what I've heard time and time again and

297
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:24,759
there is some truth to that but then

298
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:26,759
also you know like we've talked about

299
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:28,838
earlier there is a lot of potential for

300
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:31,399
people being taken advantage of if they

301
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:34,839
are are like highly passionate for a

302
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:37,000
position and will sometimes you know do

303
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:39,079
anything it takes to get into an

304
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,278
industry or a position because they feel

305
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:43,120
like they need to get their foot in the

306
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:44,838
doors so what you said there where

307
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,360
you're still you're turning down

308
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:48,000
positions because you want to make sure

309
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,800
it's the right fit a lot of people

310
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,039
should take note on that because that's

311
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:54,519
a very important thing to know your

312
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:56,198
worth as a grower yeah especially in an

313
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:58,240
industry that's going to take advantage

314
00:13:56,198 --> 00:13:59,559
of you if the possibility if the

315
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,799
opportunity AR

316
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:05,879
and so guarding yourself against that is

317
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:07,439
extremely important oh absolutely there

318
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:09,159
what I'm noticing the shift and it's

319
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,240
good for me the shift that's happening

320
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:13,360
in in corporate canis cannabis is good

321
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:17,079
for me they're starting to look for

322
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,159
leaders and managers and head Growers

323
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:21,278
that actually know how to manage teams

324
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:24,919
right and so that's been probably my

325
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:26,919
biggest success is that I had a

326
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:29,319
background previous to this industry

327
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:31,439
where I was managing you know sometimes

328
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,920
hundreds of thousands of case loads of

329
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,160
people right so managing is is something

330
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:39,399
that I'm really good at and so before

331
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:42,319
though there's so many loudmouth you

332
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:45,240
know men and women but mostly men that

333
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,440
were like promising the world to people

334
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,519
been growing for 30 years like yada yada

335
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,880
classic you know and didn't follow

336
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:54,839
through and haven't follow through like

337
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:57,078
the last place I was at I was coming in

338
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,160
like the sixth person after five men

339
00:14:57,078 --> 00:14:59,638
that just didn't want to get on the

340
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:02,159
floor with the plan

341
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,799
and 3 to four years later that's still

342
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,559
what CEOs are you coming to me for

343
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,599
seeing like Hey we're looking for that

344
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:11,599
manager that's wanting to get on the

345
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,120
floor with the plants and and manage the

346
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,519
people right like we that's what's wrong

347
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,799
with this industry I know you're an

348
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:22,278
American podcast but it might be similar

349
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:24,838
we we usually are following right behind

350
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:28,120
the trends there and the the culture in

351
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,440
in all these facilities is that it's

352
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,240
profit over people and so that's no

353
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:36,600
longer craft right as my mentor Kevin

354
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:40,120
JRE would say it's um Quality over

355
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,959
profit that's craft cannabis but um

356
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,919
that's what you're seeing and so people

357
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:46,838
if you go on indeed and see the reviews

358
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:49,159
for a lot of these places it's terrible

359
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:51,240
so they're taking note of that and they

360
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:53,318
need to switch that around so they need

361
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,639
more people and there's lots of leaders

362
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:58,318
like me and a lot of them are female

363
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:00,600
that know what to do have more empathy I

364
00:15:58,318 --> 00:16:02,919
guess can work with the young people

365
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,759
it's like a very young industry but it's

366
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:07,078
young people that are in it right like

367
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:11,039
I'm going to be like I said 47 but I'm

368
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:14,318
more rare like there's I'm working with

369
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:16,000
19 to 30y olds generally so it's a

370
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:19,000
different

371
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,559
generation yeah I um I completely agree

372
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,039
with that it is it's really interesting

373
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:28,919
to see an an emerging industry that has

374
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:33,120
this Legacy market and uh groups of leg

375
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:37,879
Legacy Growers who um you know like to

376
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:40,560
use the term Master grower or um expert

377
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:43,799
Gardener or you know some of these terms

378
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:45,758
that kind of are there to almost inflate

379
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:47,919
the ego rather than to provide an

380
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,440
explanation of what their capabilities

381
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:53,799
are and we're seeing that a lot of those

382
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,560
people that are trying to

383
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:59,198
maintain standards in this industry as

384
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:02,198
the price continues to drop as labor

385
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:05,000
prices continue to go up as the overhead

386
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:07,759
cost and the the cost per Goods you know

387
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,759
all everything is going in the wrong

388
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:14,119
direction for profits to go up right and

389
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:16,838
so yeah to have people who care about

390
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:18,438
the plant as well as make wanting to be

391
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:20,240
there to make sure that the people that

392
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:23,279
are taking care of the plant are also

393
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:28,599
taken care of is extremely important

394
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:30,678
because most Industries fail if the if

395
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:33,599
they don't take care of the workforce

396
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:36,880
especially when there is so much labor

397
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:39,399
required within agriculture in general

398
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,200
right and it's agriculture that's right

399
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,360
there what you said some of these places

400
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,880
are 100 acres how is that not

401
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:50,000
agriculture right and even in even in

402
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:54,720
small like Boutique uh farms for you

403
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,119
know Farmers Market uh style um Farms

404
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,720
where they're small enough to keep

405
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:02,038
things uh you know maybe they do one

406
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,640
style of crop or they only do a small

407
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:07,879
amount per year that's still fairly

408
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,440
craft and when you look at cannabis as

409
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:14,360
comparable to the agricultural Market in

410
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:20,038
general then you start to see that these

411
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:22,839
um these differences in scale do end up

412
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:24,879
prioritizing difference uh they they

413
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:26,879
prioritize things differently where you

414
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,400
can be small and you can prioritize the

415
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,600
workers because that means that the

416
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,360
workers are going to prioritize the

417
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:34,480
quality of the product because they feel

418
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:36,359
like they're being taken care of and you

419
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,159
know there's this reciprocity there

420
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:42,599
where as if you're in a very large you

421
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:44,760
know 100 Acre or you know giant

422
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:48,558
Greenhouse facility or or some of these

423
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:52,038
massive you know multi Light Room indoor

424
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:55,720
facilities and you have these um these

425
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:57,599
teams of workers that are trying to

426
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,960
accomplish all these different tasks but

427
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:02,759
are constantly being marginalized

428
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,600
because the you know the overhead keeps

429
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:07,720
going up like I was saying the price per

430
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:09,678
pound keeps dropping and all of a sudden

431
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,519
everyone wants a raise each year right

432
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,919
and so it's really hard to keep up with

433
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:17,519
that and so sometimes I've seen a lot of

434
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:19,480
places have the policy of like either up

435
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:23,558
or out right like you either need to

436
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:26,558
continue to rise up and provide a better

437
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:28,440
um like a better worker for the company

438
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:30,759
or you should go find work elsewhere

439
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,759
because because we need to hire new

440
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:36,480
people that are cheap enough to maintain

441
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:40,079
the just the amount of bodies that need

442
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,240
to be thrown at a task yeah um you know

443
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:45,279
like de leafing or transplanting a lot

444
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,159
of these things are fairly simple to

445
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:51,480
understand and to get really good at but

446
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:54,080
you can't have someone doing that who is

447
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,159
making a whole lot of of money I mean

448
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,960
you you can but that's where I feel like

449
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:02,000
you have like Craft Farms versus is

450
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,720
these massive facilities there's there's

451
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,960
just a different requirement into labor

452
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,038
and having someone with your

453
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,558
understanding of how you know humans

454
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:13,679
work right where you're going in there

455
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:16,599
to make sure that they feel heard and

456
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,880
understood and cared for and then also

457
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:22,038
understanding how the plants work

458
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:25,760
sometimes you can have that sort of

459
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:28,079
like uh per it's almost like a a

460
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:30,480
parental nature it feels like where you

461
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:31,839
have to be like like guiding but firm

462
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,839
you still have to make sure that the

463
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,798
stuff gets done right but you have to

464
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:38,199
make sure that they understand that

465
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:39,879
listen I know like we're all tired today

466
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,038
but we got to get through this right and

467
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,960
then you know tomorrow we'll have a more

468
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:47,279
chill day and we can go over some more

469
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:50,759
fun practices and learn some new things

470
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:53,918
um yeah right it's a balance and not

471
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:55,119
everybody has the patience I think for

472
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,000
that kind of

473
00:20:55,119 --> 00:21:00,879
balance

474
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,880
um and so that's fine that'll just bump

475
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,760
right that'll bump us right up to the

476
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,720
top we'll be floating right yeah I mean

477
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:10,519
it does remind me a lot of kitchens

478
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,440
that's the thing that if you if you have

479
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:15,278
a good reputation for doing certain

480
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,640
things then you're still going to be

481
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:21,159
relevant so like when I quit I've been

482
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:23,000
off for six 6 months and so when I left

483
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:25,600
I was like oh [ __ ] like I can't be off

484
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,839
for too long because I need to stay

485
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,278
relevant coming off of like a big win

486
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:33,678
and stuff

487
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:36,480
um so the last 6 months I have been

488
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:40,200
doing a lot of back to my roots homeg

489
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,360
growing so um still like having some

490
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,240
genetics that I've had for a long time

491
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:46,719
and just like really dialing them back

492
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,359
in and like maybe as you know you might

493
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,798
neglect your plants at home because

494
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:52,798
you're giving all your love and passion

495
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:55,240
to the plants at work and so um I

496
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:57,240
noticed that when I had the time off my

497
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:02,159
plants outside were just getting ready

498
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:04,839
to pop off was August the best the best

499
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,880
outdoor I've ever had was last year I

500
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:10,639
built a bunch of hugle bed boxes um I've

501
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,360
been doing that since I started you know

502
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,919
in the city I was growing in the city of

503
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:16,439
Edmonton when it was legal in the

504
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,880
backyard so just not that long really

505
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,600
since

506
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:25,559
2016 um but each year outdoor growing is

507
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:28,079
like fabulous out east fabulous out east

508
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:30,918
compared to sort of where it was before

509
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:33,480
so that was awesome but um even the tent

510
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:36,480
growing right like um I popped a few new

511
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:39,558
seeds and I have been trying to grow

512
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,960
sacred tobacco for offerings uh the last

513
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:45,639
6 months my partner in crime Katrina

514
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,960
Jackson we sort of developed a

515
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:51,200
Consulting business like we're not

516
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,640
incorporated or anything yet but um you

517
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,000
know it's hard to kind of delve into

518
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,799
Consulting and I I don't feel honestly

519
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
ready for it either like I have more

520
00:22:57,798 --> 00:23:01,558
experience gain and I'm ready to go get

521
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,839
that you know a few more years out in

522
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:06,918
the field but in the

523
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:09,278
meantime um Katrina's got a whole side

524
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:12,200
that complements my cultivation skills

525
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:14,119
and experience so she's doing um product

526
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,038
development and some of the products

527
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:19,519
she's developed for the Canadian Market

528
00:23:16,038 --> 00:23:22,038
have and are still top selling products

529
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:25,558
uh topicals 2.0 products stuff like that

530
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:28,558
so um we were working in some indigenous

531
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:29,720
communities out here in New Brunswick

532
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:36,079
trying

533
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:38,480
to um I guess get some Workforce going

534
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:41,000
on out in those communities so bringing

535
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,798
the youth back onto the reserves by

536
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,119
offering them like a cool place to work

537
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:47,679
like a weed facility right so um based

538
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:50,519
on the fact that there is some funding

539
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,600
money out there for indigenous

540
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:54,200
communities and things like harm

541
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:57,399
prevention or like what I just said

542
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:01,038
bringing the youth back um and so we

543
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:03,080
thought wouldn't it be a cool idea to um

544
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:04,759
help the community build their own

545
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:08,038
production facility so they can

546
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:10,440
manufacture their own sacred products um

547
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:13,720
for Sovereign ground or jump into the

548
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:16,720
legal industry really like um you know

549
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,960
this it's two separate ones out here so

550
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,120
it's awesome yeah so that that would be

551
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,400
something that I'd love to keep doing

552
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:26,199
unfortunately it's like relying on

553
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:30,159
government grants and funding and that's

554
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:33,080
just so um

555
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,760
not stable so right it's it's fairly

556
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:36,918
sporadic and when when the money does

557
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:39,640
come it's you almost have to be there at

558
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:42,759
the the front of the line snapping it up

559
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:45,000
as quick as you can exactly we uh we did

560
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:47,038
get lucky enough to sort of collaborate

561
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,759
with the doctor Dr Shelley Turner who's

562
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:51,839
like an addiction specialist physician

563
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:54,440
out here in Canada she's been working

564
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:57,558
with um people trying to get or has

565
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:00,960
successfully gotten people off opiate um

566
00:24:57,558 --> 00:25:04,440
therapies like Toxin and and things like

567
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:07,038
that to cannabis treatment so can

568
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,159
cannaboid therapy so we're we're still

569
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:11,839
going to work on that and try to pursue

570
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:14,480
that and that's why I'm bringing that up

571
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:15,879
um but at the same time you know it's

572
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,360
time to get back to work and get a real

573
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,320
job and like put that stuff to the side

574
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:23,319
for

575
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:25,720
now for sure well I I feel like we've

576
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:29,079
had a a really nice um sort of like

577
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,519
catch up to where uh you are right now

578
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:33,798
in terms of what you're looking to do

579
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:36,398
next and make some moves but um I do

580
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:38,960
like to find out sort of where the

581
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:42,839
passion started and where the interest

582
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,480
in Plants started and so um like all the

583
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:46,558
way back what were some of the first

584
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,640
experiences with plants that you had

585
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:51,599
whether it be cannabis or otherwise and

586
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:55,200
then if uh if it was Cannabis that was

587
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:57,959
kind of your first um interest in Plants

588
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,558
then how did that potentially evolve

589
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,399
into vegetable gardening or otherwise or

590
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,359
if it was perhaps some like vegetable

591
00:26:02,398 --> 00:26:07,038
gardening with Mom and Dad or grandma or

592
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:10,079
Grandpa and then if it went from there

593
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:13,440
um into cannabis let's hear the story

594
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:16,199
ooh yeah you nailed it it was my grandpa

595
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,120
so my

596
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,640
grandpa uh we used to spend like parts

597
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:23,479
of the summer with him and he had always

598
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,440
had this big Garden in the backyard and

599
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,558
so we were always uh my sister and I

600
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,960
were always helping him back there so

601
00:26:27,558 --> 00:26:34,158
just like early on really had a good

602
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,919
connection with with plants and um just

603
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,440
like a basic

604
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:43,080
understanding my dad was an avid

605
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,120
Gardener also growing up and um but I

606
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:47,079
was kind of too cool for gardening like

607
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:48,879
my dad was always trying to get me into

608
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:50,879
it but it was just like [ __ ] Garden's a

609
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,240
lot of work like it's weeding and you

610
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:57,080
know I wasn't grasping the connection

611
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:59,960
piece or you know anything like that um

612
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:02,398
and so I I really just like didn't do

613
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,640
anything until I I owned my own home in

614
00:27:02,398 --> 00:27:08,000
Edmonton I did the domestic thing for a

615
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,559
long time and so when I I own my own

616
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,359
home I was like I should have a garden

617
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:14,759
cuz that's just what people do like so

618
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:17,719
um I called it like hate gardening at

619
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:21,158
first because it was hard it was way

620
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:23,120
harder than I expected it to be um so I

621
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:25,360
actually had to like learn about the

622
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:27,599
vegetables that I was planting and learn

623
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:30,079
about what they shouldn't be next to and

624
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:32,798
you know just things like that and uh

625
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:34,359
once I started learning more about each

626
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,798
thing I really started getting into

627
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:38,918
trees and I had just had a lot of fruit

628
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:41,918
trees in my backyard for being in a city

629
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:43,840
so I was learning about pruning and um

630
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,200
probably did like 10 years of just sort

631
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:48,119
of practicing in the back and like every

632
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,798
year I'd grow new flowers cuz flowers

633
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:51,239
are hard to grow I don't know if

634
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:54,679
anyone's tried to grow like you know

635
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,000
flowers that you just get in the in the

636
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:59,480
uh Greenhouse place just like you grow

637
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,440
vegetables flowers longer to germinate

638
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,079
like I mean it depends but they can be

639
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:08,038
tougher

640
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:11,199
um and so I just looked at weed as

641
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:13,879
another flower it was just another

642
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:18,000
chemically um complicated flower but it

643
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:20,480
was still a flower um and I hadn't

644
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,200
really just decided to grow weed the

645
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,360
reason I started to grow weed was

646
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:29,679
because um I started to need it in

647
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:34,278
abundance I got really sick um um back

648
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:38,120
in like 2015 2016 and it ended up being

649
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:40,359
a kidus and like just some ulcer stuff

650
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:43,479
and I lost a lot of weight and I was

651
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:45,278
going through a lot at the time um I had

652
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:48,000
been sober from drugs and alcohol for

653
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:49,640
four years at that time 3 four years

654
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,079
like abstaining from everything I went

655
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,720
to treatment for cocaine and booze and

656
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:57,079
um my buddies were telling me to like

657
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,679
yeah smoke cannabis you know it's going

658
00:28:57,079 --> 00:29:01,678
to help you with your stomach and I was

659
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:05,159
just like no like back then like even

660
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:07,960
2016 I mention it to the my sponsor or

661
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:10,559
whatever and they're like whoa like no

662
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,640
way like that's crazy I had a

663
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:15,079
psychiatrist at the time because like I

664
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,559
was really well wrapped in treatment and

665
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:18,639
you know maintaining and doing really

666
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:21,319
well cuz it's hard to stay sober I'm

667
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,320
sure people know addictions everywhere

668
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:26,119
um but my psychiatrist who is really

669
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:30,000
helping me along with like uh I also

670
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:32,359
have ADD ADHD um so I was like you know

671
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,919
en enjoying to keep going with her but

672
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:41,079
she cut me right off when I um admitted

673
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:43,278
to admitted to um using cannabis to

674
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:45,119
treat my stomach problems but the thing

675
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:47,919
is is that the doctor the gastro people

676
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:51,439
were trying to give me like

677
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,480
um chemo meds and things like that and

678
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,519
things that I was more scared of getting

679
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,038
addicted to I guess and like they just

680
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:00,599
make you really Dopey and out of it um

681
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:02,480
so I was still just abstaining and then

682
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:05,558
I I believe it was Christmas time or I

683
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,440
know it was Christmas time and uh I was

684
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:09,678
just desperate and my buddy was like

685
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,480
here smoke this like enough's enough so

686
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:15,399
I did and um it changed my life forever

687
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,759
um that night even I felt a little bit

688
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:20,158
of hunger like appetite like to not have

689
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:24,079
an appetite and be chronically nauseous

690
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:28,799
for a year is I was suicidal like it was

691
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:30,798
terrible it was terrible so um

692
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:34,359
that was the start of when I started to

693
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:37,519
heal my body so I went into the system

694
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:40,158
um to try and get a legal

695
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:42,480
prescription um and that was really hard

696
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,840
to navigate as somebody who didn't

697
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,480
wasn't Legacy or didn't know anything

698
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:48,319
like I had a drug dealer of course but

699
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,278
it was like a nice guy that I trusted in

700
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:52,439
the social work Biz you know I did it on

701
00:30:50,278 --> 00:30:55,079
the side sure I didn't know any like

702
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,200
black market people

703
00:30:55,079 --> 00:31:02,359
um so

704
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:04,240
I did eventually get my 2 GS a day or

705
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:06,240
something like that and I remember

706
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,720
taking almost a year to convince this

707
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,919
freaking Doctor to let me grow my own

708
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:15,480
because it was costing so much money and

709
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:17,919
it was like yeah 2016 2017 at the time

710
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,798
um so it was pre- legalization here in

711
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:23,080
Canada but there's still a long medical

712
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:24,879
history here since the 9s and so I was

713
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:28,079
just trying to navigate sort of the end

714
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,440
of that and it was difficult at the time

715
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:31,960
I didn't know that the Cannabis Clinic

716
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,798
that I was attached to that I was

717
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,319
referred to from my doctor was actually

718
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:39,759
owned by

719
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:41,879
Aurora like as a consumer you don't know

720
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:44,720
that these clinics are owned by these

721
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,519
big huge corporations and so then

722
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,240
they're put they're pushing you in that

723
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,679
way to you can only buy these products

724
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,038
so at the time you have to get a

725
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,038
prescription for one one licensed

726
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:59,839
producer so you'd kind of go through the

727
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:02,599
roles of that So eventually I navigated

728
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:06,038
that system for about a year and um it

729
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:08,798
was so expensive like $700 a month just

730
00:32:06,038 --> 00:32:13,638
just to to get what I needed and at the

731
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:16,918
time I was infusing so fun fact is I

732
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:18,479
started educating the community on

733
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:22,159
YouTube

734
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,599
in maybe 2017 18 I'd have to look back

735
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:28,000
it's a long time they're embarrassing so

736
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:30,038
I barely go there but uh um infusing

737
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,038
that was my thing trial and error back

738
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:34,919
in 2016 which is only eight and a bit

739
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:37,158
years ago you couldn't get any

740
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:39,799
information from anybody's grandma or

741
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:41,799
anybody about how to get weed butter you

742
00:32:39,798 --> 00:32:44,158
had to figure it out yourself or know

743
00:32:41,798 --> 00:32:47,038
somebody that knew what they were doing

744
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,919
so I did the whole butter with water

745
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:51,398
with like oh I went through so many

746
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:53,720
gross things that I made my friends eat

747
00:32:51,398 --> 00:32:56,959
cuz it would get you high but it tasted

748
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:59,240
really bad or didn't get you high like

749
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,399
so that was sort of my Jam then and so I

750
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:05,079
was going through a lot of weed infusing

751
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:07,558
um I started like dwelling into the

752
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:09,480
unregulated market a little bit selling

753
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:12,720
my Edibles and my infusions cuz I did

754
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:15,200
eventually get really good at it and um

755
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,759
kind of dwelled into cvd because at the

756
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,600
time my dog um had been diagnosed with

757
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:23,879
epilepsy a really severe type of

758
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:26,398
epilepsy cluster cures and um someone

759
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,559
had recommend CBD CBD was so expensive

760
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:31,278
plus you didn't even know what you were

761
00:33:27,558 --> 00:33:35,359
buying back then um unregulated and so I

762
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:38,599
decided to grow it so um the very first

763
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:40,719
CBD that I ever grew was called Candida

764
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:45,519
um it was popular at the time it's a

765
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:47,759
very good uh CBD the highest CBD on it

766
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,599
was something like 190% and it was

767
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,839
considered a hemp variety because the

768
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:54,879
THC was under.

769
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:57,759
3% um I actually won an award with that

770
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,000
candida it was the highest CBD in the

771
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:02,798
homeg grower competition that I was

772
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,278
enrolled in at the time through Hempfest

773
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:07,720
but CBD is something that I still

774
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:09,960
continue to keep um I'm doing a

775
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,918
deadlights now which is subcool it's a

776
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:15,358
really awesome um strain of CBD as well

777
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:17,480
it's the closest thing I found since I

778
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:22,239
had the candida that I had that I lost a

779
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:24,000
long time ago but um yeah just uh I

780
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:27,519
guess just really getting

781
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,918
into pop popping off is the word I use

782
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:31,759
for for educating so whether that was

783
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:34,078
teaching people how to infuse I just

784
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:38,119
really want to give back I guess uh I

785
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:41,119
wanted to help what I found hard to find

786
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:43,039
for myself so um some of those videos

787
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,559
got you know some pretty good traction

788
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:47,838
at first I couldn't monetize on anything

789
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:49,878
now because like it's way it's like 10K

790
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:51,759
that's nothing now but also because I

791
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:53,398
was smoking weed so they're all age

792
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,679
restricted and

793
00:34:53,398 --> 00:35:00,319
like it's just old news the old days

794
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:02,519
right yep I mean we still will even put

795
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,760
like that our content that we make isn't

796
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:06,719
isn't made for kids because there's so

797
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,160
many different laws and you know

798
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:10,719
depending on if it's Canada where you

799
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:14,279
have to be 18 or the US where you have

800
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:17,639
to be 21 and there's you know there's

801
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:21,400
still a huge stigma so we just try to

802
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:24,440
protect ourselves as best we can um so

803
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:26,320
yeah that makes sense yeah yeah you you

804
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:30,079
brought up a lot of memories with uh

805
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,599
making Canabis butter and stuff I uh oh

806
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,320
yeah me and my partner would always make

807
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:37,039
it using a crock pot water and butter

808
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,800
and and the you know all the extra trim

809
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:43,599
or um we we use like a vaporizer so like

810
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,160
all the preved weed just goes right into

811
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,838
it yeah yep oh gosh like I have not

812
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:51,159
found one way that someone's mentioned

813
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:53,279
that I haven't tried to either decarb or

814
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:55,679
Infuse like I've done milk I've done

815
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,760
honey I've done like ke like I can put

816
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:02,199
ke in anything like and then it's good

817
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:04,119
it's good recipes because it wasn't

818
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:05,960
anything that I was told by that magic

819
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:07,559
butter machine or anything like that

820
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:11,079
just using them as an example they're a

821
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:14,199
great machine but um by trial and air so

822
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:19,000
just knowing and feeling what works best

823
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:23,118
for me really like I still have

824
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,559
unregulated clients that want my CBD oil

825
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,240
and my gummies because they are most

826
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:30,440
effective for them just based on

827
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:33,598
probably the way I Infuse it who

828
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,079
knows yeah I mean we I we make fudge

829
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,880
with the butter because you can just

830
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:39,480
stick fudge in the fridge and it lasts

831
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,400
forever and uh a good idea you know like

832
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,559
we're having like little tiny pieces

833
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,680
like

834
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:49,119
quarter quarter of an inch yeah uh

835
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:51,159
they're just so small and cuz it's it's

836
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,680
so potent but I don't you can't really

837
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:55,399
find that on the market everywhere has

838
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:58,719
like regulations on the

839
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,639
THC um like the gr of THC or the

840
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:02,519
milligrams of THC that can be in the

841
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:04,559
edible and it's like well you're making

842
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:06,440
me eat a whole bunch more sugar than I

843
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:08,838
want to to get the same results and

844
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:11,000
because of my colitis I have a sugar cap

845
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:15,440
like literally will send me into a

846
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,519
puking fit if I go above say like 18 gam

847
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,440
in one serving which is not hard to hit

848
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:22,159
cuz a pop has like 50 I could never have

849
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,039
a pop or I'd start vomiting so those

850
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:25,920
those Edibles are not for me like I

851
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:28,960
couldn't even have them the other thing

852
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,920
I don't like is a lot of regulated and

853
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,880
unregulated Edibles on the market are

854
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,358
distillate so I'm not a super big fan of

855
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:39,400
distillate it gives me a headache I

856
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:41,159
don't I like a full flower effect um so

857
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,240
it's harder to find so my stuff is

858
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:47,039
always just like it's the guts it's

859
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:49,239
everything you know for sure and also I

860
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,960
I like will always make the butter now

861
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:54,078
with stuff that's like been sitting for

862
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:57,519
a year or to so it's always you know

863
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,519
fully oxidized like extremely old

864
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:01,719
cannaboids that have mostly converted

865
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:04,440
into whatever their final form is going

866
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:06,598
to be already so I'll I'll decarb it

867
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,240
maybe a little bit but sometimes I just

868
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:11,079
will let the crockpot go for like 24

869
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:13,279
hours and I'm like yeah that's that's

870
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:16,119
enough heat to decarb it all the way

871
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,920
yeah for sure that's that's the kind of

872
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:21,280
that's how I make my death

873
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,480
brownies yes that I mean that's why F

874
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,200
such a small amount yeah it's not what I

875
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:29,599
want but it's happened before because

876
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:31,598
yeah that exactly the old stuff that's

877
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,960
been sitting there you don't even really

878
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:38,680
need to decarb it cuz it's already

879
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:41,880
oxidized and degraded into CBN and then

880
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:46,000
yeah it just hits you so good yep a

881
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:48,280
funny story like uh maybe like 10 or 15

882
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,480
years ago I I had done just that you

883
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,079
know used a bunch of old weed and made

884
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,719
butter and then I made um rainbow Rice

885
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:59,318
Krispie treats with it

886
00:38:55,719 --> 00:39:01,039
and I cut the squares into what I would

887
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:03,440
think people would want to eat for a

888
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:06,800
Rice Krispy treat not thinking about how

889
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:10,000
much THC and uh cannaboid were going to

890
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,000
be in there and I gave my dad one and he

891
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
ate it and got so high that he like

892
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,039
passed out on the couch and then crawled

893
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,280
to the bathroom because he had to throw

894
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:21,480
up it was just so intense of a of a high

895
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,160
and ever since then I've been like

896
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,440
extremely careful with my portioning cuz

897
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:28,920
I think that was when I was like you

898
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,159
know 17 or 18 and I was just like no you

899
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,599
can take it man just just eat the whole

900
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:36,118
thing you'll be fine I had one earlier I

901
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:39,039
I feel great yeah I know I know I've

902
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:44,079
death sentenced My Friends by accident

903
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:46,119
before yep oh that's funny though um so

904
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,760
with uh with some of your earlier grows

905
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:50,160
when you were just doing the homow thing

906
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,079
what were some of the methods that you

907
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:55,838
use what sort of style of growing were

908
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:59,519
you doing um I like to dabble a lot my

909
00:39:55,838 --> 00:40:03,199
main style would be quar and um sort of

910
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:04,800
any any of those pre-made bottles so

911
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:08,480
I've used Advanced

912
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,318
Nutrients um that's what I started with

913
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,000
there was Emerald

914
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:15,358
Harvest um just like all the fancy stuff

915
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,960
and then um I started buying just like

916
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:20,679
General hydroponic because I wanted to

917
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:24,519
learn like um at the time I was a big

918
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:29,000
fan and still am I don't follow much but

919
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:31,280
uh Dr Coco so I learned earned like by

920
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,119
watching his tutorials like even if you

921
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,160
go back into some of my old tutorials

922
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,119
they're like I love Dr cooko like how

923
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:40,559
embarrassing like shout out um I ended

924
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:43,039
up on a podcast with with all those guys

925
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:45,119
which is like something cool that you

926
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:47,480
know um I used to be on growing with my

927
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:50,480
fellow Growers I I was with the guys at

928
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:53,119
the beginning for a year I was with the

929
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,480
Shane and the guys so that's where I

930
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,880
think I first encountered you um was

931
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,719
with the growing with my fellow Growers

932
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,838
podcast cuz that was one of the those

933
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:02,159
are

934
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:05,559
my yeah you know it was one of those

935
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:07,199
podcasts that um I feel like I my

936
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:08,719
podcast also kind of Falls within the

937
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:10,879
same category of trying to be

938
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:13,118
educational where we're trying to like

939
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,960
not only allow people to tell stories

940
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,280
but to get information out there that

941
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,280
they feel would benefit the community uh

942
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,359
of both Growers and consumers alike

943
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,839
right yeah um and they were definitely

944
00:41:22,358 --> 00:41:26,400
some of the the earlier uh shows that

945
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:28,000
you could listen to and really pick up a

946
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,000
lot of great information

947
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,079
that you could then apply to your own um

948
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,119
either homeg growing situation or if you

949
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:35,280
were taking notes of all these different

950
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:37,318
things that you were learning and you

951
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,000
could cross reference it based on you

952
00:41:37,318 --> 00:41:42,759
know this panel of people that were

953
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,800
providing their insight into like

954
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,599
specific topics you know I think one of

955
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,839
the first ones I ever listened to was

956
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:52,960
their indoor versus outdoor um grow talk

957
00:41:50,838 --> 00:41:56,078
which to me was just such great

958
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:59,119
information to help um teach any new

959
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,880
grower about like life light cycles and

960
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,480
um substrate needs and requirements and

961
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:07,838
electrical needs and requirements and uh

962
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:10,800
if you are trying to remain um on the

963
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:14,119
cheap homow side of things then how you

964
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,720
can accomplish that without needing to

965
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:19,680
invest all this money into tents and

966
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:22,639
lights and nutrients and all the

967
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:24,879
expensive gizmos and gadgets right like

968
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:26,598
it was it was refreshing to hear that

969
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,720
cuz so many other places were like you

970
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:29,960
have to buy

971
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:33,399
air conditioner and you need to seal

972
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:39,720
your room and get Co2 yeah with all tape

973
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:42,079
and [ __ ] yeah and yeah to this day like

974
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:44,879
giant zip ties to hold up my fans in

975
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:48,000
there like things are ghetto at to make

976
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,480
it as cheap as possible but I learned so

977
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,039
much from those guys and I continue to

978
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:55,280
learn from those guys like they are some

979
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:57,400
of the top OG's like still [ __ ]

980
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,359
committed

981
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:02,760
and every single week you know like holy

982
00:43:00,358 --> 00:43:04,799
no matter what's going on in their lives

983
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:08,079
like especially shout out to like Jack

984
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:11,880
and um Russ and like the ones that are

985
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:13,760
there like every single week like wow

986
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:17,200
good J they both done an episode with me

987
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,800
and uh I've also sung their praise

988
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:22,000
because they um they've taught a lot of

989
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,680
people community yep I wish I could do

990
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
that for a living and make money like

991
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:27,960
that's what that's the dream right like

992
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,599
that's what I came out hopping to do was

993
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,480
like I have posts on LinkedIn that are

994
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,440
like [ __ ] government weed like let's hom

995
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,199
grow together and I'll teach you how

996
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,920
right but nobody wants to pay me so it's

997
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:42,879
like I got to go back into into the old

998
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:45,318
money bags but it's what the dream would

999
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,358
be right the passion is is aligned with

1000
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:50,199
the hom grower that is the heart of

1001
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:53,480
cannabis I will always say that so it's

1002
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:57,318
such a battle for me ethically to work

1003
00:43:53,480 --> 00:44:00,079
at scale and Export and live behind

1004
00:43:57,318 --> 00:44:03,440
these regulations and stand behind these

1005
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:04,640
companies and know that that's not the

1006
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,200
heart of

1007
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:10,039
cannabis right cuz the companies aren't

1008
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:12,279
smoking the the weed none of them nope

1009
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:14,759
none of them tell you they are they're

1010
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,280
not smoking weed you go you get that guy

1011
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:19,480
in a room and you smoke him under the

1012
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,839
table that's what you do they'll never

1013
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,440
let you put you doing that they're

1014
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:27,318
drinking alcohol and snort and cocaine

1015
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:29,838
it's very similar all over I'm sure

1016
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:31,318
yep I'm I'm lucky to be in a in a

1017
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:35,119
position with the company that I'm at

1018
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:37,719
where we are um you know I'm proud to uh

1019
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,640
consume the Cannabis that we produce

1020
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:42,679
because it is it's small it's a little

1021
00:44:39,639 --> 00:44:45,279
four room facility 12 lights per room

1022
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:47,719
couple of large veg spaces cuz we also

1023
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:51,000
do two acres of outdoor where we take a

1024
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:55,439
lot of good care on our outdoor plants

1025
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:58,159
and um use non-toxic and um you know

1026
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,920
regulated it uh Reg ulation approved

1027
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:02,239
sprays for Pest and pathogen prevention

1028
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,599
and then we turn it all into fresh

1029
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:07,358
frozen it all gets processed so it's

1030
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:11,079
nice and clean and it's some of the like

1031
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:13,199
the better DS and stuff on the market

1032
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:15,240
that I like to do that actually that's

1033
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:17,118
like you're leading me into the outdoor

1034
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:19,838
I have interviewed for a couple places

1035
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:25,838
that basically grow biomass in a good

1036
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:28,599
way for inputs or um to make uh yeah

1037
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:31,480
inputs yeah and we use a lot of General

1038
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:34,280
agricultural practices um because we do

1039
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:37,838
row cropping basically and it's it's

1040
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:40,920
very satisfying to be able to accomplish

1041
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:42,558
so much with such a small team because

1042
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,119
sometimes I feel like the outdoor places

1043
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:45,480
they think I need to just get a bunch of

1044
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:47,800
Labor to throw at this cuz I'm going to

1045
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:50,159
dry it all and trim it all up and sell

1046
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,960
this flower and I'm that's just not

1047
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:55,039
necessarily the move for outdoor

1048
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:57,760
cannabis right now um it I feel like

1049
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:59,880
concentrates and uh EXT TR s are the way

1050
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,319
to go I agree same with out here too

1051
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,400
there's outdoor Greenhouse there's the

1052
00:46:01,318 --> 00:46:04,800
green belt going on in Ontario there's

1053
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,318
some really good climates to grow even

1054
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,720
here in New Bruns look like I said if I

1055
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:10,358
had the money to get something started

1056
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:12,118
on this land there's 60 Acres here I

1057
00:46:10,358 --> 00:46:14,239
could grow

1058
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:19,680
um

1059
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:21,598
but it's tough um so with your um it so

1060
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:25,440
it sounds like you've mostly done

1061
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:29,160
salt-based uh growing to I it's totally

1062
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,599
fine Simply Organic or like solely

1063
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:33,960
organic basically the last like three

1064
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:36,960
and a half years so indoor and outdoor

1065
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,400
always outdoor has been organic um I've

1066
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,679
always been interested in learning about

1067
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,039
soil I mean I hang around with the guys

1068
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:45,919
that have taught me how to build my own

1069
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:47,679
soil um like I've always been interested

1070
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,200
in it but I never understood it like as

1071
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:52,358
a salt grower I was always trying to

1072
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:55,480
control everything and add everything up

1073
00:46:52,358 --> 00:46:57,639
by math and so itd be like you know like

1074
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,280
I just didn't understand how the plant

1075
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:02,039
was just picking up the nutrients when

1076
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,200
it wanted you know like or when it

1077
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:06,318
needed you just had to keep the you know

1078
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:08,679
the plant happy in the root Zone and how

1079
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:10,599
simple it is to do organic and so I just

1080
00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:13,118
really started diving into that more

1081
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:15,359
indoor um as I was able to at the

1082
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:17,599
facility that I was at plus doing it at

1083
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:19,318
home on a smaller scale in my tent so

1084
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:23,599
seeing the variation too some of the

1085
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:25,880
same genetics even um between salt

1086
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,960
indoor facility grown with like some of

1087
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,960
the best equipment and then also just in

1088
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:34,318
my tent right you can see like different

1089
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:36,679
variations but so organic is new um it's

1090
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:41,318
where I align

1091
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:44,759
now as far as the best quality cannabis

1092
00:47:41,318 --> 00:47:48,079
is organic living soil grown cannabis in

1093
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:51,160
my opinion based on doing my own

1094
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:53,920
experimenting with the same genetics in

1095
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:57,799
Organics in salts using different

1096
00:47:53,920 --> 00:48:01,159
fertilizers even organic

1097
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:05,839
synthetic fertilizers okay so there's

1098
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:07,199
those too um the best quality in my

1099
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:09,799
opinion is always going to be the living

1100
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:11,679
C and even more so like the hu culture

1101
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:13,839
stuff that I grow outside as long as

1102
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:15,239
it's a genetic that's for outside

1103
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:17,239
because it's been bred outside so

1104
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:20,439
something from California or even the

1105
00:48:17,239 --> 00:48:22,078
East Coast over here that is going to be

1106
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,440
the best

1107
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:27,318
cannabis for sure I've heard a lot of

1108
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:30,079
people um sort of say the same thing

1109
00:48:27,318 --> 00:48:32,119
and but I you know I I always like to

1110
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:36,200
ask though when was the last time that

1111
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:38,240
you took uh you know the same care for a

1112
00:48:36,199 --> 00:48:40,039
small number of plants and grew them

1113
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:41,799
with salts at home cuz it sounds like

1114
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:44,159
you've been doing Organics for like 3

1115
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:47,760
years now I was going to just say well

1116
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:50,078
right now so I switched back to salts uh

1117
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,640
at the end of this outdoor season I

1118
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:54,400
decided I I was unpracticed and so I

1119
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:56,159
wanted to get back into it so it's

1120
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,119
harder to find the inputs that I need

1121
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:00,639
just living rly where I live and so

1122
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:02,440
that's kind of been that I'll just you

1123
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:06,719
know make my own [ __ ] here cuz I can get

1124
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:08,920
it here but so um I I've always used can

1125
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:13,279
of Coco so I just stuck with my can of

1126
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:15,400
cocoa and then um I'm using like a local

1127
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:18,319
fertilizer company called rise nutrients

1128
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:20,240
and it's working really good but um just

1129
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:22,318
like what I'm trying to say is that

1130
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:24,719
these part A and Part B nutrient

1131
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:26,199
companies like I I'm using rise

1132
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:27,439
nutrients right now and it's working

1133
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:30,000
really well

1134
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:32,318
um previous to that I was using Remo

1135
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,719
nutrients and they work really well with

1136
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:37,679
the same can of cocoa I don't

1137
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:40,159
necessarily see different results I find

1138
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:43,598
them to be all very similar and I like

1139
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:46,679
ease of use so right that's going to

1140
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:48,880
always usually be my go-to I like rise

1141
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:52,159
because it's local and I can get it here

1142
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:54,240
Remo I can also get here but you know

1143
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:56,078
there's a chance it could it you know

1144
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:58,118
the shipment could not make it I could

1145
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:01,640
drive to the rise guys house probably be

1146
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:05,119
like hook me up you know yeah um so

1147
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:08,798
that's I'm kind of want to choose

1148
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:13,519
local yeah I can agree with that I um

1149
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:15,400
I've been a huge fan of uh Jr crop Tech

1150
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:16,759
okay uh for salt-based nutrients but I

1151
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,639
don't believe that they're available in

1152
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:21,160
Canada yet or they might have just

1153
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:23,719
recently um but it they have like one

1154
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:27,798
bag for flour one bag for veg and you

1155
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:29,598
can you know either use the salts um

1156
00:50:27,798 --> 00:50:31,318
directly into your Reservoir and mix

1157
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:35,160
them up or you can make a stock solution

1158
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:38,119
and dose them in um and they they don't

1159
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:41,078
sell their own calcium nitrate which is

1160
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:43,760
really nice because brand name calcium

1161
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:46,720
nitrate when it's under a hydroponic

1162
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,799
nutrients label is always more expensive

1163
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:52,558
but you can get really highgrade calcium

1164
00:50:48,798 --> 00:50:54,480
nitrate for extremely cheap so they they

1165
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:56,319
like promote that you do that which is

1166
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,519
really nice because it really reduces

1167
00:50:56,318 --> 00:51:01,719
the overall cost per gallon mixed even

1168
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:04,440
at high strengths like um at the

1169
00:51:01,719 --> 00:51:08,519
facility that I uh help manage right now

1170
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:11,240
we're running between 4.0 and 4.5 EC

1171
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:12,880
input which is you know it's it's really

1172
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:14,798
high and a lot of people get like whoa

1173
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:20,599
that's crazy and it's like well yeah but

1174
00:51:14,798 --> 00:51:22,559
we have really high ppfd CO2 yeah sorry

1175
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:24,039
I've worked at a place that also ran

1176
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:25,960
really high like that or like where it

1177
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:27,119
doesn't read it's like five plus or

1178
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,039
something like

1179
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:31,480
oh my gosh that's crazy um yeah I mean

1180
00:51:30,039 --> 00:51:33,920
we we try to keep it within there and

1181
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:36,639
then by using substrate monitoring we

1182
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,960
can detect that you know that the poor

1183
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:41,358
water EC is staying right around there

1184
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,720
which is really ideal for like a bulking

1185
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:46,480
phase and then you can raise it up

1186
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:49,399
really quickly for um a fin like a a

1187
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,400
ripening phase or a stretching phase you

1188
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:54,599
can get those generative and vegetative

1189
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:56,920
cues and uh you can kind of turn on a

1190
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:59,400
dime a lot quicker with that high EC

1191
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:01,680
yeah because it's easier to reduce and

1192
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:04,358
uh increase based on your substrate

1193
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:06,000
management but I've seen people also

1194
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:09,960
Crash and Burn really quickly when they

1195
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,440
don't have the correct monitoring um uh

1196
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,720
like the different like substrate meters

1197
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,838
and whatnot to be able to tell when

1198
00:52:13,719 --> 00:52:18,159
their plants are getting out of a safe

1199
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:20,558
range yeah that's what worries me right

1200
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:22,920
away in big facilities is just like they

1201
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:25,119
don't prepare as well for the dry out I

1202
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:28,318
guess like especially in Rockell and

1203
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:31,920
then you're using High EC like

1204
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:34,639
that yeah I I always suggest Coco cuz

1205
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,079
Rock will yeah if you get too dry then

1206
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:38,519
you're never going to really recover

1207
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:41,760
from that I've seen some things in some

1208
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:43,880
big facilities uh out out west or

1209
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,040
whatever I worked in a 500,000 ft

1210
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:49,798
facility so just pods upon pods upon

1211
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:52,199
pods just weed fields of weed inside and

1212
00:52:49,798 --> 00:52:54,838
walking into a room where the staff the

1213
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:57,318
day before forgot to like switch the

1214
00:52:54,838 --> 00:53:00,318
irrigation to on after transplant or

1215
00:52:57,318 --> 00:53:03,358
whatever and like the whole one side of

1216
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:05,759
the crop is just like laying on the

1217
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:09,039
ground basically but I've also seen it

1218
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:11,160
where they've quickly like burst the the

1219
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:12,960
juice in and it come back in two hours

1220
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:16,239
and they're like they're okay but

1221
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:20,639
they're like you know they're it's like

1222
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:22,598
amazing how resilient these plants are

1223
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:24,480
when you think a plant's dead some of

1224
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:27,440
watching some of those like what not

1225
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:29,639
toos has been like very beneficial and

1226
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:33,240
helpful for me to like be like okay so

1227
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:34,598
that's the extreme of that definitely

1228
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:36,479
yeah I feel like you learn a lot from

1229
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:38,720
the different failures that you witness

1230
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,519
and uh sometimes the successes go under

1231
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:42,000
the radar because things are just

1232
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:43,559
working as they should so you didn't

1233
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,798
necessarily catch that that one thing

1234
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:47,760
you did really helped set it off right

1235
00:53:46,798 --> 00:53:51,798
yeah

1236
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:56,119
um so uh throughout your Growing

1237
00:53:51,798 --> 00:53:58,039
Experience both um indoors at you know

1238
00:53:56,119 --> 00:53:59,720
with your your home grow outdoors with

1239
00:53:58,039 --> 00:54:02,358
your home grow at the different

1240
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:05,318
facilities that you've helped uh run

1241
00:54:02,358 --> 00:54:07,920
manage and work at what were some of the

1242
00:54:05,318 --> 00:54:10,318
successes that you found in your growing

1243
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,440
experiences there that helped you learn

1244
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:14,000
something and then on the flip side of

1245
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,599
that coin what are some of the failures

1246
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,280
that you witnessed that help you learn

1247
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,160
something kind of within the same vein

1248
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:23,359
of thought that we were just talking

1249
00:54:19,159 --> 00:54:27,000
about okay so

1250
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:29,318
um probably one of the most like kept me

1251
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,039
up at night but was the most exciting

1252
00:54:29,318 --> 00:54:36,480
and best learning experience was at the

1253
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:40,358
last facility I was at I came there to

1254
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:44,119
basically develop the the

1255
00:54:40,358 --> 00:54:47,199
um cultivation department and so first

1256
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:51,200
thing we started with was a pheno hunt

1257
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:54,159
and the reason I came out here part of

1258
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:57,358
it was that that genetic library that he

1259
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:59,118
had and so most of the genetics and I'm

1260
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:00,400
just choosing not to say the names of

1261
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:03,240
places that I

1262
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:06,838
work um so the genetics people can

1263
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:09,118
figure it out the genetics that were at

1264
00:55:06,838 --> 00:55:11,880
there 20,000

1265
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:15,079
seeds 500 different

1266
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:18,160
strains um and literal cuts too that

1267
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:21,240
were shipped over here like somehow some

1268
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:24,879
way all from Kevin jodrey California

1269
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:27,439
like huge genetic seed banks like just

1270
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,000
stuff that I was like holy [ __ ] like

1271
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,280
this guy doesn't even know what he has

1272
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,838
you know he probably does cuz he got

1273
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:39,480
most of them he went on a big thing

1274
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:42,400
anyways um so it's that was like 300

1275
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:45,240
over 300 seeds it was a small feno hunt

1276
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:47,720
when you talk about like what people do

1277
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:49,439
out at scale or whatever but like you

1278
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:52,279
know 30 seeds

1279
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:55,679
each 14 different

1280
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:57,000
strains um all researched by me and my

1281
00:55:55,679 --> 00:56:00,078
team

1282
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,318
picked out of 500 which is really hard

1283
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:06,318
when you have like it's an overwhelming

1284
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:07,798
amount of like research and okay guys

1285
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:09,079
like we're just at the table like what's

1286
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:10,838
on this one what's on this one like you

1287
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:12,440
got to figure out what your CEO wants

1288
00:56:10,838 --> 00:56:14,759
right so it's like not what I want but

1289
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:16,720
what he wants so he gives me this like I

1290
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:18,599
want fruits give me all the fruits right

1291
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:20,318
so that that's the first hunt so we're

1292
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:22,039
getting apples we're getting bananas

1293
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:23,440
we're getting grapes but you want

1294
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:25,880
there's all these different strains of

1295
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,679
all those different fruits so it was you

1296
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:32,240
know trying to narrow it

1297
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:33,558
down and so just from the very day one I

1298
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:36,759
was

1299
00:56:33,559 --> 00:56:40,160
never that was my first big task where I

1300
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:43,119
was responsible for that much genetic

1301
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:45,519
material like it kept me up at night

1302
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:47,280
like what if these seeds don't pop like

1303
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:50,038
I I've always been really good at it you

1304
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,839
know but I've never been able to do this

1305
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:53,200
cuz facilities out here aren't popping

1306
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:54,679
seeds like you're just going in you're

1307
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:56,879
working you're doing your 9 to5 and

1308
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:58,519
you're out right like so it was like

1309
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,680
unbelievably that he was trusting me

1310
00:56:58,519 --> 00:57:05,759
with this but um we did it we had a 98%

1311
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:08,480
success rate so that was

1312
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:10,440
exhilarating exhilarating cuz these

1313
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,079
seeds were all different ages like I

1314
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:14,240
didn't know some of them we didn't even

1315
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:17,960
have history on they were just like sure

1316
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:22,519
Ken J's Bank you know like

1317
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:23,760
cool um so yeah that that whole process

1318
00:57:22,519 --> 00:57:27,159
um from

1319
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:29,839
eliminating like so we we

1320
00:57:27,159 --> 00:57:31,159
like it was over 300 seeds that survived

1321
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:32,880
all these little seedlings I still have

1322
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:35,038
pictures it's the coolest thing to go in

1323
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:37,079
every day and be like you know they're

1324
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:39,119
all still alive and then you know

1325
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:41,359
getting them past that first transplant

1326
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:44,400
and then you start setting them in for

1327
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:47,239
DNA right that all that whole process is

1328
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:51,798
so cool so that was very successful that

1329
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:55,318
whole year just amazing and ended up

1330
00:57:51,798 --> 00:57:59,400
getting um really like 20 solid genetics

1331
00:57:55,318 --> 00:58:03,038
to add to his library and only they've

1332
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:05,039
used one really and that was the top one

1333
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:08,400
just for what was trending at that time

1334
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:11,200
and that was the grape because it right

1335
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:13,519
we picked that I picked that because all

1336
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:15,879
through the grow it was the only one

1337
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:18,400
that smelted like real grape so I knew

1338
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:21,079
it wasn't turfing and I knew it was

1339
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,960
different and then when it dried it

1340
00:58:21,079 --> 00:58:25,119
smelt like grape candy and then when you

1341
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,920
smoked it you got so high it was high

1342
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:30,000
THC so it was like a really it was easy

1343
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:34,159
to grow low Leaf like it was just

1344
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,400
obviously a good choice and so that was

1345
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:38,879
probably my biggest success so that that

1346
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:41,798
one Awards um there was the very first

1347
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:43,358
legal Cannabis Cup at 1/3 so for me

1348
00:58:41,798 --> 00:58:47,239
that's a success I don't need to win

1349
00:58:43,358 --> 00:58:49,798
first every time and then also in New

1350
00:58:47,239 --> 00:58:54,239
Brunswick um it

1351
00:58:49,798 --> 00:58:56,079
was runner up for top sativa I think

1352
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:58,000
last year or the year before they do a

1353
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:01,039
babis cup out here and so that was

1354
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,318
really cool just that genetic um first

1355
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:05,680
like a first time gal just you know no

1356
00:59:03,318 --> 00:59:08,038
30 years of genetic hunting or growing

1357
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:10,000
hair but you know having obviously Kevin

1358
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:12,400
at the time to help out here and there

1359
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,079
he's a busy guy so whenever I really

1360
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:18,720
truly needed it um but that was probably

1361
00:59:15,079 --> 00:59:21,000
the biggest success so the biggest

1362
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:25,318
failure before you get into the biggest

1363
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:27,159
failure um I I love the conversation of

1364
00:59:25,318 --> 00:59:30,199
pheno hunting because I feel like it's

1365
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:33,078
one of those things that are um it's

1366
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:36,118
like one of the last real sort of like

1367
00:59:33,079 --> 00:59:38,039
passionate um things that people can get

1368
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:40,960
into with cannabis is like breeding and

1369
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:43,240
pheno hunting because you can have such

1370
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:46,159
unique tastes that are very subjective

1371
00:59:43,239 --> 00:59:47,399
to yourself and if you're kind of

1372
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:50,519
following

1373
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:53,200
that you know call it passion or call it

1374
00:59:50,519 --> 00:59:54,920
whatever you want of I like this so I'm

1375
00:59:53,199 --> 00:59:58,399
going to follow it to try and find the

1376
00:59:54,920 --> 01:00:00,119
best iteration that I like um so many

1377
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:03,318
times you can find something that is

1378
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:05,720
just exceptional um but a lot of people

1379
01:00:03,318 --> 01:00:07,519
will do pheno hunting in different ways

1380
01:00:05,719 --> 01:00:09,759
and so I was curious what were some of

1381
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:11,759
the practices during your pheno hunt

1382
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:14,039
that you took that um other people might

1383
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,799
be able to learn from for sure I love

1384
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:17,799
talking about feto hunting and I don't

1385
01:00:15,798 --> 01:00:20,038
pretend to be a master or an expert at

1386
01:00:17,798 --> 01:00:22,798
it I most of my experience literally

1387
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:25,599
comes from my own homeg growing outdoor

1388
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:26,838
indoor um and then that that experience

1389
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:28,920
as well and just all the different

1390
01:00:26,838 --> 01:00:30,480
genetics that I've grown in the last six

1391
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:33,960
years to scale right so there's

1392
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:36,400
something to that but basically the the

1393
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:38,318
thing that is the most simple that made

1394
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,280
me understand it the most especially

1395
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:42,558
when you're doing it for someone else

1396
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:44,280
right so you kind of have to be good at

1397
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:47,640
it and like yeah I'm going to use my

1398
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:50,240
intuition and what I like as a very a

1399
01:00:47,639 --> 01:00:54,358
daily smoker right that's in this

1400
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:56,598
like I am a consumer too um but I'm am

1401
01:00:54,358 --> 01:00:58,920
like a I'm an elite

1402
01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:01,920
different like small make no like I

1403
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:04,920
don't buy weed from I'm not the consumer

1404
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:07,680
that they're after so you have to like

1405
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:10,559
um figure out what your project is first

1406
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:14,159
so this advice comes from Kevin so who

1407
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:17,640
is like a world renowned Breer breeder

1408
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:21,239
teacher feno Hunter Mentor he says that

1409
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:24,239
simple as like you feno hunt based on

1410
01:01:21,239 --> 01:01:25,919
whatever your goal is so you make a goal

1411
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:28,318
so whether that's your goal so that

1412
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,559
that's going to be for I'm going to uh

1413
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:33,400
be feno hunting for a medical strain for

1414
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:35,720
a effect or I'm going to be feno hunting

1415
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:37,358
because I want it to look visually great

1416
01:01:35,719 --> 01:01:40,959
or I'm going to be feno hunting because

1417
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:43,279
I want it to be 30% THC I'm feno hunting

1418
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:46,639
because I want all those things you know

1419
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:50,798
and I want it to smell like a fruit my

1420
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:53,278
boss so um yeah so it almost became

1421
01:01:50,798 --> 01:01:57,079
easier at that time I figured out my own

1422
01:01:53,278 --> 01:01:58,599
rating charts just based on um um the

1423
01:01:57,079 --> 01:02:02,240
directive that I was getting from

1424
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:04,559
different mentors so like all my mentors

1425
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:06,519
I was like asking and pulling

1426
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:09,880
information uh the guys I was just

1427
01:02:06,519 --> 01:02:12,960
speaking of um they let me stay in the

1428
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:14,480
group chat so even though I'm not on

1429
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,720
there every week with them I can still

1430
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,318
read and learn what they're popping in

1431
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:20,038
there or I've gone in there with

1432
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:21,719
questions stuff like that so based on

1433
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:24,799
all that knowledge and just like my own

1434
01:02:21,719 --> 01:02:27,199
research I created uh rating sheets

1435
01:02:24,798 --> 01:02:29,079
which I find is really help to to write

1436
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:31,598
things down as homeg Growers we don't do

1437
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:34,359
it enough I think or people just maybe

1438
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:38,400
don't think of it as as important as it

1439
01:02:34,358 --> 01:02:40,199
is and for me I always started with like

1440
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,119
journaling and writing it all down

1441
01:02:40,199 --> 01:02:43,960
because I was working on a forum so I

1442
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:45,640
was posting this stuff and then

1443
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:48,639
eventually it turned into notebooks that

1444
01:02:45,639 --> 01:02:50,278
were just like records of what I did so

1445
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:51,719
basically keeping records however that

1446
01:02:50,278 --> 01:02:54,000
looks for me it was a checklist like who

1447
01:02:51,719 --> 01:02:56,480
doesn't love a check like a checkboard

1448
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,480
where you're checklist is

1449
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:01,199
looking authoritative to the plants like

1450
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:03,440
hello yeah I'm the boss like I got the I

1451
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:04,919
got the clipboard today um but like

1452
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:08,119
based on what you're looking for right

1453
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:11,960
so visually you're looking through them

1454
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:13,838
all the way from seedling development to

1455
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:15,798
to flow which is the most important

1456
01:03:13,838 --> 01:03:18,038
obviously but you're looking for Vigor

1457
01:03:15,798 --> 01:03:19,358
so in Ved you're looking for Vigor

1458
01:03:18,039 --> 01:03:21,640
that's the main thing that you're

1459
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:24,318
looking for and you can you can see that

1460
01:03:21,639 --> 01:03:26,159
by how fast the plant's growing how how

1461
01:03:24,318 --> 01:03:28,119
dry it's getting more quickly how much

1462
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:29,759
more you have to upot it like that's

1463
01:03:28,119 --> 01:03:31,440
bigger when a plant's just like let's

1464
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,799
get going like I'm going to grow into a

1465
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,000
tree that's a good plant right there so

1466
01:03:33,798 --> 01:03:38,119
but you don't know if you have a male or

1467
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:40,278
female maybe so um it depends on what

1468
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:42,480
your project is again right so maybe you

1469
01:03:40,278 --> 01:03:44,519
are looking for a male cuz people are

1470
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:48,039
pheno hunting males I've done that here

1471
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:52,440
I have Royal cush pollen because I did a

1472
01:03:48,039 --> 01:03:54,278
male pheno hunt so um probably the

1473
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:57,119
biggest thing for people that they can

1474
01:03:54,278 --> 01:03:59,358
take home and use is record keeping and

1475
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:01,838
then following that along and not doing

1476
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:04,440
too much so you want to keep your plants

1477
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:06,920
as healthy as possible um you don't want

1478
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:09,960
to be Survivor hunting not in the first

1479
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:12,358
run you want you want to be looking for

1480
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:15,278
for fabulous and you can't look for

1481
01:04:12,358 --> 01:04:16,759
fabulous when they're on death's door

1482
01:04:15,278 --> 01:04:18,278
right or if you're like oh yeah I'm

1483
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:21,039
going to starve these things like no not

1484
01:04:18,278 --> 01:04:22,920
on the first run not on the first you

1485
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:25,000
know so I always tell people they need

1486
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:27,200
to create a baseline that they need to

1487
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,559
follow in all of their practices when

1488
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:31,519
pheno hunting and they can't baby any of

1489
01:04:29,559 --> 01:04:33,920
the plants they can't treat any of them

1490
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:35,519
special they have to just perform on

1491
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:37,680
their own and you have to choose them

1492
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:39,679
from that performance document it yep

1493
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:42,919
and document it and then you know one

1494
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:45,759
thing that I always like to ask because

1495
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:49,079
I have my own very specific practices

1496
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:51,520
for this but what do you like to flower

1497
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:53,599
out in a feno hunt do you like to flower

1498
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:56,079
out the seed plant like the plant that

1499
01:04:53,599 --> 01:05:00,519
was produced from the seedling or or do

1500
01:04:56,079 --> 01:05:02,039
you like to clone it and flower out the

1501
01:05:00,519 --> 01:05:05,278
Clone

1502
01:05:02,039 --> 01:05:07,119
both so again for me it would depend on

1503
01:05:05,278 --> 01:05:09,119
what I'm looking for if you're wanting

1504
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:13,519
something that is going to perform well

1505
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:16,640
in a facility then you can clone and see

1506
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:20,278
how it's going to go um and then just

1507
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:22,278
keep repeating it basically but I'd say

1508
01:05:20,278 --> 01:05:24,159
if you're looking for a unicorn and

1509
01:05:22,278 --> 01:05:27,838
you're you're able to

1510
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:31,078
really follow that seed right through

1511
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:32,960
the flower that's

1512
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:36,119
your

1513
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:38,960
mother like your first

1514
01:05:36,119 --> 01:05:40,720
mother sure so are you um when you do

1515
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,039
that when you flower out a seed plant

1516
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:45,519
are you usually taking cuting and saving

1517
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,880
the cuting as your mothers yeah so

1518
01:05:45,519 --> 01:05:49,318
that's the first mother that you're

1519
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:51,680
flowering out I guess and then her

1520
01:05:49,318 --> 01:05:55,719
babies are waiting in L to either be

1521
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:58,118
called or move on to the next um flower

1522
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:59,719
so you're getting to see I guess it's

1523
01:05:58,119 --> 01:06:02,240
valuable so what I'm saying is it's

1524
01:05:59,719 --> 01:06:06,719
valuable to see that seed product turn

1525
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:09,759
into a flower um in my experience that

1526
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:11,480
seed plant is a stronger that's the most

1527
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,559
vigorous the plant will be that's just

1528
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:15,679
how I've seen it it just like the stocks

1529
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:17,559
are huge like it's just like it's an

1530
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:20,118
amazing thing to see so I think if

1531
01:06:17,559 --> 01:06:22,559
anyone can do it uh most facilities

1532
01:06:20,119 --> 01:06:25,160
can't because they're it's a schedule

1533
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:26,480
you have you know four or five rooms

1534
01:06:25,159 --> 01:06:28,440
then one one of them is probably for

1535
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,920
moms and veg and so you're on a tight

1536
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:31,599
schedule and so a lot of times you're

1537
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:34,599
not even you're not going to be able to

1538
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:37,559
see any of those seed mom seed seed

1539
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:41,798
plants become the flower goddesses that

1540
01:06:37,559 --> 01:06:43,760
they deserve to be for sure I um it's

1541
01:06:41,798 --> 01:06:46,239
it's for that exact reason that I always

1542
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:48,599
suggest people uh flower out clones

1543
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:50,479
because sometimes when you have a seed

1544
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:53,278
plant right and you grow it out and it's

1545
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:55,639
super healthy super vigorous and you you

1546
01:06:53,278 --> 01:06:57,838
flower it out and you get this awesome

1547
01:06:55,639 --> 01:06:59,400
expression and structure and you saved

1548
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:01,599
the clone of it and then you go back and

1549
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:04,000
you flower that clone out you might be

1550
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:06,240
disappointed yeah sometimes the the

1551
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,679
Vigor changes sometimes the flower

1552
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:10,479
morphology especially will change and

1553
01:07:08,679 --> 01:07:13,118
I've noticed sometimes that the tpine

1554
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:15,199
profile will change from a seed plant to

1555
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:18,838
mother and it it could just be due

1556
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:21,598
to you know whether it be the tap rot or

1557
01:07:18,838 --> 01:07:24,960
um the the overall root structure and

1558
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:27,079
vigor of the plant y yeah but I I see

1559
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:28,760
the value it especially for hom Growers

1560
01:07:27,079 --> 01:07:31,039
because it might be the best iteration

1561
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:34,400
and if they just are going to be popping

1562
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:36,160
seeds every run then why not but

1563
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,318
definitely in like a commercial setting

1564
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:39,679
it it almost makes more sense to flower

1565
01:07:38,318 --> 01:07:42,719
out the Clone because yeah you want to

1566
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:44,519
make sure that's what you're act right

1567
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:47,959
right that's that's what your successive

1568
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:49,480
or yeah successive crops are going to be

1569
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:52,000
um how they're going to be best

1570
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:54,719
represented is is from the Clones yeah

1571
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,000
um if if your goal is a factory setting

1572
01:07:54,719 --> 01:07:59,399
and and sometimes even a small place is

1573
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,358
like you know everything is a certain

1574
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:03,119
way that's still sort of mini factory

1575
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:05,159
setting I don't know what else to call

1576
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:08,599
it but you got to make sure that they're

1577
01:08:05,159 --> 01:08:13,358
going to perform like their sisters like

1578
01:08:08,599 --> 01:08:15,720
it's all going to be very um

1579
01:08:13,358 --> 01:08:17,640
homogenized definitely and it it's

1580
01:08:15,719 --> 01:08:19,479
almost like for for people that are

1581
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:21,119
growing for medicine too it's one of the

1582
01:08:19,479 --> 01:08:22,798
reasons why I never suggest autof

1583
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:24,880
flowers for people that are growing

1584
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:27,039
specifically for medicine because if

1585
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:29,119
they find an Autoflower that produces

1586
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:31,278
this awesome cannaboid and turine

1587
01:08:29,119 --> 01:08:35,119
profile and they say oh this is the best

1588
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:37,719
medicine I've had well here's some tough

1589
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:40,039
news my friend it's going to be

1590
01:08:37,719 --> 01:08:44,000
extremely hard to find that again

1591
01:08:40,039 --> 01:08:45,519
because you can't clone the autoflow and

1592
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,960
unless you're working with a really

1593
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:49,920
refined company like misto genetics or

1594
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:52,239
something you're not going to be able to

1595
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:54,399
necessarily find the same phenotype

1596
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:57,198
within that same pack of seeds or even

1597
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:59,759
in 10 different pack of the same seeds

1598
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:01,960
and so that's where I always am telling

1599
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:04,719
people you know like run your clone

1600
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:06,759
because if that's the Unicorn for you

1601
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:09,439
then you know that you have it and that

1602
01:09:06,759 --> 01:09:11,600
you can reproduce it yeah it's a faster

1603
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:14,439
way to get to that goal too like that's

1604
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:17,400
what I'm hearing from you and that's why

1605
01:09:14,439 --> 01:09:19,919
they do it like that in in regulated

1606
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:21,798
cannabis or in facilities is because

1607
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:23,079
exactly you want to make sure that it's

1608
01:09:21,798 --> 01:09:26,560
going to perform and if you're using

1609
01:09:23,079 --> 01:09:28,119
your your like I have the same we I have

1610
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,640
some new stuff but I have the same stuff

1611
01:09:28,119 --> 01:09:32,399
that I know works for me for the last

1612
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:33,480
few years in there just keep doing its

1613
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:36,639
thing

1614
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:39,479
for you know

1615
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:42,359
and the point of getting that

1616
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:44,318
is the uniformity is what you want like

1617
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:46,838
the consistent medicine exactly what

1618
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:49,239
you're saying so even as a homeg grer if

1619
01:09:46,838 --> 01:09:51,479
you're medically minded you might want

1620
01:09:49,238 --> 01:09:53,639
you know this is my strain for daytime

1621
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:55,519
and this is my strain for night time and

1622
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:59,119
these are the two I like to mix together

1623
01:09:55,520 --> 01:10:03,880
and this is the one I make for oil so

1624
01:09:59,119 --> 01:10:05,399
right yes absolutely and um yeah there's

1625
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:08,239
there's so many different avenues that

1626
01:10:05,399 --> 01:10:10,799
we could go into in terms of maintaining

1627
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:14,599
that genetic stock right where people

1628
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:18,440
need to uh keep the Mothers Healthy keep

1629
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:20,440
them happy um they need to you know if

1630
01:10:18,439 --> 01:10:22,319
if they are keeping moms around for a

1631
01:10:20,439 --> 01:10:25,359
long time they need to know the risks

1632
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:27,679
that they're um possibly going to have

1633
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:30,039
have to face through that through you

1634
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:32,359
know different pressures building up

1635
01:10:30,039 --> 01:10:36,800
within the plants whether it be viral or

1636
01:10:32,359 --> 01:10:38,079
uh fungal or um pathogenic uh pests you

1637
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,880
know all these different things that

1638
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:43,079
keeping a plant around for a long time

1639
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:45,119
which was a very common practice in the

1640
01:10:43,079 --> 01:10:46,640
traditional Market Days of I need to

1641
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:48,279
keep this mom around because she's the

1642
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:51,840
one that produces the Clones that I like

1643
01:10:48,279 --> 01:10:54,679
to run versus successful successively

1644
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:57,520
cloning them at a regular uh interval to

1645
01:10:54,679 --> 01:10:59,880
make sure that you have fresh vigorous

1646
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:03,040
genetic material to make your production

1647
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:05,159
clones from and you know this is super

1648
01:11:03,039 --> 01:11:08,238
Rel relevant for hom Growers who are

1649
01:11:05,158 --> 01:11:10,238
growing for medicine as well as then you

1650
01:11:08,238 --> 01:11:12,599
know anybody that's wanting to take

1651
01:11:10,238 --> 01:11:14,559
those practices like you took your

1652
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:17,239
practices like I took my practices and

1653
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:18,719
translate that into a commercial space

1654
01:11:17,238 --> 01:11:21,959
learning some of these things is

1655
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:25,520
extremely crucial and um I've seen some

1656
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:27,319
definite like uh missteps where people

1657
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:30,280
will try to enter into the commercial

1658
01:11:27,319 --> 01:11:33,479
space and take their you know I baby

1659
01:11:30,279 --> 01:11:36,198
this one or two plants and make them my

1660
01:11:33,479 --> 01:11:38,519
everything for this 3 or 4 months that

1661
01:11:36,198 --> 01:11:40,759
I'm growing them and then go into a

1662
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:42,239
facility and get really disappointed by

1663
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:44,480
the fact that they can't baby every

1664
01:11:42,238 --> 01:11:45,519
single plant because they're responsible

1665
01:11:44,479 --> 01:11:48,319
for

1666
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:49,960
hundreds I know it's a real shock as a

1667
01:11:48,319 --> 01:11:52,599
person that's been

1668
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:55,840
there it it was a huge shock for me as

1669
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:57,960
well I just uh even the first yeah even

1670
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:00,800
the first facility I worked at

1671
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:02,520
everything was handw watered and uh and

1672
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,239
I was like oh this is nice you get to

1673
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:06,080
spend time with with each plant and then

1674
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:08,718
I look back and I'm like how how did we

1675
01:12:06,079 --> 01:12:10,719
even afford that sort of labor for the

1676
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:12,960
amount of product we were producing it's

1677
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:15,198
ridiculous irrigation has been the one

1678
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:18,079
thing that's trended in all my positions

1679
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:19,519
like I was an irrigation lead actually

1680
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:24,439
at this one

1681
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:27,239
spot who I was hired on to help get the

1682
01:12:24,439 --> 01:12:30,039
automation going it was a vertical

1683
01:12:27,238 --> 01:12:34,079
grow

1684
01:12:30,039 --> 01:12:35,560
um and we were hand watering okay so I

1685
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:38,600
trying to remember how many plants are

1686
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:43,920
in there three tiers dude three tiers uh

1687
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:46,719
so we were using a um zoom

1688
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:49,079
boom to water the plants with buckets

1689
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:50,920
and ladders and there was one time where

1690
01:12:49,079 --> 01:12:53,119
I was in the mother room and I swear to

1691
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:56,440
God I wish I had this footage but I was

1692
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:59,158
on this rickety old ladder with my 5

1693
01:12:56,439 --> 01:13:00,559
gallon bucket dragging it up to the

1694
01:12:59,158 --> 01:13:01,799
second level they didn't even have a

1695
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:06,080
hose and a

1696
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:08,320
pump not that no no because of the weird

1697
01:13:06,079 --> 01:13:11,279
concoctions of things that were going on

1698
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:12,439
I won't even get into that but up on a

1699
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:16,359
big

1700
01:13:12,439 --> 01:13:20,279
ladder with my uh lab Beaker plastic

1701
01:13:16,359 --> 01:13:24,238
Beaker like watering these three gallon

1702
01:13:20,279 --> 01:13:26,679
375 milliliters in each one five times

1703
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:28,599
yes no human there I'm sure right and

1704
01:13:26,679 --> 01:13:31,199
then you got to go log it all but

1705
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:33,360
anyways that's not even my story I fell

1706
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:37,960
off the ladder everything went down and

1707
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:42,559
I was like hanging from the second

1708
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:45,239
year we handw watered like 900 plant

1709
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:49,600
rooms like three tier 900 plant rooms

1710
01:13:45,238 --> 01:13:52,238
like that for six months every day and I

1711
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:54,639
wonder that's brutal how did I do that

1712
01:13:52,238 --> 01:13:57,238
yeah yeah that was crazy it just made me

1713
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:59,000
think of it I must have blocked it out

1714
01:13:57,238 --> 01:14:00,839
but it's like a fun experience when I

1715
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,079
think of actually like setting up the

1716
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:06,679
automation we were using nlex and it was

1717
01:14:03,079 --> 01:14:09,439
my first time it was during Co and so

1718
01:14:06,679 --> 01:14:11,840
they got the nlex machine into the

1719
01:14:09,439 --> 01:14:14,079
facility but because of Co they couldn't

1720
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:16,239
send out uh it was because it's from

1721
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:18,960
Texas so there was nobody coming over

1722
01:14:16,238 --> 01:14:20,678
from America at that time so they

1723
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,560
couldn't bring out any textt to like

1724
01:14:20,679 --> 01:14:24,399
train the staff on it and that had all

1725
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:26,600
sort of happened before I got hired so

1726
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:29,399
we got hired and they're like here's

1727
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:31,679
this kid he'll teach you stuff and then

1728
01:14:29,399 --> 01:14:35,879
set this up you know so there was lots

1729
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:38,480
of experiences where you send the water

1730
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:40,279
out and it goes up and you're like oh my

1731
01:14:38,479 --> 01:14:42,158
God I hope that went into the right room

1732
01:14:40,279 --> 01:14:44,599
and then you're running down the hallway

1733
01:14:42,158 --> 01:14:47,119
to the facility and people are yelling

1734
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:50,480
cuz it's like oh my God the water's

1735
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:52,639
paring into the storage and there's star

1736
01:14:50,479 --> 01:14:56,238
like it was like so many crazy

1737
01:14:52,639 --> 01:15:01,480
irrigation experiences uh that's crazy

1738
01:14:56,238 --> 01:15:05,198
floods floods floods like 500 like how

1739
01:15:01,479 --> 01:15:08,559
these were 2,000 gallon tanks for

1740
01:15:05,198 --> 01:15:11,000
R and we how does it how is it not

1741
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:13,120
automated to shut off when it hits the

1742
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:16,639
top you know like

1743
01:15:13,119 --> 01:15:20,559
you later and go back and be like [ __ ]

1744
01:15:16,639 --> 01:15:23,119
and the whole place would be like so

1745
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:25,960
flooded that's crazy boys did that with

1746
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:28,800
acid once like for

1747
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:32,719
um um

1748
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:36,480
phosphorus acid it like exploded out of

1749
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:40,000
the nlex machine and the whole place was

1750
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:43,039
flooded with acid like 8 months later

1751
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:46,560
still cleaning up like pieces from the

1752
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:50,119
ground that were like chewed away yeah

1753
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:52,719
crazy [ __ ] man crazy that's crazy the

1754
01:15:50,119 --> 01:15:55,519
the nlex is the um like the fertigation

1755
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:57,760
skid right where it has a few different

1756
01:15:55,520 --> 01:16:00,000
input channels that you can put the

1757
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:02,280
different like acid or the your

1758
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,158
different mpks and whatnot into it and

1759
01:16:02,279 --> 01:16:08,399
then send it out we we use one of those

1760
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:11,799
for our field irrigation okay um and the

1761
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:13,879
craziest part to me is that the software

1762
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:17,679
that the thing runs off of is from like

1763
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:19,840
the late 90s oh my God it's similar then

1764
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:22,079
yeah I I bet you looks like an old

1765
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:25,560
computer when you're on there it's like

1766
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:28,119
the yep and and you have to like the the

1767
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:30,159
screen is like that green with like

1768
01:16:28,119 --> 01:16:31,840
black block letters probably have

1769
01:16:30,158 --> 01:16:34,519
pictures on here if I can find some I'll

1770
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:37,279
send them to you yep I I use the same

1771
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:40,600
machine every summer and it works great

1772
01:16:37,279 --> 01:16:44,439
when it's correctly functioning yeah

1773
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:46,719
like but it took us a while like my boss

1774
01:16:44,439 --> 01:16:48,279
had you know a manual this thick that he

1775
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:50,158
read through to make sure that he

1776
01:16:48,279 --> 01:16:52,719
understood it and then only taught me

1777
01:16:50,158 --> 01:16:55,279
the things that I needed to know and

1778
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:57,039
like distilled it down to okay these are

1779
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:59,920
the only functions you ever have to mess

1780
01:16:57,039 --> 01:17:02,158
with cuz there's so much back it was

1781
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:03,359
overwhelming you get the little piece in

1782
01:17:02,158 --> 01:17:05,799
there that you

1783
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:08,639
need y easy and I remember it for the

1784
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:10,480
summer and then like right now cuz we're

1785
01:17:08,639 --> 01:17:12,359
going to get ramping back up to get our

1786
01:17:10,479 --> 01:17:15,198
crop going for the summer I'm thinking

1787
01:17:12,359 --> 01:17:16,479
about it and I'm like oh I don't I would

1788
01:17:15,198 --> 01:17:19,559
have to go and stand in front of the

1789
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:21,399
machine again for an hour or two just

1790
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:23,719
back and forth oh yeah the memories came

1791
01:17:21,399 --> 01:17:25,759
right back to me for sure yeah I always

1792
01:17:23,719 --> 01:17:28,359
wondered why is this machine seems so

1793
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:30,960
old but it's like new technology so

1794
01:17:28,359 --> 01:17:32,759
strange it is it is really strange and

1795
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:36,198
it's because it's been used for so long

1796
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:38,800
and in Greenhouse uh irrigation and

1797
01:17:36,198 --> 01:17:40,960
applications um where you know and the

1798
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:42,960
thing with it is is you need electricity

1799
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:44,760
to run it and that's why I always

1800
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,679
suggest people if they are setting up

1801
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:49,199
like a commercial facility or even like

1802
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:51,158
a an advanced home grow where they have

1803
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:52,799
you know a few lights in a in a room

1804
01:17:51,158 --> 01:17:55,039
built out that they could just go with

1805
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:58,119
something simple like a dosatron where

1806
01:17:55,039 --> 01:18:00,000
it's all hydraulic and it all just doses

1807
01:17:58,119 --> 01:18:02,559
your system through the water pressure

1808
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,279
itself so you can just if you have clean

1809
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:07,560
water on your main yeah then you can run

1810
01:18:05,279 --> 01:18:09,238
it from your main and you don't you

1811
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:11,920
won't ever lose water pressure unless

1812
01:18:09,238 --> 01:18:13,959
the entire like District you live in

1813
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:16,199
loses water pressure and if that happens

1814
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:19,039
you have a whole bunch more stuff to

1815
01:18:16,198 --> 01:18:19,039
worry about than your

1816
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:24,440
grow yeah there's been some crazy

1817
01:18:22,679 --> 01:18:26,960
learning curves out here for weather

1818
01:18:24,439 --> 01:18:29,759
[ __ ] like hurricanes throwing [ __ ] down

1819
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:31,399
so for sure or freezes as well I'm sure

1820
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,520
because you probably have to keep your

1821
01:18:31,399 --> 01:18:35,119
lines like your your fill lines if

1822
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,960
anything's running Outdoors you got to

1823
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:42,399
keep them wrapped in some sort of

1824
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:45,760
heating cord or um have a we we we've

1825
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:47,519
had some like crazy uh ice storms out

1826
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:52,199
here in Oregon where we had to set up

1827
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:54,520
like a a a drip um setting in our

1828
01:18:52,198 --> 01:18:57,799
different irrigation systems where we

1829
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:59,840
would have it burst little amounts of uh

1830
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:01,920
water through the system every couple

1831
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:04,000
minutes it won't freeze very small

1832
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:07,920
amounts yeah and just stuff like that

1833
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,960
that you start to learn the uh you know

1834
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:11,639
how the facility operates based on all

1835
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:14,158
these other things and you start to

1836
01:19:11,639 --> 01:19:16,199
become that like Universal key where

1837
01:19:14,158 --> 01:19:18,839
you're I can fix that really quick or I

1838
01:19:16,198 --> 01:19:21,919
know how to do this um but it does come

1839
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:23,400
with time and with a lot of uh failures

1840
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:24,600
right because you don't know that your

1841
01:19:23,399 --> 01:19:28,158
lines are going to freeze until one of

1842
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:31,400
them explodes on you totally

1843
01:19:28,158 --> 01:19:33,479
yeah um so you know we kind of got a

1844
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:35,359
little bit off track there but I think

1845
01:19:33,479 --> 01:19:37,479
it was great you know with the feno

1846
01:19:35,359 --> 01:19:39,759
hunting and irrigation stuff that's a

1847
01:19:37,479 --> 01:19:41,559
lot of stuff that people should know is

1848
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:44,840
you know it takes a lot to figure out

1849
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:47,120
and to experience-based for sure I'm not

1850
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:49,600
a learning by the book like that manual

1851
01:19:47,119 --> 01:19:51,319
did nothing for me it was scary because

1852
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:54,079
I didn't have someone visually showing

1853
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:57,119
me how to do it so right it's a

1854
01:19:54,079 --> 01:19:59,719
different Lear um with with that being

1855
01:19:57,119 --> 01:20:01,158
you know we were at uh where your

1856
01:19:59,719 --> 01:20:03,600
successes were and then we were going to

1857
01:20:01,158 --> 01:20:06,158
go into what one of uh your setbacks

1858
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:09,159
were that you learned a lot from so go

1859
01:20:06,158 --> 01:20:13,479
ahead and uh share that story yeah so

1860
01:20:09,158 --> 01:20:15,439
probably my big my first big setback or

1861
01:20:13,479 --> 01:20:19,519
um where I was

1862
01:20:15,439 --> 01:20:22,559
disappointed was also in the first year

1863
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:23,920
of the place when I came out here um it

1864
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,320
was the first spot where I was like

1865
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:29,359
fully in charge

1866
01:20:25,319 --> 01:20:33,439
and so any crop failures would be me um

1867
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:37,599
facing the consequences and so we had

1868
01:20:33,439 --> 01:20:40,359
some challenging in input issues and and

1869
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:43,880
like I had alluded to earlier um it was

1870
01:20:40,359 --> 01:20:46,000
a big shock to come from western Canada

1871
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:48,719
to Eastern Canada east coast

1872
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,679
specifically where um the biggest city

1873
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:52,359
from me is an hour and a half away and

1874
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:54,880
it's not even that big of a City

1875
01:20:52,359 --> 01:20:56,198
compared to what I'm used to um and just

1876
01:20:54,880 --> 01:21:01,719
not being able to get the things that I

1877
01:20:56,198 --> 01:21:03,039
need especially at a a scale size so um

1878
01:21:01,719 --> 01:21:05,198
was working with different soil

1879
01:21:03,039 --> 01:21:08,319
companies cuz it was a living soil it

1880
01:21:05,198 --> 01:21:10,960
was aquaponics as well and so trying to

1881
01:21:08,319 --> 01:21:13,119
find a living soil that's also going to

1882
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:16,000
be complemented by our fish

1883
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:18,519
poop um and so the

1884
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:22,439
first or second I can't remember it was

1885
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:25,280
the first or second um flower grow where

1886
01:21:22,439 --> 01:21:28,119
it was like um monocrop it was dosy cake

1887
01:21:25,279 --> 01:21:31,119
we were growing um and the

1888
01:21:28,119 --> 01:21:32,158
soil the soil that we were using ended

1889
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:35,119
up

1890
01:21:32,158 --> 01:21:37,519
being um like the batch that they had

1891
01:21:35,119 --> 01:21:39,119
made was extra hot so the plants were

1892
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:41,360
just getting fried they were getting

1893
01:21:39,119 --> 01:21:43,359
ammonia burned and like so it was like

1894
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:45,920
hard to watch I called it brown Town cuz

1895
01:21:43,359 --> 01:21:48,759
it was like a section of the the crop

1896
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:51,399
that was just turning brown and we had

1897
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:54,199
to to get rid of some of those plants

1898
01:21:51,399 --> 01:21:57,158
early it didn't all die but um it wasn't

1899
01:21:54,198 --> 01:21:59,119
it wasn't a good crop and compared to

1900
01:21:57,158 --> 01:22:02,079
what I'm used to Growing or what we had

1901
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:04,158
grown right so that was a big learning

1902
01:22:02,079 --> 01:22:06,519
curve and you just got to take your

1903
01:22:04,158 --> 01:22:09,359
dumps with your successes right like

1904
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:11,840
it's not all going to be roses and and

1905
01:22:09,359 --> 01:22:14,839
sunshine and sometimes it is going to be

1906
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:16,760
disappointing and you know at that point

1907
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:20,319
we were just trying to do our best to

1908
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:23,520
like get the crop to the finish line and

1909
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:25,880
um the other thing because from that

1910
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:29,639
crop we didn't use most of it honestly

1911
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:33,039
most of it went to garbage but that the

1912
01:22:29,639 --> 01:22:36,440
other big fail that I could think of was

1913
01:22:33,039 --> 01:22:38,600
um managing the grow where I have full

1914
01:22:36,439 --> 01:22:43,359
control because I'm there every single

1915
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:45,600
day versus managing the same strain at a

1916
01:22:43,359 --> 01:22:47,158
different facility that's two provinces

1917
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:49,199
away and they're not listening to me or

1918
01:22:47,158 --> 01:22:50,799
updating me or keeping in touch or you

1919
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:52,759
know like it's just like hard to work

1920
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:56,279
with this man who just won't work with

1921
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:58,400
me um and so we had just gotten into BC

1922
01:22:56,279 --> 01:23:00,198
here which is hard to get into for all

1923
01:22:58,399 --> 01:23:02,839
the way from the East Coast this little

1924
01:23:00,198 --> 01:23:04,678
but I had sent the buyers uh the Dosey

1925
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:05,840
cake and I had sent them like the weed

1926
01:23:04,679 --> 01:23:07,319
and they were just like yeah this is

1927
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:11,159
fire we want

1928
01:23:07,319 --> 01:23:15,000
it so when the batch went over there it

1929
01:23:11,158 --> 01:23:18,559
was um mixed with a crop that was like

1930
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:20,319
it was our crop and another crop um so

1931
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:23,400
the quality was different and like maybe

1932
01:23:20,319 --> 01:23:24,960
not to to everybody it looked very

1933
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:27,359
similar like my boss would look at it

1934
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:29,480
and go it's exactly the same but to

1935
01:23:27,359 --> 01:23:31,679
somebody like me or you we'd be like no

1936
01:23:29,479 --> 01:23:33,718
like I don't want to sell this mid but

1937
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:35,880
I'll sell this good quality like some

1938
01:23:33,719 --> 01:23:38,239
people can see the difference smell it

1939
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:40,359
whatever so that's what went out I had

1940
01:23:38,238 --> 01:23:41,638
to literally face to face that buyer

1941
01:23:40,359 --> 01:23:45,079
because he's like I went out and bought

1942
01:23:41,639 --> 01:23:50,039
a doy cake and he's like it was not what

1943
01:23:45,079 --> 01:23:52,119
you sent me so that was hard to talk to

1944
01:23:50,039 --> 01:23:53,679
you know like to just like be the grower

1945
01:23:52,119 --> 01:23:56,198
and be responsible but not throw people

1946
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:58,880
under the bus cuz it's not that cuz I

1947
01:23:56,198 --> 01:24:02,759
did I let it go out right like it was in

1948
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:04,359
my control or I thought it was um and so

1949
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:07,199
it's stuff like that that's that makes

1950
01:24:04,359 --> 01:24:09,960
the job harder but like I said you take

1951
01:24:07,198 --> 01:24:13,238
your dumps with your success and it's

1952
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:16,000
not as often so I find that the job is

1953
01:24:13,238 --> 01:24:19,279
more rewarding than it is not

1954
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:21,359
rewarding for sure yeah that's a really

1955
01:24:19,279 --> 01:24:24,639
great point that you bring up that just

1956
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:30,719
because two people are growing the same

1957
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:34,319
strain with the same Sops and you know

1958
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:36,920
attempting to mimic the Styles as exact

1959
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:39,118
as possible the end product can turn out

1960
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:40,800
vastly different you know maybe it's an

1961
01:24:39,118 --> 01:24:43,319
environmental Factor that's slightly

1962
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:44,840
different or maybe there's an input

1963
01:24:43,319 --> 01:24:46,599
Factor that's slightly different you

1964
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:48,119
know especially if that was what I

1965
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:50,199
noticed was the biggest thing was the

1966
01:24:48,118 --> 01:24:53,238
different irrigation style so a lazy

1967
01:24:50,198 --> 01:24:55,678
version versus consistent irrigation

1968
01:24:53,238 --> 01:24:59,158
like TP just you know people

1969
01:24:55,679 --> 01:25:01,639
just it's a labor of love right hand

1970
01:24:59,158 --> 01:25:03,719
watering one the the irrigation

1971
01:25:01,639 --> 01:25:07,159
practices as well especially if you are

1972
01:25:03,719 --> 01:25:08,840
in a living soil situation then the

1973
01:25:07,158 --> 01:25:11,000
nutrient availability is going to be

1974
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:14,400
highly dependent upon how that

1975
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:16,279
irrigation is applied and so you know

1976
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:19,359
not only is it just irrigation at that

1977
01:25:16,279 --> 01:25:23,079
point it's the overall nutrient density

1978
01:25:19,359 --> 01:25:24,519
within the root Zone and the the you

1979
01:25:23,079 --> 01:25:26,158
know percentage of different

1980
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:28,480
constituents that are making up that

1981
01:25:26,158 --> 01:25:32,079
nutrient package for the plant they're

1982
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:34,399
they're all going to be um adjusted

1983
01:25:32,079 --> 01:25:36,158
because irrigation can affect especially

1984
01:25:34,399 --> 01:25:38,799
in living soil right it can affect the

1985
01:25:36,158 --> 01:25:41,879
pH of the soil it can you got to let it

1986
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:44,279
ride it out in living soil like it's not

1987
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:45,920
like that's what I missed about salt you

1988
01:25:44,279 --> 01:25:48,639
know just being able to flush and

1989
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:51,600
control verus you can flush it and reset

1990
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:53,760
it yeah like watching Brown town just

1991
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:55,600
slowly die before my eyes like that was

1992
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:57,760
so hard

1993
01:25:55,600 --> 01:26:00,560
yeah that's be coming from like strictly

1994
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:05,159
going automated salt places you know

1995
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:08,560
Rocko cocoa to like this is living soil

1996
01:26:05,158 --> 01:26:11,198
like right well then also this was with

1997
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:15,400
uh like a dual root Zone aquaponic

1998
01:26:11,198 --> 01:26:20,079
system we hand watering in the um fish

1999
01:26:15,399 --> 01:26:22,000
poop but okay um so yeah yeah we were

2000
01:26:20,079 --> 01:26:24,800
doing a bunch of actually rearch

2001
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:28,039
research research studies

2002
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:31,480
with the government of Canada so we were

2003
01:26:28,039 --> 01:26:34,600
maximizing on funding through uh certain

2004
01:26:31,479 --> 01:26:36,718
tax benefits that you get for doing R&amp;D

2005
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:38,880
and so instead of it costing a lot of

2006
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:42,239
money we ended up you know it paid for

2007
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:44,560
itself and that was through doing a uh

2008
01:26:42,238 --> 01:26:46,198
affluence uh studies so we had

2009
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:48,920
scientists I was working with a

2010
01:26:46,198 --> 01:26:53,799
scientist um we were using actually the

2011
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:55,600
doy cake um to replicate you know is

2012
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:58,039
this making a difference basically by

2013
01:26:55,600 --> 01:27:00,159
adding this effent what's in this poop

2014
01:26:58,039 --> 01:27:02,319
what's you know we had send it away for

2015
01:27:00,158 --> 01:27:04,439
microbial analysis which is really

2016
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:06,479
difficult to get um because you can go

2017
01:27:04,439 --> 01:27:08,799
to your basic cannabis lab or any lab

2018
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:10,559
really and get a microbial analysis

2019
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:13,119
that'll tell you like your cfu or

2020
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:15,000
exactly how much microbials are on

2021
01:27:13,118 --> 01:27:16,639
something but it can't tell you what

2022
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,880
microbes those are so are they good are

2023
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:23,480
they bad like you just don't know so it

2024
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:26,319
was um through a university in uh

2025
01:27:23,479 --> 01:27:29,439
Halifax I think um dalh Housey it's a

2026
01:27:26,319 --> 01:27:31,799
good popular one that we got our

2027
01:27:29,439 --> 01:27:33,879
affluent in our soil and like the

2028
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:37,400
scientist LED that whole research

2029
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:41,960
project and then we were actually um on

2030
01:27:37,399 --> 01:27:44,519
a couple of the the world aquaponic the

2031
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:46,520
virtual um conference too so the

2032
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:49,760
scientists was on there talking about

2033
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:55,560
what they found and what we

2034
01:27:49,760 --> 01:28:00,199
found is that there wasn't really any

2035
01:27:55,560 --> 01:28:04,119
rare or like unique microbe in fish

2036
01:28:00,198 --> 01:28:06,359
effent that was doing anything to create

2037
01:28:04,118 --> 01:28:09,719
like higher yield higher quality

2038
01:28:06,359 --> 01:28:12,519
basically any microbial input will help

2039
01:28:09,719 --> 01:28:15,600
break down the what you need and will

2040
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:20,360
work the same whether it's fish poop

2041
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:22,760
Worm poop um teas that people Brew based

2042
01:28:20,359 --> 01:28:25,759
on those things compost that kind of

2043
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:29,960
thing you know so it was it was pretty

2044
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:32,199
cool that is really cool I um I always

2045
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:34,439
listen to or I used to listen to a lot

2046
01:28:32,198 --> 01:28:38,198
the um growing with fishes podcast with

2047
01:28:34,439 --> 01:28:40,079
Steve raisner and um I always wanted to

2048
01:28:38,198 --> 01:28:41,799
try out like the Dual root Zone planting

2049
01:28:40,079 --> 01:28:43,920
where you have your little your fish

2050
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:45,800
tank and you just run almost like a a

2051
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:48,079
thin nutrient film technique with the

2052
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:50,159
plant sitting above it with the yeah I

2053
01:28:48,079 --> 01:28:54,639
can visualize that diagram right now

2054
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:56,519
dude yep for sure me too I the a home

2055
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:58,319
when they got rid of the fish farm I was

2056
01:28:56,520 --> 01:29:00,560
like can I have like they're three lb

2057
01:28:58,319 --> 01:29:03,118
fish right they're huge and my fish guy

2058
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:04,560
Gary was like I'll tell you a sad story

2059
01:29:03,118 --> 01:29:06,079
man he's like you don't want one of

2060
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:08,119
those in your living room cuz you need a

2061
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:10,198
big pool and you'll find it on the

2062
01:29:08,118 --> 01:29:13,000
ground Dead one day which I did always

2063
01:29:10,198 --> 01:29:14,599
find lots of dead fish so cuz they'll

2064
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,319
just hop out of the tanks yeah as soon

2065
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:17,840
as they lose oxygen those suckers are

2066
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:19,198
jumping out they're and it's aggressive

2067
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:21,319
jumping like you you have to have

2068
01:29:19,198 --> 01:29:24,759
netting on them our our genetics anyway

2069
01:29:21,319 --> 01:29:29,439
is the tilapia so they're they like a

2070
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:32,199
warmer a warmer a warmer

2071
01:29:29,439 --> 01:29:33,678
water yeah that's um I I feel like

2072
01:29:32,198 --> 01:29:34,919
anybody that hasn't really heard much

2073
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:38,279
about

2074
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:40,440
um uh aquaponics should go and listen to

2075
01:29:38,279 --> 01:29:42,319
the growing with fishes podcast yes they

2076
01:29:40,439 --> 01:29:44,638
are the experts I had very basic

2077
01:29:42,319 --> 01:29:46,840
knowledge of it honestly people want me

2078
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:49,440
on their they have asked to be like a

2079
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:51,560
speaker and stuff and I decline because

2080
01:29:49,439 --> 01:29:55,238
like it's not my forte like yeah I did

2081
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:57,320
that but it was very ghetto and it was

2082
01:29:55,238 --> 01:29:59,359
yeah probably

2083
01:29:57,319 --> 01:30:02,920
not you know but it was a good

2084
01:29:59,359 --> 01:30:02,920
experience I love the fish

2085
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:11,039
actually I still have a picture of them

2086
01:30:08,079 --> 01:30:14,079
up I

2087
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:15,519
see um well I have a couple more

2088
01:30:14,079 --> 01:30:19,279
questions to go

2089
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:21,719
through um so I'll ask them and then um

2090
01:30:19,279 --> 01:30:25,238
we'll just go from there so you know

2091
01:30:21,719 --> 01:30:28,439
with all of the um experience that you

2092
01:30:25,238 --> 01:30:30,799
have had um especially it sounds like

2093
01:30:28,439 --> 01:30:33,079
you've seen some of the practices within

2094
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:34,639
the industry that a lot of people might

2095
01:30:33,079 --> 01:30:37,519
be like ooh that's something that I want

2096
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:39,560
to avoid um as well as some of the

2097
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:41,480
things that you've seen that are fairly

2098
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:43,719
successful within the industry and and

2099
01:30:41,479 --> 01:30:45,959
you know running teams that are highly

2100
01:30:43,719 --> 01:30:48,480
productive and and really helping hone

2101
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:49,840
in those different aspects of the grow

2102
01:30:48,479 --> 01:30:51,479
um what are some of the things that you

2103
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:54,199
would like to see change within the

2104
01:30:51,479 --> 01:30:57,079
cultivation industry

2105
01:30:54,198 --> 01:30:58,759
um honestly uh the most important thing

2106
01:30:57,079 --> 01:31:00,479
I think that needs to change is just

2107
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:03,239
what we were talking about earlier and

2108
01:31:00,479 --> 01:31:05,638
that's in regards to um positive

2109
01:31:03,238 --> 01:31:08,439
leadership and so there just needs to be

2110
01:31:05,639 --> 01:31:10,520
a bigger shift in um management and

2111
01:31:08,439 --> 01:31:12,279
Leadership and that needs to trickle

2112
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:15,719
down into

2113
01:31:12,279 --> 01:31:17,679
productivity um and so I feel like any

2114
01:31:15,719 --> 01:31:19,560
any facility or any industry or any

2115
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:25,560
workplace is going to need to

2116
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:27,719
incorporate that um type of you know

2117
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:30,960
newer style

2118
01:31:27,719 --> 01:31:34,800
leadership um to get anywhere and to get

2119
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:39,279
people to stay you want we're seeing

2120
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:41,199
more transition and less um like staff

2121
01:31:39,279 --> 01:31:43,439
retention because they're just not being

2122
01:31:41,198 --> 01:31:46,559
treated properly and the generation of

2123
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:49,000
today is like [ __ ] you you know like

2124
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:51,400
they do not give one [ __ ] about paying

2125
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:55,118
for rent or like they'll go live in an

2126
01:31:51,399 --> 01:31:56,559
RV by the river like it's just unreal

2127
01:31:55,118 --> 01:31:59,158
like people just won't put up with [ __ ]

2128
01:31:56,560 --> 01:32:01,039
and so that managers need to follow that

2129
01:31:59,158 --> 01:32:04,479
Trend you know because it's just like

2130
01:32:01,039 --> 01:32:07,639
it's such a waste of um a per a

2131
01:32:04,479 --> 01:32:10,079
company's money and time to be replacing

2132
01:32:07,639 --> 01:32:11,800
these people constantly so it's like you

2133
01:32:10,079 --> 01:32:14,639
need to get the right people in and do

2134
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:17,119
the right things you need to pay them

2135
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:20,159
properly um no

2136
01:32:17,118 --> 01:32:24,000
[ __ ] communicate

2137
01:32:20,158 --> 01:32:25,519
more more transparency honestly like but

2138
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,158
I don't really see those things changing

2139
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:30,880
quickly so it's just going to be like

2140
01:32:27,158 --> 01:32:33,519
that's how I see um changes happening

2141
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:35,359
but it doesn't necessarily mean that

2142
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:36,639
that's where anything's going I hope so

2143
01:32:35,359 --> 01:32:40,000
slowly but

2144
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:42,159
surely sure uh you know in the same line

2145
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:44,600
of thought uh what are some of the

2146
01:32:42,158 --> 01:32:46,039
pitfalls that you might be seeing in the

2147
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:48,079
industry or perhaps things that are

2148
01:32:46,039 --> 01:32:49,519
being swept under the rug um are there

2149
01:32:48,079 --> 01:32:50,960
any other other things there that you're

2150
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:53,480
seeing other than what you've talked

2151
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:56,600
about pitfalls I guess for me would be

2152
01:32:53,479 --> 01:33:01,039
like regulations and so um the tight

2153
01:32:56,600 --> 01:33:06,800
regulations and the amount of tax that

2154
01:33:01,039 --> 01:33:09,800
um that is being taken from Cannabis is

2155
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:12,639
insane and I you know I know at the

2156
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:14,920
basic level from being in it so here in

2157
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:18,279
Canada you're having to feed all the

2158
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:20,800
different provinces separately like

2159
01:33:18,279 --> 01:33:22,519
separate um buyers they all have

2160
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:26,520
different rules and regulations you need

2161
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:28,159
to know them um you can't mess up at all

2162
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:32,400
and then they're they're taking all your

2163
01:33:28,158 --> 01:33:34,960
money so things are are starting to get

2164
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:37,319
known and so you're seeing like leaders

2165
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:40,840
in this industry shouting out about it

2166
01:33:37,319 --> 01:33:42,679
and wanting excise reform and you know

2167
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:44,480
that's going to stop a lot of these

2168
01:33:42,679 --> 01:33:46,679
smaller businesses from being taken out

2169
01:33:44,479 --> 01:33:50,678
honestly and

2170
01:33:46,679 --> 01:33:54,480
and and so the pitfall is the changes

2171
01:33:50,679 --> 01:33:57,279
are are coming too slowly and and so

2172
01:33:54,479 --> 01:34:00,319
companies are just expiring because they

2173
01:33:57,279 --> 01:34:02,359
can't wait they can't wait for the

2174
01:34:00,319 --> 01:34:04,599
changes so if they people are getting

2175
01:34:02,359 --> 01:34:06,158
taken out and it's just not fair so it's

2176
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:09,280
like going to be a monopoly just like

2177
01:34:06,158 --> 01:34:11,439
every other industry where there's all

2178
01:34:09,279 --> 01:34:14,479
these corporations that own everything

2179
01:34:11,439 --> 01:34:16,519
and everything's being exported because

2180
01:34:14,479 --> 01:34:19,158
they don't want to pay the excise tax so

2181
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:21,080
if you like good weed and you you want

2182
01:34:19,158 --> 01:34:22,679
it from this guy well you can't get it

2183
01:34:21,079 --> 01:34:25,118
from this guy cuz he needs to make money

2184
01:34:22,679 --> 01:34:27,679
so he's exporting it to Germany so any

2185
01:34:25,118 --> 01:34:31,799
good weed you're making more money and I

2186
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:35,440
know this for sure you're making $2 a gr

2187
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:39,360
for dank ass weed in Canada domestically

2188
01:34:35,439 --> 01:34:42,879
versus four plus dollars internationally

2189
01:34:39,359 --> 01:34:45,079
at their like American or Australian or

2190
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:47,960
you know Euros right so it's even more

2191
01:34:45,079 --> 01:34:49,800
money so yeah no

2192
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:52,639
excis makes

2193
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:55,119
sense that does I feel like supporting

2194
01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:57,800
the local cons consumers and community

2195
01:34:55,118 --> 01:35:00,759
over your

2196
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:01,960
um trying to get the highest dollar is

2197
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:03,639
something that a lot of people should

2198
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:05,800
think about because that's that's very

2199
01:35:03,639 --> 01:35:11,359
important it

2200
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:13,760
is um so having been a new grower uh and

2201
01:35:11,359 --> 01:35:17,359
trying to you know and then successfully

2202
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:19,639
entering into the commercial space um

2203
01:35:17,359 --> 01:35:22,000
what are some what is some advice that

2204
01:35:19,639 --> 01:35:27,520
you would give to new Growers whether it

2205
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:30,960
be um in homow sense or in a commercial

2206
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:30,960
sense new

2207
01:35:31,399 --> 01:35:40,158
Growers so much so much

2208
01:35:36,158 --> 01:35:44,519
um the best advice I can give to new

2209
01:35:40,158 --> 01:35:47,519
Growers is to start with good reputable

2210
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:50,040
genetics and so

2211
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:54,560
um invest in

2212
01:35:50,039 --> 01:35:58,279
yourself so figure out res

2213
01:35:54,560 --> 01:36:02,360
search um find out come to me even come

2214
01:35:58,279 --> 01:36:05,238
to you I'm sure ask where people are

2215
01:36:02,359 --> 01:36:07,880
buying um their genetics and how cuz

2216
01:36:05,238 --> 01:36:09,279
sometimes It's Tricky so I don't mind

2217
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:10,520
having those conversations but I think

2218
01:36:09,279 --> 01:36:12,599
that's the most important thing because

2219
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:14,840
you can get so turned away by having

2220
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:17,920
just someone's St someone's you know

2221
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:19,840
basement unstable genetics like I would

2222
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:22,239
I would give a new grower those and let

2223
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:24,199
them know that's what they are and that

2224
01:36:22,238 --> 01:36:25,879
you know this is a good learning too

2225
01:36:24,198 --> 01:36:28,279
right like let's watch for everything

2226
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:31,560
you know like so

2227
01:36:28,279 --> 01:36:33,039
there's benefits but I wouldn't if

2228
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:34,480
you're just doing this on your own and

2229
01:36:33,039 --> 01:36:36,039
you're like you want to make your own

2230
01:36:34,479 --> 01:36:37,759
medicine and you want to learn and get

2231
01:36:36,039 --> 01:36:40,079
on as quickly as possible you got to

2232
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:43,239
start with good quality stuff and That's

2233
01:36:40,079 --> 01:36:46,039
genetics first for sure I agree with

2234
01:36:43,238 --> 01:36:48,879
that I think that you know genetics

2235
01:36:46,039 --> 01:36:51,039
always tend to be at the Forefront of

2236
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:53,279
what's important for a new grower to pay

2237
01:36:51,039 --> 01:36:57,319
attention to uh one thing that I do like

2238
01:36:53,279 --> 01:36:59,279
to add to that is that I think it's

2239
01:36:57,319 --> 01:37:02,359
beneficial for a lot of new Growers if

2240
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:05,800
they have it available to grow a clone

2241
01:37:02,359 --> 01:37:08,599
rather than a seed because yeah that's

2242
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:12,000
clones that are tested and proven you

2243
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:13,760
can have certain expectations on exactly

2244
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,198
what it should look like whereas with

2245
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:18,239
seeds sometimes even if they're really

2246
01:37:16,198 --> 01:37:20,238
refined and from a really reputable

2247
01:37:18,238 --> 01:37:22,718
breeder there can be different

2248
01:37:20,238 --> 01:37:24,559
morphologies that the the you know that

2249
01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:27,118
the phenotype can can take that might

2250
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:28,920
throw you off from thinking that it is

2251
01:37:27,118 --> 01:37:31,079
what you were looking for but if you

2252
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:33,079
grow a clone and you see it grow out and

2253
01:37:31,079 --> 01:37:36,519
you do it a few times and you can kind

2254
01:37:33,079 --> 01:37:39,319
of see this is what something that is

2255
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:42,360
supposed to produce really well does in

2256
01:37:39,319 --> 01:37:44,599
my setting and environment then you can

2257
01:37:42,359 --> 01:37:47,479
then start to look through seeds and

2258
01:37:44,599 --> 01:37:49,760
find things that are you know comparable

2259
01:37:47,479 --> 01:37:52,079
so you can go this is where my Baseline

2260
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:53,679
was it's this clone I know how it grows

2261
01:37:52,079 --> 01:37:56,079
here I'm going to start looking through

2262
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:59,359
seeds because I do want to try something

2263
01:37:56,079 --> 01:38:01,920
that's like a grape flavor or maybe find

2264
01:37:59,359 --> 01:38:03,759
something that's an OG or a GMO or you

2265
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:05,679
know just something that you maybe if

2266
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:08,360
it's flavor forward that you're

2267
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:10,118
searching for or a specific cannaboid

2268
01:38:08,359 --> 01:38:12,559
profile that you're searching for you

2269
01:38:10,118 --> 01:38:15,799
can at least still know what you can do

2270
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:16,599
with the um the setup that you have yeah

2271
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:19,480
I

2272
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:21,639
agree cool well you know this has been a

2273
01:38:19,479 --> 01:38:23,959
wonderful conversation Genevie I really

2274
01:38:21,639 --> 01:38:26,319
appreciate you joining me today

2275
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:29,880
um I do like to wrap up the show with a

2276
01:38:26,319 --> 01:38:33,238
couple of questions that I ask all of my

2277
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:35,719
fellow Growers um so what is your

2278
01:38:33,238 --> 01:38:39,399
favorite strain of all time White

2279
01:38:35,719 --> 01:38:41,520
Widow I love white right off the bat

2280
01:38:39,399 --> 01:38:44,238
yeah right off the bat I'm not growing

2281
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:47,239
White Widow though I know I need a good

2282
01:38:44,238 --> 01:38:49,000
one though um so I just need to invest

2283
01:38:47,238 --> 01:38:52,039
in my favorite white widow that I've

2284
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:54,960
ever grown is from Amsterdam Amsterdam

2285
01:38:52,039 --> 01:38:56,960
marijuana seeds um out in the

2286
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:59,480
Netherlands that's actually my favorite

2287
01:38:56,960 --> 01:39:01,800
genetic seed bank they do their own

2288
01:38:59,479 --> 01:39:04,399
thing um and they have the best white

2289
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:06,760
widow I like their white widow extreme

2290
01:39:04,399 --> 01:39:10,960
it's called it's just the

2291
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:13,039
effect um that one I I grew so long ago

2292
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:14,840
that I was be pre before I was like

2293
01:39:13,039 --> 01:39:16,719
getting a lab to test anything so I

2294
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:19,719
don't know what the tpin are on it but I

2295
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:21,359
can guess that lemoning is up there

2296
01:39:19,719 --> 01:39:24,158
because of the euphoria that you

2297
01:39:21,359 --> 01:39:26,719
experience with it it's like a haven't

2298
01:39:24,158 --> 01:39:28,839
felt a lot of strains that give me that

2299
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:30,520
and so I miss it so I I definitely need

2300
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:32,960
to invest in getting some

2301
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:34,920
seeds nice yeah I haven't had White

2302
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:37,039
Widow in probably a decade or more it's

2303
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:40,000
skunk right like I love a good

2304
01:39:37,039 --> 01:39:44,840
skunk for sure you know every time I

2305
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:46,679
hear skunk I I I just can't ever I can't

2306
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:48,960
remember ever having something that did

2307
01:39:46,679 --> 01:39:50,520
taste like skunk the closest thing that

2308
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:53,840
I can yeah the closest thing I can think

2309
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:55,960
of is like a good GMO or um

2310
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:59,000
like one of the different Burger strains

2311
01:39:55,960 --> 01:40:01,639
from from skunk Master Flex and okay

2312
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,520
I've never tried one of those but GMO

2313
01:40:01,639 --> 01:40:06,920
for

2314
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:08,639
sure yep um but yeah th those are always

2315
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:11,960
like I think that that's what skunk

2316
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:14,118
tastes like yeah yeah I encourage you to

2317
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:17,198
get out there and buy some White Widow

2318
01:40:14,118 --> 01:40:19,079
extreme it's got a really unique like

2319
01:40:17,198 --> 01:40:21,238
I'd say like a burnt rubber I still

2320
01:40:19,079 --> 01:40:24,359
remember like but almost like lemon

2321
01:40:21,238 --> 01:40:27,399
burnt rubber hazy

2322
01:40:24,359 --> 01:40:30,399
smell that does sound good yeah well

2323
01:40:27,399 --> 01:40:32,359
along the same uh line of questioning

2324
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:33,960
what is your favorite breeder of all

2325
01:40:32,359 --> 01:40:35,519
time or who is your favorite breeder of

2326
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:39,158
all time I should

2327
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:42,480
say hard hard hard it probably be what

2328
01:40:39,158 --> 01:40:44,479
I've grown the most of so I'm trying to

2329
01:40:42,479 --> 01:40:46,319
think like collectively like what where

2330
01:40:44,479 --> 01:40:50,238
do I go

2331
01:40:46,319 --> 01:40:54,439
like I've grown a lot of Barney's Farm

2332
01:40:50,238 --> 01:40:54,439
I've grown a lot of dinm

2333
01:40:54,800 --> 01:41:02,039
Kevin jodrey is also a favorite breeder

2334
01:40:58,039 --> 01:41:04,920
I do have some of his um genetics not

2335
01:41:02,039 --> 01:41:06,920
just from you know where I worked but

2336
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:09,399
also seeds he's

2337
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:12,000
given

2338
01:41:09,399 --> 01:41:14,839
um I'm trying to think of a Canadian

2339
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:17,840
person that I want to

2340
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:17,840
plug

2341
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:27,480
uh yeah I'll stick with that well that's

2342
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:30,198
so fine I feel like sometimes inetics

2343
01:41:27,479 --> 01:41:31,598
black cherry punch boom boom boom Oh

2344
01:41:30,198 --> 01:41:33,000
Canadian you know what I was just

2345
01:41:31,599 --> 01:41:34,760
talking about this I'm going to do a

2346
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:37,238
shout out this is only because they

2347
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:40,159
didn't come to my mind like jeez Lise

2348
01:41:37,238 --> 01:41:42,678
I've already grown T like in commercial

2349
01:41:40,158 --> 01:41:46,799
setting there is a breed here mother

2350
01:41:42,679 --> 01:41:48,440
Labs so I've grown black cherry punch it

2351
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:50,000
they got from in-house genetics I

2352
01:41:48,439 --> 01:41:51,359
believe I don't know the whole story of

2353
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,920
it but I've grown it in different

2354
01:41:51,359 --> 01:41:55,000
facilities cuz these facilities have

2355
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:57,560
bought it from them so they're located

2356
01:41:55,000 --> 01:42:00,880
in Saskatchewan which is where I grew up

2357
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:03,639
and was born which is cool um yeah if I

2358
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:06,079
could ever get a job working under Brian

2359
01:42:03,639 --> 01:42:07,760
who is the CEO and founder or like on

2360
01:42:06,079 --> 01:42:11,319
their science team as like someone's

2361
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:13,480
assistant I would love that job just how

2362
01:42:11,319 --> 01:42:17,439
much learning the tissue culture like

2363
01:42:13,479 --> 01:42:19,399
banking um uh like breeding pheno

2364
01:42:17,439 --> 01:42:21,479
hunting it's just like imagine going to

2365
01:42:19,399 --> 01:42:23,439
work and that's what you do every day I

2366
01:42:21,479 --> 01:42:26,039
know there's probably paperwork involved

2367
01:42:23,439 --> 01:42:28,919
but prob yeah definitely a lot of

2368
01:42:26,039 --> 01:42:30,519
tracking um yeah so I'm going they're my

2369
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:32,800
favorite because I have experience

2370
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:35,840
they're Canadian let's go with that

2371
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:38,239
mother Labs nice yeah we have tissue

2372
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:40,159
culture come up a lot on the podcast

2373
01:42:38,238 --> 01:42:41,678
because um so many people are getting

2374
01:42:40,158 --> 01:42:44,598
into it and I think it's really

2375
01:42:41,679 --> 01:42:48,000
important experience it is it's really

2376
01:42:44,599 --> 01:42:50,920
fun actually there's like a lot of calm

2377
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:52,760
that you have to maintain in order to do

2378
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:56,800
uh tissue culture very well because so

2379
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:59,480
much of is very fine motor skills and uh

2380
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:00,679
patience yeah maybe your facility needs

2381
01:42:59,479 --> 01:43:05,079
me

2382
01:43:00,679 --> 01:43:08,920
ni um we we are so small but

2383
01:43:05,079 --> 01:43:12,439
uh International here I come there you

2384
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:13,639
go maybe not USA actually never mind no

2385
01:43:12,439 --> 01:43:18,960
probably not

2386
01:43:13,639 --> 01:43:18,960
I not not currently um C cut cut

2387
01:43:19,279 --> 01:43:26,118
yeah um so last question then on sort of

2388
01:43:23,439 --> 01:43:28,678
these these uh wrap-up questions is what

2389
01:43:26,118 --> 01:43:30,719
is your most memorable cannabis or

2390
01:43:28,679 --> 01:43:33,279
smoking related

2391
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:35,800
experience oh

2392
01:43:33,279 --> 01:43:38,359
wow

2393
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:41,079
most H you know some people it'll be

2394
01:43:38,359 --> 01:43:45,118
their first time smoking other

2395
01:43:41,079 --> 01:43:47,399
people embarrassing like that first like

2396
01:43:45,118 --> 01:43:49,519
joint that I my buddy forced out my

2397
01:43:47,399 --> 01:43:54,000
throat when I was like I'm going to kill

2398
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:57,280
myself like um that's pretty out there I

2399
01:43:54,000 --> 01:44:02,039
guess like that joint saved my life so

2400
01:43:57,279 --> 01:44:04,479
in like a really hopeful but like

2401
01:44:02,039 --> 01:44:06,399
desperate that you know that's it I

2402
01:44:04,479 --> 01:44:09,118
guess but in a fun way I was trying to

2403
01:44:06,399 --> 01:44:09,118
think of a fun

2404
01:44:09,719 --> 01:44:17,079
one I guess it would be that trip so

2405
01:44:13,158 --> 01:44:19,198
taking I called it um like the grand

2406
01:44:17,079 --> 01:44:21,880
weed tour

2407
01:44:19,198 --> 01:44:25,198
2018 and that was literally driving down

2408
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:28,319
the coast through Washington Oregon

2409
01:44:25,198 --> 01:44:30,960
Northern California stopped in Weed

2410
01:44:28,319 --> 01:44:32,479
California to look for weed and they're

2411
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:34,800
like sorry we don't have any weed and

2412
01:44:32,479 --> 01:44:37,638
it's dangerous for you to be asking that

2413
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:39,560
you know so why you know like probably

2414
01:44:37,639 --> 01:44:42,000
should have been killed a few times on

2415
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:44,800
that trip but God's with me Creator

2416
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:47,359
thank you protecting me but some of

2417
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:53,320
those experiences I was on hippie Hills

2418
01:44:47,359 --> 01:44:56,679
smoking a joint we missed 420 so like we

2419
01:44:53,319 --> 01:44:59,799
got there way too late rolled into town

2420
01:44:56,679 --> 01:45:02,158
but we were like so what you know a

2421
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:05,119
little bit later rolled in and still was

2422
01:45:02,158 --> 01:45:06,479
like very solo but smoked my own joint

2423
01:45:05,118 --> 01:45:08,479
that's probably one of the most

2424
01:45:06,479 --> 01:45:11,079
memorable like that's history that's

2425
01:45:08,479 --> 01:45:13,598
where history has been you know so

2426
01:45:11,079 --> 01:45:15,479
that's cool maybe it's different for

2427
01:45:13,599 --> 01:45:18,239
people who live closer but like I just

2428
01:45:15,479 --> 01:45:21,319
thought that was cool yeah yeah I I grew

2429
01:45:18,238 --> 01:45:23,238
up in the Bay Area and um it was uh

2430
01:45:21,319 --> 01:45:26,880
cannabis is a huge part of the culture

2431
01:45:23,238 --> 01:45:29,238
there yeah it's so neat it is and yeah

2432
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:30,760
smoking up on hippie Hill is definitely

2433
01:45:29,238 --> 01:45:32,799
something people should experience if

2434
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:34,800
they have I felt I feel grateful for

2435
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:36,880
having experienced the little that I've

2436
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:40,279
experienced in the last eight or nine

2437
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:43,760
years I am not a an OG or a legacy

2438
01:45:40,279 --> 01:45:46,599
grower I am a noob at this I just happen

2439
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:49,400
to like whip in and like work my way up

2440
01:45:46,599 --> 01:45:53,159
and win some stuff but honestly like I

2441
01:45:49,399 --> 01:45:55,158
am so grateful to have gotten and had

2442
01:45:53,158 --> 01:45:59,238
the blessings that have had in such a

2443
01:45:55,158 --> 01:46:01,598
short amount of time so it's cool well I

2444
01:45:59,238 --> 01:46:04,198
feel like your experience uh speaks

2445
01:46:01,599 --> 01:46:07,159
volume for your own capabilities as a

2446
01:46:04,198 --> 01:46:09,759
grower and you know a lot of people can

2447
01:46:07,158 --> 01:46:12,399
learn a lot from yourself if they do

2448
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:14,599
want to enter into the Cannabis industry

2449
