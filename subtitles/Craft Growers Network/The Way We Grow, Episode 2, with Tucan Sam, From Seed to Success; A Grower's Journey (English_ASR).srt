1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,480
hello and welcome to the way we grow

2
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:10,879
podcast um where we have interviews with

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,240
people about their cannabis story their

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,559
Journey uh with cannabis and what led

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,118
them to cannabis

6
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:22,278
cultivation so today we have uh two can

7
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:24,240
Sam he's a hom grower a seed tester he's

8
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:27,160
also a pheno hunter and above all else

9
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:29,399
he's a family man and uh so Sam how are

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,079

11
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:33,799
thank you for having

12
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:35,280
awesome yeah it's great to have you um

13
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:36,640
so what's new in your girl world like

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,280
what have uh what have you been doing

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,719
lately what have you been perhaps uh

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,920
what season you've been popping what

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,239
have you been uh testing lately um well

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,920
recently I've been going down a cap

19
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:51,679
junky Wormhole uh so it's been a lot of

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,760
cap junkie crosses and what I'm trying

21
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:57,600
to do is find something that I like and

22
00:00:53,759 --> 00:01:01,079
F to it um and just kind of breed it out

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,239
that way more for curiosity sake not you

24
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,200
know I'm just kind of going off the cuff

25
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:08,280
but uh you know what I'm doing right now

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,400
and just kind of still pheno hunting and

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,759
testing different things but right now

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,640
it's mostly like a cap junkie got a few

29
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:17,239
mat crosses in there

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,239
so pretty much going down that stuff

31
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:23,078
that's what I like nice have you ran uh

32
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:25,959
like just the straight cap junkie before

33
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:28,199
I haven't I've always had the flow um

34
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:31,078
one of my buddies who kind of put me on

35
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,000
to Growing he used to grow it a lot so I

36
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:36,839
would pick it up from him and it was

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,239
phenomenal um I've grown out uh

38
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,280
different uh different crosses from it

39
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:44,000
and you know it's always been something

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,640
that I've kind of liked so my buddy uh

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,640
flamethrower hooked me up with some

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,599
maybe like a hundred or so beans um so

43
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,759
I've been running through some crosses

44
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:58,000
it's been fun nice that's awesome is is

45
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,680
uh is that his like uh genetics label or

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,959
flamethrower or uh

47
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,000
yeah that's um one of my P on Instagram

48
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,439
check him out um he does a lot of

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,280
different work but he knew that was kind

50
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:12,359
of what was up my alley he was like yo

51
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,159
try this I'm not into it but I know you

52
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,360
are and I ran a couple like whoa then I

53
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:19,079
ran a couple more and then so wait a

54
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,879
minute I might you might actually been

55
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,519
right buddy so are they all uh are they

56
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:28,239
all female are they fem or they no no

57
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:31,280
it's a r seeds so I'm uh looking through

58
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,120
the Maes too uh chopping down a lot but

59
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,280
um every once in a while every 1 in five

60
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,959
or 10 you find that nice one that you

61
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,959
just have to keep around and do

62
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:43,439
something with so what what makes it

63
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,719
nice for you um you know once I figure

64
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,318
out that it's a male just that it it

65
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,039
goes through a lot of abuse you know I

66
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:51,518
might I might throw it out of the tent

67
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,560
for a couple days you know I might not

68
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,480
water it with the rest you know I might

69
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,719
skip a couple waterings just to really

70
00:02:55,479 --> 00:03:00,518
beat it up you know just to if it

71
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:02,560
bounces back and just still the top of

72
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:04,439
the tent and I know all right that's

73
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,959
something I you know want to want to

74
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:11,079
stick around with structure-wise it can

75
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:13,519
stand up on its own um stem rub and all

76
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,840
that stuff you know I I don't know if

77
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,000
that's that's everything you know a lot

78
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,598
of a lot of different opinions on that

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,400
but um I mostly go just on structure uh

80
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,079
how vigorous it is how much abuse it can

81
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,039
take you

82
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,959
know for sure I mean those are like

83
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:32,919
pretty much the exact same things that I

84
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,400
look for an AA like just stress testing

85
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:38,359
it making sure that it doesn't throw a

86
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,039
bunch of nuts like while it's in veg um

87
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,480
you know the structure on it like

88
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:44,199
keeping the keeping the plant like

89
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,318
upright without having to put any

90
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:49,079
support on it while it's growing for you

91
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:53,639
know months and months in the same small

92
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:55,920
one gallon or two gallon pot um and like

93
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,759
having the ability to do like multiple

94
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,199
prunings on it without it causing too

95
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,239
much stress for it to throw a bunch of

96
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,639
nuts either like yeah I think that

97
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,120
you're you're spot on with a lot of

98
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:08,000
those and the last thing is um when you

99
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,239
flower it some of the ones they might

100
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,759
look good and then you flower it and

101
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,680
it's just like not not nutsy let's say

102
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,878
you know it's not too many sacks or

103
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,840
they're you know you want them you want

104
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:22,000
them clustered um tight tight like a a

105
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,119
flower structure as as you know like in

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,319
a for the female right right right so

107
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,759
you know you go through a lot of males

108
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,399
you feel bad tossing them but uh has to

109
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:32,800
be done

110
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,758
yeah I mean I feel like you probably go

111
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,639
through more females I I feel like

112
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:38,919
sometimes the the males you're just kind

113
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,639
of like you either just are keeping a

114
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:44,159
bunch of them around right or you just

115
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,280
like toss them all right away maybe keep

116
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,919
one that's how it has to be or you're

117
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:50,439
going to end up with a male Factory real

118
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:52,959
you know pollen's going to be everywhere

119
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:55,319
it's going to be a as roster Jeff says

120
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,758
it's going to be a Mor pich who's the

121
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:00,199
daddy and you don't want you don't want

122
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,639
that you don't want that no and then you

123
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,319
you start to get good at like just

124
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,120
noticing the structure of the plant and

125
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:07,360
the leaf morphology and overall Vigor

126
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,478
and stuff and you're just like I can

127
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,000
pick them out you know pretty early just

128
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:14,319
to at least give it a potential try cuz

129
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,759
I feel like unless you're doing

130
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,038
something where you're introducing like

131
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,919
ethylene to the the flowering cycle of

132
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:25,120
the male and trying to promote some sort

133
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:28,279
of like uh Tricom production or um uh

134
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,918
other like uh XX characteristic

135
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:33,599
Productions like with c or or bracks at

136
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:35,439
the inner nodes and stuff then you're

137
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,360
you're not really going to know the the

138
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:40,680
full like potential for it when it is

139
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,439
introduced to uh like a female

140
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,879
population and what their like progyny

141
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:46,839
is going to bring to the table until you

142
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:50,680
do the whole process and sometimes

143
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:52,560
that's just it's tedious 100% man shout

144
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,360
out to the guys who are doing that stuff

145
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,319
that they're way smarter than me you

146
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,560
know I'm just keeping it simple you know

147
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,360
yeah what's uh what's some of the

148
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,000
favorite uh things that you've crossed

149
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,840
together then grown out and found

150
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,959
something that you were like wow that's

151
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,560
that's really cool like you I I didn't

152
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:13,120
think that that would even come from it

153
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,680
um a few meat breath

154
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,639
crosses

155
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,038
um one of the ones a white truffle with

156
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:23,400
meat breath you know the problem

157
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:26,000
is if I get a Herm every now and then

158
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:28,879
I'm not too angry about it in in fact

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,800
like it in the right spot it I could be

160
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,079
Juiced you know I I might really fit

161
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,478
like oh nice you know I might get a

162
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:38,959
little but I know people don't want that

163
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,079
so certain things that I if I notice it

164
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,478
starts to

165
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:46,519
Herm frequently I'll I'll NX it and some

166
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:50,478
of the white truffle uh crosses that I

167
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:52,000
did early on are really good um you know

168
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,639
but like I said there were Herm stuff

169
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,759
and then I'd grow some of the Herm like

170
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,800
wow that's also really good one time it

171
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,840
hered onto a Mac and I grew the C and

172
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,759
that was phenomenal a white truffle mac

173
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:05,279
cuz you know Mac when you try on your

174
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:08,560
own it'll it'll deny you right off the

175
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,079
bat you know you failed pollinations but

176
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,000
sometimes with a Herm it just does its

177
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,959
thing and you get seeds it's like wow

178
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,279
how that that's really weird you know so

179
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,719
that's really weird I wonder if there's

180
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:22,000
anything to that uh genetically cuz it

181
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,120
it's um I'm pretty sure Mac is

182
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,680
considered like a triploid where it

183
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,598
doesn't have it's not supposed to be

184
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,439
able to accept pollen so like I want I

185
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:33,719
wonder if there is some potential for

186
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:36,279
like if uh if you get a Herm pollen

187
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,199
right then you're getting an XX uh

188
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:40,878
chromosome in the pollen and I wonder if

189
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:45,520
there's anything to that that's that

190
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:47,199
allows it to enter like I I don't know I

191
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,120
again like like you said that's for

192
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,598
smarter people to figure out I I really

193
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,120
don't know how that could be but it's

194
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,079
interesting and there's got to be

195
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,918
something there you know like feel like

196
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,639
nature happens but for the most part you

197
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:02,839
can usually be able to like if if you

198
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,879
know all the you know the the modes of

199
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:06,279
action and how everything is interacting

200
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,800
then you can usually be like oh this

201
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:11,198
causes this causes this causes this

202
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,000
but I don't know what this one that's

203
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,720
that's really fascinating though yeah I

204
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,800
uh I definitely think that's um you know

205
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,840
it'll probably be discovered you know in

206
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,000
the future as it gets more legalized and

207
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:27,638
more research is done you know big a

208
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,079
starts jumping in more and more so

209
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:32,200
they'll be probably soon

210
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:35,360
and big a has some big money for for

211
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,278
breeding and genetics so that's a huge

212
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,158
potential and I'm sure that's going to

213
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:42,759
be part of it locking down things and

214
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:46,159
you know keeping it propri proprietary

215
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:48,480
and whatever else so yeah that's a great

216
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:51,000
Point um all right so I'm going to jump

217
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,120
into a couple questions just uh to keep

218
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,159
the the flow of this going the way I

219
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,440
want but um so uh what's what was your

220
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:01,719
first experience growing uh any type of

221
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,160
plant not necessarily

222
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,839
cannabis um my first experience was it

223
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:11,439
was actually a cactus a pencil

224
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:15,079
Cactus um from my grandma she was a big

225
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,680
green thumb uh tried to pass it to my

226
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:20,120
mom and I just remember her coming over

227
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:22,799
for Christmas or whatever and she would

228
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,480
go on a rampage you know in her Jamaican

229
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:28,000
accent about how you know my mom would

230
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,680
be killing plants and she's always doing

231
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,159
this and doing that how Terri and then

232
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,120
so finally my Grandma comes to me and

233
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:35,120
she's like well all you have to do is

234
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,679
like all right so I start taking care of

235
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,639
this little Cactus one day and next

236
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:40,159
thing you know it's a big bush I'm like

237
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,278
wow you know all I did was water it

238
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,919
literally she had water what what was

239
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:48,320
Grandma's

240
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:49,799
advice uh just water it you know she did

241
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,040
she was old school she's always

242
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:54,799
collecting eggshells and uh orange peels

243
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,399
and I always used to think Grandma come

244
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,078
on that really you're putting that in

245
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,120
the plants like that you know that

246
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:02,679
doesn't do anything but she was

247
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,039
convinced you know she knew she knew her

248
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:08,879
stuff um but yeah she'd put orange peels

249
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:11,199
uh eggshells in the top like crun them

250
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,159
up and just put leave them at the top

251
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,040
yeah

252
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:18,078
um so it's it's a trick I still use now

253
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:20,439
you know I still use my banana peels and

254
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:22,958
my eggshells so but to answer your

255
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,320
question it was a pencil Cactus that's

256
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:27,559
really cool uh do you do you use those

257
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,560
in like the form of like a a worm bin or

258
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:32,399
composting now or or do you just use

259
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:35,799
them as like a top dress for your

260
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,440
like for the eggshells I'll just uh I'll

261
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:39,319
roast them in the air fryer for probably

262
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,639
about 20 minutes crush them up in the

263
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:45,600
blender and then I'll add those to my uh

264
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,320
soil bins you know that's uh basically

265
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,360
the soil that's just cooking waiting

266
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,879
waiting to be mixed I'll sprinkle that

267
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,959
on top I I have like a power drill and I

268
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:58,399
just you know mix it in real good um

269
00:10:54,958 --> 00:11:00,838
with the banana peels I roast those but

270
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:04,278
that's more used for top dress and

271
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:06,720
teas okay uh pretty big on using teas

272
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:08,720
and things like that so for sure well I

273
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,600
mean like let's so let's uh kind of get

274
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,519
into that so what what is your grow

275
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:18,120
style like how do you grow I'm a Sanic

276
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:21,320
grower for sure um I like organic I like

277
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:24,000
Doc keeping it simple um get your dry

278
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:28,680
amendments it's renewable you're eating

279
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,440
bananas eggs all the time so using that

280
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:33,199
type of stuff

281
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,519
but always having those or I always keep

282
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,120
some Jacks you know keep some uh with a

283
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,278
botanic hair on on tap just in case

284
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,440
something hits the fan you know maybe

285
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:47,200
every two to three weeks um you're

286
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,560
throwing a little fertilizer in there

287
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,639
just to juice things up a little not

288
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:52,919
even

289
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,720
if not even if it it's showing

290
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:57,319
deficiency per se but if it is for sure

291
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,519
but even if it's been like wow it's only

292
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,959
it's been couple weeks let me let me top

293
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,000
dress let me throw some fertilizer in

294
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:06,879
there it's like a treat you

295
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,278
know so but when you say that are you

296
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:11,278
like adding both like uh organic top

297
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:14,159
dressings as well as then like watering

298
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:16,600
in the the fertilizers to kind of like

299
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:19,000
bridge the gap before the Organics

300
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:23,278
become available or or like what is your

301
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,600
right well I I top dress um maybe once a

302
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:27,958
month okay so that's on schedule no

303
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,519
matter if it's uh fertilizer or not it's

304
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:32,958
getting that top dress just to keep that

305
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:36,159
soil um well when it's in the flower

306
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:39,039
tent I'm giving it uh flower girl Dr

307
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:42,360
Earth it's the uh flower

308
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:45,559
bloom uh formula is that a dry Amendment

309
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,079
or dry Amendment yeah okay mhm cool I

310
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:51,559
have that mixed with roasted uh banana

311
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:54,679
peels and I just kind of add that every

312
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:57,879
month and keep keep things going but

313
00:12:54,679 --> 00:13:00,599
daily I use uh te's I have the air

314
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:05,240
bubblers okay um and I stick them in the

315
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:07,920
one gallon jugs uh four gallons for my

316
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,480
flower tent every other day is what I

317
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:14,078
have it down

318
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:17,079
to so how long do you broom for uh 24

319
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:19,879
hours okay so I just stick a little

320
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:21,239
nozzle in there add the teas on top you

321
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:25,360
know a little

322
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:29,720
sugar um depending on I have I use the

323
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,399
clear jugs for flour and the uh

324
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,240
they're white my boys drink a lot of

325
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:36,240
milk so they're like white jugs for the

326
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,000
for the ones that are green so anything

327
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,120
that's green it's getting stuff in the

328
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,039
white anything that's just flour only

329
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,078
it's going to be mostly water aired

330
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:49,439
water a little bit of banana peel but

331
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:50,479
mostly just that water um okay you know

332
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,360
and so that's how I just keep them

333
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,560
rolling bubble them and then set it and

334
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,440
forget

335
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:59,679
it oh excuse me

336
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,160
um and I think that's the thing about

337
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,679
Organics that uh you know it gives you

338
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:08,439
that things can work behind the scenes

339
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:10,198
you know you get those microbes bubbling

340
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,000
just let it sit for 24 hours you know

341
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:14,439
it's working that whole 24 hours you're

342
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,958
just doing your regular life come back

343
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:20,639
water and it seems uh seems to be seems

344
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:23,439
to be doing all right nice I mean all

345
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,839
your flowers on Instagram uh are are

346
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,759
great and uh for all the listeners I'll

347
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:32,040
I'll definitely have uh 2an Sam's

348
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,399
Instagram in the description but uh it's

349
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:38,240
uh @ 2an Sam on Instagram is that

350
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,639
correct yeah tanor Sam something like

351
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,759
that all

352
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:46,320
right um so with with your grow setup do

353
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:50,800
you I if I remember correctly you were

354
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:53,320
using both like uh HPS and led in one

355
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:56,159
tent setup to T to get like the

356
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,120
different uh tpine expressions from the

357
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,078
different uh wavelengths like the

358
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,959
different light quality

359
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:03,120
um is that still what you're doing

360
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:05,159
absolutely

361
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,399
definitely do you want to explain your

362
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:10,399
like philosophy behind that a little bit

363
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:13,559
well sure it's it's twofold it's

364
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:16,320
practical for one you might say well

365
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:17,919
practical I grow in a basement you know

366
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,480
the the grow space is like the

367
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,360
afterthought of my house you know

368
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,600
everything else was put in nice and like

369
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,560
all right where can I put a tent all

370
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,680
right there's a spot in the boiler room

371
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:29,078
that's been cold and forgotten about you

372
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:32,039
know here you can have this area yeah

373
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:34,439
it's cold down there um in the winter

374
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:36,679
you need that HPS you know when that

375
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,360
thing's not on it's 60° down there as

376
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:41,039
soon as it cranks up the veg tent starts

377
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:46,159
heating up everything starts heating up

378
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:52,480
so I have a 4x4 and it's a a 600 wat HPS

379
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:55,639
and a um Mars Hydro SP 3000 it's like a

380
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,720
300 watt bar so it's it's probably a

381
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:59,759
little overpowered light for the space

382
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,480
but you know

383
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:06,959
it's it's not too bad you know I think

384
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:09,639
is the uh is the 600 watt dimmable uh no

385
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:12,679
no okay but the Mars Hydro you can dim

386
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,879
it is dimable yeah it is dimmable I keep

387
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:19,239
them both on full blast you know I'm not

388
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:21,360
te guy you know PP whatever light blast

389
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,399
uh ppfd people sometimes try to stay

390
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,839
within a range I just kind of let it rip

391
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,278
100% you know all the time and the

392
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:31,040
plants kind of get used to it you know I

393
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:33,198
feel like if you're consistently one way

394
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,679
the plants will just adjust and or they

395
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:36,758
won't you know you have those strains

396
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:39,078
that are just like roasted and

397
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:42,600
occasionally I'll post them the roasted

398
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:45,359
tops um you know but everything under

399
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,120
those roasted tops are going to be like

400
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,839
rock hard you could beat someone with

401
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,639
the nugs they're going to be so thick so

402
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,560
um we even in the like uh commercial

403
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,519
space we'll sometimes say you know if

404
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,359
you sacrifice a couple of those very

405
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:00,799
Tippy tops everything below it is

406
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,759
and and everything below it is perfect

407
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,918
then it's like well you're that means

408
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:06,360
you're maxing out the ppfd across most

409
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:09,679
of the canopy and if you have a couple

410
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:12,078
of hot spots you know that's

411
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,400
one it's probably better it's probably

412
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:15,959
like the overall yield is going to be

413
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,519
better because if you have no like

414
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,839
extremely hot spots that means that

415
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:20,558
there's definitely going to be parts of

416
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:22,759
the canopy that are below the ideal

417
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:25,639
level as well right right you're not

418
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:29,558
pushing it to that limit

419
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:31,559
yeah so um and and it me if I'm wrong

420
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:34,399
but you kind of do like a Perpetual

421
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:37,480
flower uh tent so like you you're you're

422
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,320
never really shutting it down um unless

423
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,519
you unless you do and you pull things

424
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:44,038
out and clean it or I only yeah yeah

425
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:46,160
right that's that's how it should be you

426
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:48,960
know as I clean it every 3 months or

427
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,519
what would be great but um typically

428
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,440
that thing only gets emptied when it's

429
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:55,240
catastrophic failure

430
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,798
involved something goes uh something

431
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,480
goes haywire and I have to take

432
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:02,319
everything out or whatever else cuz it's

433
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,558
probably about you know I don't want to

434
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:08,079
get too detailed but it's it's a decent

435
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,079
amount of plants in there

436
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:14,399
um every every Monday I try to clip two

437
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,038
to three plants so it's

438
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,038
constantly trying to overfill the space

439
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:22,679
you know is it a mi and I also run uh a

440
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:25,200
lot of regular SE regular seeds from you

441
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:27,400
know testers and things so it's

442
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,880
constantly not wanting to give too much

443
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,440
light to un proven like cuz it could be

444
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,960
a male you don't want to put them on

445
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,080
Front Street so it's constantly managing

446
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,880
like you know what needs the light and

447
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:41,038
what doesn't but it's a labor of love

448
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,400
you know you I I like to do it it's it's

449
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:47,000
like it's like therapy it's

450
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:49,679
yoga so I totally feel that I love I do

451
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,558
definitely love it as well it's like a

452
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:56,480
it's it's kind of being Zen being in the

453
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:59,678
garden I like it yeah you know what uh

454
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,079
so just because this is is where my mind

455
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:05,320
always goes to when I hear Perpetual

456
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:10,038
growing uh what is your what are your

457
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:11,798
like IPM practices um okay yeah cuz for

458
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:14,119
me that was like it's one of the biggest

459
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:16,319
things at least in a commercial space

460
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:18,839
where having a Perpetual grow like say

461
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:21,119
in a greenhouse where you have let's say

462
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:25,678
five or six rows uh and you're like

463
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:27,079
swapping one row out every 10 or 14 days

464
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,798
uh so you're like harvesting one and

465
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:32,519
moving one in and uh like that I I

466
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:35,000
always am like how if you are spraying

467
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:37,000
how are you not getting overdrift if you

468
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,960
not spraying how are you like are you

469
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,079
running beneficials or so sorry I'm I'm

470
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,798
rambling but please explain I would love

471
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:48,038
to hear how like your philosophy I I

472
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:51,480
think that is the Achilles heel of the

473
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:53,839
Perpetual grow um my dad is always

474
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,440
telling me shut it down come on you got

475
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:59,519
to cuz he runs segments and everything

476
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,919
else so it that is Kelly's healing it

477
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:06,639
did take me a while to figure out but

478
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:08,880
um it's two things it's you can

479
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,880
either it's like a it's like a steel

480
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,919
Fortress you can create that steel

481
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,840
Fortress if something gets in God help

482
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,360
you you know but if you just keep a Ste

483
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:22,319
Fortress then nothing can get in and for

484
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:25,000
a while that's what I did but as any

485
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,639
grower you get cocky you get clones you

486
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,079
have buddies who want to send you these

487
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,600
things and lo and behold I got spider

488
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:34,480
mites I got

489
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:36,279
thrips um you know it was hell you know

490
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,120
I didn't know what to fungus well fungus

491
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:40,798
n is the only thing that uh I still

492
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:42,479
haven't defeated those bastards um once

493
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:47,038
in a while you you'll see them floating

494
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:50,960
around but um IPM I've started doing and

495
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:52,519
I've defeated all those uh so to speak

496
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,159
haven't seen anything haven't seen any

497
00:20:52,519 --> 00:21:01,158
signs in probably about a year and a

498
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:04,240
half um but you know it's about spraying

499
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:07,600
every every other watering I'm spraying

500
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,480
I spray the base like the the soil level

501
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:13,918
MH um I get the basically just and I

502
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,679
skirt uh the plant so that first three

503
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,400
four inches of the plant it's just all

504
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:21,200
stem so I spray the base and the stem

505
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,400
and that's where I focus on and that's

506
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,080
how I can spray in flour and whatever

507
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:29,559
else cuz I'm spraying straight to the

508
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:32,798
base of the plant um what are you spray

509
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:36,278
um I use uh Dr Bronner's the uh

510
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:42,079
peppermint the oil I use that mixed with

511
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:46,079
a Lost Coast okay um and that also the

512
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:48,678
the final uh icing on the cake is the

513
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:50,759
alcohol level if there's nothing going

514
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:53,120
on I may not add alcohol but if their

515
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:55,240
fungus knats popping up then I'll put a

516
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:59,278
little alcohol in there to spice it up

517
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:03,079
for them okay um

518
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:05,960
and have you um have you ever tried

519
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:08,399
nematodes I have yeah I've I've tried

520
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:11,759
nematodes it helps don't get me wrong it

521
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,880
does help but man these fungus snats I

522
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:17,079
don't know what I have I must have the

523
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:19,760
African fungus n they hunt us oh my gosh

524
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:22,359
um you know they they they defeat

525
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:27,359
anything I've literally you know done

526
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:29,479
the nematodes the the de I have mosquito

527
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:33,119
bits at every that's what I find is most

528
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:35,759
effective mosquito bits um

529
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:38,359
nematodes it's just you know sand I've

530
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:41,440
tried play sand it you need everything

531
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:43,278
you literally need to combo punch them

532
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,120
to to slow them down that's the only

533
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:47,038
thing that it's like they just don't go

534
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:49,359
away because I have so much organic soil

535
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:51,079
it's always has to be somewhat wet I can

536
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:53,439
never just say you know what bone dry

537
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:57,158
everything CU then for sure things will

538
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,798
get real unhappy so are you using are

539
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:02,039
you using plastic pots or uh fabric pots

540
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:04,079
I use fabric pots and that's another

541
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:06,000
headache you know so it's it's keeping

542
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,240
everything somewhat moist cuz now I

543
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,759
don't want to get hydrophobic and then

544
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:14,798
everything's a mess so that is the that

545
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:16,278
is my everyone has their cross to bear

546
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:18,079
and you know it could be worse than

547
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:20,159
fungus knats you know I got stickies

548
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:23,278
everywhere and that's just what you got

549
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:27,360
to do more stickies you know more

550
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:29,480
mosquito bits y but um you know they're

551
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:31,319
harmless relative they're just annoying

552
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,558
and they ruin pictures that's the most

553
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:35,480
important thing they ruin getting them

554
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:38,319
out of the [ __ ] buds yeah you know

555
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,079
what a pain that's that's really that's

556
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,079
at the worst of times now it's just one

557
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:45,678
in a while once in a while to fly around

558
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:47,439
so for sure I mean like smoking outdoor

559
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,080
you're going to not only be smoking some

560
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,840
fungus knats and some some bugs and

561
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:55,439
beagles but you're also smoking dust and

562
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:57,439
dirt and anything else that was kicked

563
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,600
up in the air so sure you got spiders

564
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,880
thinking it's that's their hangout spot

565
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,678
all kinds of things bunch of spider silk

566
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,200
spider web all over your buds

567
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:09,360
yeah so um I guess yeah a couple of

568
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,200
fungus nuts aren't the worst thing I

569
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:14,119
don't I would say protein but we're not

570
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,558
eating it I don't know if you need that

571
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:19,558
in your lungs but hey study for another

572
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:21,759
day yeah maybe maybe you got to see the

573
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:24,278
impacts of fungus snack

574
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:26,720
combustion oh that's funny um in my

575
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:29,119
pictures you always see uh fresh fresh

576
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,720
yellow tapes around just to uh I think

577
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,479
those are good at catching them but it's

578
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,278
also good at finding out when things are

579
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,720
really kicking around you know for sure

580
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:41,640
and also if you're like dealing with

581
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:43,720
fungus Nets and or root aphids they look

582
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,880
like the Flyers can look very similar if

583
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,200
you're just catching them out of the

584
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,960
corner of your eye but if you if you

585
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,360
like have them on the on the sticky trap

586
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,399
then you can definitely identify the

587
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:56,038
difference between the two so it's uh

588
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:57,639
yeah I I think that sticky traps are

589
00:24:56,038 --> 00:25:00,960
pretty clutch not only for catching them

590
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:04,278
but for identif in for sure yeah

591
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,200
definitely so you mentioned earlier that

592
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:08,079
your dad you know was giving you some

593
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,960
suggestions on being like hey clean out

594
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:12,599
the tent clean out the tent cuz and it

595
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,278
sounds like he might grow as well so I

596
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:17,519
um I want to steer the conversation just

597
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:20,240
back a little bit and be like so who did

598
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:23,720
you learn to grow from uh yeah funny

599
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:27,240
funny enough he never told me that he

600
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,880
grew he was always a stickler about me

601
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:32,359
not smoking

602
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,120
okay so but basically his rationale was

603
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:37,719
he wanted me to find my own path he

604
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:42,079
didn't want me to be swayed by any that

605
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:43,960
he did or whatever else so he but you

606
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:46,879
know he's an old school type of grower

607
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:50,038
you know um he's not caring about

608
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,360
humidity you know he's he's gotten more

609
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:55,119
into it since I've gotten into it and

610
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:55,119
I've kind of

611
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:02,398
I'm like dude there's no way he's like

612
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:04,398
I'll show you and then he brought me

613
00:26:02,398 --> 00:26:06,439
back and then he opened this little

614
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:10,038
closet that I thought cuz he's an avid

615
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:12,798
gunsman so I thought it was a gun safe

616
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:16,000
it was a freaking tent that he had you

617
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:18,440
know foil papered out and he's like you

618
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,319
never smelled anything you know I'm like

619
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,759
dude if I would have smelled something I

620
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:23,639
would have thought it was me and I would

621
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,960
have lost my head and I would have

622
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,679
started cleaning up and no telling what

623
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:32,798
I would have done oh that's so funny you

624
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:34,880
know so yeah he grew a little bit but

625
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:38,119
that's so funny cuz uh when I was

626
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,679
growing up my parents had this like shop

627
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:44,798
shed like kind of like a leant to shed

628
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,880
with like uh the the clear corated

629
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:49,879
plastic on one side but it was like that

630
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,799
opaque green stuff that right right was

631
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:56,200
kind of ubiquitous for a while back in

632
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:57,679
like the 9s and uh and my brother and I

633
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,880
weren't allowed in there but every

634
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,480
summer we always said that the skunks

635
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,720
got really bad cuz living in California

636
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,200
at the time you know we would we would

637
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,880
just skunk skunks all the time but

638
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,120
especially in spring because that's like

639
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,039
when they're mating and whatnot you get

640
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:16,798
like so many skunk smells but then like

641
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:19,158
in summer we we would get a lot of skunk

642
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,720
smells right near the house and my

643
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:22,360
parents would always be like oh be be

644
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:26,000
careful if you go outside watch for

645
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:27,719
skunks so you don't get sprayed and uh

646
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,278
and then after a while they told me that

647
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,640
they were they had like a little tiny

648
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:33,679
grow in there and it was like just like

649
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:36,159
a little Greenhouse mini grow it was

650
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,519
just enough for my dad because he had uh

651
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,919
he was using it for like essential

652
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:43,240
tremor and stuff and I was like after I

653
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:45,840
learned that I was like what the [ __ ] I

654
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,200
had no idea I just thought that we had

655
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:51,319
skunks all the time and I was like just

656
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:54,120
you know of course young and naive no

657
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:55,558
that's that's funny man that's how

658
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:57,319
that's how it is like you don't you

659
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:59,398
don't question it until you get older

660
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:00,639
maybe or they tell something they could

661
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:05,398
tell you

662
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:07,799
anything yep but uh so if uh since your

663
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:09,839
dad didn't tell you but was growing so

664
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:11,440
who who where did you kind of like get

665
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,359
your inspiration to start growing

666
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,399
cannabis cuz it sounds like you you

667
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:17,519
started with a cactus and where did it

668
00:28:15,398 --> 00:28:20,359
go to from there it started with a

669
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:22,519
cactus and then it was uh going on eBay

670
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:25,278
for trying to buy cannabis seeds on eBay

671
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:27,359
you know you had to use secret codes it

672
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:30,278
was like it was written in like certain

673
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:33,319
descriptions and so I bought some White

674
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:36,880
Widow quote unquote seeds and I was in

675
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:38,720
an apartment at the time um so I'm like

676
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,519
all right I'll just grow it veg it

677
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,360
inside and then I'll throw it outside

678
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:43,720
and'll flour and I'll worry about it

679
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:47,839
then but I don't have to worry about the

680
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:51,640
smell until flower okay so I hooked up a

681
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:54,839
little setup in my uh in my office

682
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:57,038
desk and I'm vegging it out and the

683
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:58,599
things just start stinking you know next

684
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:00,720
thing I know the whole of I'm like wait

685
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:02,678
is that me I'm like yeah no that's just

686
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,278
I'm just being paranoid I'm like wait no

687
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:06,919
it really smells like how's this

688
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:10,720
possible obviously I know things can

689
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:14,200
smell in veg but um so that was kind of

690
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,600
my first uh you know just just curiosity

691
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:20,278
you know just wanting

692
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:23,240
to grow cannabis you know I I I've grown

693
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:24,720
other like potted plants but not really

694
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,038
cared for something typically with a

695
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,640
potted plant you water it when you

696
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:29,960
remember and it's kind of like yeah you

697
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,720
know not all right great but to like

698
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,440
have an attachment to like oh [ __ ] this

699
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,600
is important can't screw this up can't

700
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,840
screw this up yeah it was that uh desk

701
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:43,119
White Widow you know I ended up uh

702
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:45,000
throwing it outside got way too smelly

703
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:49,119
way too big so then I had to start

704
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,200
growing tomatoes to mask the herbs that

705
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:53,398
I had going on so I started growing

706
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,600
tomatoes in front of it and it was just

707
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:59,278
a whole thing um and this was just at

708
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:00,879
some apartment in New York uh in Queens

709
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,960
yeah my first

710
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,760
apartment so uh my landlord he's some

711
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,038
you know he's a nice Jewish man but he

712
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:10,158
definitely wouldn't be down with any any

713
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:12,398
no type of type of funny business like

714
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,000
that so that's why I had to grow the

715
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:16,199
garden and wow what a nice Garden like

716
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,480
yeah

717
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:23,120
yeah so he was right there like he saw

718
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:24,759
he saw the the tomatoes growing at least

719
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,119
he saw the tomatoes growing and then I

720
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:29,720
had to make a cage because the buds just

721
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:33,038
would not stay down so I just had to tie

722
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:36,120
them down you know at all costs oh so

723
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:37,960
like almost making like a a scrog exct

724
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:41,359
to keep it lower to the ground frog

725
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:43,278
right oh that's so funny so I mean from

726
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:46,000
what I've heard that's some of the first

727
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:47,679
uses of like of scrogging for outdoor

728
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,679
plants is just to keep them below the

729
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:54,000
fence line so yeah and it it worked

730
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,720
wonders you know I couldn't believe how

731
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,839
well it was going so that's kind of

732
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,240
really just got me going but how many

733
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:05,519
years ago is

734
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:09,159
that man that's going back

735
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:11,798
maybe eight nine years of at this time

736
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:14,720
um wow so it was a you really think that

737
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:14,720
your landlord didn't

738
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:21,480
know I I I'm not sure you know I took a

739
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,480
lot of great pains to but you know when

740
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,200
you like you think about things and you

741
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,000
think back on it like there's no way

742
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,440
that smell you know it was and then once

743
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,200
I clipped it it's like all right where

744
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,360
do I he might have just thought I just

745
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,399
was smoking at the time you know maybe

746
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:38,240
he didn't think it was growing but he

747
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:40,638
knew something was going on because now

748
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,759
once I once I clipped it I couldn't put

749
00:31:40,638 --> 00:31:44,678
it anywhere you know it's just like the

750
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:47,440
smell just kept getting worse and worse

751
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:51,200
so um how did you dry it like in the

752
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:53,320
apartment I I first attempted to dry it

753
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,120
I had a grill at the time and you know

754
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:58,079
under the grill there's like that little

755
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:00,000
space so I made like a little in the the

756
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,918
thick of the night I went out and made

757
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,240
like a fishing line and I hung it up and

758
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:06,559
I did this whole setup but eventually I

759
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,120
said all right this not working and I

760
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:10,720
made Edibles with it okay brought it

761
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:12,038
inside and I just started cooking it

762
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,440
down I was like all right I just got to

763
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:16,638
cook this up and hopefully mean even the

764
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:20,000
cooking is going to be smelly as [ __ ] it

765
00:32:16,638 --> 00:32:22,839
was smelly man it was it was it was a it

766
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,200
was definitely a rough uh you know a

767
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:26,558
rough week and a half experimenting with

768
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,159
it was a good experience you know in the

769
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:32,480
end it now I look back on it how silly I

770
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:34,840
was but I wasn't on Instagram then you

771
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,480
know it kind of okay yeah I didn't I

772
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:38,879
thought Instagram was for kids back then

773
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,278
you know I'm a old school guy I thought

774
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,519
Instagram please you know so it was a

775
00:32:42,278 --> 00:32:48,278
whole new world once I started Instagram

776
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:50,359
you know it was like literally you know

777
00:32:48,278 --> 00:32:51,919
the lights turned on like holy I've been

778
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:54,599
doing this in the dark the whole time

779
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,759
literally just feeling around oh this

780
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:58,959
seems right all right once I got to

781
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:00,879
Instagram I realized all the things I

782
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,319
did wrong you know

783
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,080
so it was a pretty good experience

784
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:07,798
learning you know just on your own you

785
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:10,879
got to make mistakes and do stupid

786
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:14,879
things but uh you

787
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,679
know I mean that's that's such a great

788
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,760
story though for like a a first time

789
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:22,360
grow like not only like you were able to

790
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:25,079
even get it successfully harvested but

791
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:27,119
then just you know I I feel like it's

792
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:30,000
it's one of those lessons that so many

793
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:32,839
Growers now are are like I people like

794
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,240
me and I'm sure even like yourself if

795
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:36,638
people have asked you for help uh you're

796
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,839
telling them make sure that you have a

797
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:41,719
good drying space like and don't don't

798
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:43,558
wait until you harvest to figure out

799
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:46,720
where you're going to dry your bud or

800
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:49,240
how you're going to dry it um it's not

801
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,000
sexy that's not a sexy answer you know

802
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,359
it's not and it's the most important

803
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,319
part like exactly you can take

804
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:58,240
mediocrely grown weed and give it a

805
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:00,038
really nice dry and cure

806
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,519
and have it be something that you're

807
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:04,759

00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,440
here you know what I mean you don't want

882
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:27,759
to start like oh it's only one plant

883
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,920
he's going to grow it's like oh sure

884
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,560
let's let us know who we have from Jump

885
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,119
Street there are some skunks shouldering

886
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:36,199
a lot of heavy load in my neighborhood

887
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:39,240
I'll tell you that much that's funny

888
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:43,879
yeah the heavy load of the blame oh

889
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:46,039
yeah but um you so I mean uh it sounds

890
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,559
like you were a consumer far before you

891
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:51,318
were a grower is that uh correct to say

892
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:53,039
okay definitely definitely and so like

893
00:37:51,318 --> 00:37:55,119
uh what was your first experience

894
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:58,759
smoking

895
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,838
then um that was with my buddies back in

896
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:04,160
high school we had this buddy you know

897
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:05,920
we all had I went to a private school so

898
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:09,039
a couple of my buddies had real strict

899
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,838
parents okay but one of my buddies who

900
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:14,599
drove he his dad would work late on

901
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:16,679
Mondays so every Monday night it became

902
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:20,119
like a tradition we'd meet up we'd sneak

903
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:23,199
out of the house by any you know means

904
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:26,000
necessary and I think this was maybe

905
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:28,759
senior year of high school and every

906
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,358
Monday man we just smoke and have a good

907
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:33,319
time and always look forward to Mondays

908
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:36,000
everyone bitching about Mondays we could

909
00:38:33,318 --> 00:38:38,639
not wait for Mondays to roll around all

910
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,838
we had to do was go to school and soon

911
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:45,759
we'd be high that's great so um that's

912
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:47,960
kind of how it started for us and then

913
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,680
uh so like what like with your first

914
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,800
grow where you went to get those white

915
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:53,039
widow seeds what inspired you to grow

916
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:57,640
like was it just something where you

917
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:59,599
wanted to um like you you were like well

918
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:01,480
I know that this flower comes from some

919
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,400
plant so I might as well figure out what

920
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,719
that plant's about or or did somebody

921
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,039
like did you see somebody growing and be

922
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:11,078

923
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:14,079

roof we were paying those and you know

959
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:42,000
it was either I was going to grow and

960
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:43,519

970
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:15,719
ounce I'm almost embarr like wait that

971
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:17,440
can't be real it was real like you know

972
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:18,480
what were the names you were paying for

973
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,720
cuz I feel like

974
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:26,079
that's you know you were going after the

975
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:29,159
the the the cookies whatever oh the fake

976
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,160
myars were so oh man those myars we'd

977
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:35,318
get so many of those little blue cookie

978
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:38,440
myars and Gary Payton and you know like

979
00:41:35,318 --> 00:41:41,279
bring me all of that stuff but um it was

980
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,358
just a lot of names you know whatever

981
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,400
but I didn't discriminate I wanted it

982
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:48,799
all you know I didn't run into one batch

983
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:50,960
that I didn't like so for me it's like I

984
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,240
just you know and I guess I'm lucky in

985
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,240
that sense I don't some people don't

986
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:57,639
like Girl Scout cookies oh it makes me

987
00:41:55,239 --> 00:42:01,078
feel a certain way and you know that to

988
00:41:57,639 --> 00:42:03,440
me is is terrible you know imag you know

989
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:06,119
that's so unfortunate you know it's I

990
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,960
smoke it and it's great you know I

991
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:11,240
that's great too yeah you know I I think

992
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:13,760
everything is kind of good so it's like

993
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:16,519
you yes you have preferences but at the

994
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,480
end of the day it's like what sex is bad

995
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:20,039
sex exactly you know just the the one

996
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:24,199
that I'm not having you know that's

997
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:27,838
that's the real answer so

998
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:29,358
um I can dig that answer yeah you know

999
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:32,279
so that's

1000
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:34,358
funny but yeah I I totally agree I feel

1001
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,359
like sometimes it's like the uh the

1002
00:42:34,358 --> 00:42:37,519
bandwagon effect almost for some of the

1003
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:40,078
hatred that some of these different

1004
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:42,280
strains get and whatnot and it's like I

1005
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:46,318
don't I don't know if it's

1006
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:49,040
uh if it's warranted you know like uh

1007
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:51,719
based on the the actual flower itself I

1008
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:54,838
think it's more about like the the

1009
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:57,239
culture uh and and what what specific

1010
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:59,159
people are saying about it and you know

1011
00:42:57,239 --> 00:43:02,838
know what in group they're part of

1012
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:05,279
that's being like yeah F this or F that

1013
00:43:02,838 --> 00:43:06,759
or we give our seal of approval to this

1014
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,720
or to that

1015
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:11,400
and yeah cuz like as a grower you know

1016
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:13,838
there's so many different factors that

1017
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,400
come into it like oh you didn't like

1018
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:19,838
that oh well how was it grown when was

1019
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:23,039

1020
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:25,639

1023
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:33,160
could have happened to that particular

1024
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:35,199
batch was it a pheno thing was it a cut

00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:43,318
of your buddies rolled the blunt and was

1029

1041
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:14,640
funny that's funny Mis Mis associating

1042
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:17,838
who's to blame yeah

1043
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:20,400
um well um so so throughout your your

1044
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:22,599
growing experiences what was one of the

1045
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,680
times where you look back at and it was

1046
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:27,400
like one of your biggest learning

1047
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:30,118
experiences uh whether it be due to like

1048
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,639
um like let's maybe ask it in two in two

1049
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:34,240
ways so like what was your biggest

1050
00:44:31,639 --> 00:44:35,519
learning experience due to a setback and

1051
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:38,799
then what was your biggest learning

1052
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:42,079
experience due to uh

1053
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:47,200
success biggest learning experience due

1054
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:48,119
to a setback um that would be letting in

1055
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:51,239
the

1056
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:54,358
bugs that was my own fault you know you

1057
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:58,118
just don't know you know I I took in

1058
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:59,960
clones from outside like of you know for

1059
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:03,160
friends or whatever but I also literally

1060
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:06,679
took in clones from outside I took in

1061
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:08,759
clones from my greenhouse and I thought

1062
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:10,759
what I know what I know now was not a

1063
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,480
thorough IPM at the time I'm like oh

1064
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:15,480
there's no way a bug could last through

1065
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,838
this it's it's cold water I'm splashing

1066
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:20,039
on the thing you know it's like dude did

1067
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:22,679
you put oil did you sulfur did you oh

1068
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:26,639
you just ran water over it oh great you

1069
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:28,838
know so getting spider mes uh defeating

1070
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:32,000
those things it was tough because

1071
00:45:28,838 --> 00:45:34,639
Perpetual I'd think I got it and then it

1072
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:39,199
would sneak around somehow and I'd find

1073
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:41,719
him again um so that was and I I threw I

1074
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:43,838
lost Cuts you know I that that was a big

1075
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:46,239
one that was my first like um you know

1076
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:49,239
you think the world is going to end oh

1077
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:52,399
like girl it's ruined finished and now

1078
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:55,118
it's like a people yeah you know I was I

1079
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,519
was I was really you know not to say I

1080
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,079
was going to stop growing but I was

1081
00:45:56,519 --> 00:46:00,719
really

1082
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:02,559
demoralized um at one point over spider

1083
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:05,799
Ms you know I think about it now like

1084
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:09,240
who cares about spider you know just no

1085
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:12,800
big deal spray them you know yeah it's

1086
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:15,039
crazy what what like a a bad infestation

1087
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:17,039
will do to the the mor the morale of a

1088
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:21,079
grower like I don't know if you've ever

1089
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:24,960
dealt with rude AIDS before but man no

1090
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:27,480
oh it is it is just so depressing to

1091
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,440
deal with because like

1092
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:33,920
not only do they just make a mess cuz

1093
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:37,119
they they grow and repopulate so fast um

1094
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:40,280
and like they they like stain all your

1095
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:42,200
trays and you got to like it takes like

1096
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,800
multiple cleaning Cycles to get the

1097
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:46,639
stains removed from their just dead dead

1098
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,318
bodies and you got to wash the trays

1099
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:51,598
down every day if you don't want it to

1100
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:54,000
build up and they like they can

1101
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:56,200
sometimes become

1102
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,079
uh I don't know the term but they'll

1103
00:46:56,199 --> 00:47:01,639
basically go from just being something

1104
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:03,599
that's in the in the soil uh to where

1105
00:47:01,639 --> 00:47:05,838
they'll they'll climb up into the canopy

1106
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,280
and start to repopulate there as well so

1107
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:10,679
you start to just have like actual uh

1108
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:13,119
aphid problems where it's like you got

1109
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:15,639
honeydew on all your leaves and on some

1110
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:19,480
of your buds and they'll like crawl into

1111
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:22,558
the nooks and crannies and oh it's they

1112
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:25,119
are and and they're so hard to get rid

1113
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:27,160
of because they'll like they burrow way

1114
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,079
into like like fungus Nets you know like

1115
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:30,318
they're just once you have them like

1116
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:34,599
it's almost like impossible to

1117
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:37,358
completely eradicate them um and so yeah

1118
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:39,960
I've if if you haven't dealt with uh rud

1119
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:42,358
aids for all the listeners and for you

1120
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:45,318
as well Sam I I would never wish that on

1121
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:47,598
my worst enemy it is by far my least

1122
00:47:45,318 --> 00:47:50,639
favorite pest to deal with that or

1123
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:52,280
thrips because thrips can just if you

1124
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:55,000
have like hops slate and virate or

1125
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:58,680
something and in and if it's like at a

1126
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:01,318
low uh threshold of of pressure it'll

1127
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:03,159
it'll explode the pressure in like no

1128
00:48:01,318 --> 00:48:06,440
time

1129
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:09,679
flat yeah I think uh I think everyone

1130
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:12,800
should have an experience with uh pest J

1131
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:14,440
just just to give you that you know that

1132
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,480
[ __ ] in your armor just to give you

1133
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:19,519
that that tool in your belt it does make

1134
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:21,358
you more resilient yeah you know I

1135
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:23,599
remember at the time I thought that I

1136
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:26,880
wore that as a badge of honor I've never

1137
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:28,200
had any bugs like it was saying you know

1138
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,880
like yeah you haven't been growing that

1139
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:34,318
long pal so you know and if you say my

1140
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:35,880
new spot has never had bugs and it's

1141
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:38,119
been that way for 5 years then I'm going

1142
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:40,838
to be like damn you're you have really

1143
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:43,200
good IPM practices right exactly you've

1144
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:45,759
you've learned you've burned and you

1145
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:47,199
implemented you know not not to say

1146
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,200
you've never exper then it's like all

1147
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:51,879
right just if anything hits you it's

1148
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:53,679
going to topple you like bricks yeah cuz

1149
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:57,798
if you don't cuz like there's such a

1150
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:59,598
huge uh like variety of weapons in Your

1151
00:48:57,798 --> 00:49:01,920
Arsenal for

1152
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,720
IPM that but they all have like

1153
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,159
different targeted approaches and

1154
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:10,239
different uh targeted applications sure

1155
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:12,558
if you don't if you don't know you know

1156
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:15,318
it's I I don't have a good analogy for

1157
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:17,240
it or like when you're using the uh oil

1158
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:18,920
you can't use the oil with certain

1159
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:22,838
sprays or you'll burn the hell out of

1160
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:25,480
the leaves you know sulfur no oil o

1161
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:27,039
together yep absolutely so I'm dipping

1162
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,960
them in Sulfur and then spraying them

1163
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:32,199
with oh what the hell's going on here

1164
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:35,199
what's you know I'm and if if you do get

1165
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:38,078
a new product right it it shows you like

1166
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:40,159
uh application per acre in a lot of

1167
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:44,000
cases and you're looking at that as a

1168
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:47,199
direction be like how the what what is

1169
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,000
an what how do I convert tent what is

1170
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:52,199
the acre to tent conversion ratio you

1171
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,079
know like it doesn't that's when you rub

1172
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:55,798
your chin two times and you say ah I

1173
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,760
guess I'll use a little bit yeah I guess

1174
00:49:55,798 --> 00:50:00,280
I'll use a little bit

1175
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,280
hopefully it works uh but then even even

1176
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:04,119
there like I don't know if you've

1177
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,680
listened to any of the stuff by like uh

1178
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:09,400
Suzanne uh Wayne Wright Evans I believe

1179
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:11,639
is her name she's like the bug lady on

1180
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,880
Instagram and she's been on like the uh

1181
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:17,440
the kiss Organics podcast a few times

1182
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:19,920
and she has I like through listening to

1183
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,240
her I've heard you know like you have to

1184
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,920
there's there's a reason why things have

1185
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:26,798
certain application rates cuz if you go

1186
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:29,200
over then in some cases it might not

1187
00:50:26,798 --> 00:50:31,759
work and then if you go under in a lot

1188
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:33,519
of cases it won't work and uh and then

1189
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,920
if you if you're also going over then

1190
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:37,318
you have like the phytotoxicity

1191
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,519
potentials within the plants where

1192
00:50:37,318 --> 00:50:45,519
they'll just burn and melt and turn into

1193
00:50:40,519 --> 00:50:49,199
you know a a brown spotty mess of uh of

1194
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:50,759
decaying plant matter um oh yeah and and

1195
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:54,039
you got to get it like just right just

1196
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:56,319
so it like is just enough to affect the

1197
00:50:54,039 --> 00:50:57,920
the target pest but not enough to burn

1198
00:50:56,318 --> 00:51:00,599
the plant and not too little to not do

1199
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:03,480
anything and just waste products so

1200
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:05,400
that's I it is unfortunate that a lot of

1201
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:08,159
the most effective products only have

1202
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:11,079
these sort of like uh industrial

1203
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:14,000
applications uh in in their in their

1204
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:16,440
like how they perceive their usage is

1205
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
going to be sure and I'm sure once

1206
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:20,039
they're you know once they're marketing

1207
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
for a legal product and not a quote

1208
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:25,000
unquote illegal you know then it'll make

1209
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,159
a lot more sense for them to do it for a

1210
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,960
pot g a five gallon size as opposed to

1211
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:33,480
all right do this per half acre and you

1212
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,400
know it'll make more sense right now

1213
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:37,519
it's I guess it's in limbo land or

1214
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,920
whatever but um and certain companies

1215
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:40,679
are doing it but they're they're also

1216
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:42,798
the ones gouging you probably the most

1217
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:46,159
at this point the ones that are Tak at

1218
00:51:42,798 --> 00:51:49,480
risk and uh any can of product I already

1219
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:53,039
know is going to be charging you a nice

1220
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:55,000
premium exactly and that's that's also I

1221
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:58,039
I feel like that's such a an issue

1222
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,159
because there's so many things out there

1223
00:51:58,039 --> 00:52:02,400
especially when it comes to like

1224
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:06,920
fertilizers or you know pesticides or

1225
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:09,599
herbicides or um even like

1226
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:13,400
uh just like different like

1227
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:17,079
environmental control equipment that are

1228
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:21,519
all used in different Industries um and

1229
00:52:17,079 --> 00:52:24,839
all have like pretty cheap versions that

1230
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:27,199
are still of decently high quality like

1231
00:52:24,838 --> 00:52:29,000
fertilizers comes to mind with that or

1232
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:32,439
you know like buying a a bottled

1233
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,079
fertilizer that has water mixed into it

1234
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,159
you know you're you're paying for like

1235
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:37,920
the shipping cost of that water and and

1236
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:40,480
you're paying for The Branding and the

1237
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:46,159
logo that has you know the different

1238
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:49,318
cannabis related uh um scheme to it

1239
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:52,798
and it you can get like the same thing

1240
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:55,039
at any like major a Supply in a 50 lb

1241
00:52:52,798 --> 00:52:56,960
bag that's going to last you probably

1242
00:52:55,039 --> 00:53:01,119
your entire life if you're just a homeg

1243
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:04,119
grower and it's you know the the 50 lb

1244
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:06,920
bag costs the same as the one qu bottle

1245
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:08,039
at the hydro store it's insane it's

1246
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,960
literally

1247
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:13,239
insane you know but you live and you

1248
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,960
learn and hey it ain't tricking if you

1249
00:53:13,239 --> 00:53:18,798
got it you know if you want to do it all

1250
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:21,079
simple and easy and it's you know it's

1251
00:53:18,798 --> 00:53:23,280
it's cost effective for you I mean I

1252
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:25,960
guess it's cool you know makes sense but

1253
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,960
when you're doing it always all the time

1254
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,318
perpet

1255
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,280
to 3 years from now you know you're

1256
00:53:29,318 --> 00:53:33,239
still going to be growing that's when

1257
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,920
you start to think all right what why

1258
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:36,879
don't I get the biggest size they have

1259
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,280
why don't I go right to the factory look

1260
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,920
at the ingredients you know it makes

1261
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,680
more sense from that some people I guess

1262
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,880
get into it and they don't know if

1263
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:46,039
they're going to be doing it in six

1264
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,358
months you know so they just kind of buy

1265
00:53:46,039 --> 00:53:50,000
the bottles I've been there that's why I

1266
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:53,480
started with you know the fox

1267
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,119
farm man yeah that was it you know

1268
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,440
buying bottles and bottles I'm like all

1269
00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:00,079
right what's up with this p what is this

1270
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,079
Jax one of the guys that I learned from

1271
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:04,240
he's Jack I'm like what is this Jax wow

1272
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:07,240
it's a lot cheaper wow this will last me

1273
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:09,598
a long time you know so so who did teach

1274
00:54:07,239 --> 00:54:11,959
you uh like kind of like your cannabis

1275
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:14,359
growing style or like where did you

1276
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:17,199
where did you develop that from it was

1277
00:54:14,358 --> 00:54:19,279
remember I always I I had a aversion to

1278
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:22,719
Instagram I don't know what I thought at

1279
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:24,920
the time but I just I don't know so I I

1280
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:29,639
ended up joining Facebook and I started

1281
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:32,680
like joining one of these groups and a

1282
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:35,358
Gentleman um that Liv near me live near

1283
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:39,318
the house that I'm in now he was growing

1284
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:41,039

00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,400
Instagram you know I I hate to try to

1294
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:03,919
bust your chops here but you should

1295
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:06,039
really think about uh reconsider yeah I

1296
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:09,880
don't know I don't know but finally I

1297
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:13,719
did and just that in person looking at

1298
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:16,480
things plus learning online it was like

1299
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:18,519
you know just lighter fluid to the fire

1300
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:21,679
you know it was a burning desire I had

1301
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:24,440
to learn but it was you know it was

1302
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:25,960
limited by knowledge by this by that but

1303
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,639
once I don't know I could even use the

1304
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:29,440
internet so many different things I

1305
00:55:27,639 --> 00:55:31,239
could have learned but it's like

1306
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,639
Instagram just turned the lights on and

1307
00:55:31,239 --> 00:55:35,239
made me realize there's so many people

1308
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:38,000
out here growing you know it was like it

1309
00:55:35,239 --> 00:55:40,639
was incredible when I cuz you thought

1310
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,480
it's just me it's just a couple guys you

1311
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:45,798
know and so once you realize that it's a

1312
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,880
whole nation of people out there growing

1313
00:55:45,798 --> 00:55:52,639
together and sharing ideas that's when

1314
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:56,880
my progress just you know

1315
00:55:52,639 --> 00:56:00,920
skyrocketed that's crazy I mean I

1316
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:03,440
guy the dude Francis right

1317
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:06,358

1319
00:56:06,358 --> 00:56:11,078

1321
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:15,640
definitely um yeah it's it's so crazy

1322
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:18,880
cuz yeah I feel like it was like the

1323
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:20,199
secret grow Club forever until like as

1324
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,960
soon as you get introduced to one of

1325
00:56:20,199 --> 00:56:25,598
these larger communities like uh the in

1326
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,838
Instagram Community or uh even like the

1327
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:29,798
different Reddit communities I feel like

1328
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:32,838
there's uh like just so many more people

1329
00:56:29,798 --> 00:56:34,759
growing than you even expected and uh

1330
00:56:32,838 --> 00:56:36,000
it's that's that's definitely I feel

1331
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,960
like the shared information is

1332
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,519
definitely the biggest uh learning curve

1333
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:42,519
that I've had as well so um yeah that's

1334
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:47,000
that's pretty

1335
00:56:42,519 --> 00:56:49,480
awesome um so before we we had done the

1336
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,239
uh like what was your biggest uh

1337
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,639
learning experience from a setback so

1338
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:58,199
what would be your biggest learning

1339
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:58,199
experience from a um a success

1340
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,559
um I would say maybe making my own

1341
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:08,880
seeds uh doing the STS

1342
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:13,119
reversals um learning the difference

1343
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:15,798
between an st STS pollination and a

1344
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:18,519
regular male pollination my first

1345
00:57:15,798 --> 00:57:21,119
pollination was with a reversal so

1346
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:23,838
that's kind of what you know I kind of

1347
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:27,318
had based I did did my research and I

1348
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:28,719
whatever else um so I kind of you know I

1349
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:30,798
did the whole thing and I reversed a

1350
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:32,239
couple plants and you know I was always

1351
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:34,719
like all right you know this is some

1352
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:36,358
pollen but man it's it's not as much as

1353
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:38,199
I thought it would be you know I thought

1354
00:57:36,358 --> 00:57:40,480
these things would and then I started

1355
00:57:38,199 --> 00:57:43,078
working with um

1356
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,599
males and how much pollen the difference

1357
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:46,480
in amount of pollen they were kicking

1358
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:49,400
off and different things like that but

1359
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:52,039
um just creating you know looking at

1360
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:55,240
different mothers and the value of a

1361
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:58,880
pheno hunt you know they're not they're

1362
00:57:55,239 --> 00:58:00,639
not giving you 10 seeds or 15 seeds just

1363
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,640
cuz they want you to have 15 Keepers you

1364
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:06,000
know you you got to sift through and you

1365
00:58:03,639 --> 00:58:08,719
know find that one that really speaks to

1366
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,199
you you know so I think uh just breeding

1367
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:13,279
and making your own seeds so you can pop

1368
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:16,239
all right let me pop 20 today you know

1369
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:18,680
let me pop 25 to you know and be real

1370
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:23,038
specific about who I keep just having

1371
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:24,399
that ability I think you know it it it

1372
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:26,280
affects you differently than When you're

1373
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,798
counting like all right I just paid $200

1374
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:29,359
bucks for these 10 seeds all right

1375
00:58:27,798 --> 00:58:31,199
that's 20 bucks that's 20 bucks all

1376
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:32,759
right I can't waste these you know I

1377
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:36,439
can't call them I just spent 20 bucks

1378
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:37,680
for this seed you know so it's different

1379
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:40,200
when it's like all right I have hundreds

1380
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:43,038
of them throw a handful in and let's see

1381
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:44,639
what happens yeah the the value of seeds

1382
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:48,039
changes when you do your first

1383
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:49,679
pollination cuz you have like you you

1384
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:52,400
sift through them and you're like this

1385
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:54,639
is more seeds off of this tiny little

1386
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,000
plant than I've ever purchased in my

1387
00:58:54,639 --> 00:59:01,078
entire life

1388
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:02,838
100% and and and they're worth how much

1389
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:07,000
it just it's a kind of a glass

1390
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:09,279
shattering moment so like uh are are you

1391
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,798
then um so it sounded like before you

1392
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,798
know you were counting this counting the

1393
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:15,159
seeds as each one being worth as a

1394
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:17,000
certain amount based on like how it

1395
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:20,480
divided out based on how much you spent

1396
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,798
per pack uh and absolutely so I would I

1397
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:24,920
would assume then that you were only

1398
00:59:21,798 --> 00:59:26,358
popping a couple at a time sure I was

1399
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:28,358
very you know and everything was a

1400
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:29,920
keeper like if it grows slow all right

1401
00:59:28,358 --> 00:59:32,199
well I'm going to grow it slow you know

1402
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,880
if if it's wonky well I'm growing a

1403
00:59:32,199 --> 00:59:36,960
wonky plant then you know taking it

1404
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:39,160
whatever I pop I'm taking it to the end

1405
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:41,559
that's just how stubborn I am sometimes

1406
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:43,519
do you so do you still only pop one or

1407
00:59:41,559 --> 00:59:45,440
two out of a pack if you purchase it or

1408
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:49,679
get it as a testing or something or do

1409
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:52,280
you just no rip the whole thing open I

1410
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:55,118
it depends on if I have just one pack

1411
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:57,720
I'll at least try to pop half of it okay

1412
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:59,960
um you know I'm going two if it's

1413
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:02,558
regular seeds I'm putting two in one cup

1414
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:04,400
to fight it out and see who grows better

1415
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:05,960
if it's a lot more you know sometimes I

1416
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,960
put three in one cup if I'm really

1417
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:12,079
feeling frisky like all right I'm GNA be

1418
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:13,920
strict today right you know um so it

1419
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:17,359
gives you that more population listening

1420
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:19,400
to guys like uh CSI and how much numbers

1421
01:00:17,358 --> 01:00:21,880
they go it's like gez I got to get my

1422
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,720
numbers up you know I I want to see more

1423
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:25,559
of what different things have to offer

1424
01:00:23,719 --> 01:00:28,519
and you can see it in real time the

1425
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:31,680
first time time you do it it'll show you

1426
01:00:28,519 --> 01:00:33,159
like wow it is something in doing 10

1427
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:35,879
females as opposed to all right these

1428
01:00:33,159 --> 01:00:37,719
are my best two females you don't know

1429
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,880
but when you have 10 it's like ah I can

1430
01:00:37,719 --> 01:00:41,239
kind of see where the lines going here

1431
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,680
it's like all right here it is on the

1432
01:00:41,239 --> 01:00:46,558
Spectrum you're down here and you're on

1433
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:50,639
the other end for sure so it's kind of

1434
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:52,839
nice yeah I I I uh I think the first

1435
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:56,038
time I I popped seeds I only popped like

1436
01:00:52,838 --> 01:00:58,159
one or two out of a pack and it it was

1437
01:00:56,039 --> 01:01:00,760
just so like

1438
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:02,239
uh I I was almost disappointed because I

1439
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:04,400
was just like this like neither of these

1440
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:06,558
are showing me what I thought that they

1441
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:09,160
were supposed to show based on the the

1442
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:11,400
photos that the Breeders are providing

1443
01:01:09,159 --> 01:01:13,318
and you realize you know after I did a

1444
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:15,880
little research I'm like well so there's

1445
01:01:13,318 --> 01:01:17,599
this thing called pheno hunting and uh

1446
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:19,519
the phenotypic expression of the plant

1447
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:21,720
is going to change based on like not

1448
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:24,079
only the parameters of the grow but also

1449
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:25,759
like what the genetic makeup of it is

1450
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:28,880
and each seed is going to be different

1451
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:31,599
and and you look at that and you go hm

1452
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:34,440
well human beings are pretty unique and

1453
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:36,640
different and uh it seems like cannabis

1454
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:40,358
is pretty similar with uh having a male

1455
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:44,318
and a female provide the um the the

1456
01:01:40,358 --> 01:01:45,679
donation for the genetics and I guess

1457
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:48,920
you're going to just have to search

1458
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:50,960
through a lot uh so that's where I I

1459
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:53,000
just started popping all the seeds from

1460
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:56,318
every pack CU I was like I don't like if

1461
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:59,239
I keep if I keep one or two around still

1462
01:01:56,318 --> 01:02:00,920
uh then like if those are the keepers

1463
01:01:59,239 --> 01:02:03,558
and I don't find it in the first batch

1464
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:04,960
and I spent all that time when I could

1465
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:07,720
have just had a couple more plants

1466
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,960
shoved into the space you know you know

1467
01:02:07,719 --> 01:02:11,558
you might be you might be on to

1468
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:13,720
something with that I've uh you know I

1469
01:02:11,559 --> 01:02:15,559
have a bit of hoarder in my nature so I

1470
01:02:13,719 --> 01:02:18,838
have to fight that instinct all the time

1471
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:20,278
to uh keep those keep those little

1472
01:02:18,838 --> 01:02:23,078
behind just in

1473
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:25,920
case yeah but because it it feels like

1474
01:02:23,079 --> 01:02:29,720
the the logic behind keeping it is what

1475
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:31,760
if those are the keepers you know and by

1476
01:02:29,719 --> 01:02:33,798
that logic at the same time it almost

1477
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:36,839
makes more sense to hunt them all

1478
01:02:33,798 --> 01:02:39,278
because if you're

1479
01:02:36,838 --> 01:02:41,599
uh if you're if you're looking for the

1480
01:02:39,278 --> 01:02:44,239
keeper then the then the goal would be

1481
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:46,838
to just to find it as soon as possible

1482
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:48,479
and I since you've been a tester and a

1483
01:02:46,838 --> 01:02:51,719
pheno hunter and you've also made your

1484
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:56,400
own seeds and um then hunted through

1485
01:02:51,719 --> 01:03:00,118
them afterwards you know the the time

1486
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:01,838
and effort it takes just to go from

1487
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:05,200
let's just say selecting a mother and a

1488
01:03:01,838 --> 01:03:09,159
father plant or a a mother and a donor

1489
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:12,159
plant and then finding something that

1490
01:03:09,159 --> 01:03:15,000
you're proud to say was a keeper of the

1491
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:18,719
entire process is you know that's a year

1492
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,639
or more oh and it it always makes not

1493
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:23,759
makes me laugh but it always makes me

1494
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:26,558
like like wow when these guys are you

1495
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:30,680
know there's C different folks they'll

1496
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:33,839
pump them out you know and you know like

1497
01:03:30,679 --> 01:03:36,000
wait like I guess if you have the right

1498
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:39,798
just a huge facility and number I guess

1499
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:42,400
it could be but obviously I'm nowhere

1500
01:03:39,798 --> 01:03:45,440
near that level so it's like it just

1501
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:48,000
logically like you grow it you select it

1502
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:51,119
you it just takes time everything is

1503
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:53,639
months not like all right I it's months

1504
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:55,559
you know you'll know if it's something

1505
01:03:53,639 --> 01:03:59,798
all right get back with me next year

1506
01:03:55,559 --> 01:04:01,319
well uh we'll see you know yep and I'm

1507
01:03:59,798 --> 01:04:04,119
I'm not sure about you but I always

1508
01:04:01,318 --> 01:04:07,038
flower out um cuting of plants I never

1509
01:04:04,119 --> 01:04:10,680
flower out the seed plant itself just

1510
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:13,039
because yeah because um if if uh if

1511
01:04:10,679 --> 01:04:16,598
there is any potential in the genetics

1512
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:19,400
to have any sort of uh different in

1513
01:04:16,599 --> 01:04:23,278
morphology after a certain period in its

1514
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:26,920
life based on the the hormonal um kind

1515
01:04:23,278 --> 01:04:30,079
of buildup then I want to be as close to

1516
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:33,039
what I could then put into production uh

1517
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:36,960
as I can be for the initial search so if

1518
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:39,278
I'm like hunting just from uh from seed

1519
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,639
and I've uh experienced this and heard

1520
01:04:39,278 --> 01:04:43,760
this from other people you know like you

1521
01:04:40,639 --> 01:04:47,558
may or may not have some sort of inex

1522
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:49,359
traits show or the morphology as well is

1523
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:51,720
going to be you know it's more like that

1524
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:56,318
bifurcated morphology where as the plant

1525
01:04:51,719 --> 01:05:00,000
grows it it produces two sets of um

1526
01:04:56,318 --> 01:05:02,599
auxiliary branches per per node set

1527
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:06,039
versus if you're growing like a clone

1528
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:09,240
you know you get the um kind of the uh

1529
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:11,240
epy form of like having one come after

1530
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:13,759
another on the

1531
01:05:11,239 --> 01:05:15,798
stock and and that also then affects the

1532
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:17,520
flower structure cuz like as I'm sure

1533
01:05:15,798 --> 01:05:20,358
you've seen from a seed plant if you

1534
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:23,358
just grow it and flower it that top nug

1535
01:05:20,358 --> 01:05:29,000
is also you know it has the the two

1536
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:31,358
nodes per um per nodal spacing and uh it

1537
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,440
those tops can get huge and then if you

1538
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:34,719
grow out the Clone all of a sudden even

1539
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,358
if you don't top it you're like well

1540
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:38,759
this flower structure is completely

1541
01:05:36,358 --> 01:05:41,719
different it's it's got a a bit more of

1542
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:45,278
a fox taily structure the peak on it is

1543
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:48,159
taller and uh the side auxiliary buds

1544
01:05:45,278 --> 01:05:50,920
are uh like smaller they don't they're

1545
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:52,838
not as compacted or maybe they're even

1546
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:55,960
better you know and and that's kind of

1547
01:05:52,838 --> 01:05:58,078
where I've I've leaned towards just only

1548
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:59,798
flowering out clones rather than seed

1549
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,000
plants and I'll keep the seed plant

1550
01:05:59,798 --> 01:06:04,119
around for longer as a mother as long as

1551
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,400
I'm up potting it but then you know

1552
01:06:04,119 --> 01:06:08,960
eventually it just it never makes it to

1553
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,519
flow gotcha gotcha oh that's interesting

1554
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:13,639
for

1555
01:06:10,519 --> 01:06:16,358
sure yeah no I um I do know what you

1556
01:06:13,639 --> 01:06:18,480
mean about that top Cola how it's you

1557
01:06:16,358 --> 01:06:20,838
know it's always super heavy when it's

1558
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:24,318
from seed always got to make sure those

1559
01:06:20,838 --> 01:06:26,838
suckers are near fans because uh all too

1560
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:29,519
much you you know especially that late

1561
01:06:26,838 --> 01:06:32,038
summer Run next thing you know you're

1562
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:34,239
cracking it open and it's Bad News Bears

1563
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:37,359
and you know y like wait that was the

1564
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:39,078
main that was the main main Feast right

1565
01:06:37,358 --> 01:06:41,598
there you know so that you're looking at

1566
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:43,680
it especially if it's like a small plant

1567
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:45,720
you're like that was like a quarter of

1568
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:49,358
my weight yeah

1569
01:06:45,719 --> 01:06:51,278
exactly so yeah I'm getting better with

1570
01:06:49,358 --> 01:06:54,239
my clone so who knows I'll uh maybe

1571
01:06:51,278 --> 01:06:56,440
start running some clones uh more

1572
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:57,798
frequently nice is your what's your

1573
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:02,119
cloning

1574
01:06:57,798 --> 01:07:06,038
method um I use uh cups like the I have

1575
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:08,920
a clone Dome and a mat but um I inside

1576
01:07:06,039 --> 01:07:12,359
that Dome I'll put them in like a

1577
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:14,400
rooting plug and I'll use a like a fast

1578
01:07:12,358 --> 01:07:16,880
food cup one of those like plastic cups

1579
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:18,760
with the lids okay and I'll just kind of

1580
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:21,480
leave them in there and let them do

1581
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:24,480
their thing but now my buddy uh faded

1582
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:27,159
put me on I he started using the Athena

1583
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:29,559
gel and man okay it has made all the

1584
01:07:27,159 --> 01:07:32,719
difference I've tried so many

1585
01:07:29,559 --> 01:07:37,640
things but that seemed to that with uh

1586
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:39,879
just solid uh you know just solid

1587
01:07:37,639 --> 01:07:43,278
practices of keeping it moist and not

1588
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:44,480
too wet not too hot um seems to be doing

1589
01:07:43,278 --> 01:07:45,920
the trick I don't know if I'm getting

1590
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,480
better maybe you know it's just right

1591
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:49,119
thing right right place right time I

1592
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,798
don't know if the gel is everything my

1593
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:53,559
technique better

1594
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:57,000
but since I've been using it my uh

1595
01:07:53,559 --> 01:07:59,880
clones have been you know pretty good so

1596
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,599
knock on wood hopefully it continues and

1597
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:03,480
and are you using like the uh the

1598
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:08,480
compressed Pete

1599
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:11,679
plugs uh yes the uh what is

1600
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:13,679
it um The Name Escapes me now but it's

1601
01:08:11,679 --> 01:08:17,719
you know the ones on Amazon plugin roots

1602
01:08:13,679 --> 01:08:19,278
or like ort or something or

1603
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:23,198
uh

1604
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:25,719
right that's one I have root R cool

1605
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:27,198
those are those are great I um I I think

1606
01:08:25,719 --> 01:08:30,520
like uh what's his name on Instagram

1607
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:31,960
clone coach uses those and or a couple

1608
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:33,040
other people I've known have used those

1609
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:35,198
I've used them in the past and they

1610
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:37,920
always seem to work I don't know why I

1611
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:39,639
just stick with like rock wool now or um

1612
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:43,359
I've been using the little uh cocoa

1613
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:45,359
coins that uh Char quaire put out like

1614
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:47,440
they're kind of like um like Jiffy

1615
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:50,159
pellets but rather than with Pete Moss

1616
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:52,960
they're with Coco cuz I always grow Coco

1617
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:55,439
with Hydro so I um I like the uh the

1618
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:57,838
like media in like media and it sounds

1619
01:08:55,439 --> 01:09:00,960
since you're using uh like an organic

1620
01:08:57,838 --> 01:09:05,479
based um uh substrate then I'm I'm sure

1621
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:07,838
part of it's like uh um spum Pete Moss

1622
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:13,318
yeah yeah got the P it's probably about

1623
01:09:07,838 --> 01:09:15,838
50% soil then the rest uh 25% Coco broke

1624
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:18,759
up a couple cocoa bricks in there and uh

1625
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:21,559
perlite lots and lots of perlite nice

1626
01:09:18,759 --> 01:09:23,960
I'm a chronic overw waterer I don't know

1627
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:25,920
so do you mix up your own soil yes

1628
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:29,880
definitely oh all right

1629
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:32,560
yep very cool what's your initial

1630
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:36,400
mix

1631
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:38,839
um just a lot of uh I'll try to find

1632
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:41,879
like a farm like a worm farm and I'll

1633
01:09:38,838 --> 01:09:45,838
get a lot of compost

1634
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:47,719
um the the soil basically uh the only

1635
01:09:45,838 --> 01:09:49,559
problem with that is the fungus gats and

1636
01:09:47,719 --> 01:09:52,119
that's where you got to break it in and

1637
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:56,199
kind of just work your solution or

1638
01:09:52,119 --> 01:09:58,559
whatever through it um but but i' I've

1639
01:09:56,198 --> 01:10:03,158
tried you know it's all mixed in there a

1640
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:06,800
fox farm I've tried a bio

1641
01:10:03,158 --> 01:10:09,238
365 um you know so I kind of just

1642
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:11,920
everything just goes into a rolling bin

1643
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:14,839
and I've been using this same

1644
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:17,440
soil four five years now you know so

1645
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:21,520
it's just keeping it in

1646
01:10:17,439 --> 01:10:24,879
rotation so do you do you like save the

1647
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:28,239
um the used soil and add it back into

1648
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:33,640
this this mixing Barrel I have uh I have

1649
01:10:28,238 --> 01:10:36,039
three big tubs cool a b and the stuff

1650
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:39,560
that's like the on Deck Circle basically

1651
01:10:36,039 --> 01:10:42,238
that's uh fresh dumped pots okay um I

1652
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:45,239
basically I'll mix up I'll add to the

1653
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:50,198
new stuff I'll dry it down as dry as I

1654
01:10:45,238 --> 01:10:51,959
can I'll top the pot with um de cuz I'm

1655
01:10:50,198 --> 01:10:54,039
always on the battle for the fungus knat

1656
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:57,600
so before I try to mix a soil I'll try

1657
01:10:54,039 --> 01:11:00,238
to kill everything that there dry it out

1658
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:02,199
um let that sit for a couple days in my

1659
01:11:00,238 --> 01:11:04,079
basement it dries it out pretty good

1660
01:11:02,198 --> 01:11:08,119
I'll mix

1661
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:11,359
that um use the Dr Earth the

1662
01:11:08,119 --> 01:11:13,519
444 or uh I had guia green at one point

1663
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:16,799
when it ran out I just went back to Dr

1664
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:19,159
Earth um and that's pretty much it you

1665
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:22,760
know I add a little uh gypsum add a

1666
01:11:19,158 --> 01:11:24,879
little uh potassium sulfate little

1667
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:27,239
powder and that's pretty much it you

1668
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:31,880
know I like it sit it probably sits in

1669
01:11:27,238 --> 01:11:35,639
each bin for 3 to four months and it's

1670
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:37,239
just you know I periodically maybe once

1671
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:40,480
every two months I'll Water it a little

1672
01:11:37,238 --> 01:11:43,479
bit just to keep that when I open it the

1673
01:11:40,479 --> 01:11:46,479
top is usually like uh sweating okay so

1674
01:11:43,479 --> 01:11:48,119
it has that uh you know the everything's

1675
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:50,079
kind of I can tell everything's kind of

1676
01:11:48,119 --> 01:11:54,279
getting acclimated any Leaf litter I'll

1677
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:56,880
put in there um I used to use a hand mix

1678
01:11:54,279 --> 01:11:58,679
but and I know a lot of guys still swear

1679
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:01,319
by the hand mixer

1680
01:11:58,679 --> 01:12:04,158
but I believe in the power wash the

1681
01:12:01,319 --> 01:12:06,799
power uh tools I have a paint mixer and

1682
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:08,799
that thing has made all the difference I

1683
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:11,400
get two batteries and I'll

1684
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:14,239
just everything will be so fluffy and

1685
01:12:11,399 --> 01:12:16,399
lomy and perfect you know because I

1686
01:12:14,238 --> 01:12:17,799
think Fox Farm has the perfect soil if

1687
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:20,439
you would ask me who has the perfect

1688
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:22,039
soil I think Fox Farm the problem is

1689
01:12:20,439 --> 01:12:24,839
they're just expensive and it's fungus

1690
01:12:22,039 --> 01:12:27,119
snats it's full of freaking fungus snats

1691
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:28,279
but it is literally the perfect soil

1692
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:31,158
it's so

1693
01:12:28,279 --> 01:12:35,639
lonely ocean forest or

1694
01:12:31,158 --> 01:12:37,759
Happ ocean Forest yeah cool um it's just

1695
01:12:35,639 --> 01:12:39,600
so you know it's very nice and it's not

1696
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:42,639
clumpy it's light and that's what I try

1697
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:44,600
to model my soil after that feel where

1698
01:12:42,639 --> 01:12:47,800
you can just kind of just pick it up and

1699
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:50,880
it drops and it's not you know too Dusty

1700
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:53,880
and whatever else so do you get any like

1701
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:56,239
uh any like mold blooms or anything in

1702
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:59,000
between mixings

1703
01:12:56,238 --> 01:13:02,238
um you said do I add any or do you get

1704
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:04,639
any like in the in the tub uh yeah like

1705
01:13:02,238 --> 01:13:07,119
yeah you'll see some you see some things

1706
01:13:04,639 --> 01:13:09,319
growing in there a little uh you know

1707
01:13:07,119 --> 01:13:11,519
especially on the top layer every so

1708
01:13:09,319 --> 01:13:15,079
often I'll when I add the water I'll mix

1709
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:16,719
that top layer in um add my mosquito

1710
01:13:15,079 --> 01:13:20,439
bits on

1711
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:22,520
top um that's when I put the neem any

1712
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:25,399
type of neem I'll put sprinkle on top

1713
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:27,239
just to deter any

1714
01:13:25,399 --> 01:13:28,679
because you know the bugs they they

1715
01:13:27,238 --> 01:13:30,359
sense it you know they could sense where

1716
01:13:28,679 --> 01:13:32,359
the good stuff is I'm sure they sense

1717
01:13:30,359 --> 01:13:35,759
the soil and everything else so I just

1718
01:13:32,359 --> 01:13:38,119
want to make it not uh you know not not

1719
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:40,760
an attractive option for them you know I

1720
01:13:38,119 --> 01:13:43,800
I grow organic everywhere else so

1721
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:45,800
there's plenty in the garden I don't mow

1722
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:48,920
the lawn so there's plenty outside for

1723
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:51,480
them that's not sprayed that they can

1724
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:56,158
enjoy and I found that they leave the

1725
01:13:51,479 --> 01:13:58,519
stuff that's sprayed alone you know ni

1726
01:13:56,158 --> 01:14:01,198
yeah that that makes sense I mean why

1727
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:02,239
path resistance basically you know like

1728
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:04,559
resistance you know you're not going to

1729
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:07,959
beat them all just go that way look at

1730
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:11,639
all this you know here put some tasty

1731
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:14,480
snacks out here for you boys oh that's

1732
01:14:11,639 --> 01:14:17,159
funny yeah I don't like to spray

1733
01:14:14,479 --> 01:14:19,158
anything the only things I do spray and

1734
01:14:17,158 --> 01:14:22,119
I spray heavily are like the the

1735
01:14:19,158 --> 01:14:25,359
entrances like the window sill around my

1736
01:14:22,119 --> 01:14:28,158
uh the vent to come in like the exhaust

1737
01:14:25,359 --> 01:14:30,960
vent I'll spray like um where it exhaust

1738
01:14:28,158 --> 01:14:32,519
just you know you always bugs they're

1739
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:34,399
looking especially in the winter all

1740
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,920
that hot air is coming out they're

1741
01:14:34,399 --> 01:14:38,479
trying to get where the warm is you know

1742
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:40,560
everything is freezing and snow covered

1743
01:14:38,479 --> 01:14:44,000
whether it be a rat or freaking

1744
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:46,280
something else you know do you exhaust

1745
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,920
your your tent out out of the house out

1746
01:14:46,279 --> 01:14:51,000
of the basement definely yeah uh 24/7

1747
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:54,279
it's always

1748
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:58,039
on um okay it's always pulling it's a 6

1749
01:14:54,279 --> 01:15:00,158
in uh uh when when the guy I traded for

1750
01:14:58,039 --> 01:15:02,359
is still the original thing I traded for

1751
01:15:00,158 --> 01:15:05,238
It was a commercial guy he was closing a

1752
01:15:02,359 --> 01:15:08,639
commercial uh whatever so he had like an

1753
01:15:05,238 --> 01:15:11,158
8 in you know it was a huge it's

1754
01:15:08,639 --> 01:15:14,639
probably like a 5 foot

1755
01:15:11,158 --> 01:15:16,319
uh exhaust vent but you know I I still

1756
01:15:14,639 --> 01:15:19,000
use it I just run it on its lowest

1757
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:21,799
setting and that's basically allowed me

1758
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:25,079
to you know still keep it

1759
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:27,679
going wow okay that's fascinating I

1760
01:15:25,079 --> 01:15:31,198
didn't uh I I always think like when

1761
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:33,679
it's a cold space to to keep the um the

1762
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:35,799
room sealed just to to try and keep that

1763
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:38,359
heat in but

1764
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:41,320
uh too hot even with even in the winter

1765
01:15:38,359 --> 01:15:43,920
the HPS would uh it would it would still

1766
01:15:41,319 --> 01:15:46,559
go over 90 probably 90 you know it'd be

1767
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:49,440
really hot if that uh thing wasn't

1768
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:50,760
kicking what uh what temp do you us

1769
01:15:49,439 --> 01:15:55,238
usually shoot

1770
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:58,360
for um I think you know I'm usually low

1771
01:15:55,238 --> 01:16:02,638
80s in the morning and by afternoon it's

1772
01:15:58,359 --> 01:16:06,439
probably up you know 87 88 that's that's

1773
01:16:02,639 --> 01:16:07,840
what I that's my sweet spot okay um I

1774
01:16:06,439 --> 01:16:10,198
don't like when it gets

1775
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:12,400
too in the summer it does get hotter

1776
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:14,799
than that in the

1777
01:16:12,399 --> 01:16:17,559
summer you know it'll start out in the

1778
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:20,480
mid 80s and by the end of the day it's

1779
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:23,480
probably up there 92 93 so tops are

1780
01:16:20,479 --> 01:16:25,319
roasting baby you could you know so

1781
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:26,158
that's not I don't grow my best flower

1782
01:16:25,319 --> 01:16:29,559
in the

1783
01:16:26,158 --> 01:16:32,479
summer um that's yeah that's super hot

1784
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:35,360
it's hot boy I I keep air moving I keep

1785
01:16:32,479 --> 01:16:37,319
it's it's blowing but it's hot it's

1786
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:39,119
nothing I can do I it is something I

1787
01:16:37,319 --> 01:16:42,519
could do actually I could not be lazy

1788
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:43,960
and take out the HPS every summer and do

1789
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:49,159
you have like another LED you could put

1790
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:51,480
in there I I have an extra no it's a T5

1791
01:16:49,158 --> 01:16:53,238
that I have laying around and I'm like

1792
01:16:51,479 --> 01:16:55,919
you know so when I do come up with an

1793
01:16:53,238 --> 01:17:00,119
extra LED then I will it'll be more

1794
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:05,319
tempting to like set it up but now um I

1795
01:17:00,119 --> 01:17:09,279
have two LEDs in my veg and led and HPS

1796
01:17:05,319 --> 01:17:14,039
in the flower

1797
01:17:09,279 --> 01:17:16,359
so um wow yeah that's uh that's some

1798
01:17:14,039 --> 01:17:17,760
that's some hot hot temps I I'm just

1799
01:17:16,359 --> 01:17:21,279
thinking about do you do you keep it

1800
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:23,520
pretty humid to try and like match the

1801
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:25,800
in the summer it's humid um but that's

1802
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:28,679
where you run into those those issues

1803
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:30,760
with those Mega colas in the middle no

1804
01:17:28,679 --> 01:17:33,119
matter how ventilated you get when

1805
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:35,760
you're fooling around with that hot and

1806
01:17:33,119 --> 01:17:37,840
it dips you know the lights go off

1807
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:39,600
that's where the trouble comes into play

1808
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:42,400
couple times I'm running down opening

1809
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:44,600
the tent up and just for that hour cool

1810
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:48,079
down when the lights go off that's where

1811
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:52,000
the trouble comes into play um but you

1812
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:53,760
know you know as a home grower there's

1813
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,039
certain limitations that you have you

1814
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:58,440
know you have you can't do well I mean

1815
01:17:56,039 --> 01:18:00,319
you can do everything great but it's

1816
01:17:58,439 --> 01:18:03,399
more realistic that unless you're really

1817
01:18:00,319 --> 01:18:05,198
spending the money on environment and

1818
01:18:03,399 --> 01:18:08,000
something's going to suffer in the

1819
01:18:05,198 --> 01:18:12,198
seasons and for me my Achilles heel is

1820
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:16,158
that you know that middle of summer

1821
01:18:12,198 --> 01:18:21,678
those random hot and humid days you know

1822
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:23,519
but uh so it happens fory sure um so uh

1823
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:25,239
out of like your whole growth setup what

1824
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:29,560
do you think is like the most important

1825
01:18:25,238 --> 01:18:32,399
part to you um and and in how you grow

1826
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:33,679
and and uh is there anything like unique

1827
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:37,960
about

1828
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:42,679
it um I think the the tea

1829
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:44,800
aspect is uh something that is you know

1830
01:18:42,679 --> 01:18:48,279
maybe overlooked you know I hear people

1831
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:50,000
say they do te's once a month you know I

1832
01:18:48,279 --> 01:18:51,519
hear people say they do te's every

1833
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,800
couple weeks you

1834
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:57,159
know for me a tea is just erated water

1835
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,600
with a little banana peel you know

1836
01:18:57,158 --> 01:18:59,679
doesn't really doesn't have to be

1837
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:03,239
anything

1838
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:06,679
complex um I use uh sh I don't know if

1839
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:08,678
you heard of shillig jit it's like you

1840
01:19:06,679 --> 01:19:11,600
know it sounds familiar but I I couldn't

1841
01:19:08,679 --> 01:19:13,119
place it what is that it's like the it's

1842
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:15,800
supposedly like some rosin from the

1843
01:19:13,119 --> 01:19:18,359
Himalayas basically has like a humic and

1844
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:21,360
fulvic basically I add that to water

1845
01:19:18,359 --> 01:19:25,238
I'll use that um some banana peel some

1846
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:27,359
Dr Earth and you know a little molass

1847
01:19:25,238 --> 01:19:30,039
and it's an AirStone each one goes in a

1848
01:19:27,359 --> 01:19:32,198
gallon jug and it just sits there um for

1849
01:19:30,039 --> 01:19:34,679
24 hours of bubbles I think that makes a

1850
01:19:32,198 --> 01:19:38,359
huge difference uh you and I do that

1851
01:19:34,679 --> 01:19:40,679
daily do you add do you add any like um

1852
01:19:38,359 --> 01:19:42,880
microbial consortiums or or anything

1853
01:19:40,679 --> 01:19:45,158
like that to promote the biology or is

1854
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:48,239
it all just like a a nutrient

1855
01:19:45,158 --> 01:19:51,439
tea um that's in the mix basically I

1856
01:19:48,238 --> 01:19:53,959
have like um it's in a container of old

1857
01:19:51,439 --> 01:19:57,599
Jacks I've upcycled it and it says flour

1858
01:19:53,960 --> 01:20:00,800
mix and and it's a rechar I use recharge

1859
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:03,360
okay that's my stuff for the microbes um

1860
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:06,000
i' I've used great white dynamite in the

1861
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:09,759
past but in really nerding out and

1862
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:12,079
getting into the you know the what's in

1863
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:14,000
this what's in that what am I paying for

1864
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:15,359
I've come back to recharge like wait a

1865
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,520
minute they actually do have a pretty

1866
01:20:15,359 --> 01:20:20,279
solid you know it seems like it's pretty

1867
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:23,600
solid um I know a lot of people swear by

1868
01:20:20,279 --> 01:20:25,439
it yeah they swear by it um you know and

1869
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:28,560
it seems to work that great white is

1870
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:30,519
also another good one that um but yeah

1871
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:32,480
it's just a little dabble do you it's so

1872
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:34,239
much it's so little the amount that you

1873
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:37,718
need like

1874
01:20:34,238 --> 01:20:39,599
literally a uh the faintest dusting on

1875
01:20:37,719 --> 01:20:41,439
the water it's a gallon each is an each

1876
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:43,120
gallon jug just the faintest dusting

1877
01:20:41,439 --> 01:20:45,960
will turn the water a color and you know

1878
01:20:43,119 --> 01:20:48,359
that's enough nice I mean like as long

1879
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:51,079
as you're feeding them the sugar and you

1880
01:20:48,359 --> 01:20:52,559
know those other uh all that other stuff

1881
01:20:51,079 --> 01:20:54,639
that you're putting in the water is is

1882
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,960
feeding them as well and in most cases

1883
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:59,119
is you know you're just multiplying

1884
01:20:55,960 --> 01:21:01,600
those numbers over that 24 hours yeah I

1885
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:05,238
think that makes a huge huge difference

1886
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:06,960
you know that air and that water just uh

1887
01:21:05,238 --> 01:21:10,000
you know the plants just they they seem

1888
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:12,920
to like it awesome dude I mean that it

1889
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:15,399
sounds awesome

1890
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:18,760
um let's see I wanted to ask a couple

1891
01:21:15,399 --> 01:21:20,839
more questions of you um did you have

1892
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:26,320
any uh solid out time that you needed to

1893
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:29,079
get going by no no all right cool um so

1894
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:31,840
uh you know I know that you are a just a

1895
01:21:29,079 --> 01:21:35,880
hom grower I and I don't mean that as

1896
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:37,880
just a hom grower um so let me rephrase

1897
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:40,679
that um so I know that you're a hom

1898
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:43,480
grower uh and I'm I'm not sure do you

1899
01:21:40,679 --> 01:21:45,800
have any like um uh commercial

1900
01:21:43,479 --> 01:21:49,039
experience have you have you like toured

1901
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:51,039
any facilities seen anybody else uh like

1902
01:21:49,039 --> 01:21:53,000
had any friends doing commercials or

1903
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:55,238
anything and you're right don't correct

1904
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,319
yourself my friend I am just home grower

1905
01:21:55,238 --> 01:21:59,678
you know that's that's you know I think

1906
01:21:57,319 --> 01:22:02,399
that's that's what I that's what I do

1907
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:05,520
yeah I've gone I went to Colorado once

1908
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:07,759
um I was actually trying to buy in my

1909
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:09,679
when I was in my home buying mode I

1910
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:11,520
wanted to leave New York desperately I'm

1911
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:13,600

Colorado I went to see a couple

1915
01:22:18,319 --> 01:22:21,599
dispensaries I went to see like

1916
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:24,960
facilities and different things and I

1917
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:27,760
was blown away um and I I I don't do

1918
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:32,639
anything like that I don't do anything

1919
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:35,800
like that's that is so Technical and you

1920
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:38,039
know I like to just I I like it more

1921
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:40,560
natural and I like to have the music and

1922
01:22:38,039 --> 01:22:42,479
I like to have the feel you know I don't

1923
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:44,239
like anything feeling scientific you

1924
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:46,079
know it is scientific really if you're

1925
01:22:44,238 --> 01:22:50,399
thinking about it you're you're doing

1926
01:22:46,079 --> 01:22:52,960
plant science but you know it's not

1927
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:55,359
um you know but as a as a hobbyist you

1928
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:59,679
don't necessarily need to make it uh you

1929
01:22:55,359 --> 01:23:01,839
know uh to like the the the professional

1930
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:06,279
scientific level

1931
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:09,039
of and EC and pH and light meter I'm

1932
01:23:06,279 --> 01:23:12,158
like guys you know the plants are fine

1933
01:23:09,039 --> 01:23:14,560
you're fine yeah you know it's why we

1934
01:23:12,158 --> 01:23:18,198
need all these meters and the solution

1935
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:19,480
and the what what you know so I think

1936
01:23:18,198 --> 01:23:21,599
there's definitely a place for it don't

1937
01:23:19,479 --> 01:23:23,439
get me wrong it it's like being a home

1938
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:26,039
cook you still want to go out to

1939
01:23:23,439 --> 01:23:27,960
restaurants you know you still want to

1940
01:23:26,039 --> 01:23:29,800
cook at home yeah but I I still love

1941
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:31,760
going out for a nice restaurant that's

1942
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:33,880
how I feel with the dispensaries you

1943
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:35,920
know you you cook at home and it's good

1944
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:38,880
it's great but you still want to go to a

1945
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:42,279
freaking Steakhouse and get that top

1946
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:44,159
shelf for whatever and you know see like

1947
01:23:42,279 --> 01:23:45,960
wow these guys are really all right this

1948
01:23:44,158 --> 01:23:47,638
is this is what I can really aspire to

1949
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:51,800
here you know this type of thing yeah

1950
01:23:47,639 --> 01:23:54,800
it's like a experience based uh uh

1951
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:57,679
Association I guess yeah I get that I I

1952
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:59,520
mean I love eating out and uh I I I was

1953
01:23:57,679 --> 01:24:01,719
classically trained as a chef and I did

1954
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:03,880
that for like a decade before I got into

1955
01:24:01,719 --> 01:24:06,399
the Cannabis industry so I

1956
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:08,560
um yeah there's different different

1957
01:24:06,399 --> 01:24:10,359
things that I Feel Like We crave and we

1958
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:13,320
not only crave like what we can do but

1959
01:24:10,359 --> 01:24:15,679
also like the uh what other people can

1960
01:24:13,319 --> 01:24:18,799
show in the same category just to

1961
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:21,158
experience it in different ways so I am

1962
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:23,960
yeah I totally totally understand that

1963
01:24:21,158 --> 01:24:27,198
um but as so as a hom grower then like

1964
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:29,000
what would you want to see change in the

1965
01:24:27,198 --> 01:24:31,198
Cannabis industry overall like let's

1966
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:34,039
just call the industry you know from hom

1967
01:24:31,198 --> 01:24:37,759
Growers to Consumers to dispensaries to

1968
01:24:34,039 --> 01:24:40,118
large commercials grows um you know and

1969
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:43,000
and and everything in between uh what

1970
01:24:40,118 --> 01:24:43,000
what would you like to

1971
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:50,679
see um I mean I guess just you know they

1972
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:53,879
take the restrictions away I think I

1973
01:24:50,679 --> 01:24:56,920
think it's silly that one state I can

1974
01:24:53,880 --> 01:25:00,079
grow I can sell it I can Boutique it I

1975
01:24:56,920 --> 01:25:03,440
can do whatever I want if I go two hours

1976
01:25:00,079 --> 01:25:06,960
that away now it's a different story you

1977
01:25:03,439 --> 01:25:09,678
know I think that's kind of like legal

1978
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,840
or not legal you know okay or not okay

1979
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:13,719
let's come to an agreement yeah and then

1980
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:16,639
the second thing that's the biggest rip

1981
01:25:13,719 --> 01:25:19,039
is the insta nonsense you know as much

1982
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:22,199
as I praise and they've been the light

1983
01:25:19,039 --> 01:25:23,840
that has opened you know shine lights on

1984
01:25:22,198 --> 01:25:26,839
whole industries that I didn't even know

1985
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:28,840
existed they are all also you

1986
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:30,719
know sometimes you get caught in the

1987
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:32,880
weeds you know and next thing you know

1988
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:35,880
you're banned or you're restricted like

1989
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:38,719
wait what did I I posted a plant P like

1990
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:40,800
wait if that's what you're going by then

1991
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:42,239
just you're going to shut the whole

1992
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:44,880
thing like what do you what do you mean

1993
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:47,879
I posted I posted a marijuana picture of

1994
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:49,560
course I did you know so it's like

1995
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:51,600
sometimes that is unclear and then you

1996
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:55,400
ask a question it's like all right let

1997
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:57,119
me you know going to Ai and it's like

1998
01:25:55,399 --> 01:25:59,359
all automated you know it's not like a

1999
01:25:57,118 --> 01:26:00,719
person you can reach out to that can use

2000
01:25:59,359 --> 01:26:04,519
common sense on

2001
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:08,118
it um but yeah I think that I think the

2002
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:09,360
the community is based on Instagram for

2003
01:26:08,118 --> 01:26:13,599
For Better or For

2004
01:26:09,359 --> 01:26:15,639
Worse you know yeah is Instagram a bust

2005
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:18,440
at this right now that's kind of how it

2006
01:26:15,639 --> 01:26:21,679
is yeah there's other platforms

2007
01:26:18,439 --> 01:26:23,519
but you know it's it they fizzle out

2008
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:25,118
they seem to fizzle out you know they

2009
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:28,560
seem to all right we're all going to go

2010
01:26:25,118 --> 01:26:31,399
back to X all right everybody on X

2011
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:33,000
that'll last a week they all be back you

2012
01:26:31,399 --> 01:26:35,960
know what I mean all right I'm going to

2013
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:38,960
freaking threads [ __ ] it pardon my

2014
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:41,000
language and it's like all right yeah

2015
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:43,279
we're we're back like oh back on Insta

2016
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,359
huh what's up buddy yeah you know For

2017
01:26:43,279 --> 01:26:47,479
Better or For Worse they're they're the

2018
01:26:45,359 --> 01:26:50,238
overlords right now

2019
01:26:47,479 --> 01:26:52,559
so yeah it's uh it is unfortunate I feel

2020
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:54,238
like just the not only the stigma cuz I

2021
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:59,039
feel like the stigma keeps people in the

2022
01:26:54,238 --> 01:27:03,599
the mindset of wanting to um uh cover

2023
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:05,279
up and uh hide away the you know it

2024
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:07,119
feels like we're like the the Dirty

2025
01:27:05,279 --> 01:27:09,359
Little Secret that the different parts

2026
01:27:07,118 --> 01:27:12,519
of America doesn't want to necessarily

2027
01:27:09,359 --> 01:27:14,519
talk about in some aspects um as the as

2028
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:16,800
the Cannabis industry where it's yeah

2029
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:20,840
this uh

2030
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:24,760
semi-legal or quasi legal you know

2031
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:28,880
ambiguousness of having States right be

2032
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:31,480
able to say it's okay and still at the

2033
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:36,400
same time having federal agencies like

2034
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:40,479
the DEA you know continue to prosecute

2035
01:27:36,399 --> 01:27:41,439
people and uh it it it it does just seem

2036
01:27:40,479 --> 01:27:47,319
like an

2037
01:27:41,439 --> 01:27:49,839
overall uh weird farce and facade that

2038
01:27:47,319 --> 01:27:52,198
should it it needs to become more clear

2039
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:53,840
because it does then make it so that if

2040
01:27:52,198 --> 01:27:56,839
companies are operating in the United

2041
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:59,000
States like Instagram or or Facebook

2042
01:27:56,840 --> 01:28:01,719
even is you know I guess they're all

2043
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:06,359
kind of part of the same thing

2044
01:28:01,719 --> 01:28:08,679
um they they will continue to shut down

2045
01:28:06,359 --> 01:28:13,118
people that are breaking those federal

2046
01:28:08,679 --> 01:28:16,359
laws that they're beholding to make sure

2047
01:28:13,118 --> 01:28:19,639
hold on a sec breaking those laws

2048
01:28:16,359 --> 01:28:22,599

01:29:23,399 --> 01:29:30,158
oh yeah you also selling this or selling

2074
01:29:27,039 --> 01:29:34,519
seeds or clones and you weren't paying

2075
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:37,158
Instagram any any revenues you know yeah

2076
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:39,679
I me I know of one uh one of the

2077
01:29:37,158 --> 01:29:41,638
moderators that I'm a moderator with on

2078
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:44,960
uh on Reddit on the craft marijuana

2079
01:29:41,639 --> 01:29:47,760
subreddit um he he uses Instagram to

2080
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:51,520
promote his seed sales and he pays them

2081
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:54,560
monthly for ads and they don't shut down

2082
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:56,960
his account because he's paying them and

2083
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:59,159
so it's definitely a pay to play in

2084
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:01,039
certain aspects and some people can

2085
01:29:59,158 --> 01:30:03,399
direct like direct people directly to

2086
01:30:01,039 --> 01:30:06,238
cannabis seed sales through Instagrams

2087
01:30:03,399 --> 01:30:08,559
forget about cannabis direct to Herb

2088
01:30:06,238 --> 01:30:09,759
direct to flour like wait a minute I

2089
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:14,039
think as long as you're paying for it

2090
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:16,239
you know paying baby that's it you know

2091
01:30:14,039 --> 01:30:19,279
it's as long as you're paying you're

2092
01:30:16,238 --> 01:30:21,158
good to go and that's the asterisk that

2093
01:30:19,279 --> 01:30:24,279
they don't like to mention they want to

2094
01:30:21,158 --> 01:30:26,479
say oh marijuana no say what it really

2095
01:30:24,279 --> 01:30:28,439
is you know you pay us or you don't do

2096
01:30:26,479 --> 01:30:30,559
this here yeah you know it's like the

2097
01:30:28,439 --> 01:30:33,479
old drug dealer From the Block if you're

2098
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:35,520
not paying my freaking piece you're not

2099
01:30:33,479 --> 01:30:37,519
going to do this business here and it's

2100
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:41,760
kind of now the digital you know it's a

2101
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:44,320
digital black hand yeah in in a sense so

2102
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:46,760
that's yeah that's a great great analogy

2103
01:30:44,319 --> 01:30:49,000
because it is like definitely the uh

2104
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:50,960
it's like the territory control uh

2105
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,600
paying for protection almost you know

2106
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:55,079
this is my neighborhood you want to sell

2107
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:58,119
here you pay me a piece of all your

2108
01:30:55,079 --> 01:30:59,359
profits wow yeah Instagram's just a

2109
01:30:58,118 --> 01:31:03,479
bunch of

2110
01:30:59,359 --> 01:31:05,599
gangsters just a big pimp yeah well it's

2111
01:31:03,479 --> 01:31:07,638
unfortunate because you're right it it

2112
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:10,760
is like the community that people keep

2113
01:31:07,639 --> 01:31:13,880
coming back to because

2114
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:16,920
the the opportunity to connect with you

2115
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:20,159
know a wide swath of people from the

2116
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:21,520
industry is so great and you know like

2117
01:31:20,158 --> 01:31:24,920
there's a fair amount of people that'll

2118
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:26,960
respond to your DMs and stuff that

2119
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:30,719
you might have trouble finding in any

2120
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:33,439
other in any other way that can open up

2121
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:35,600
the opportunities that someone like even

2122
01:31:33,439 --> 01:31:38,359
myself have used to get into the

2123
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:41,079
industry into certain spaces and you

2124
01:31:38,359 --> 01:31:43,719
know it it's unfortunate they then go

2125
01:31:41,079 --> 01:31:47,399
around and criminalize those who are not

2126
01:31:43,719 --> 01:31:49,399
able to pay the piper so to speak CU

2127
01:31:47,399 --> 01:31:51,238

2138
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:17,239
true it's [ __ ] weird there's too many

2139
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:19,079
Bots I remember back in the day we used

2140

01:32:35,639 --> 01:32:41,800
exactly yeah um Al uh I have just a few

2148
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:44,600
more questions uh and then we're going

2149
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:48,239
to get to like a couple of uh sort of

2150
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:52,039
wrapup questions um

2151
01:32:48,238 --> 01:32:54,919
so how uh how do you think Growers can

2152
01:32:52,039 --> 01:32:56,679
protect ourselves from the future so you

2153
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:59,560
know like even with what you're saying

2154
01:32:56,679 --> 01:33:02,520
where you you'd like to see

2155
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:05,159
um kind of just more transparency in

2156
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:07,119
terms of how things uh go with

2157
01:33:05,158 --> 01:33:09,319
legalization like let's almost like

2158
01:33:07,118 --> 01:33:11,519
let's make up our minds on this let's

2159
01:33:09,319 --> 01:33:14,599
not have uh let's not have it be so

2160
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:17,520
ambiguous any longer um so like with

2161
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:19,760
that in mind uh and and if the ambiguity

2162
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:22,760
continues how do you think that like

2163
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:25,719
homeg Growers like yourselves should um

2164
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:27,760
protect themselves

2165
01:33:25,719 --> 01:33:31,719
uh I mean the answer is not going to be

2166
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:36,600
popular it's not going to be sexy um you

2167
01:33:31,719 --> 01:33:40,439
know I think the best way is to

2168
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:44,480
be insulated in other markets and to be

2169
01:33:40,439 --> 01:33:47,000
you know have that be your passion but

2170
01:33:44,479 --> 01:33:50,000
what I mean how how highly do you think

2171
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,719
of the the farmer who makes your corn

2172
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:54,479
you know how highly do you think of the

2173
01:33:51,719 --> 01:33:56,520
farmer who makes you know your your

2174
01:33:54,479 --> 01:33:59,238
brussel sprouts you know what other crop

2175
01:33:56,520 --> 01:34:01,400
do you really think of the farmer you

2176
01:33:59,238 --> 01:34:04,039
know farmer has forgotten about who the

2177
01:34:01,399 --> 01:34:07,000
heck cares you know who the person

2178
01:34:04,039 --> 01:34:09,960
putting their hands in the dirt they're

2179
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:12,520
they're not rich and famous and you know

2180
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:14,679
so if it's if it's that that you're

2181
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:17,360
after then make sure your personality is

2182
01:34:14,679 --> 01:34:19,840
you tell funny jokes or you know if

2183
01:34:17,359 --> 01:34:22,920
you're a lady you're really growing and

2184
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:26,880
danc you know whatever it is but have an

2185
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:29,440
other niche that you know because you

2186
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:31,319
know it's it's growing like who grows

2187
01:34:29,439 --> 01:34:33,839
the most Tomatoes you know who's the

2188
01:34:31,319 --> 01:34:37,118
most popular tomato grow once it becomes

2189
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:40,679
legal it'll be like a farm crop you know

2190
01:34:37,118 --> 01:34:42,359
and farming is not so sexy so I think

2191
01:34:40,679 --> 01:34:43,880
people can just do what they like make

2192
01:34:42,359 --> 01:34:47,719
sure it's something you like if you like

2193
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:49,840
to grow do that you know no one can in

2194
01:34:47,719 --> 01:34:52,760
organic garden it's like your organic

2195
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:54,279
garden it it makes you feel good you can

2196
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:57,560
taste the difference

2197
01:34:54,279 --> 01:34:58,840
your family's happy about it you know

2198
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:00,719
what else do you need past that if

2199
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:04,000
you're doing it for the for the fame and

2200
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:05,800
the riches I don't know I don't know you

2201
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,118
might it might be a tougher of a goal

2202
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:10,199
but if you're doing it just for your

2203
01:35:08,118 --> 01:35:12,000
health benefits you're going to be happy

2204
01:35:10,198 --> 01:35:13,319
if you're doing it for cost benefits

2205
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,198
you're going to be happy if you're doing

2206
01:35:13,319 --> 01:35:17,279
it for your family you're going to be

2207
01:35:15,198 --> 01:35:20,079
happy but long as you keep those

2208
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:22,960
intentions pure I think you know sky's

2209
01:35:20,079 --> 01:35:25,198
the limit you know insulate from what

2210
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:26,198
you're insula yourself from cost you

2211
01:35:25,198 --> 01:35:29,238
know

2212
01:35:26,198 --> 01:35:32,039
Co the cost of a pound goes up four time

2213
01:35:29,238 --> 01:35:34,399
4X it don't mean [ __ ] for you you know

2214
01:35:32,039 --> 01:35:36,319
the cost goes down oh I can't make no

2215
01:35:34,399 --> 01:35:38,118
money off this doesn't mean anything for

2216
01:35:36,319 --> 01:35:42,599
you you know either way it's kind of

2217
01:35:38,118 --> 01:35:45,319
like yeah that's good you know so so it

2218
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:47,000
sounds like keep growing at home that's

2219
01:35:45,319 --> 01:35:49,158
how we protect ourselves know live

2220
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:52,520
within means and just kind

2221
01:35:49,158 --> 01:35:54,158
of don't you know just not be affected

2222
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:56,679
by the little things things you know you

2223
01:35:54,158 --> 01:35:58,638

01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:08,639
it's a tough uh tough out it is well no

2227
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:11,279
I mean I think that's a great answer

2228
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:13,600
because uh you know I I feel like homeg

2229
01:36:11,279 --> 01:36:16,079
growing is definitely the way forward

2230
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:18,800
with uh a lot of aspects of the the

2231
01:36:16,079 --> 01:36:21,960
Cannabis culture and the community

2232
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:23,800
around growing and um I mean that's part

2233
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:25,760
of the reason why I'm doing this podcast

2234
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:28,400
is to make sure that people know that

2235
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:31,280
everyone can grow and it's something

2236
01:36:28,399 --> 01:36:35,079
that's uh available in a whole bunch of

2237
01:36:31,279 --> 01:36:36,559
different scenarios and um yeah like

2238
01:36:35,079 --> 01:36:39,118
people like yourself where you you

2239
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:42,199
you've had experiences uh indoor and

2240
01:36:39,118 --> 01:36:44,719
outdoor and this and that and uh at this

2241
01:36:42,198 --> 01:36:46,319
location and that location it's um you

2242
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:47,880
know hopefully it inspires more people

2243
01:36:46,319 --> 01:36:49,559
to just want to grow at home and give it

2244
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:53,159
a

2245
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:55,560
try yeah no matter what you produce it's

2246
01:36:53,158 --> 01:36:57,359
it's going to be you're going to be

2247
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:58,880
you're going to be happy you know

2248
01:36:57,359 --> 01:37:01,158
obviously the more you put into it if

2249
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:03,359
you like doing the thing that helps a

2250
01:37:01,158 --> 01:37:06,079
lot but just knowing it's something you

2251
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:07,880
created and you you know put your time

2252
01:37:06,079 --> 01:37:09,359
into it's it's going to be a good result

2253
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:11,639
you know I think everyone should try it

2254
01:37:09,359 --> 01:37:15,000
everyone should do it absolutely it's

2255
01:37:11,639 --> 01:37:17,840
good for the soul absolutely 100% on

2256
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:20,920
that um so you know knowing what you

2257
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:23,239
know now uh about all the different

2258
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:25,679
growing aspects that you can you know

2259
01:37:23,238 --> 01:37:28,319
put that that pin on your your badge of

2260
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:31,600
uh you know I am I am a grower with all

2261
01:37:28,319 --> 01:37:33,000
of these accomplishments um what would

2262
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:35,280
you want to what advice would you want

2263
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:38,319
to give yourself before you ever put

2264
01:37:35,279 --> 01:37:38,319
that first seed in the

2265
01:37:39,719 --> 01:37:45,719
dirt

2266
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:50,480
um flow and steady wins the

2267
01:37:45,719 --> 01:37:52,599
race you know um that's great I think I

2268
01:37:50,479 --> 01:37:56,000
think sometimes you get caught up in the

2269
01:37:52,599 --> 01:37:59,039
rushing I used to be a stickler on times

2270
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:01,319
all right 6 weeks 8 weeks 10 weeks it's

2271
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:03,359
been 10 weeks time to cut I don't do

2272
01:38:01,319 --> 01:38:06,759
times anymore forget about weeks you

2273
01:38:03,359 --> 01:38:08,238
know that's all depends it's phenotypes

2274
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:09,880
it could be anything you know you could

2275
01:38:08,238 --> 01:38:12,158
get a early finisher suppose this one

2276
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:14,079
wants to finish in 49 days you know and

2277
01:38:12,158 --> 01:38:16,759
you're taking it or suppose this one

2278
01:38:14,079 --> 01:38:18,920
wants to finish 75 days you know just

2279
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:21,000
let the plant do its thing slow and

2280
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:23,520
steady you know you're going to grow it

2281
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,679
you're going to make a mistake it's best

2282
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:28,440
to make the mistake you know before you

2283
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:31,158
grow too big and you ruin a whole room

2284
01:38:28,439 --> 01:38:33,919
you ruin a whole you know it's good to

2285
01:38:31,158 --> 01:38:36,359
kind of get your get your feet under you

2286
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:38,639
you know you crawl then you walk then

2287
01:38:36,359 --> 01:38:40,960
you're running you know a lot of times

2288
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:45,079
on Insta it's like I just want to run

2289
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:48,039
baby run baby run you know you get guys

2290
01:38:45,079 --> 01:38:51,118
going high octane and then you know it's

2291
01:38:48,039 --> 01:38:52,599
just crash and burn you know that's I

2292
01:38:51,118 --> 01:38:53,960
mean that's great advice though because

2293
01:38:52,599 --> 01:38:55,279
I feel like uh

2294
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:57,359
you know that applies to so many

2295
01:38:55,279 --> 01:38:59,439
different aspects of Life uh makes me

2296
01:38:57,359 --> 01:39:02,118
think of cooking again where you know

2297
01:38:59,439 --> 01:39:03,839
you ask the chef hey Chef how long until

2298
01:39:02,118 --> 01:39:06,759
that's done and he looks at you and he

2299
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:08,840
goes it'll be done when it's done and

2300
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:10,599
you know like with flowers too I've even

2301
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:12,599
heard people calling it you know I'm I'm

2302
01:39:10,599 --> 01:39:14,880
cooking it you know like I'm letting it

2303
01:39:12,599 --> 01:39:17,000
cook uh in those last in those last

2304
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:19,679
couple weeks you know like just just let

2305
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:22,639
those tricomes ripen let those uh cxes

2306
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:25,679
swell up let let that that expression of

2307
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:28,239
color come through and the inessence and

2308
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:31,000
uh yeah I I feel like you got to be

2309
01:39:28,238 --> 01:39:33,158
patient sometimes and some people you

2310
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:34,639
know they'll I feel like there's the you

2311
01:39:33,158 --> 01:39:36,479
know the the common thing of always

2312
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:38,760
being like two more weeks right you know

2313
01:39:36,479 --> 01:39:41,319
like just give it two more weeks or uh

2314
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:44,159
of course you know little more cowm mag

2315
01:39:41,319 --> 01:39:47,359
but uh the the two more weeks thing is

2316
01:39:44,158 --> 01:39:49,079
uh I feel like pretty it's a pretty good

2317
01:39:47,359 --> 01:39:52,000
pretty good advice for any new grower

2318
01:39:49,079 --> 01:39:54,079
because like even something like someone

2319
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,840
like myself who has some some experience

2320
01:39:54,079 --> 01:40:00,319
growing for a little while now and I I

2321
01:39:56,840 --> 01:40:02,880
still have trouble sometimes getting

2322
01:40:00,319 --> 01:40:04,679
that perfectly right bud and and I don't

2323
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:07,960
even think necessarily it's always

2324
01:40:04,679 --> 01:40:11,520
something that is uh is always going to

2325
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:16,039
happen like I feel like if you have some

2326
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:20,400
improper practices whether it be uh you

2327
01:40:16,039 --> 01:40:23,479
know let it like too high of heat or um

2328
01:40:20,399 --> 01:40:25,679
not dropping the the temperatures or the

2329
01:40:23,479 --> 01:40:29,000
the humidities towards the the late

2330
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:32,399
flowering uh stages um you know you can

2331
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:34,279
really extend that flowering time and

2332
01:40:32,399 --> 01:40:37,479
really make it so that it it wants to

2333
01:40:34,279 --> 01:40:41,639
just keep producing new bra with uh or

2334
01:40:37,479 --> 01:40:44,000
new cxes with uh more white pistols and

2335
01:40:41,639 --> 01:40:45,840
and it wants to keep growing so that it

2336
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:49,319
can accept pollen cuz you know like the

2337
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:52,079
the whole uh process of its life is just

2338
01:40:49,319 --> 01:40:53,799
to accept pollen to make make seeds and

2339
01:40:52,079 --> 01:40:56,000
reproduce so if you give it

2340
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:58,760
you know if you continue to provide all

2341
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,039
that energy to produce those parts of

2342
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:03,679
the plant then it's just going to keep

2343
01:41:00,039 --> 01:41:06,359
going and keep going and so but also it

2344
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:07,760
will it will stop at some point and

2345
01:41:06,359 --> 01:41:09,960
that's also I feel like where a lot of

2346
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:12,840
people get this huge learning curve of

2347
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:15,719
how to taper down those

2348
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:18,079
um those plant responses towards the end

2349
01:41:15,719 --> 01:41:20,639
of flower and and get a better syence

2350
01:41:18,079 --> 01:41:24,118
response so that you can get those nice

2351
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:26,239
Instagram worthy uh bud shots where it's

2352
01:41:24,118 --> 01:41:28,158
all the hairs are orange there's no new

2353
01:41:26,238 --> 01:41:31,598
growth everything's colored out and

2354
01:41:28,158 --> 01:41:35,799
tried out and it's just beautiful Frosty

2355
01:41:31,599 --> 01:41:39,279
flower um and so I I feel like the the

2356
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:41,199
idea of slow and steady and just don't

2357
01:41:39,279 --> 01:41:42,759
don't rush yourself give yourself time

2358
01:41:41,198 --> 01:41:44,678
and you'll learn from everything that

2359
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:47,360
you do and and take that into the next

2360
01:41:44,679 --> 01:41:50,279
one is just Stellar

2361
01:41:47,359 --> 01:41:52,719
advice yeah I appreciate that yeah it's

2362
01:41:50,279 --> 01:41:55,439
uh you know it's the essence of life you

2363
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:59,039
know you got to sometimes just stop

2364
01:41:55,439 --> 01:42:01,279
and smell the roses you know smell the

2365
01:41:59,039 --> 01:42:03,198
flowers smell the flowers he would see

2366
01:42:01,279 --> 01:42:05,279
what you got going on and just just

2367
01:42:03,198 --> 01:42:07,439

2368
01:42:05,279 --> 01:42:09,198
absolutely all right well I I just got

2369
01:42:07,439 --> 01:42:10,598
now some wrap-up questions for you that

2370
01:42:09,198 --> 01:42:13,479
are going to be kind of my little

2371
01:42:10,599 --> 01:42:15,840
ubiquitous cannabis podcast questions

2372
01:42:13,479 --> 01:42:17,039
that I feel like everyone asks but I

2373
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:19,239
always feel as though they're worth

2374
01:42:17,039 --> 01:42:21,679
hearing because it's uh it's something

2375
01:42:19,238 --> 01:42:23,759
that almost every grower can relate to

2376
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:25,840
so um what's your favorite Rin of all

2377

01:42:54,118 --> 01:42:58,079
it's just got that uniqueness to it

2390
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:01,439
where it's it's such good smoke it's

2391
01:42:58,079 --> 01:43:04,760
creamy and smooth

2392
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:07,198
potent yeah people say it's boring but

2393
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:09,639
call me maybe I'm just a boring guy what

2394
01:43:07,198 --> 01:43:12,319
can I say hey dude Coca-Cola is boring

2395
01:43:09,639 --> 01:43:13,800
if you think about it but I will love a

2396
01:43:12,319 --> 01:43:19,000
cold coke with a

2397
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:21,560
burger 100% right all right so uh I love

2398
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:23,479
that Mac one you know like I for the

2399
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:25,599
longest time that was my most sought

2400
01:43:23,479 --> 01:43:27,559
after strain because it it was something

2401
01:43:25,599 --> 01:43:29,679
that even to find like the rosin or the

2402
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:32,080
flower was elusive because only a few

2403
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:34,560
people had the cuts and so you'd find it

2404
01:43:32,079 --> 01:43:37,559
on the you know in the wreck Market

2405
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:39,199
somewhere and you'd buy like three grams

2406
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:41,400
or something spend all your all your

2407
01:43:39,198 --> 01:43:45,678
money on on a few Downs or a few few

2408
01:43:41,399 --> 01:43:47,759
chunks of nice looking flower but uh I I

2409
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:50,440
totally agree I think Mac one is

2410
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:52,639
definitely at least on the top the top

2411
01:43:50,439 --> 01:43:57,079
five list for most people if they've if

2412
01:43:52,639 --> 01:43:59,639
they've credit grown really well 100%

2413
01:43:57,079 --> 01:44:01,719
yeah all right uh so who's your favorite

2414
01:43:59,639 --> 01:44:05,000
breeder of all time whether or not this

2415
01:44:01,719 --> 01:44:07,158
is um due to the flower that you've had

2416
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:09,439
smoked of it or that you've seen of It

2417
01:44:07,158 --> 01:44:12,198
produced by other people or uh whether

2418
01:44:09,439 --> 01:44:14,960
it be just due to the the growing

2419
01:44:12,198 --> 01:44:17,719
properties that you've

2420
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:19,039
experienced um I would say the breeder

2421
01:44:17,719 --> 01:44:21,719
that's

2422
01:44:19,039 --> 01:44:23,719
probably you know I I think cap is up

2423
01:44:21,719 --> 01:44:27,880
there but i' probably go Thug pug for

2424
01:44:23,719 --> 01:44:30,480
that next spot um just a breeder when he

2425
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:32,679
you know the type of funky nasty stuff

2426
01:44:30,479 --> 01:44:36,919
that I'll get out of that stuff and

2427
01:44:32,679 --> 01:44:38,960
Classics like peanut butter breath um I

2428
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:41,800
think uh he's always got something in

2429
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:43,719
the mix you know whether it's that a lot

2430
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:45,880
of stuff you even see other people

2431
01:44:43,719 --> 01:44:46,960
they'll take um the meat breath or

2432
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:50,000
whatever

2433
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:51,840
else they'll F2 he they'll make whole

2434
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:54,039
family lines off of just that meat

2435
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:56,520
breath you know just so I think he has a

2436
01:44:54,039 --> 01:44:58,679
lot of a lot of Classics in there it's

2437
01:44:56,520 --> 01:45:02,239
like his his genetics have made other

2438
01:44:58,679 --> 01:45:04,800
people fortuns Almost sure sure yeah I

2439
01:45:02,238 --> 01:45:06,439
agree with that he's a great breeder I I

2440
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:08,840
remember one of the first places that I

2441
01:45:06,439 --> 01:45:10,479
worked at in the commercial Market we

2442
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:12,440
had this cut of peanut butter breath

2443
01:45:10,479 --> 01:45:14,598
that was just like our staple and we

2444
01:45:12,439 --> 01:45:18,799
grew it every round and it was just so

2445
01:45:14,599 --> 01:45:20,679
good H it was oh I do miss that and oh

2446
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:23,079
yeah I haven't ever grown out meat

2447
01:45:20,679 --> 01:45:25,039
breath I I I know that I've gotten a

2448
01:45:23,079 --> 01:45:28,118
clone from uh from

2449
01:45:25,039 --> 01:45:30,639
someone and uh I just never got around

2450
01:45:28,118 --> 01:45:32,920
to flowering it out because like right

2451
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:35,279
as I was about to I had to to move to a

2452
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:37,480
new spot and just cleared everything out

2453
01:45:35,279 --> 01:45:40,519
cuz it was uh untenable to take it all

2454
01:45:37,479 --> 01:45:44,399
with me but uh maybe again in the future

2455
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:45,599
that can happen I um but yeah Thug pugs

2456
01:45:44,399 --> 01:45:48,638
he's an amazing

2457
01:45:45,599 --> 01:45:50,480
breeder yeah he gets a lot of uh he he

2458
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:53,359
just you know gets it whatever his

2459
01:45:50,479 --> 01:45:55,319
selection is that that eye for that m or

2460
01:45:53,359 --> 01:45:57,598
whatever it is you know he just has that

2461
01:45:55,319 --> 01:45:59,158
something something that makes it makes

2462
01:45:57,599 --> 01:46:03,319
it pretty classic when he does do

2463
01:45:59,158 --> 01:46:05,118
something yep I uh oh what's it his the

2464
01:46:03,319 --> 01:46:09,479
mail that he uses for a bunch of stuff

2465
01:46:05,118 --> 01:46:11,960
is called studly spew right yeah yeah

2466
01:46:09,479 --> 01:46:14,799
that's it's so funny I I love the idea

2467
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:17,279
of naming a male uh plant just that

2468
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:18,639
you're keeping around because it's uh

2469
01:46:17,279 --> 01:46:20,719
like I feel like everything else just

2470
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:23,440
kind of leans towards like a a female

2471
01:46:20,719 --> 01:46:26,039
naming process or using

2472
01:46:23,439 --> 01:46:28,198
sure and I think he one first guys to do

2473
01:46:26,039 --> 01:46:30,198
that you know I you know I I don't know

2474
01:46:28,198 --> 01:46:31,559
if anybody else that did it before him

2475
01:46:30,198 --> 01:46:33,598
for sure but I know of people that have

2476
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:35,880
done it after him oh definitely

2477
01:46:33,599 --> 01:46:38,880
definitely myself included yeah

2478
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:40,599
absolutely I have as well it's a yeah

2479
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:42,118
that's a funny story for another time

2480
01:46:40,599 --> 01:46:43,440
sense once you see it like oh you know

2481
01:46:42,118 --> 01:46:46,880
that that is right I might as well give

2482
01:46:43,439 --> 01:46:49,638
him a manly studly you know kind of you

2483
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:53,000
know just a boisterous name just so how

2484
01:46:49,639 --> 01:46:53,719
masculine he is yeah exactly that's

2485
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,920
that's

2486
01:46:53,719 --> 01:46:59,599
hilarious um so what what was your most

2487
01:46:56,920 --> 01:47:02,560
memorable cannabis related experience

2488
01:46:59,599 --> 01:47:06,079
whether it be like smoking or or just

2489
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:06,080
other cannabis H

2490
01:47:06,599 --> 01:47:10,920
Jinks

2491
01:47:08,679 --> 01:47:14,239
um I

2492
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:16,440
mean I guess just being able to smoke it

2493
01:47:14,238 --> 01:47:19,118
in different places you know grow it and

2494
01:47:16,439 --> 01:47:21,519
smoke it and you know now that you have

2495
01:47:19,118 --> 01:47:23,238
a house and it's kind of like as a kid

2496
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:25,119
you know you kind of just smoke a you

2497
01:47:23,238 --> 01:47:27,959
can you know you didn't really get to

2498
01:47:25,118 --> 01:47:30,158
plan too much but I guess now growing it

2499
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:32,639
and kind of getting to plan and package

2500
01:47:30,158 --> 01:47:34,920
and go everywhere with it you know if I

2501
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:37,599
want to go on you know to the mountains

2502
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:39,719
it's it's in a you know a responsible

2503
01:47:37,599 --> 01:47:43,960
fashion you know you're doing everything

2504
01:47:39,719 --> 01:47:46,399
there or um I'm recently I have another

2505
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:48,158
trip to a Hawaii planned and you know

2506
01:47:46,399 --> 01:47:49,079
something about smoking weed in Hawaii

2507
01:47:48,158 --> 01:47:51,960
is

2508
01:47:49,079 --> 01:47:55,639
uh you know I don't know it's I I think

2509
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:57,520
it's I haven't been since 2019 but um

2510
01:47:55,639 --> 01:47:59,279
I'm planning to go back this next summer

2511
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:01,880
but something about just smoking weed

2512
01:47:59,279 --> 01:48:04,198
there is like you know it doesn't matter

2513
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:06,880
if you're by the beach if you're you

2514
01:48:04,198 --> 01:48:08,559
know in the mountain somewhere it's like

2515
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:12,159
you know just that Spirit just that

2516
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:16,520
relaxation like you really get that true

2517
01:48:12,158 --> 01:48:18,000
relaxation um the Aloha spirit so nice

2518
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:21,239
probably be doing one of those one you

2519
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:23,279
know hiking uh paying off the one of the

2520
01:48:21,238 --> 01:48:24,959
guys doing it on the zipline mining you

2521
01:48:23,279 --> 01:48:28,679
know all kinds of crazy stuff I like to

2522
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:30,198
get into but um you you know and I I

2523
01:48:28,679 --> 01:48:32,440
feel like I know the answer already to

2524
01:48:30,198 --> 01:48:33,919
this but what's your favorite uh method

2525
01:48:32,439 --> 01:48:38,118
of uh

2526
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:40,118
consumption uh joints I'm strictly a

2527
01:48:38,118 --> 01:48:45,198
joints white

2528
01:48:40,118 --> 01:48:47,799
paper um no no tobacco uh whatsoever no

2529
01:48:45,198 --> 01:48:49,719
you know just they're inefficient don't

2530
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:51,639
get me wrong you know they're they're

2531
01:48:49,719 --> 01:48:53,960
but they're tasty oh yeah you're going

2532
01:48:51,639 --> 01:48:56,400
to blow through a lot lot of lot of

2533
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:57,880
material but um you know if you're

2534
01:48:56,399 --> 01:49:00,879
trying to conserve I'd definitely say

2535
01:48:57,880 --> 01:49:03,279
grab a bowl and make it last but when

2536
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:04,800
you're growing it you can roll it as fat

2537
01:49:03,279 --> 01:49:07,000
as you want there's nothing better than

2538
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:08,920
a big old stinky

2539
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:11,399
joint yeah I

2540
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:13,679
mean I personally haven't smoked a joint

2541
01:49:11,399 --> 01:49:16,399
in in a couple years I just stick to a a

2542
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:19,199
volcano a vaporizer or like one of their

2543
01:49:16,399 --> 01:49:21,598
their handheld vaporizer it's just I was

2544
01:49:19,198 --> 01:49:24,759
uh oh your lungs will thank you yeah I

2545
01:49:21,599 --> 01:49:26,599
was hacking up a lung for sure so I I um

2546
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:28,800
I definitely had to to cut back on that

2547
01:49:26,599 --> 01:49:31,440
but I was also you know a smoker of

2548
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:33,119
cigarettes for a decade or more and that

2549
01:49:31,439 --> 01:49:35,799
probably did a little number on my lungs

2550
01:49:33,118 --> 01:49:40,238
where the Cannabis is just uh

2551
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:42,920
exacerbating that experience but yeah I

2552
01:49:40,238 --> 01:49:45,519
I do love joints I mean I also was a

2553
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:49,800
huge like blunt connoisseur for the

2554
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:51,719
longest time but uh yeah joints I I I've

2555
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:53,279
seen so many videos on your stories

2556
01:49:51,719 --> 01:49:55,639
where you just have like

2557
01:49:53,279 --> 01:49:58,639
big old finger joints that are just

2558
01:49:55,639 --> 01:50:00,719
dripping with resin and uh it always

2559
01:49:58,639 --> 01:50:03,880
just kind of makes me salivate a little

2560
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:06,920
bit oh yeah man I definitely love me yo

2561
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:09,359
one of the most resinous uh strains I

2562
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:13,399
ever grown was one of one that you gave

2563
01:50:09,359 --> 01:50:15,319
me a uh is that strawberry strawberry

2564
01:50:13,399 --> 01:50:18,679
guava

2565
01:50:15,319 --> 01:50:20,519
military dude that that ruined uh it

2566
01:50:18,679 --> 01:50:23,639
ruined a couple sleeves you know you

2567
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:26,840
have the little filters man thing was

2568
01:50:23,639 --> 01:50:29,079
that was some like I know if I want to

2569
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:32,079
break that over a joint it has to be a

2570
01:50:29,079 --> 01:50:34,000
cold day it has to be at least 30

2571
01:50:32,079 --> 01:50:35,198
degrees in my garage I even think to

2572
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,198
break that up or my hands are going to

2573
01:50:35,198 --> 01:50:40,799
be stuck to literally everything that's

2574
01:50:37,198 --> 01:50:42,000
crazy that sucker is amazing so I'm

2575
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:44,159
definitely can't wait to grow some more

2576
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:46,520
of that stuff out I hope I still have

2577
01:50:44,158 --> 01:50:48,879
some seeds I lost so much in the move I

2578
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:52,199
um I'll have to see if I can find some

2579
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:55,199
but uh yeah I have I have a couple on

2580
01:50:52,198 --> 01:50:56,638
hand I have I I actually f2d it um I

2581
01:50:55,198 --> 01:50:59,039
want I might need to get some of those

2582
01:50:56,639 --> 01:51:01,599
back from you to to continue the line

2583
01:50:59,039 --> 01:51:04,039
and put it back to the military ioss I

2584
01:51:01,599 --> 01:51:06,199
reversed meat breath to a couple I did

2585
01:51:04,039 --> 01:51:08,198
uh did some funky stuff to it but yeah I

2586
01:51:06,198 --> 01:51:10,678
it was definitely one of those resin

2587
01:51:08,198 --> 01:51:13,000
monsters couldn't believe it could not

2588
01:51:10,679 --> 01:51:16,039
believe it the strawberry guava itself

2589
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:18,039
was a bag seed um from a strawberry

2590
01:51:16,039 --> 01:51:20,880
guava plant that I had harvested

2591
01:51:18,039 --> 01:51:22,840
Outdoors at a facility and we found the

2592
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:27,078
seed in it and it turned out to to be

2593
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:28,840
female um and it uh I I didn't even uh

2594
01:51:27,078 --> 01:51:31,439
that was one of the last times I grew

2595
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:33,440
plants from seed and flowed the seed

2596
01:51:31,439 --> 01:51:36,118
plant and I I didn't save a cutting of

2597
01:51:33,439 --> 01:51:37,879
it and uh I just I just went straight

2598
01:51:36,118 --> 01:51:40,359
with the pollination of it and then just

2599
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:43,279
broke up the buds and smoked it as I was

2600
01:51:40,359 --> 01:51:46,559
as I was pulling seeds out and it was so

2601
01:51:43,279 --> 01:51:48,639
tasty I I kind of like regret doing that

2602
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:50,400
dude that's that's how the best strains

2603
01:51:48,639 --> 01:51:52,800
that's how that's how it goes you know

2604
01:51:50,399 --> 01:51:53,759
it's just the happen stance not like it

2605
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:56,679
was

2606
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:58,360
intentional just oh got some seeds there

2607
01:51:56,679 --> 01:52:01,359
all right it was the worst structure

2608
01:51:58,359 --> 01:52:04,759
plant too it was like bangers it was

2609
01:52:01,359 --> 01:52:07,519
spindly and and like the the buds were

2610
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:11,639
just like these you know solid stacks of

2611
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:13,440
kix's that were maybe 3 in Long growing

2612
01:52:11,639 --> 01:52:16,480
and it had like no structure to it

2613
01:52:13,439 --> 01:52:20,078
whatsoever but it was just fully resined

2614
01:52:16,479 --> 01:52:22,559
out and it just it tasted exactly like

2615
01:52:20,078 --> 01:52:24,840
strawberries and bananas and so I was

2616
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:28,760
was kind of devastated that I lost that

2617
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:31,078
but you know live and learn and uh I'm

2618
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:32,840
glad that that was like such a a

2619
01:52:31,078 --> 01:52:34,559
memorable experience for you as yeah

2620
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:36,239
dude now that you say that I'll have to

2621
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:38,039
uh next time I'm going through that bag

2622
01:52:36,238 --> 01:52:39,919
I'll put some together for you for sure

2623
01:52:38,039 --> 01:52:41,760
oh dude that would be awesome I will I

2624
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:45,199
will grow those out and hopefully save

2625
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:46,840
something this time definitely man it's

2626
01:52:45,198 --> 01:52:49,039
always good when you think one got away

2627
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:50,440
and it's a buddy has some seeds

2628
01:52:49,039 --> 01:52:52,920
somewhere like oh I still have some

2629
01:52:50,439 --> 01:52:56,198
seeds of that little [ __ ] all right

2630
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:57,760
yeah absolutely it's uh I feel like

2631
01:52:56,198 --> 01:53:00,198
that's the best part about sharing too

2632
01:52:57,760 --> 01:53:02,079
and another point in the industry where

2633
01:53:00,198 --> 01:53:03,919
people could maybe take a a little

2634
01:53:02,078 --> 01:53:05,719
pointer of just getting some of these

2635
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:07,760
genetics out to more people just so that

2636
01:53:05,719 --> 01:53:09,719
they're there if they need them

2637
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:11,639
definitely I think right now everyone's

2638
01:53:09,719 --> 01:53:14,760
still kind of in the I'm gonna hit It

2639
01:53:11,639 --> 01:53:16,000
Rich this is a goal you know once they

2640
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:18,719
once they get their heads out of the

2641
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:21,920
sand and realize it's for sharing for

2642
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:24,639
Community for love not for these big

01:53:29,439 --> 01:53:34,479
you know this is something deeper than

2647
01:53:31,439 --> 01:53:37,039
just a quick little you know hoarding

2648
01:53:34,479 --> 01:53:39,439

2652
01:53:44,078 --> 01:53:48,920
this on it's uh cannabis is deeper than

2653
01:53:47,158 --> 01:53:51,000
a lot of people give it credit for and

2654
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:52,239
we should all just you know respect the

2655
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,439
plan a little more and hope that we get

01:53:52,238 --> 01:53:55,759
a little a little more respect as a

2657
01:53:53,439 --> 01:53:58,000
community if we uh if we get people to
