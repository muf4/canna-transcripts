um I'm excited to talk and um yeah I

14
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:41,238
just started a new soil grow um when I

15
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:45,119
first learned I learned doing Rock wol

16
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:47,519
so now I'm learning soil it's pretty

17
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,320
interesting cool and what type of soil

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,480
are you using in

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,399
it um it's Pete Moss perlite and it's

20
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:59,398
actually my co-workers kind of like

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,480
setup um okay like their Blend or

22
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:06,280
something exactly yeah um okay cool I

23
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,920
can look for it he definitely sent it

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,759
over to

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,719
me so it sounds like you're using like

26
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:15,118
sort of like a living soil setup or

27
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,000
something with a is it like a water only

28
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,000
system for that

29
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:24,560
or no um I'm using nutrients as

30
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:26,799
well oh okay yeah cool just using a

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,600
different substrate rather than uh than

32
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,399
uh rock wall

33
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:34,879
yes yeah Co cool awesome well um I'll

34
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:37,920
just get right into some of these

35
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:40,078
questions um so what was your first

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,920
experience growing did you um did you

37
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:45,319
start uh growing other plants before you

38
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,240
uh started growing

39
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:51,639
cannabis um so I kind of go back to like

40
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:54,239
high school or middle school when you

41
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,280
learned in science class to grow a seed

42
00:01:54,239 --> 00:02:00,560
in a bag with the paper you know um I

43
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,640
did that but I never did it at home so

44
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,960
my first grow actually was Cannabis over

45
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:10,959
a year ago oh nice and um it actually it

46
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:14,400
led me to growing vegetables and

47
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:17,680
fruits now so I grow

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,920
both nice yeah we uh we like to say that

49
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,480
cannabis is the gateway drug to

50
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:26,039
gardening um you it feels like if uh if

51
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:27,679
you weren't um growing vegetables or

52
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,079
fruit or anything like that before you

53
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,360
all of a sudden get interested because

54
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,760
you see how fast and vigorous like a

55
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,680
cannabis plant can grow and you're like

56
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:36,079
oh I can do other things now and uh

57
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,599
abolutely it just leads you into the

58
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,800
garden as as a whole yeah that's awesome

59
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:43,759
um so what uh what got you into growing

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,599
cannabis then did you um I mean were you

61
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,199
a a user beforehand were you just

62
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:51,919
interested in it like what got you into

63
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:54,719
it so it starts back in high school um I

64
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:57,359
actually sold cannabis in high school I

65
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:01,959
was kind of like your high school plug

66
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:07,239
per se um okay yeah so um I started off

67
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:11,799
with that and then um La last year I

68
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:14,120
started smoking jungle boys flow and I

69
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,680
really liked it I enjoyed the taste I

70
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,439
was curious to how they grow it so I

71
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,400
started watching videos on YouTube and I

72
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:23,318
was like I need to do this myself um

73
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,680
I've always wanted to grow at home but I

74
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:30,238
never had like the uh equipment or room

75
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,200
so finally last year I had everything

76
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,519
ready to go um I was luckily able to

77
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:38,158
finance equipment through

78
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,920
Amazon so it made it a lot easier for me

79
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,280
to start and just get equipment um

80
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:46,079
through the stages than getting

81
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,640
everything at once and uh it was just it

82
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,239
was hard financially to get started so

83
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:55,399
having that Finance helped a

84
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,039
lot okay cool and so is that just kind

85
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,438
of like a payment plan thing where you

86
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:03,158
get to like uh like pay it off over time

87
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:04,799
kind of absolutely yeah it's uh through

88
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:10,199
Amazon it's called a

89
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:13,439
firm and you can pick um your APR and

90
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:16,519
what you want to do for your um payment

91
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,959
plan um so it's really affordable that

92
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,199
way to

93
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,199
start okay um well I didn't even know

94
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,199
that that was like a thing that but

95
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:28,478
that's really cool um I mean it it does

96
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,720
help people get into it uh if they can't

97
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,519
necessarily like cuz it it is really

98
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,520
expensive to get into it especially like

99
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:36,879
some of the lights and even uh the

100
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:38,439
different nutrients and if you have if

101
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,800
you want different like control

102
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:42,319
equipment or um monitoring equipment

103
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,800
that can get start to get really pricey

104
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,759
really quick oh yeah and as a home

105
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,120
grower just wanting to get into it I

106
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,600
could understand not necessarily having

107
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,639
all those funds around I think I I put

108
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,199
mine together slowly but surely as well

109
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:59,199
where it was like I think I started in I

110
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:02,759
I built a tent out of just like um some

111
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:06,080
spare Lumber that was around and uh like

112
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,879
moving blankets and myar blankets on the

113
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,959
inside for like the reflective surface

114
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:14,159
and then a like I I found like a $100

115
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,399
LED light on Amazon I think it was like

116
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,560
5 years ago or five and a half years ago

117
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,079
now and it was kind of a piece of crap

118
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,478
but it still worked and I still got I

119
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:24,839
grew ruts and it was awesome nice turned

120
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:26,800
out really nice was that when you first

121
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:29,719
started growing at

122
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,800
home that's like when I first started

123
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,039
growing uh where I was like really

124
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,160
putting effort into trying to learn

125
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:40,519
about how to

126
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:43,639
um like best grow cannabis cuz before

127
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:45,680
that uh my partner and I had like had

128
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:50,240
some plants grow at one apartment that

129
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:53,240
we lived at and we had uh you know

130
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,680
always been users and before that my my

131
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,120
dad grew and I like had one plant I

132
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,918
think in high school or something it was

133
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,038
uh but in earnest it was only like 5

134
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:09,598
years ago

135
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:12,719
okay yeah um but okay so let's see you

136
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:18,120
evolved pretty quickly in 5

137
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:20,759
years I a lot of reading and a lot of uh

138
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:25,519
time on like forums and listening to

139
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:28,240
videos and more reading um and and then

140
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,120
applying those practices as as much as I

141
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,400
could so I I tried to immediate get into

142
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,720
like the commercial space and from there

143
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,598
it was just kind of uh every place that

144
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,520
I worked at I learned something new and

145
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:42,240
I was able to apply it and uh when I had

146
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:44,719
a home grow it was

147
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,560
um yeah it was all applied at home so I

148
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,039
could kind of reaffirm the actions

149
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,800
rather than just seeing how other people

150
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:54,279
did it um I could understand sort of the

151
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,400
processes behind it but um yeah I feel

152
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:58,439
like in a a lot there's so much

153
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,079
accessible information nowadays that

154
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,879
it's easy to learn a lot in a short

155
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,800
amount of time if you um if it's like

156
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,000
not only your hobby but you put your

157
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,439
professional time into it as well as I'm

158
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,240
sure you know like so

159
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:15,279
um back back to back to your story so

160
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,800
you um you know you you started growing

161
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:22,638
at home uh just a little over a year ago

162
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,520
and um uh tell us kind of your process

163
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,598
of how you figured out how you wanted to

164
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:29,719
grow and then um the processes you used

165
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,399
cuz you were pretty successful ear early

166
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,319
on i' I've been kind of following your

167
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:35,918
story since you started on Instagram

168
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:38,039
when you were first um helping manage

169
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:41,359
someone else's cannabis account so let's

170
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:44,598
uh like talk about a little of uh like

171
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,919
where your processes came from so it did

172
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:50,079
start when I started smoking jungle boys

173
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:53,799
flour um that's when I started really

174
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:57,038
researching like the Athena nutrients

175
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:00,439
line which is what I use and using rock

176
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:01,918
wool um I kind of CAU copied what jungle

177
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:05,598
boys

178
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:12,519
does um I first started off with the 4in

179
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:15,478
cubes and um when I met my mentor Matt

180
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:20,000
um which I found him off YouTube

181
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:23,240
searching Rock Roll grow um his were

182
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,519
really um he just had a lot of

183
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,918
information and more like scienti

184
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:31,279
scientific

185
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:33,439
facts and I liked that about his page so

186
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:36,319
I actually reached out to him and said

187
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,519
hey could you help me uh grow uh it's my

188
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,959
I'm on my first grow I'm growing in 4in

189
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:43,278
cubes using

190
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:45,799
Athena um could you help me from start

191
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:49,679
to finish and he was more than willing

192
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:52,439
to help me um he would call me email me

193
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,799
text me just tell me everything that he

194
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:58,040
knows and I listened to everything he

195
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,958
told me and I was successful that way um

196
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:02,278
I believe growing

197
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:05,039
in general that it's important to have

198
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:05,039
help in other

199
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,359
resources yeah absolutely so what what

200
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:13,159
were some of the um like the first

201
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,399
methods that you were told would work

202
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:18,078
for you and like uh when you said that

203
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,759
you followed the the Athena method or

204
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:21,319
the jungle boys method are are you

205
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,559
referring to kind of like their their

206
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,240
handbook and sort of what they had like

207
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:27,759
described about in there and then um

208
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,879
yeah what like how did you how did you

209
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:33,120
go about that first grow

210
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:36,200
so I actually they have a YouTube video

211
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,159
on how to grow and how they do it so I

212
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,200
kind of just rewinded it and just paused

213
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:44,719
and and just wrote down everything list

214
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,399
by list like what do I need to start um

215
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,440
and then uh when I went to a hydroponic

216
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,799
store my first time I bought Athena

217
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,959
products there and they gave me a free

218
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:57,199
handbook when I bought Athena and um oh

219
00:09:55,958 --> 00:10:01,319
that's cool I started learning more

220
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,320
through the handbook yeah

221
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,040
okay um so what do you think since since

222
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:10,079
you have been growing for uh you know a

223
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,639
somewhat shorter amount of time and it

224
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:13,719
seems as though you've made uh

225
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:16,519
significant changes in your grow from

226
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,120
like each of your grows uh how how do

227
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,240
you feel like those changes have gone

228
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,720
and sort of what has been like the

229
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,879
things that you've learned from those

230
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,120
different uh

231
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:29,958
changes so I feel like each grow I

232
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,440
advance and I just learn more and more

233
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:36,239
um in general even with my

234
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:41,000
setups um right now I don't have a

235
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:43,000
proper drainage system for my plants but

236
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,519
uh I make it work I have little caddies

237
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
they sit on and they have drainage trays

238
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:52,078
so I have to manually uh drain out the

239
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,078
trays and I get a lot of floods because

240
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:57,479
of that but luckily they're up

241
00:10:54,078 --> 00:11:00,319
above they're up above and I've learned

242
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,920
uh throughout growing of how many

243
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,120
irrigation shots that I should be giving

244
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:06,120
my plants so that way I don't get so

245
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,278
much

246
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,799
runoff um okay and these words that I'm

247
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:14,278
using I would have never used in my very

248
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:17,559
first grow like I I would have no idea

249
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:19,958
to say irrigation shots and runoff it's

250
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:22,958
just stuff like kind of words you just

251
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:26,559
learn over time okay yeah for sure I

252
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:29,319
mean it I feel like it it is a really

253
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:31,439
um there there's so much spe

254
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,879
specifically within like the commercial

255
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,560
or the cultivation culture of cannabis

256
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:39,720
where um we have these terms that we've

257
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:42,159
created as a community over like however

258
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,639
many decades of growing and even some of

259
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,120
those terms have changed and evolved

260
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:48,759
over time but a lot of it was because it

261
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,839
was almost like you had to talk about it

262
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:53,319
this way um because it was illegal and

263
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,320
you didn't want people to know exactly

264
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,680
what you were talking about but even now

265
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,879
there seems to be a lot of like not

266
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:06,359
necessarily proprietary but it it feels

267
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:09,240
like uh like a lot of it is just

268
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,560
um very unique to cannabis and to to

269
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,000
cannabis cultivation shots might not be

270
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:15,599
I don't I don't know if that's referred

271
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,399
to in other forms of like Horticulture

272
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,040
or agriculture where they use um drip

273
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,600
emitters and cuz like there's some

274
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,919
tomatoes that are grown on rock wool and

275
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,680
there's a lot of other crops grown on

276
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:29,278
rockwool and hydroponic systems and

277
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:31,599
stuff like that but um yeah it's very

278
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,120
it's a great point where like a lot of

279
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,199
people hear this stuff uh if they're

280
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,039
trying to get into cultivation and they

281
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:39,359
don't really understand these different

282
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:42,078
terms

283
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,000
um what do you think was one of like the

284
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:44,919
the other than the terminology what do

285
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,679
you think was one of the biggest

286
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:50,599
learning curves you had like getting

287
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:53,838
into growing um like what were some of

288
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,519
the things that you were found to need

289
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,880
the most of your attention when when

290
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,600
learning about

291
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:04,320
it um I think it's really important to

292
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:08,120
know each stage for sure um and know

293
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,839
when your plants are ready to switch um

294
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:14,480
and it's really important to have a

295
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:16,920
handbook or some kind of uh

296
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,879
dosage uh for your

297
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:22,919
nutrients um I feel like that helps uh

298
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:26,799
protect you from any deficiencies if you

299
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:29,639
have something to look at and measure by

300
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:32,759
uh I believe that's really important

301
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:35,839
and um also like learning the steps that

302
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,799
you need to do for each stage um my when

303
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,240
I first

304
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,958
grew uh I didn't really realize there

305
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,278
was all these steps that you needed to

306
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:46,638
do at a certain day or

307
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:48,838
week um now that I am in a commercial

308
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,759
setting I have learned more of like for

309
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:56,720
instance day 10 is the day that we like

310
00:13:52,759 --> 00:14:00,199
to skirt our plants or

311
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,440
lollipop um okay some other might think

312
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:05,838
you know differently or do things

313
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:08,040
differently that's fine but I've just

314
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,240
learned throughout you know growing that

315
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:13,599
there's a bunch of different times and

316
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,360
certain days that you should do things

317
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,360
to not stress your plants out and to

318
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,159
have a better grow yeah that's very true

319
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,480
and I feel like so much of it is

320
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,159
somewhat subjective um like for me I I

321
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,440
don't like to do any of the skirting

322
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:28,480
until the um the plants have finished

323
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,639
stretching and like finished their

324
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,959
flower set

325
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,039
I agree I think you know depending on

326
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:37,479
the different the like depending on the

327
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:39,759
setup it could uh it could be beneficial

328
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,720
um cuz I know one thing I've seen when

329
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,199
pruning early in the stretch is you get

330
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,680
a little bit of a a vegetative response

331
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:48,559
so like the plants will um sometimes get

332
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:50,838
a little bit taller than they might

333
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:52,479
otherwise um so if you have a large

334
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:54,160
space or if you have a canopy that needs

335
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,159
to be filled up still that might be

336
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:58,159
beneficial but if you have a smaller

337
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,039
space or a lower ceiling height or

338
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:02,278
something then you really want to make

339
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:04,159
sure that you're just getting the plants

340
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:06,720
to stretch as much as they will based on

341
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,799
your irrigation practices or the the

342
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,879
genetic potential of the plant or

343
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,519
otherwise and um and that way when you

344
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:15,799
prune they kind of just stay right where

345
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:20,839
they are already that makes a lot of

346
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:25,000
sense cuz this grow I listen to what my

347
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:27,519
bosses say and skirt at day 10 and uh I

348
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,318
have some sativas this is my first time

349
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,799
growing sativas so it's pretty fun and I

350
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:34,879
was expecting really tall plants but my

351
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,078
Strawberry Cough ended up being really

352
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,439
short and that's it could be because I

353
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:42,638
skirted too

354
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:44,959
early you know and um I I think also

355
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,759
some of the genetics like uh when they

356
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:50,119
when they say like sativa or Inda it can

357
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,278
sometimes be a little misleading cuz um

358
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,440
it's like some sativas now are so far

359
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:56,519
bred away from where they were that's

360
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,040
it's sometimes like the the effects that

361
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:02,839
are described as sativa versus the

362
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:04,919
growth pattern um because uh I I usually

363
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:08,720
like to describe it as like equatorial

364
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:11,719
versus um

365
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,199
uh I forget the other one but basically

366
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,519
like if it's near the equator versus

367
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:19,359
every uh latitude that it goes up um and

368
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,879
gets further away from the equator I

369
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,000
feel like they get squatter and squatter

370
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:28,278
um just based on the the lighting cycles

371
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,879
and stuff but um yeah sometimes I feel

372
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:32,078
like that might be a little bit bit

373
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:33,720
misleading with in terms of what you

374
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:37,239
would assume the structure to be as a

375
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,440
grower um when someone says the tee are

376
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,799
indicia

377
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:46,120
um so uh let's talk then about like what

378
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:47,799
your current grow right now so um why

379
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,799
don't you go over sort of what you're

380
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:53,599
doing for your uh hydroponic setup and

381
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:55,639
then what you're doing for your um with

382
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,040
the rock wool and then how it differs

383
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:01,240
from what you're doing with the uh the

384
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:05,000
potting mix based

385
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:08,318
grow so in my experience right now I

386
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,519
want to say Hydroponics is easier um

387
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:14,519
it's just less headache uh even with

388
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:19,599
nutrients uh I use three different

389
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:22,400
nutrients core um bloom and grow just

390
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:26,198
three things and then with the soil I'm

391
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,960
using like 8 to 10 different things and

392
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:33,360
it just kind of feels like I'm more like

393
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:36,200
a scientist in soil growing but but I

394
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:38,558
feel like it's it takes more time to you

395
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,200
know measure everything out you know get

396
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:44,038
everything precise and and for my

397
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,120
hydroponic grow it's super quick I can

398
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:49,279
whale out everything super fast and have

399
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:51,918
my reservoir ready in like 10 minutes

400
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:54,319
but it took me like half an hour just to

401
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,480
do four gallons for my soil

402
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:59,759
grow uh just adding all the little you

403
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,240
know things

404
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,158
nutrients when when you're doing when

405
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,000
you're using the um Athena for your

406
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:09,400
Hydroponics are you using the Athena

407
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,640
Proline yes okay cool yeah that

408
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:16,320
three-part fertilizers are really easy I

409
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:19,038
love it um it it does make life really

410
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:23,359
easy um and then

411
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:25,519
so when you're doing the um Athena uh

412
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:28,240
are you running like any uh like

413
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:30,679
supplemental CO2 anything else and then

414
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,919
like what are you running your EC at and

415
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:34,360
kind of what are some of the targets

416
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,960
that you shoot for um cuz a lot of your

417
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:37,839
grows do look really nice and for

418
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,558
someone that has only been growing for a

419
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,480
little over a year it's it's really

420
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:43,359
great to see people that have success

421
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,519
because it shows that other people can

422
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,558
do this too at at home without you know

423
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,960
if they enjoy smoking cannabis or if

424
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:51,399
they enjoy consuming it and they uh

425
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,400
don't want to keep spending the money

426
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,080
but they also enjoy like the hobby of

427
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,280
gardening I feel like it's really

428
00:18:55,079 --> 00:19:00,279
important to uh for people to see that

429
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:04,759
they can and be successful in their

430
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:08,839
grows at home early on oh yeah it's very

431
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:11,279
doable for sure but I think uh having a

432
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:14,158
mentor definitely helped me learn things

433
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,240
a lot quicker understand things better

434
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:19,280
um if I didn't have someone to guide me

435
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,679
I probably would be a little held back

436
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:26,038
and maybe not know as much as I do now

437
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:29,559
for sure um I was running

438
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:32,919
CO2 and it's kind of kind of uh

439
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:37,918
expensive to be honest uh I was running

440
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:42,240
through it like every week a 25 lb tank

441
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:45,120
and I was spending $45 every week on it

442
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,880
and it just became too expensive um I

443
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:48,879
didn't notice a huge difference not

444
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,440
having

445
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:55,039
it but it did hurt me because when I ran

446
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,519
out I didn't have an exhaust in one of

447
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,519
my grows and I experienced some mold

448
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:03,839
problems

449
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:06,200
um and I lost probably like I don't know

450
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,759
I I yielded one and a half pounds and

451
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,840
I've could have gotten like at least 2

452
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:12,319
lbs so I feel like that hurt me a little

453
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:16,480
bit and set me

454
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:19,720
back um but instead of running CO2 I got

455
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:23,038
an exhaust and hopefully no mold this

456
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:25,480
time cool yeah I mean definitely if

457
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:28,279
you're if you're running CO2 in a tent

458
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,919
and it's uh it's really hard if you're

459
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:31,720
um especially if you're like getting

460
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,679
into the beginning of summer or

461
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,600
something along those lines where the it

462
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,519
everything starts to heat up and you

463
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:41,719
have all that transpiration um yeah it

464
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,918
it it becomes really hard to mitigate

465
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:47,640
mold if you're not exhausting that that

466
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:51,360
extra humidity um and and usually I find

467
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,720
like especially with tent grows uh that

468
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:56,240
exhaust is so important that CO2 can

469
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,720
sometimes you know you do run into like

470
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,279
where you're just running through it so

471
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,480
quickly or the fact that the tents are

472
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:02,879
usually you know mesh and they're

473
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,200
semi-permeable you have a little bit of

474
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,600
loss through the zippers and and the

475
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,319
different ducks and whatnot um so it

476
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:13,599
does it it does become a little bit like

477
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:15,519
hard to to keep up with the cost of it

478
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:18,439
even if it does get you a little bit

479
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:21,278
more uh like chunky chunky flowers at

480
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,840
the end of it um so I get that I've

481
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:25,440
always wanted to run CO2 at home but I

482
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,798
feel like you do have

483
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,798
to you would have to then like have this

484
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:34,679
whole setup and uh was something that I

485
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:38,558
never was able to do yeah yeah you need

486
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:40,919
like uh air conditioning and you need um

487
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:42,720
definitely dehumidification and all

488
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,240
these different things and all that adds

489
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,278
on to your electrical cost yeah so I

490
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,919
don't think it's that important uh even

491
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:51,519
though if you look at videos on YouTube

492
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,720
they're always like oh use CO2 it's

493
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:56,278
going to help your yield and it might

494
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,679
but it's going to cost you a lot more

495
00:21:56,278 --> 00:22:01,440
yeah absolutely like in a commercial

496
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:03,720
space where you have the ability to uh

497
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,558
air condition and and um control

498
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:09,960
humidity and and other environmental

499
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:12,079
factors then it it almost uh would make

500
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,000
uh it would make less sense to not run

501
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:16,240
it you you almost have to run it in

502
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,440
order for the all the equipment to run

503
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,278
it Peak Performance um and and for you

504
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,919
to increase your yields by by that

505
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:26,960
amount you know I I always think

506
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,159
like it's not like you get like this uh

507
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,880
this double return though or like you if

508
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:34,080
you can add CO2 and then Peak every like

509
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,960
all the other uh parameters out like

510
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,519
your ppfd and your temperature and

511
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,919
humidity and uh the differentials uh for

512
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:41,639
all the different settings for day and

513
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,080
night and whatnot I just you still

514
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,360
probably won't double your output um if

515
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:49,839
you add CO2 but if if you're able to get

516
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:51,719
everywhere everything else to that point

517
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,599
then it seems like it's still worth it

518
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,319
no matter what um but yeah not not

519
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:59,240
necessarily in a home grow that's that's

520
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:02,639
a a totally different situation

521
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:05,200
that's what my my mentor taught me to do

522
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,559
cuz he does that at his home grows but

523
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,000
he has an open space so it makes it a

524
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:11,639
lot better to use if you have an open

525
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,079
space I

526
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,640
believe like a like a room or something

527
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,158
that he has like sealed off or something

528
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,559
exactly like you were saying with the

529
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:24,880
tents it's just not

530
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:27,079
it so yeah yeah I I wouldn't use CO2

531
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,960
again unless I have open space or a

532
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:31,639
bigger grow going on

533
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,159
but it was fun to learn fair

534
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,720
enough yeah absolutely it's it's it

535
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,200
doesn't hurt you know it makes me think

536
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,159
of those like

537
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,360
uh those exhaust bags or I forget what

538
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,278
they're called but they're basically

539
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:47,000
like a a mushroom block that you can wet

540
00:23:44,278 --> 00:23:49,599
down and hang inside the grow and it cuz

541
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,919
mushrooms produce CO2 so you're all just

542
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:53,399
making making CO2 with mushrooms but

543
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,000
what's funny is I bought one of those

544
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:59,038
bags I bought one of those bags and then

545
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,919
my mentor was like just get a tank and I

546
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:04,079
returned the bag i' never even used it

547
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,080
um oh I don't know how much they

548
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:10,079
actually produce um because I've I've

549
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:13,399
seen people where I think at one point

550
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:16,960
on uh like the build-a soil uh YouTube

551
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:19,400
channel he had his 10x10 tent uh being

552
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,240
and he exhausted into it from a mushroom

553
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,519
tent so it pulled all the CO2 and cooler

554
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,159
air into that tent and I was like that's

555
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:28,639
not a bad idea especially if you're in

556
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,399
like Colorado like he is and you're all

557
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,840
that extra humidity into the tent as

558
00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:34,798
well to compensate so what a great idea

559
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:37,558
like that's that's not a bad idea yeah

560
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:39,639
right makes me want to like grow some uh

561
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:42,879
oyster mushrooms and some shiitake

562
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:47,679
mushrooms yes um I want to do that too

563
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:50,240
yeah right and I so I I had grown um

564
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:56,080
organically at one point in like a 30

565
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:59,278
gallon uh pot and used a local um like

566
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:04,359
super soil uh living living soil blend

567
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:07,640
in indor up and it um It produced so

568
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:09,918
much CO2 that like the parts per million

569
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:14,038
at the surface of the the substrate were

570
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:16,320
like 800 um and so it like made it it it

571
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:18,359
did its own thing because it had all the

572
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:20,359
uh fungal colonies in the substrate

573
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:22,678
already basically acted like a giant

574
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:26,240
mushroom block that's crazy um so that

575
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:27,960
was pretty cool that's really cool um so

576
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,839
yeah how much did you yield off your

577
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:35,600
plant if I can ask you remember um off

578
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:38,720
of it was one plant under in a 4x4 area

579
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:41,158
and I'm pretty I I only weighed like a

580
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,000
quarter of it because by the time that I

581
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:45,960
had it all all dried and done I had kind

582
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,319
of just like divied it up and then

583
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,480
realized I hadn't weighed it so I

584
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:52,158
weighed what was the remaining quarter

585
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,440
of it and it it was like 2.1 lb out of

586
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:59,039
that one space the one uh area and it

587
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:01,798
was under a 340 WT LED

588
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:05,919
so it was pretty good for for that

589
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:08,319
little over um 2 G per watt yeah uh and

590
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,600
that was pretty nice uh and it was like

591
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:12,158
one single plant too in this giant pot I

592
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:15,839
think I vegged it for like a month and a

593
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:20,159
half it was crazy wow um but it was fun

594
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:21,439
yeah um so you have uh so tell us a

595
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,720
little bit more then about your

596
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,000
hydroponic setup uh What uh like what EC

597
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,640
are you running and what are some of the

598
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:35,640
other targets that you usually look for

599
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:38,120
so in early veg I start off with 1.0

600
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:41,759
EC um at my

601
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:42,759
job they start off 3.0 and run it all

602
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:46,319
the way

603
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:48,679
3.0 from start to finish um but I was

604
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:52,158
taught to start at like 1.0 and then

605
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:56,278
kind of work your way up slowly to 3.0

606
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:58,360
EC um but for the run you see a

607
00:26:56,278 --> 00:27:00,839
difference between those two methods

608
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:02,119
sorry sorry for a little Sidetrack but

609
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:06,959
do you see a difference between those

610
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:10,079
three two methods I do I see less stress

611
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:13,640
and uh kind of like I didn't really have

612
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:17,439
deficiency but just more stress for sure

613
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:19,600
and um I had some yellowing going on but

614
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:23,679
nothing too concerning when I was just

615
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:27,398
pushing 3.0 from the start to to end um

616
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:30,480
I like to ease up I feel like that helps

617
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:33,319
better for the plants or they like it

618
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,319
better that's awesome yeah definitely I

619
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:37,639
feel like I hear that a lot so it's it's

620
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:39,158
good to just have one more uh anecdotal

621
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,799
evidence to say so I feel like

622
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:42,960
commercially they kind of just they

623
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:45,720
start at 3.0 just to like push it and

624
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,519
get it you know going uh cuz commercial

625
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,519
is just Bam Bam fast let's get these in

626
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:54,679
and get them out you know but at home

627
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:57,240
you can have the patience and start off

628
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:59,360
slow with your EC and you know get all

629
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,679
the way to 3.0

630
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:03,000
um but with my EC run off and all the

631
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,840
plants get a little bit of extra

632
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,839
treatment too because you got you know

633
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:12,319
got the time to take to um to hang out

634
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:16,278
with each plant individually basically

635
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:19,000
yes and and for the runoff um I was

636
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:22,440
taught to not go over 9

637
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:26,200
EC um but I've also been taught to not

638
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:28,720
go over seven e see so I mean I've gone

639
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:32,480
over nine and

640
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:36,278
yeah I had it I had some run off EC

641
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:39,519
mhm wow and I noticed uh it was kind of

642
00:28:36,278 --> 00:28:43,079
towards the end uh like around week five

643
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:44,919
or six where my runoff was that high and

644
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:47,439
it was good the colors were coming in

645
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:50,480
great but the leaves were just kind of

646
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:54,278
getting a little crispy burnt uh

647
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:59,240
tips but I mean it's part of like the

648
00:28:54,278 --> 00:29:03,480
fade per se so mhm

649
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:06,960
um but right now I'm having my EC at or

650
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:10,278
EC runoff at 7 I'm trying not to go past

651
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,840
that and my plant seem pretty happy with

652
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:15,359
that

653
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:17,480
nice yeah you know I um I've seen EC

654
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:20,519
like yeah way in the runoff way over

655
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,240
nine and it was uh like it I think

656
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:25,359
sometimes it depends on the size of the

657
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:28,480
substrate as well so if you like have um

658
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:30,398
like a 4in uh Rock wo and you have a

659
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,919
really high EC coming out of it there's

660
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:35,599
and you're also getting a pretty big

661
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,759
dryback then um typically like I I think

662
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:40,759
like at the point of dryback the EC and

663
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,798
the substrate is going to be more than

664
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:44,759
what the runoff EC is going to be just

665
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:46,839
because of the lack of water and as the

666
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:48,278
water like goes away and any salts that

667
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:52,480
are left in there it just keeps

668
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:54,079
compounding how um how much uh salt is

669
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,599
felt by the roots in terms of the

670
00:29:54,079 --> 00:30:00,158
osmotic stress and so if you have a

671
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:03,278
bigger um pot though

672
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,480
and you can have like you know if you

673
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:07,679
have 9.0 EC runoff in that but then it's

674
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,919
not drying back as far usually that

675
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:14,000
still means that like the the the PO

676
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:15,600
water EC isn't spiking up past uh or or

677
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
to the same point that the smaller

678
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:19,879
substrate was so I could see how like

679
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,798
especially in rock wall just how dry

680
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,360
sometimes they can get between the end

681
00:30:21,798 --> 00:30:25,599
of the day and and the first irrigation

682
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:27,639
yeah you could probably get some pretty

683
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:29,240
darn High ECS in there and get a little

684
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,240
bit of that tip burning and stuff I

685
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,240
could see that did you did you find

686
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,720
though that um when you're getting that

687
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,919
little extra stress in the plants did

688
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:42,600
you feel as though the um the turpine

689
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:44,600
profile or any of the other like uh um

690
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:47,000
like secondary metabolites and tertiary

691
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:49,599
metabolites like the uh the triome

692
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,079
production and the cannaboid production

693
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:54,319
uh increase um because sometimes I see

694
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,240
like the triome production just goes

695
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,519
crazy when you get all these really far

696
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,599
dryb backs and high ECS and

697
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:02,480
sometimes uh like that you can start to

698
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:05,119
get these really pungent days where they

699
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,120
start to really

700
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:10,120
smell um

701
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,319
yes um I

702
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:15,079
noticed

703
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:18,200
like how would I say it just like more

704
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:20,319
colors coming in and yeah more

705
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,960
smells

706
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:26,599
um and it seemed like I was getting a

707
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:30,000
lot of moisture too in the buds and

708
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:33,759
maybe that's why I had some mold issues

709
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,960
too um okay when you when you say like

710
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:36,440
you were getting a lot of moisture in

711
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,519
the buds what do you what do you mean by

712
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,440
that you could just like were you seeing

713
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:42,200
stuff on the buds or no but you could

714
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,200
just tell like that they were wet by

715
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,639
when you would de like when you take off

716
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:51,200
a leaf it just seemed super like wet you

717
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:52,678
know what I mean uh than my other grow

718
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,919
when I when I pulled off leaves from my

719
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:55,840
other grow it was kind of more like a

720
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,600
dry when the leaves came off it just

721
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:01,439
like Snap off but with the high you see

722
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:05,798
the leaves felt more

723
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:08,080
wet interesting um almost like they were

724
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:12,038
a little bit more leathery or something

725
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:14,638
uh like they had a a kind of a a thicker

726
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:16,519
um like the leaf was almost thicker or

727
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:19,398
something

728
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:21,359
or um I guess when you know when you

729
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:22,719
pull a leaf off and sometimes they come

730
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:25,079
off like super

731
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,360
crispy and then sometimes they come off

732
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:29,759
and you you get like a little like uh I

733
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:31,798
guess they they say it's like the

734
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:34,919
plant's blood or whatever when you pull

735
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:37,079
off a leaf but I felt like I feel like

736
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:39,360
it's just the moisture kind of like okay

737
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:41,678
I I see what you're saying like almost

738
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:43,199
uh like where you break it off at water

739
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,360
water will come out of the plant or

740
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,159
something okay yeah definitely like it

741
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:52,319
has um like there's there's a high uh uh

742
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:53,799
water pressure in the in the stem yes

743
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:55,918
that's the word I'm looking for when you

744
00:32:53,798 --> 00:32:57,960
when you see that H when you see that

745
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,840
happening do do the plants usually have

746
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,798
a lot of turer like where all the leaves

747
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:07,519
are kind of preying up towards the light

748
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:09,398
yes yeah okay definitely so like uh yeah

749
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,679
like uh the turer of the plants is

750
00:33:09,398 --> 00:33:13,558
usually based on like the how much

751
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,038
internal water pressure is in the

752
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:17,599
vascular structure of the plant so yeah

753
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:19,079
if you pop leaves off then I've

754
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:21,199
definitely noticed that as well like

755
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:23,839
sometimes I've just been popping leaves

756
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,840
and I I'll get like splashes on my

757
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:27,839
glasses and I'll be like what is that

758
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:30,240
I'll wipe it but it's like plant juice

759
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:33,519
it kind of just makes my glasses all

760
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,440
smudged and shmeed and so I'm just like

761
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,079
yeah I I totally have experienced that

762
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,320
as well

763
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:42,638
um so okay then so uh are does that mean

764
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:46,558
then you're ramping up your grow at home

765
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:48,678
up to 3.0 EC um is that like kind of

766
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:51,359
where you where you'll you'll end at

767
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:52,960
before you and then um do you taper it

768
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:56,479
back down then from there towards the

769
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:59,278
end of the grow um yes so that's what my

770
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:04,079
my teacher taught me to do to uh just

771
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:06,359
lower your EC um every other day or so

772
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:11,239
and just kind of go by each like

773
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:13,078
point and come down to like 1.0 or

774
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:14,598
1.5

775
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:17,720
um

776
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:20,480
but I've only done that I feel like

777
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:25,759
once um the other times I've just kept

778
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:28,519
it at 3.0 till Harvest day um nice and

779
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,399
it was smooth it didn't taste hard harsh

780
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:34,480
um I've never flushed my plants

781
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:36,759
before I might try that this time just

782
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,480
by flushing it with maybe just some AR

783
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,679
water at the last 3

784
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,960
days um I just want to try different

785
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,559
things to see what

786
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:49,480
happens um sure if I can get a better

787
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:53,159
taste colors

788
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:56,918
smells stuff like that um I did move up

789
00:34:53,159 --> 00:35:00,358
to 6 in hugos now I started off with the

790
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:03,199
4 in cubes on my first grow and

791
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:05,598
then uh my mentor told me if you want to

792
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:09,759
grow commercially you should try the 6in

793
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:12,720
cubes so I tried those and I've noticed

794
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:17,119
way bigger plants with the 6

795
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:17,118
in um and just bigger

796
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:23,838
colas for sure do you do you notice

797
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:28,000
um cuz sometimes I feel like going from

798
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:30,679
a 4 in to a 6in cube you can um you can

799
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,960
tend to overwater a little bit uh early

800
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:34,960
on with the 6-in cube if you're used to

801
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,760
watering in a 4-in cube and and the dryb

802
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,358
backs that a 4in will'll get um even

803
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:42,320
early on in veg um did you find that you

804
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:45,119
were getting like excess Leaf production

805
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,880
or longer inter nodes between the

806
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,160
different flower sites on the plant um

807
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,200
as it grew or did you feel as though it

808
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:55,199
just kind of um you didn't notice too

809
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:58,598
much of a difference in that in terms of

810
00:35:55,199 --> 00:36:01,039
like how you felt as though like if it's

811
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:03,760
like generative leaning where it's like

812
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:05,400
a lot of flow production versus

813
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,319
vegetative leaning where it kind of has

814
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,519
more leafy flowers and longer internodes

815
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:17,759
and stuff like that I feel like with the

816
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:21,639
6 in it was more of a leafy intron noes

817
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:26,280
um yeah uh I just overall it's just they

818
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:27,960
seem like bigger plants in 6 in um but

819
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,760
maybe that's just cuz I used four my

820
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,920
first grow and now that I'm evolving

821
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,880
maybe I'm just getting bigger plants who

822
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,119
knows for sure I I always say that to

823
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,318
people when they're like uh they'll

824
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,960
Implement uh you know early on in their

825
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:43,719
grow career they'll add something new to

826
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:46,159
their grow or they'll change something

827
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:48,279
and they'll go oh this change made me a

828
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:50,838
better grower and I always tell them I'm

829
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,680
like no the fact that you you grew one

830
00:36:50,838 --> 00:36:55,519
more time makes you a better grower yes

831
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:58,039
usually it's just the experience that

832
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:59,920
helps uh people get better and they're

833
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:03,039
just taking the experience from each

834
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:06,440
successive uh Harvest and applying it to

835
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:07,920
the next one and usually yeah it's uh

836
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,480
sometimes it's a culmination of both

837
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,960
though like if you if you were doing

838
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,119
something either to hinder yourself or

839
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:17,119
if you do Implement something that is uh

840
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:19,200
beneficial to the grow um it can be then

841
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,318
in conjunction with the increase in

842
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:24,199
skill as well so I yeah that's a it's a

843
00:37:22,318 --> 00:37:27,318
good point

844
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:28,719
um so okay then uh I feel like that kind

845
00:37:27,318 --> 00:37:31,400
of gives us a good picture of how you

846
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:33,759
grow hydroponically with your rock wool

847
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:36,599
um so tell us more about your your new

848
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:40,319
setup that you're trying out with the um

849
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:44,680
the potting soil the uh the Pete based

850
00:37:40,318 --> 00:37:47,838
media so it's a little

851
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:51,199
like uh I'm kind of going at it blindly

852
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:55,400
a little because my

853
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:58,318
coworker uh has or he has this tent that

854
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:01,599
he let me borrow behind me um it's the

855
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:04,358
same one I use for my hydro grow uh

856
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:07,760
they're both gorilla tents my hydro has

857
00:38:04,358 --> 00:38:09,559
the uh 4x4 and the soil grow I'm doing

858
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,280
is a

859
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:15,719
5x5

860
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:21,880
um with the 4x4 I'm using ion LED lights

861
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:24,959
8 20 watts and okay with the soil it's a

862
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:28,920
fluence LED lights I'm not sure how many

863
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:31,639
watts though um it's probably like 7 720

864
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:34,000
or 780 if if it's the one that I see

865
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:35,519
right behind you there m

866
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,559
yep

867
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:42,440
yeah cool um so as

868
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:46,039
nutrients it seems like I have

869
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:50,000
everything individually uh some are in

870
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:53,239
liquids and then some are in powdered

871
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,239
form uh the nitrogen is in powdered form

872
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:55,919
it's like a

873
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:58,838
soybean

874
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:04,440
base nitrogen

875
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:07,719
um and then I have phosphate carbon

876
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:10,960
silica and they're all in liquid

877
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:13,679
forms okay what brand is it that you're

878
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:17,559
using I have no

879
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:22,118
idea it there's no brand name or it's

880
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:22,119
just in random bottles like

881
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:30,239
this oh okay and this is from your

882
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:35,240
coworker

883
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:35,239
yes okay so it sounds like they make

884
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:41,920
n okay yeah so it's a little different

885
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:45,440
um interesting yeah he he said it's kind

886
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:48,440
of like a secret that someone his mentor

887
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:51,039
came up with the nutrients and

888
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:53,440
everything so he doesn't really tell me

889
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:56,559
much about it but he just tells me the

890
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,318
measurements yeah so I'm kind of going

891
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:01,318
at it blindly

892
00:39:59,318 --> 00:40:03,639
have you taken like an EC or a pH

893
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:05,000
measurement of the um the solution that

894
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:10,318
you're

895
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:13,199
adding um no but I've uh tested my EC um

896
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:17,199
with just carbon and

897
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:18,919
nitrogen and my EC or it was PPM it was

898
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:23,759
at like

899
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:26,119
700 PPM I think that's like 0.5 EC or

900
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,800
something starting off

901
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:31,880
low um I think it's um depending uh some

902
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:35,039
of the ppms you know I always forget if

903
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:38,800
it's you double the PPM uh you multiply

904
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:44,000
it by a, uhhuh yeah double and then

905
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:49,880
divide by 1,000 so 700 be like 1.4 PC is

906
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:51,358
it yeah um I'm pretty sure um but uh so

907
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,838
is that and that's just two parts of it

908
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:55,519
and then you add all these other parts

909
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:58,318
as well yes they're like all these

910
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:00,960
little bottles separate things

911
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:04,159
um it's a lot it like a milliliter of

912
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:06,358
this a gram of this m so it's just a

913
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:09,159
bunch of little tiny things okay and

914
00:41:06,358 --> 00:41:12,598
when you're watering these um are you

915
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:15,879
watering to them to runoff or are you uh

916
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:19,480
avoiding runoff with this so I'm doing

917
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:23,559
runoff um and then I'm also doing some

918
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:25,440
flushing with the soil um like once a

919
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:28,199
week

920
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,119
flushing um I started them off in rock W

921
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:32,838
cubes like the starter

922
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:34,838
plugs so I kind of had to do some

923
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:36,440
flushing to get the salts out and then

924
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:41,119
start with the

925
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:43,720
organic nutrients okay um yeah but it

926
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,838
it's a lot to have like eight different

927
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:49,598
types of nutrients going on and having

928
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:52,199
to measure like of an eighth of a

929
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:54,079
teaspoon and times that by how many

930
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:57,598
gallons I'm doing so it's kind of a

931
00:41:54,079 --> 00:42:01,400
headache to be honest

932
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:04,280
but I mean I anything that was over like

933
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,720
however many parts always kind of I I I

934
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:08,560
like shied away from them earlier on

935
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,919
like at one point I think I was mixing

936
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:14,519
like 10 or 12 different parts at this

937
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,400
one grow I was working at and then we

938
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:19,759
we'd like mix them all and then hand

939
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,480
water all the plants with it and it was

940
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:26,319
it just seemed like such a hassle and

941
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:28,358
then home like it's time consuming

942
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:31,599
absolutely

943
00:42:28,358 --> 00:42:34,000
um and it just you know I I never saw

944
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,440
anything that I was like so blown away

945
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,599
with that I was just like wow this is

946
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,639
this is the truth this is exactly how we

947
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:43,440
should be growing this plant um and then

948
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:46,118
I saw like living soil where it was just

949
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:50,159
water only and that I was just like oh

950
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:52,318
well this seems really easy um but then

951
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:54,159
re amending it started to become

952
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:57,920
something that did require

953
00:42:54,159 --> 00:43:01,399
like if you wanted to do it at scale or

954
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:04,480
uh at a very like either professional or

955
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,240
scientific level of of of understanding

956
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,199
exactly what was going on so that you

957
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:12,719
could make like a fully

958
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:15,118
educated uh adjustment or um addition uh

959
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:16,480
if it's like a dry Amendment or um some

960
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,838
sort of tea or something you would need

961
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,719
to do all these like substrate uh

962
00:43:18,838 --> 00:43:23,920
saturated Pace tests and then even

963
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:25,639
compare it to like sap analysis of the

964
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,960
plant and other things like that so that

965
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:31,519
you could understand sort of how those

966
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,679
uh nutrient packets were impacting the

967
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:35,719
soil and then how that was over time

968
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:37,558
translating to the plant and so you

969
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:40,439
could kind of TR like if you were doing

970
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:42,720
it consistently you could see the trends

971
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,240
over time of what was in the plant and

972
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:46,480
then there were some resources online

973
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:48,279
that you could see where those targets

974
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,039
were that you would want and you could

975
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,680
increase or lower than what your

976
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:54,639
nutrient package was that you were

977
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:56,039
adding to the substrate but that's

978
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:57,598
something that's like it's only

979
00:43:56,039 --> 00:43:59,960
available to do that at a commercial

980
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:04,318
level because each one of those tests is

981
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:07,800
like either $100 or more and if you're

982
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:10,279
doing it weekly or monthly then that

983
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,839
that also it's it's like the CO2 in a

984
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,880
hom grow it's like that's almost it's

985
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:16,880
untenable you can't necessarily afford

986
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:19,480
that if if the if one of the ideas for

987
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:23,240
homeg growing is to grow your own

988
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:25,679
medicine um then like increasing the

989
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:28,959
price of it almost makes it in some

990
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:32,159
cases especially when you have readily

991
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,720
accessible cannabis in a medical or a

992
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:36,759
recreational Market sometimes it ends up

993
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:39,719
being cheaper especially with the

994
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:42,040
commercial race to the bottom um where

995
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:45,118
everyone's just trying to get as much

996
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:47,279
product sold for the lowest amount and

997
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:52,880
it sometimes doesn't even matter if it's

998
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:56,359
super high quality yeah I can agree for

999
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,160
sure yep well so how how are you liking

1000
00:44:56,358 --> 00:45:01,000
this uh

1001
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:02,799
organic grow style um I mean other than

1002
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,358
the time consuming

1003
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,680
part um yeah I really don't like the

1004
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:12,440
timec consuming part uh that is not it

1005
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:16,919
for me I don't like it um but so when I

1006
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:20,880
first started I cut clones off my hydr

1007
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:24,480
grow and nurse them into veg and put

1008
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:27,720
them in the soil and I noticed cuz I was

1009
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:31,240
just using carb and carbon

1010
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:33,598
um not nitrogen at first so I started

1011
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:35,479
noticing yellowing and deficiencies and

1012
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,599
I was like oh no I'm already messing up

1013
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:40,639
the soil grow but uh my coworker was

1014
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:42,440
just like oh just add nitrogen the

1015
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:45,639
yellowing should go away quickly and I'm

1016
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:47,480
like really okay so I added nitrogen the

1017
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:51,078
next day I noticed the yellowing just

1018
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:54,199
kind of slowly going away um but within

1019
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:57,640
a day the yellowing was almost

1020
00:45:54,199 --> 00:46:00,000
gone um that's awesome yeah fast acting

1021
00:45:57,639 --> 00:46:02,239
for something that's uh like an an

1022
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,599
organic system it makes me want to know

1023
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:06,000
like what it is it sounds like almost

1024
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,079
like a soy hydrate or something like

1025
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,559
that where it's like a Amino based

1026
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:13,039
nitrogen Source um maybe something

1027
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:15,240
that's like right there readily

1028
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:16,838
available that's pretty cool it kind of

1029
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:18,479
sounded like what you were saying too

1030
00:46:16,838 --> 00:46:20,759
like with the living soil and kind of

1031
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,960
adding like your own ingredients and

1032
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:26,400
seeing how the plant reacts it's kind of

1033
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:30,559
like that yep mhm yeah I could see how

1034
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:33,358
it you know it's probably good for all

1035
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:35,000
new Growers to use something that

1036
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:38,679
requires them to pay attention to the

1037
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,199
plants needs and um and then find a

1038
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:43,759
response

1039
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:46,399
appropriate uh that kind of uh addresses

1040
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,200
those needs and so that you can see the

1041
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,559
progress of the plant from your

1042
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:53,318
additions cuz I feel like sometimes when

1043
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:55,440
it's um like if you if you do

1044
00:46:53,318 --> 00:46:57,039
Hydroponics and you do it correctly or

1045
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,880
if you follow directions and you're not

1046
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:02,480
necessarily trying to be so easy uh yeah

1047
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,160
like if if if you follow the directions

1048
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,159
in the most cases they work really well

1049
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:08,639
but a there's a lot of directions out

1050
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:12,239
there that

1051
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:16,799
are unique to the specific nutrients or

1052
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:18,279
unique to a specific um environment um

1053
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,200
and so a lot of these different recipes

1054
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:23,720
are somewhat subjective because they

1055
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:25,719
need to follow specific parameters but

1056
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:27,519
if you like follow all the instructions

1057
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:30,039
you should be good um

1058
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:32,639
as as you don't try to get fancy or you

1059
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:35,000
know try to be like I'm going to double

1060
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:36,639
this or half this just because I want to

1061
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,079
see what happens like sure see what

1062
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:40,759
happens but it it probably um you're

1063
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:45,119
going to see like what a deficiency

1064
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:47,040
looks like or a toxicity looks like um

1065
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,000
but yeah with like a organic row or

1066
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:51,679
something where you do like I'm adding

1067
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,719
this for nitrogen or this for calcium or

1068
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:56,239
this for magnesium or this for potassium

1069
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:57,679
phosphorus uh all the different

1070
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:59,358
constituents

1071
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:02,919
um I could see how that could be pretty

1072
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:04,199
helpful especially if you like do it

1073
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:07,119
long enough where you go okay I'm just

1074
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:08,919
going to pull a bunch of phosphorus out

1075
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:11,240
of the the nutrient package and let's

1076
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:13,159
see what happens um so you can then like

1077
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:16,479
document it almost and be like I know

1078
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:18,879
that this works uh when I have the

1079
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:22,000
phosphorus at X level and if I bring it

1080
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,838
down to Y level um this is what happens

1081
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,960
and so if you then see that happening

1082
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:28,719
you can go oh I need to add more

1083
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,800
phosphorus um I like that you put it

1084
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:33,598
that

1085
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:36,720
way in kind of like a learning way of

1086
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:39,318
growing cuz you're adding one

1087
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:42,358
component um at different times or

1088
00:48:39,318 --> 00:48:44,400
whatever not like how with Athena it's

1089
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:46,759
all together in one so you're not going

1090
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,639
to really have to stress about

1091
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:52,880
phosphorus or silica separately or

1092
00:48:49,639 --> 00:48:55,400
whatever and like you're saying you

1093
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,680
could add a bunch of phosphorus and if

1094
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:01,160
the if the plant loves it then you know

1095
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:05,000
okay cool it loves that check off the

1096
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:08,480
list um yeah it's more like a science

1097
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,039
experiment exactly uh yeah there's a um

1098
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,358
I've brought it up in the last podcast

1099
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:15,798
but I might as well bring it up again

1100
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:17,440
but there's a uh a term uh or a theory

1101
00:49:15,798 --> 00:49:21,798
or a law it's called Le Big's law I

1102
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:24,519
believe um but basically what it is is

1103
00:49:21,798 --> 00:49:27,318
uh it's kind of like the law of minimums

1104
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:30,079
almost where you can only

1105
00:49:27,318 --> 00:49:33,920
achieve your greatest results uh based

1106
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:37,920
on what is the the lowest

1107
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:40,079
um uh available nutrient um in like a

1108
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,318
growth system and so like sometimes

1109
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:44,680
it'll be described as like staves in a

1110
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:46,400
barrel so like a wine barrel where all

1111
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:48,279
the different staves that kind of go

1112
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,358
around the outside of the barrel are all

1113
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:52,040
tightly compressed together but they're

1114
00:49:50,358 --> 00:49:53,920
all at the same height and so you can

1115
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:55,798
fill the the wine and the barrel up to

1116
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,519
that height but if one of those staves

1117
00:49:55,798 --> 00:50:00,519
is cut lower then even though all those

1118
00:49:58,519 --> 00:50:02,559
other levels are all the way up at the

1119
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:06,559
top the wine can only fill up to where

1120
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:10,160
that lowest Stave is um so it like if if

1121
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:12,920
you if that's your uh if that's your

1122
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:14,639
limiting factor then even if you have

1123
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:19,519
all these other elements within them

1124
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:24,118
grow at their Peak or at their their

1125
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:26,719
uh like ideal levels um you'll never be

1126
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:28,920
able to see what results that those can

1127
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:32,838
truly provide if there's something else

1128
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:35,039
that isn't at its uh most ideal level in

1129
00:50:32,838 --> 00:50:38,199
in sort of that

1130
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:40,719
same specific environment that you're

1131
00:50:38,199 --> 00:50:42,879
providing all these things in cuz like

1132
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:44,759
sometimes like more humidity in one

1133
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,280
environment is not as good as more

1134
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:50,079
humidity in another environment whether

1135
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:52,280
it be like CO2 lighting heat um

1136
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:53,720
absolutely uh exhaust all these

1137
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:57,480
different things that can have an effect

1138
00:50:53,719 --> 00:51:00,519
on that yes um but but it's it's cool to

1139
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:04,599
see a newer grower like yourself using

1140
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:08,318
these different tools of a hydroponic

1141
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:11,480
grow and then a hand mixed

1142
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:13,279
painstaking organic grow because it it

1143
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,159
it'll round you out as a grower though

1144
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,680
be it it's it's great to see other

1145
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:18,118
people doing that because I felt like

1146
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:20,639
that was one of the ways that I learned

1147
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:24,039
the most is uh just going to different

1148
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:26,078
styles of growing almost every second

1149
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:27,079
grow I would switch it up like I i' do

1150
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,680
the first grow

1151
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:30,400
it would either work or it wouldn't work

1152
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:32,039
that well I'd do it again the second

1153
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,639
time and i' usually get it to work and

1154
00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:35,318
then I'd go okay this is boring I'm

1155
00:51:33,639 --> 00:51:37,558
going to do something else switch it up

1156
00:51:35,318 --> 00:51:39,358
um and then I yep and then it like

1157
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:43,000
started at Hydroponics and ended at

1158
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:47,000
Hydroponics for me because it's so easy

1159
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:50,639
uh like you you use cocoa

1160
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,880
right yeah at work we use cocoa um have

1161
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:55,719
you done Rock grow at the

1162
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:58,720
facil yeah so at the facility that I

1163
00:51:55,719 --> 00:52:00,439
manage we've done uh cocoa and we do

1164
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:03,039
Cocoa now and we have for quite some

1165
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:05,400
time but um we've done Rock wal as well

1166
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:09,199
where we did uh the slabs where you have

1167
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:11,280
three plants per slab um on the 4in

1168
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:14,439
cubes and that worked really well we've

1169
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:18,160
done um where we've done uh 4in cubes

1170
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:20,318
for veg uh and then we set those on top

1171
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:23,838
of cocoa pots and let them roote into

1172
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:26,199
the cocoa pots and um go about it that

1173
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:29,279
way but there is like a a little bit of

1174
00:52:26,199 --> 00:52:32,598
a intense osmotic gradient between rock

1175
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,960
wool and Coco where the Coco wants to

1176
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:36,599
pull all the water out of the rock wool

1177
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,798
so you have to provide all these little

1178
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:41,359
irrigation shots early on to make sure

1179
00:52:38,798 --> 00:52:42,639
that it roots in correctly and usually

1180
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:44,960
that keeps it a little bit too

1181
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:48,118
vegetative early on and you don't get

1182
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:50,960
that uh it's not as easy to build the EC

1183
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:53,559
early in in flower in the substrate

1184
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,720
makes sense um which usually we we aim

1185
00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:59,519
for to get that generative response of a

1186
00:52:55,719 --> 00:53:01,679
lot of flower sets and stuff

1187
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:05,199
um yeah I just want to say it's really

1188
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:07,639
cool to see um another person entering

1189
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:10,480
their cannabis cultivation journey and

1190
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:12,759
uh using these different methods to to

1191
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,838
learn from yeah I like to learn all

1192
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:17,559
different aspects every way you can do

1193
00:53:14,838 --> 00:53:21,039
it let's learn it and find the best way

1194
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:24,960
to do it that's my

1195
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:29,440
goal for sure at my job they

1196
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:32,639
uh um they they grow uh everything in

1197
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:35,920
Rockwell right um even our moms are in

1198
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:39,000
Rockwell Cubes but uh just recently they

1199
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:43,280
started switching over to uh Coco for

1200
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:46,318
the moms um just because the six inch

1201
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:49,040
hugos aren't big enough to hold those

1202
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:52,279
moms and our moms were flopping over

1203
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:55,358
every day and it was just a mess

1204
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:58,119
and so I think now you have to if

1205
00:53:55,358 --> 00:54:00,759
they're that big

1206
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:02,480
yeah so yeah switching over to Coco I'm

1207
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:04,280
I'm I'm assuming they're liking it

1208
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:07,358
better I haven't been up in veg since

1209
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:10,160
they've done that but all the moms now

1210
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:13,838
are in Coco no more rock wool for

1211
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:16,399
them so cool Coco Coco can also be a

1212
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:18,239
little bit cheaper um you can get a

1213
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,838
little bit of a larger substrate size

1214
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:23,118
for the same price as rock wol so like I

1215
00:54:20,838 --> 00:54:25,679
think those 6 in especially if they're

1216
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:27,760
groan I think those are getting up there

1217
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:29,279
in price now above like four bucks a

1218
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,319
piece and I think you can get a like a

1219
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:35,559
two gallon cocoa pot for uh like a buck

1220
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:37,798
50 to two bucks a piece so um you can

1221
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:40,559
get a lot more a lot more substrate out

1222
00:54:37,798 --> 00:54:44,400
of it and uh a lot more runtime out of

1223
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:47,079
each mom um but I always personally

1224
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,838
suggest even in uh hom grows and

1225
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:52,680
Commercial spaces to keep your mom uh

1226
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:55,039
lifespan to no longer than like 8 weeks

1227
00:54:52,679 --> 00:54:57,239
at the max I usually shoot for like

1228
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:59,159
between 6 and 8 weeks sometimes they'll

1229
00:54:57,239 --> 00:55:01,399
go into 10 weeks but that's usually if

1230
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:03,399
it's like a yeah it's usually if it's

1231
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:06,358
like a

1232
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:08,440
um like something that I'm needing to

1233
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:11,199
keep around for genetic preservation or

1234
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:12,720
something um yeah some of the larger

1235
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:18,039
moms actually you know like sometimes

1236
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:22,558
they'll go up to to to like uh what like

1237
00:55:18,039 --> 00:55:24,838
90 days um if like it's a instant a much

1238
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:27,559
larger pot and if I up poot it like once

1239
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:30,038
a month um

1240
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:31,559
it really depends on kind of what what

1241
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:34,000
time of year it is and how long we need

1242
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:35,839
to keep moms around for but I like to

1243
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,960
keep them around for as little amount of

1244
00:55:35,838 --> 00:55:42,358
time as possible um sometimes you just

1245
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:46,880
get like fungus nap populations yes yes

1246
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:49,558
we have a lot of fungus Nets and um they

1247
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:53,960
have us top down the

1248
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:56,640
moms every week uh there's probably

1249
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:59,039
like I don't know like 30 different

1250
00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:02,679
strains of moms there's just a lot going

1251
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:05,400
on in veg at my job for sure you guys

1252
00:56:02,679 --> 00:56:07,879
have around like 30 30 cultivars on your

1253
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:11,639
list at any given time

1254
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:14,039
yes okay they like that because it uh

1255
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:16,759
that's a decent list yeah they said more

1256
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:19,240
strains better because it helps uh push

1257
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:21,280
product quicker than just having 10

1258
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:25,118
different strains the same strains if

1259
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:27,559
they have 30 different strains or more

1260
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:29,960
for sure then

1261
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:32,880
are they are they usually growing all

1262
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:34,519
30 yeah like at any given time yeah and

1263
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,480
they keep their moms pretty that's

1264
00:56:34,519 --> 00:56:40,239
impressive yeah they keep their moms all

1265
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:43,199
the way till like I think the most 8

1266
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:46,038
months they've kept their moms oh wow

1267
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:47,639
yeah yeah those are huge uh are they I

1268
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:51,640
assume then that they're in probably

1269
00:56:47,639 --> 00:56:53,558
like uh High Bay rooms with like um

1270
00:56:51,639 --> 00:56:56,719
high-intensity discharge lighting like

1271
00:56:53,559 --> 00:57:01,240
CMH or HPS

1272
00:56:56,719 --> 00:57:03,838
um I think they just use gavita bar

1273
00:57:01,239 --> 00:57:07,598
lights oh really yeah that's that's

1274
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:11,038
pretty cool yeah awesome do they have a

1275
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:13,519
pretty big growing area for each Mom oh

1276
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:16,920
yeah um there's

1277
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:21,280
probably I want to say like eight maybe

1278
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:23,760
eight to 10 different tables of the long

1279
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:27,839
tables okay and probably like like

1280
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:31,960
longer than a 4x8 table

1281
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:35,719
yes I think so okay like a like a custom

1282
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:37,519
uh drain table is yeah exactly um okay

1283
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:39,519
they're feeding like at

1284
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:42,798
least like three to four different

1285
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:44,119
strains per table and like uh I want to

1286
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:46,838
say 10

1287
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:48,838
different well the three strains three

1288
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:50,838
to four strains per table and like 10

1289
00:57:48,838 --> 00:57:54,239
plants per

1290
00:57:50,838 --> 00:57:55,558
strain okay so like uh okay wow Al those

1291
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:57,558
are going to be really those are big

1292
00:57:55,559 --> 00:58:01,319
plants like um what do they have like

1293
00:57:57,559 --> 00:58:05,039
two two across per like two across on on

1294
00:58:01,318 --> 00:58:09,199
the table yes yep okay yeah those are

1295
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:13,760
big moms then that's pretty cool um yeah

1296
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:16,639
we have like uh we have uh two tiers uh

1297
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:19,960
on on our tables in both our like veg

1298
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:26,239
and our mom room and so um but they only

1299
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:28,838
have like I think 38 in and 48 in or no

1300
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:31,279
46 in something like that uh that's like

1301
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:33,558
the the total height from the tray to

1302
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:35,680
the light so we have to like splay them

1303
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:37,440
out as much as we can and keep them

1304
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:38,798
really short and you have to top them

1305
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,400
down every

1306
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:43,639
week uh we try to top them down every

1307
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:45,798
week yeah but we are also like a very

1308
00:58:43,639 --> 00:58:47,558
small team so sometimes they they'll

1309
00:58:45,798 --> 00:58:49,358
grow into the lights and we'll usually

1310
00:58:47,559 --> 00:58:50,680
just be like well those are going to get

1311
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:56,239
pruned and then they're going to grow

1312
00:58:50,679 --> 00:58:59,038
again and they'll be okay um yeah uh I I

1313
00:58:56,239 --> 00:59:01,000
would love to have large High Bay

1314
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:03,359
ceilings in a veg space cuz then you can

1315
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,239
get really really big moms oh yeah

1316
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:09,519
they're like

1317
00:59:05,239 --> 00:59:12,479
trees yeah so what made you decide to um

1318
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:15,239
enter uh from just homeg growing into

1319

1321
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:26,240
career so I started looking on

1322
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:29,000
Craigslist zip recruiter for cultivation

1323
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:32,759

um

1331
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:56,960

a trimmer for highkey and when I told

1333

1349
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:38,760
a cultivation job um it can be very

1350
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:40,399
grueling yes so I didn't I mean they did

1351

1355
01:00:46,838 --> 01:00:52,480

1356
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:56,799
different rooms in

1357
01:00:52,480 --> 01:01:00,240
flower so yeah uh it's a lot of work a

1358
01:00:56,798 --> 01:01:02,358
lot of work uh I lost 20 lbs just the

1359
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:06,679
first like two to three months working

1360
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:08,199
there just sweating and busting ass I

1361
01:01:06,679 --> 01:01:10,239
literally like feel like I'm running

1362
01:01:08,199 --> 01:01:12,879
with my head cut off

1363
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:15,239
there um it's one of the like best

1364
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:18,640
workouts for a job that I've had I and I

1365
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:22,000
used to be a chef and same felt like the

1366
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:23,358
kitchen kept me fairly fit and then yeah

1367
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,798
doing this

1368
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:29,880
is it's it's at least not making me uh

1369
01:01:27,798 --> 01:01:32,440
feel like I need to go to the gym all

1370
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:33,920
the time where I'm like feeling like oh

1371
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:35,880
I feel like I'm sitting around all the

1372
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,960
time or something like I'm moving all

1373
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:40,079
the time at work and

1374
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:43,960
yeah from the different

1375
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:46,559
heat yeah yeah just tired yes I don't

1376
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:49,000
want to do anything after working

1377
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:53,240
basically I used to go hiking all the

1378
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:55,400
time I used to hike like 6 to8 miles now

1379
01:01:53,239 --> 01:01:59,439
I don't even want to do that I'm like uh

1380
01:01:55,400 --> 01:02:02,720
work is a lot so um yeah I didn't expect

1381
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:05,440
that I did not expect the grind um I was

1382
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:08,639
definitely told in my interview to

1383
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:11,079
expect it but I did not um so whoever

1384
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:15,558
wants to get in the commercial field

1385
01:02:11,079 --> 01:02:17,760
expect to bust ass and sweat like a

1386
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:20,200
crazy

1387
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:23,400
person yeah I literally come out of the

1388
01:02:20,199 --> 01:02:26,239
rooms my hair is just

1389
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:28,240
yeah yeah it gets pretty crazy sometimes

1390
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:30,959
I feel like also

1391
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:33,078
uh if you're just like doing some of the

1392
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:37,278
really repetitive tasks like moving

1393
01:02:33,079 --> 01:02:39,278
plants or um like we use uh these cocoa

1394
01:02:37,278 --> 01:02:42,039
pots that you hydrate so you have to

1395
01:02:39,278 --> 01:02:43,920
like go in and you have to break them up

1396
01:02:42,039 --> 01:02:46,880
so the cocoa gets nice and fluffy after

1397
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:49,278
you hydrate it like a pillow

1398
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:51,440
that pretty much but it like your

1399
01:02:49,278 --> 01:02:53,880
shoulders and your back afterwards when

1400
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:56,480
you're like bent over the trays cuz like

1401
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:58,480
some of our trays are pretty blow to the

1402
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:01,798
floor in in some of the low ceiling

1403
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:03,639
rooms um you don't sit in stols like

1404
01:03:01,798 --> 01:03:07,358
well so we sit on stools but it's still

1405
01:03:03,639 --> 01:03:09,318
like yeah you're bending forward because

1406
01:03:07,358 --> 01:03:12,719
yeah in the low ceiling rooms where we

1407
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:14,880
have the two-tier veg space that will

1408
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:16,879
hydrate these pots on cuz we transplant

1409
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:19,920
directly into them out of the Clone room

1410
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:23,240
can I interrupt you real quick um what's

1411
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:26,159
you say tiar are you talking about like

1412
01:03:23,239 --> 01:03:28,679
uh stacking

1413
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:31,078
stacking I guess like like two two TI

1414
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:33,118
where there's like uh lights and then a

1415
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:36,400
tray and then lights right below that

1416
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:39,960
tray and another tray below it um you

1417
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:43,160
have three so yeah so well two tiers so

1418
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:46,159
we have um two uh but it's it's in a

1419
01:03:43,159 --> 01:03:48,679
room that has I think their like 8 and

1420
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:52,278
1/2t ceilings and so there's very

1421
01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:55,159
limited space and so we have like the

1422
01:03:52,278 --> 01:03:57,599
the bottom tier is only about like yeah

1423
01:03:55,159 --> 01:03:59,798
that like five four five in off the

1424
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:01,119
floor wow and so like you're still in

1425
01:03:59,798 --> 01:04:04,440
the stool but you're like kind of

1426
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:05,880
squatted in theol bent over breaking up

1427
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:08,000
the cocoa pots yeah and then breaking up

1428
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:10,240
the cocoa pots after you do like a 100

1429
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:14,039
or 200 of those your shoulders are just

1430
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:16,439
dying and that can really really be uh

1431
01:04:14,039 --> 01:04:18,599
tiresome and a huge workout sounds

1432
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:22,599
tiring sounds super

1433
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:25,039
tiring yeah but I mean as you know it's

1434
01:04:22,599 --> 01:04:26,278
it's it's a grind and and if people are

1435
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:29,799
looking to get into into it it's

1436
01:04:26,278 --> 01:04:31,440
something to really be aware of that um

1437
01:04:29,798 --> 01:04:34,000
especially in like I I want to say like

1438
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:36,119
a hydroponic grow where you're moving a

1439
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,039
bunch of plants around it can that can

1440
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:41,519
be a lot of fast-pace movement and then

1441
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:44,039
if you're working in like uh commercial

1442
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:46,440
grow that uses Organics and like let's

1443
01:04:44,039 --> 01:04:49,319
say you're you're moving plants into

1444
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:51,200
transplant into beds or something or or

1445
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:55,358
let let's say you're just using large

1446
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:56,439
like 7 to 10 Gall pots um for the entire

1447
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:59,078
Cy

1448
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:01,119
and you have to move those pots

1449
01:04:59,079 --> 01:05:05,039
imagine yeah it's like you know you're

1450
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:07,039
picking up 40 to 50 lb sacks of dirt

1451
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:09,640
basically each time cuz they're usually

1452
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:12,640
semi-saturated and and I complain now it

1453
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:13,838
is a a lot of work yeah you know it's

1454
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:16,159
but it's a lot of work for anybody that

1455
01:05:13,838 --> 01:05:18,960
wants to get into it and it's it's good

1456
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:21,159
to hear you reiterate that because it is

1457
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,119
it's but it's a lot of fun also I feel

1458
01:05:21,159 --> 01:05:25,480
like when

1459
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:26,160
you time flies get into a good routine

1460
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,519
yeah

1461
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:29,639
time flies and you get into a good

1462
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:31,519
routine of it and you start to see all

1463
01:05:29,639 --> 01:05:34,879
the improvements that are being made

1464
01:05:31,519 --> 01:05:37,079
through your attention to detail and the

1465
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:39,798
repetition of the different tasks as

1466
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:42,160
they kind of as day in and day out you

1467
01:05:39,798 --> 01:05:44,199
start to find your groove and be more

1468
01:05:42,159 --> 01:05:46,558
efficient at different things and Def I

1469
01:05:44,199 --> 01:05:48,719
love little efficiencies are really nice

1470
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:50,440
I could speak on that with uh using the

1471
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:55,798
sprayer to spray your

1472
01:05:50,440 --> 01:06:00,358
plants we use like a paint sprayer MH

1473
01:05:55,798 --> 01:06:03,199
and the hose oh my goodness I hate it I

1474
01:06:00,358 --> 01:06:05,558
struggle with that hose every time and

1475
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:07,719
it's a nightmare um it gets caught on

1476
01:06:05,559 --> 01:06:09,920
everything and you have to prime it so

1477
01:06:07,719 --> 01:06:12,358
it can get loose and it's just a pain in

1478
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:14,440
the butt and I hate it but um my

1479
01:06:12,358 --> 01:06:16,920
co-workers have taught me little like

1480
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:18,440
Nicks and knacks how to like tuck it in

1481
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:20,318
and keep it away from the table so it

1482
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:23,079
doesn't get caught and like kind of walk

1483
01:06:20,318 --> 01:06:25,558
with it and just little tricks to like

1484
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:27,480
make time more efficient and not

1485
01:06:25,559 --> 01:06:29,798
struggle with a hose so much and do your

1486
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:33,318
job and get out of there quicker cuz

1487
01:06:29,798 --> 01:06:36,440
they expect us to spray every room in 10

1488
01:06:33,318 --> 01:06:37,920
minutes or 10 minutes per room it seems

1489
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:40,798
fast

1490
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:43,000
um and I come out of those rooms

1491
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:44,199
dripping sweat cuz of those hot suits

1492
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,358
and the

1493
01:06:44,199 --> 01:06:49,798
mask and yeah spraying is when you're

1494
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:53,358
spraying pra like early flour so it's

1495
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:56,000
really hot and he there yes oh yes yes

1496
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:59,119
and then when we do our L3 spray which

1497
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,559
is uh when we spray on the plants with

1498
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:05,440
the lights off we use this little like

1499
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:06,640
green light and it's like on a timer so

1500
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,240
when you're in the middle of spraying

1501
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:10,920
the green light will turn off and then

1502
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:12,679
you're in a pitch black room and you're

1503
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:15,039
in that mask in the suit and you're

1504
01:07:12,679 --> 01:07:17,399
trying to like not knock into stuff pull

1505
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:20,079
your phone out start looking around it's

1506
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:23,599
just a pain in the butt been there um

1507
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:27,000
but it's it's fun I've I've definitely

1508
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:29,000
uh got quicker I used to take 20 minutes

1509
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,639
per room now I'm down to 12 minutes a

1510
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,079
room I time myself and I try to do

1511
01:07:31,639 --> 01:07:36,078
different things to be faster and that's

1512
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:39,000
something I feel like is important in

1513
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:40,559
the commercial industry is there you

1514
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,639
have to always look for ways that are

1515
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:44,798
more efficient and faster and that's

1516
01:07:43,639 --> 01:07:47,440
what they want they just want you to

1517
01:07:44,798 --> 01:07:52,038
push push push you

1518
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:55,240
know yeah absolutely I mean it's um like

1519
01:07:52,039 --> 01:07:58,000
I said earlier on it uh the the pack

1520
01:07:55,239 --> 01:07:59,519
price just keep on dropping oh yeah and

1521
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,358
uh if they keep going down but

1522
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:04,079
especially in oron the cost of living

1523
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:06,239
keeps going up yeah I mean organ kind of

1524
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:08,079
is terrible right now yes it's a little

1525
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:09,879
bit of a joke but your price per pound

1526
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:13,519
is sad

1527
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:16,000
I I won't Dell on it too much yeah cuz

1528
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:19,158
our our product keeps getting better and

1529
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,399
uh it keeps going down in price so it's

1530
01:08:19,158 --> 01:08:23,679
uh it's frustrating cuz frustrating you

1531
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:26,039
know cost of living yeah cost of living

1532
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:27,640
goes up and uh everything else keeps

1533
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:29,719
getting more expensive but for some

1534
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:31,960
reason people want better cannabis for

1535
01:08:29,719 --> 01:08:33,480
lower prices and it's like one of those

1536
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:35,119
few commodity I I guess a lot of

1537
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:37,959
Commodities people want like the best

1538
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:41,238
for less but uh everyone's looking for a

1539
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:44,079
deal it then sucks to be yeah even me

1540
01:08:41,238 --> 01:08:44,079
when I go shopping for

1541
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:48,640
cannabis I I don't blame you I I

1542
01:08:47,158 --> 01:08:50,399
definitely don't go for like the highest

1543
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:54,079
pric stuff anymore because I just can't

1544
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:55,599
afford it and um like I'll usually only

1545
01:08:54,079 --> 01:08:58,399
ever

1546
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:00,679
look for like uh concentrates every once

1547
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:02,278
in a while but it yeah they're they're

1548
01:09:00,679 --> 01:09:04,600
just really expensive and I usually like

1549
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:06,279
to just price them out because I can

1550
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:08,920
compare them then to what like we're

1551
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:11,400
producing at the the grow that I work at

1552
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:14,399
and what they're selling for and like it

1553
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:16,559
makes me think of like the uh back in

1554
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:20,920
the days of like Ford Motors when they

1555
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:22,400
first started they made cars that uh it

1556
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,880
was like one of his philosophies or

1557
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:25,679
whatever to make cars that were

1558
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:28,838
affordable enough for his employ emplo

1559
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:31,119
to purchase um which is a little funny

1560
01:09:28,838 --> 01:09:32,439
cuz then it's kind of like Falls in line

1561
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:35,198
with the saying of don't get high on

1562
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:38,439
your own Supply um like he's he's just

1563
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:41,119
having his employees pay the bills for

1564
01:09:38,439 --> 01:09:43,358
their own salaries but you know maybe

1565
01:09:41,119 --> 01:09:47,238
that's a conversation for a different

1566
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:47,239
podcast I have a Ford

1567
01:09:47,838 --> 01:09:54,000
so for sure I um I used to have a Bronco

1568
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:56,839
and it was a it was a fun car but

1569
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:00,198
Broncos are nice uh fix or repair daily

1570
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:06,760
right f d yeah um Fords aren't that

1571
01:10:00,198 --> 01:10:09,839
great yeah no no um well so uh do you

1572
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:11,000
feel as though um in your home grow do

1573
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:14,480
you feel as though there's anything

1574
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:16,359
unique that you do that you um have

1575
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:17,519
developed through your your few grows

1576
01:10:16,359 --> 01:10:19,039
that you've done that you're like this

1577
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,600
is something that I'm going to continue

1578
01:10:19,039 --> 01:10:23,800
to do because I really like the outcome

1579
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:25,840
of it regardless of what I've heard

1580
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:27,640
other people say or

1581
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:29,360
um even if you feel as though it's just

1582
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:31,600
something that you might have developed

1583
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:37,119
uh through your own

1584
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:40,360
experiences um so I really so this time

1585
01:10:37,119 --> 01:10:44,000
in this grow it's kind of hard to see

1586
01:10:40,359 --> 01:10:47,799
with the bright light but in my hydro

1587
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:53,399
grow uh this is my fourth time growing

1588
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:56,000
in hydro and um my first time topping

1589
01:10:53,399 --> 01:10:59,439
twice uh the other times I just topped

1590
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,119
the main stem once and that was it and

1591
01:10:59,439 --> 01:11:03,000
this time I topped the main stem and

1592
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:04,800
then the sides so they could all catch

1593
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,399
up together um it was something I was

1594
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,159
kind of nervous about doing when I first

1595
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:11,559
started growing cuz it just feels weird

1596
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:13,079
to chop at your plant um when you first

1597
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:15,920
start growing it's like uh I don't want

1598
01:11:13,079 --> 01:11:18,158
to touch it you know so um when I

1599
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:19,800
learned commercially that it's fine to

1600
01:11:18,158 --> 01:11:21,399
top your plant more than once or not

1601
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,719
even top a plant because it's not

1602
01:11:21,399 --> 01:11:25,719
catching up to the

1603
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:28,719
others um I learned you can really you

1604
01:11:25,719 --> 01:11:32,439
know change your yield that way and I've

1605
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:34,679
already seen it like all my tops are at

1606
01:11:32,439 --> 01:11:38,000
the third net pretty

1607
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:40,359
much um in my other grows I noticed that

1608
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,679
a lot of my colas didn't make it to the

1609
01:11:40,359 --> 01:11:45,839
third net I always use three

1610
01:11:42,679 --> 01:11:49,319
Nets um I was also taught by my teacher

1611
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:52,039
Matt that using three Nets is you have

1612
01:11:49,319 --> 01:11:55,119
to do it uh if you don't use three Nets

1613
01:11:52,039 --> 01:11:58,600
you're going to see a decrease in yield

1614
01:11:55,119 --> 01:12:01,039
um um is this um in order uh to like

1615
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:03,039
scrog and and bring the branches out to

1616
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:05,399
fill the canopy exactly yeah for sure if

1617
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:08,079
you're if you're scrogging that's

1618
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:10,238
absolutely you got use the one to spread

1619
01:12:08,079 --> 01:12:12,198
it out and then two to capture all the

1620
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:14,399
branches as grow up to make sure that

1621
01:12:12,198 --> 01:12:16,519
you're supporting them I agree with that

1622
01:12:14,399 --> 01:12:18,198
I feel like um I I've now been really

1623
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:22,560
trying hard to get away with only two

1624
01:12:18,198 --> 01:12:24,879
trellis Nets um at work but we uh don't

1625
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:26,199
do a like we don't train the plants at

1626
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:28,480
all once once they're in flower we just

1627
01:12:26,198 --> 01:12:30,960
let them grow um same with my job and

1628
01:12:28,479 --> 01:12:34,119
let the the side branches kind of fill

1629
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:37,520
yeah fill the canopy so usually the two

1630
01:12:34,119 --> 01:12:39,198
Works uh on smaller plants but then I I

1631
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:41,679
tend to need three on anything that's

1632
01:12:39,198 --> 01:12:43,439
too big because it just you got to get

1633
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:45,359
those tops so they don't flop over

1634
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:47,799
exactly the flopping over you do not

1635
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:52,000
want so that's why I was taught to

1636
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:55,880
always use three and um I was also

1637
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:59,238
taught to uh wait to defa

1638
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:01,840
at the end of week five just because

1639
01:12:59,238 --> 01:13:05,479
okay the plants need those lower leaves

1640
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:09,159
for mobile nutrients and to help

1641
01:13:05,479 --> 01:13:11,439
photosynthesize um for sure so what I

1642
01:13:09,158 --> 01:13:15,559
used to do was wait till uh the end of

1643
01:13:11,439 --> 01:13:18,879
week five and just de at once but my

1644
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:21,159
mentor told me what I could do is wait

1645
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:24,679
till the end of week five take off one

1646
01:13:21,158 --> 01:13:26,759
or two leaves that are towards the top

1647
01:13:24,679 --> 01:13:28,760
that are covering

1648
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:31,840
colas and you just take one or two

1649
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:34,560
leaves off every day to not have any

1650
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:37,119
stress to your plants cuz deing all

1651
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:41,440
those leaves at once causes way too much

1652
01:13:37,119 --> 01:13:45,399
stress and uh sets back your growth is

1653
01:13:41,439 --> 01:13:47,039
what I was taught and um so he said yeah

1654
01:13:45,399 --> 01:13:49,279
just go ahead and pick off one or two

1655
01:13:47,039 --> 01:13:51,760
leaves every day till the end of uh week

1656
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:54,039
seven and they should you should have

1657
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:56,520
all the leaves off by then it's like

1658
01:13:54,039 --> 01:13:58,359
almost a month of deing one to two

1659
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:00,320
leaves a day so I'm going to try that

1660
01:13:58,359 --> 01:14:04,119
this grow and like one one or two leaves

1661
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:06,559
per plant yeah mhm and you start from

1662
01:14:04,119 --> 01:14:09,000
the top and go to the bottom so I'm

1663
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:10,560
going to try that this grow and see if I

1664
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,800
get better

1665
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:15,159
response and yield

1666
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:19,239
maybe

1667
01:14:15,158 --> 01:14:20,559
um what else I actually tried some crop

1668
01:14:19,238 --> 01:14:24,119
steering at

1669
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:27,639
home uh it's something I just learned

1670
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:30,479
recently from the commercial

1671
01:14:27,639 --> 01:14:34,600
field um they push crop steering really

1672
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:37,839
hard commercially and I've read that it

1673
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:41,480
helps yield as well so I've been trying

1674
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:43,679
to learn different techniques uh to do

1675
01:14:41,479 --> 01:14:46,158
it here at home I mean I don't have a

1676
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:49,119
sensor to tell me my dryb backs and

1677
01:14:46,158 --> 01:14:51,359
whatnot but you can just feel your block

1678
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:54,279
and lift it up see how dry you're

1679
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:55,679
getting um so with this grow I kind of

1680
01:14:54,279 --> 01:14:58,960
did a crop

1681
01:14:55,679 --> 01:15:05,239
steer kind of little run just to

1682
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:08,480
see um in veg I did uh ventive is that

1683
01:15:05,238 --> 01:15:11,000
how you say it ventive uh vegetative

1684
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:14,599
vegetative yeah vegetative there's

1685
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:19,198
vegetative and generative um growth yes

1686
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:22,239
so yeah in veg I did vegetative where my

1687
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:25,759
EC uh was low but I had more runoff I

1688
01:15:22,238 --> 01:15:27,959
was watering more and then now that I'm

1689
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:31,800
in flower I'm kind of letting the EC

1690
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:34,039
stack and uh I have it on irrigation

1691
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:37,480
settings to where they're only getting

1692
01:15:34,039 --> 01:15:39,679
like three to four shots right now

1693
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:45,000
um of

1694
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:47,399
water and uh in veg I hand water so I

1695
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:50,719
have more of control to like water more

1696
01:15:47,399 --> 01:15:55,119
and get that uh I have a hard time

1697
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:58,079
saying ve vegetative I can't say

1698
01:15:55,119 --> 01:16:00,319
vegetative vegetative yeah a vegetative

1699
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:02,679
steer so I've been working on crop

1700
01:16:00,319 --> 01:16:04,399
steering it it's something new to me uh

1701
01:16:02,679 --> 01:16:07,000
something I'm interested in learning I

1702
01:16:04,399 --> 01:16:09,279
know it's uh something valuable to learn

1703
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:12,238
in the commercial field yeah so I'm just

1704
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:13,880
trying to implement it at home uh so I'm

1705
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:18,119
doing I'm always doing different things

1706
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:19,639
every grow for sure I yeah I like to

1707
01:16:18,119 --> 01:16:22,679
tell people that do want to get into the

1708
01:16:19,639 --> 01:16:25,520
commercial space to to learn about uh

1709
01:16:22,679 --> 01:16:27,039
what crop steering is and then um I

1710
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,880
always offer like reach out if you have

1711
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:31,560
questions because it is it is a

1712
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:33,760
frustrating thing to learn uh especially

1713
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:35,440
when you don't have substrate monitoring

1714
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:38,639
cuz when people will say things like

1715
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:41,519
stack your EC in the substrate or um

1716
01:16:38,639 --> 01:16:45,600
lean towards a vegetative steer or lean

1717
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:48,239
towards a generative steer or um you

1718
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:51,120
know like uh do a do a vegetative

1719
01:16:48,238 --> 01:16:53,000
environment but a generative irrigation

1720
01:16:51,119 --> 01:16:56,198
um those are things that when I first

1721
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:59,000
heard about them I didn't have any idea

1722
01:16:56,198 --> 01:17:01,960
talk um but then over time like yeah as

1723
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:04,560
you learn about it you go okay so like

1724
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:07,319
you can you can call it like uh heavy

1725
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:10,120
stress versus low stress where heavy or

1726
01:17:07,319 --> 01:17:12,279
heavy stress leans towards generative

1727
01:17:10,119 --> 01:17:17,599
and low stress leans

1728
01:17:12,279 --> 01:17:20,238
towards um vegetative and um yeah it and

1729
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:22,480
and then knowing how there's irrigation

1730
01:17:20,238 --> 01:17:25,599
practices that lean towards one where

1731
01:17:22,479 --> 01:17:28,079
generative is uh like higher E's

1732
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:31,239
uh larger dryb backs vegetative is lower

1733
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:33,238
e se's um lower dryb backs or smaller

1734
01:17:31,238 --> 01:17:37,119
dryb backs and then the environment

1735
01:17:33,238 --> 01:17:39,198
where uh a higher um vapor pressure

1736
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:41,559
deficit is generative and a lower vapor

1737
01:17:39,198 --> 01:17:43,479
pressure deficit is vegetative and then

1738
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:45,840
how you can use both of those different

1739
01:17:43,479 --> 01:17:49,000
things in combination with lighting and

1740
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:53,279
CO2 and do you do this at

1741
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:54,439
work I do yeah so yeah we have to in

1742
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:56,000
order to make sure that we're getting

1743
01:17:54,439 --> 01:17:59,039
the yield that we want out of each of

1744
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:01,399
the rooms um but then to know how to

1745
01:17:59,039 --> 01:18:05,519
combine them is is hard did you first

1746
01:18:01,399 --> 01:18:07,519
start uh with your company like as a

1747
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:09,040
group like for starting crop steering or

1748
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:11,480
was something that they already did

1749
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:14,359
before you worked

1750
01:18:11,479 --> 01:18:16,198
there so the owner of the company had

1751
01:18:14,359 --> 01:18:18,599
already started implementing these

1752
01:18:16,198 --> 01:18:21,879
practices um he he took over the company

1753
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:23,360
from his parents um and started

1754
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:25,880
implementing a lot of these different

1755
01:18:23,359 --> 01:18:31,119
technical practices that he learned with

1756
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:33,960
uh other grows and also uh he is just a

1757
01:18:31,119 --> 01:18:38,319
a consumer of knowledge and a retainer

1758
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:41,198
of knowledge and can usually apply all

1759
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:44,158
that knowledge really accurately um and

1760
01:18:41,198 --> 01:18:46,198
so we were able to to use uh his

1761
01:18:44,158 --> 01:18:48,759
experience as well as my experience and

1762
01:18:46,198 --> 01:18:51,238
knowledge and we kind of worked on it

1763
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:53,039
together and him doing a lot of this the

1764
01:18:51,238 --> 01:18:55,678
fiddling with stuff in the backgrounds

1765
01:18:53,039 --> 01:18:58,800
with a lot of Hands-On and doing most of

1766
01:18:55,679 --> 01:19:00,719
the the Hands-On stuff and then using

1767
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:03,719
different um did you guys run into any

1768
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:08,279
issues while doing that

1769
01:19:03,719 --> 01:19:11,600
or I mean we've definitely seen um how

1770
01:19:08,279 --> 01:19:13,800
like uh large plants uh or starting with

1771
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:16,480
large plants and flower can be a problem

1772
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:20,079
in some cases because they just can kind

1773
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:24,119
of get away from you if you if you uh if

1774
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:26,399
the substrate is is improperly sized um

1775
01:19:24,119 --> 01:19:28,279
or your IR ation practices aren't geared

1776
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:31,359
exactly towards

1777
01:19:28,279 --> 01:19:34,198
uh reducing the stretch and stuff like

1778
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:36,479
that

1779
01:19:34,198 --> 01:19:38,919
um it I mean it's it's been a huge

1780
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:42,718
learning curve

1781
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:44,760
because we we change a lot of variables

1782
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:48,359
within the grow whether it be substrate

1783
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:51,480
or lighting or um temperature parameters

1784
01:19:48,359 --> 01:19:53,719
or humidity parameters to try and just

1785
01:19:51,479 --> 01:19:55,879
find little tweaks here and there to to

1786
01:19:53,719 --> 01:19:58,319
Really perfect it and

1787
01:19:55,880 --> 01:20:00,840
then we'll we'll we've been trying to

1788
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:02,599
also run more strains per room rather

1789
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:05,119
than just doing monocrops because we

1790
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:09,760
only have uh all of our rooms are like

1791
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:12,519
12 light equivalence uh rooms and so we

1792
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:14,400
we only grow eight plants per room um

1793
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:20,239
where it's like nine nine plants per

1794
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:21,879
light and it uh we tend to um like

1795
01:20:20,238 --> 01:20:23,799
especially with the changing market and

1796
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:25,960
we have a we have a huge Library where

1797
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:29,800
we keep like over 120 different

1798
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:31,239
cultivars on hand at any time um and

1799
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:34,000
then we'll usually be flowering out

1800
01:20:31,238 --> 01:20:37,479
anywhere from like 10 to 15 different

1801
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:39,399
cultivars at any time amongst four rooms

1802
01:20:37,479 --> 01:20:41,718
um and so like trying to keep all

1803
01:20:39,399 --> 01:20:44,238
everything like within a balance is kind

1804
01:20:41,719 --> 01:20:45,760
of what we've been aiming for where

1805
01:20:44,238 --> 01:20:49,279
we're trying to find like General

1806
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:50,679
practices that can be applied across a

1807
01:20:49,279 --> 01:20:54,079
multitude of

1808
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:56,199
scenarios uh versus dialing in a recipe

1809
01:20:54,079 --> 01:21:00,479
for a specific specific cultivar in a

1810
01:20:56,198 --> 01:21:02,479
specific room to to like perfect that

1811
01:21:00,479 --> 01:21:05,759
cultivar like we want to we want to get

1812
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:07,759
the the best iteration of it out of a

1813
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:09,800
general approach that allows for the

1814
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:13,159
best possible outcomes without having to

1815
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:16,199
make too many fine adjustment tweaks

1816
01:21:13,158 --> 01:21:19,719
specific to a a plant or specific to a

1817
01:21:16,198 --> 01:21:21,479
room I guess because we we then can take

1818
01:21:19,719 --> 01:21:23,760
these ideas and apply them outwards

1819
01:21:21,479 --> 01:21:26,158
towards uh helping other people with

1820
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:28,960
their grows um whether it be home grows

1821
01:21:26,158 --> 01:21:30,719
or commercial grows I'm sure also helps

1822
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:34,439
with like setting up a room and knowing

1823
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:36,840
which plants can you know be together

1824
01:21:34,439 --> 01:21:40,319
for that for crop steering

1825
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:42,840
too um yeah but I know that also each

1826
01:21:40,319 --> 01:21:44,279
table you can change too do you use grow

1827
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:48,800
you use grow

1828
01:21:44,279 --> 01:21:51,439
link uh no we use um open sprinkler for

1829
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:55,239
all of our irrigation and then uh aoya

1830
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:59,039
for all of our monitoring okay um

1831
01:21:55,238 --> 01:22:01,359
and uh those two in in conjunction with

1832
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:02,399
uh we use one more uh thing called gr

1833
01:22:01,359 --> 01:22:03,519
Tronics but they're actually going out

1834
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:05,839
of business so we need to find a

1835
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:08,120
different application for that so I I'm

1836
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:11,119
assuming once you figure out like which

1837
01:22:08,119 --> 01:22:14,319
plants need uh what when you're crop

1838
01:22:11,119 --> 01:22:15,158
steering uh it'd be easier to set up a

1839
01:22:14,319 --> 01:22:17,840
whole

1840
01:22:15,158 --> 01:22:20,439
room where you know every plant needs

1841
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:22,119
the same amount of shots and you're not

1842
01:22:20,439 --> 01:22:24,039
just like doing different shots per

1843
01:22:22,119 --> 01:22:26,559
table and it's just like you know

1844
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:28,319
everything's on the same route like cuz

1845
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:31,679
we're using the same irrigation schedule

1846
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:35,439
per table yeah um yeah so we we do try

1847
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:39,960
to match uh like cultivars with like

1848
01:22:35,439 --> 01:22:43,638
cultivars um in terms of if they are uh

1849
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:45,600
leaning more on the like I want to

1850
01:22:43,639 --> 01:22:48,760
stretch and be big and bushy plants or

1851
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:51,320
if I'm short and squat and um because we

1852
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:53,639
don't want to like shade out half of the

1853
01:22:51,319 --> 01:22:56,238
table with uh another half of the table

1854
01:22:53,639 --> 01:22:58,000
or something like that yeah um and then

1855
01:22:56,238 --> 01:22:59,839
yeah the water consumption is is going

1856
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,600
to be vastly different but I've I've run

1857
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:03,239
into new cultivars where I haven't seen

1858
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:04,719
them grow before and I don't have the

1859
01:23:03,238 --> 01:23:06,479
data on it so I'll just throw it in

1860
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:08,520
there on a table with something else and

1861
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:10,599
just put like one light worth yeah just

1862
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:13,960
like nine plants and like right now I'm

1863
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:16,840
running um sherb uh cocktail number

1864
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:19,079
seven on a table with uh our beach

1865
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:22,000
grapes number 12 that we hunted in house

1866
01:23:19,079 --> 01:23:23,920
and the sh cocktail number seven and

1867
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,359
Beach grapes went in at the same time

1868
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:30,840
but the sh cocktail of course is three

1869
01:23:26,359 --> 01:23:33,960
times the the height uh of the of the

1870
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:37,000
beach grapes and I because it was a new

1871
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:40,158
cultivar I've been steering that table

1872
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:42,359
with data from the uh sherb cocktail

1873
01:23:40,158 --> 01:23:44,039
because I wanted to see how it responded

1874
01:23:42,359 --> 01:23:46,079
to the irrigations and stuff cuz I've

1875
01:23:44,039 --> 01:23:48,679
already seen the beach grapes and I can

1876
01:23:46,079 --> 01:23:51,000
kind of gauge if it's lean if it's going

1877
01:23:48,679 --> 01:23:52,840
a little bit too vegetative based on the

1878
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,279
leaf growth and the the flower

1879
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:57,520
morphology or if it is leaning towards

1880
01:23:55,279 --> 01:24:01,158
like a generative or if it's kind of a

1881
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:02,880
nice mixed medium of the two um and

1882
01:24:01,158 --> 01:24:05,599
oddly enough they're they're roughly

1883
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:06,840
using about the same water um I think

1884
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:09,639
the beach grapes are getting just

1885
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:12,199
slightly overwatered um and leaning a

1886
01:24:09,639 --> 01:24:15,600
little bit vegetative but it's it's

1887
01:24:12,198 --> 01:24:19,039
surprising to me that the biomass of the

1888
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:20,760
Sher cocktail has got to be at least one

1889
01:24:19,039 --> 01:24:22,319
and a half times the beach grapes

1890
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:25,199
overall in terms of like if I were to

1891
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:26,719
cut down both plants wet right now I I'd

1892
01:24:25,198 --> 01:24:28,919
say the Sher cocktail is going to be

1893
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:30,600
like 1 and 1/2 times the weight um but

1894
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:33,039
it's it's not

1895
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:34,800
transpiring at 1 and 1/2 times what the

1896
01:24:33,039 --> 01:24:37,519
beach grapes is which is really

1897
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:40,679
fascinating um so is that something you

1898
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:42,639
do though do you match like cultivars

1899
01:24:40,679 --> 01:24:45,279
with uh like

1900
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:48,279
irrigations if that makes

1901
01:24:45,279 --> 01:24:50,479
sense um I mean ideally that would be

1902
01:24:48,279 --> 01:24:52,960
where we try to to match cultiv bars on

1903
01:24:50,479 --> 01:24:54,599
the same table yeah absolutely and

1904
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:58,880
usually we do that based off of

1905
01:24:54,600 --> 01:25:00,480
structure because uh like size plants

1906
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:02,760
usually use about the same amount of

1907
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:05,839
water but then there are plants that are

1908
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:08,440
just not heavy drinkers um they don't

1909
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:11,440
assimilate the uh the nutrients as fast

1910
01:25:08,439 --> 01:25:13,599
and so they don't need as much water and

1911
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:15,279
maybe their stamata like the density of

1912
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,079
their stamata on the leaves might be

1913
01:25:15,279 --> 01:25:18,519
lesser or something than the other

1914
01:25:17,079 --> 01:25:20,760
plants where they they just don't have

1915
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:22,239
the ability to transpire as as greatly

1916
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:24,000
as some other plants do it makes me

1917
01:25:22,238 --> 01:25:26,879
think of like mac 1 Mac 1 is a really

1918
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:29,158
slow grower it seems like I water her

1919
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:31,199
half as much as some of the other plants

1920
01:25:29,158 --> 01:25:32,638
that are moms um cuz we handw waterer

1921
01:25:31,198 --> 01:25:33,960
all our moms so that we like pick up

1922
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:35,719
each plant make sure that it gets a good

1923
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:40,560
dry back so that we're don't not running

1924
01:25:35,719 --> 01:25:43,800
in into any um like hypoxia related uh

1925
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:46,280
root issues where they're just like

1926
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:48,440
going Anor robic or anything like that

1927
01:25:46,279 --> 01:25:50,000
um yeah there's it's it's really

1928
01:25:48,439 --> 01:25:52,919
fascinating to see how different

1929
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:56,319
cultivars react differently and how you

1930
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:58,199
can then try to find matching um

1931
01:25:56,319 --> 01:26:00,759
cultivars to put together so that you

1932
01:25:58,198 --> 01:26:03,439
can grow them under the same irrigation

1933
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:04,960
strategies and in the same environment

1934
01:26:03,439 --> 01:26:06,599
um and that has been a huge Challenge

1935
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:08,600
and that's where it's like we we haven't

1936
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:10,320
really been we haven't really been

1937
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:13,159
leaning towards

1938
01:26:10,319 --> 01:26:14,719
making like recipes for cultivars that I

1939
01:26:13,158 --> 01:26:16,519
heard a lot of people would do with

1940
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:19,439
their irrigation practices and

1941
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:21,520
environmental practices because yeah in

1942
01:26:19,439 --> 01:26:23,879
today's market you have to have so many

1943
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,880
flavors available that you can't really

1944
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:27,239
dedicate

1945
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:28,760
all of your space to like so we have

1946
01:26:27,238 --> 01:26:31,359
four flower rooms we can't just have

1947
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:33,679
four cultivars available yeah it's not

1948
01:26:31,359 --> 01:26:35,238
it's not it it doesn't really work for

1949
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:38,399
us

1950
01:26:35,238 --> 01:26:41,079
um even at like the lower the lower

1951
01:26:38,399 --> 01:26:46,238
packs that we we produce you know each

1952
01:26:41,079 --> 01:26:48,039
Harvest is only 30 to 36 lb so um but

1953
01:26:46,238 --> 01:26:50,118
even amongst that like nobody wants 30

1954
01:26:48,039 --> 01:26:51,960
lbs of one strain in Oregon at this

1955
01:26:50,118 --> 01:26:53,279
point of high quality weed because I

1956
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:55,399
think everywhere they're going to sell

1957
01:26:53,279 --> 01:26:56,639
it for more yeah yeah absolutely and

1958
01:26:55,399 --> 01:27:00,000
it's it's unfortunate cuz the price

1959
01:26:56,639 --> 01:27:02,039
keeps going down uh to the grower but

1960
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,279
then the price in the dispensary is

1961
01:27:02,039 --> 01:27:07,920
consistent or goes up for some of the

1962
01:27:04,279 --> 01:27:11,158
high quality like top shelf stuff and

1963
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:13,520
um yeah it's it's a weird market right

1964
01:27:11,158 --> 01:27:14,679
now for sure um it's almost like one of

1965
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:18,480
those things where we just have to like

1966
01:27:14,679 --> 01:27:20,560
hold on and hope that things adjust and

1967
01:27:18,479 --> 01:27:22,599
uh not necessarily like improve as

1968
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:26,119
though like we know what that could be

1969
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:29,840
but it something needs to change

1970
01:27:26,118 --> 01:27:31,238
so you know speaking of change um now

1971
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:32,960
that you've worked in the Cannabis

1972
01:27:31,238 --> 01:27:35,198
industry for a little bit and you've

1973
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:37,399
been doing your home grow and you've

1974
01:27:35,198 --> 01:27:40,759
been an active participant within the

1975
01:27:37,399 --> 01:27:42,960
community posting on Instagram looking

1976
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:44,520
at what other people are doing

1977
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:48,079
interacting I don't know if you go to

1978
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:50,199
since you're in um in like kind of an

1979
01:27:48,079 --> 01:27:51,600
area where there's a lot of uh cannabis

1980
01:27:50,198 --> 01:27:53,279
events and stuff I don't know if you're

1981
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,280
like attending any of these I think you

1982
01:27:53,279 --> 01:27:59,519
went to MJ bus

1983
01:27:55,279 --> 01:28:01,960
uh this year um so like by immersing

1984
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:06,400
yourself more into the industry and the

1985
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:10,079
community um where do you feel as though

1986
01:28:06,399 --> 01:28:11,799
some changes could be um like what would

1987
01:28:10,079 --> 01:28:14,039
you want to see change in the community

1988
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:18,560
I guess and or the industry as a whole

1989
01:28:14,039 --> 01:28:22,198
uh homow commercial anywhere in

1990
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:24,119
between um well back when we were

1991
01:28:22,198 --> 01:28:25,719
talking about remember how I mentioned

1992
01:28:24,118 --> 01:28:26,960
strawberry cough and I thought it would

1993
01:28:25,719 --> 01:28:31,279
be

1994
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:32,679
tall um cuz it's a sativa but I was

1995
01:28:31,279 --> 01:28:35,238
going to mention is that because

1996
01:28:32,679 --> 01:28:37,000
nowadays we only have poly hybrid

1997
01:28:35,238 --> 01:28:40,319
strains

1998
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:42,479
and nothing's truly sativa nothing's

1999
01:28:40,319 --> 01:28:45,599
truly Indica now it's just pretty much

2000
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:49,759
all hybrid I want to change that

2001
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:52,880
or go back to like uh where you can just

2002
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:54,960
smoke straight indica or you know get

2003
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:57,760
some straight SA

2004
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:59,800
uh I think uh

2005
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:02,800
consumers think still that they're

2006
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:06,480
getting sativa in Indica but it's it's

2007
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:07,440
not everything's hybrid no and I think

2008
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:09,198
yeah there's there's not a lot of

2009
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:11,960
commercial producers that would want to

2010
01:29:09,198 --> 01:29:14,439
grow a sativa that takes 12 to 14 weeks

2011
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:16,880
to flower cuz right that's almost two

2012
01:29:14,439 --> 01:29:20,519
full flower cycles of something that is

2013
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:24,639
more of a a squatter um non-equatorial

2014
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:28,199
so realistically Inda um yeah

2015
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:30,920
so profit Wise It's not smart to do

2016
01:29:28,198 --> 01:29:33,439
that yeah you can't charge twice for a

2017
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:35,079
sativa um and that's one of the big the

2018
01:29:33,439 --> 01:29:38,439
big things cuz it it does take about

2019
01:29:35,079 --> 01:29:40,319
twice the amount of input um makes sense

2020
01:29:38,439 --> 01:29:42,279
but I I hear you cuz there are some

2021
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:44,880
people that are still doing it and

2022
01:29:42,279 --> 01:29:47,439
they're you know they're just uh making

2023
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:49,520
it a small a small part of their crop

2024
01:29:47,439 --> 01:29:53,118
but it's also one of the reasons why I

2025
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:56,119
am so uh heavily advocate advocating for

2026
01:29:53,118 --> 01:29:58,399
hom grow is because somebody at home can

2027
01:29:56,118 --> 01:30:00,799
absolutely take their time to grow out

2028
01:29:58,399 --> 01:30:03,960
something like Panama Red where they're

2029
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:06,960
going to flower it for 120 days that's

2030
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:13,198
just to me I'm I'm like when I think 120

2031
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:16,560
days in flour that is crazy I I don't

2032
01:30:13,198 --> 01:30:18,279
keep like for I I feel like I will cut

2033
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:23,080
from a

2034
01:30:18,279 --> 01:30:25,319
mom clone like take that clone it veg it

2035
01:30:23,079 --> 01:30:28,079
flower it out

2036
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:31,118
and like that whole cycle of like even

2037
01:30:28,079 --> 01:30:34,158
growing the mom to make that cutting Al

2038
01:30:31,118 --> 01:30:37,319
together that doesn't take 120 days yeah

2039
01:30:34,158 --> 01:30:39,839
and uh but of course I'm thinking of it

2040
01:30:37,319 --> 01:30:41,599
from a commercial standpoint and from

2041
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:43,279
like a production standpoint but for

2042
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:46,520
like the home grower who wants Panama

2043
01:30:43,279 --> 01:30:49,679
Red like go for it that's

2044
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:52,520
awesome yeah just more

2045
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:54,920
patience yeah um to get but it sounds

2046
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:57,159
like you want more of that the industry

2047
01:30:54,920 --> 01:31:01,279
in terms of you want it to to be less of

2048
01:30:57,158 --> 01:31:04,879
a a poly hybrid yeah uh cess pool so to

2049
01:31:01,279 --> 01:31:11,118
speak because when I was uh a dispatcher

2050
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:14,800
at like a black market uh delivery

2051
01:31:11,118 --> 01:31:17,839
company uh we would lie to customers the

2052
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:21,239
customers would say oh I want OG Kush

2053
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:23,600
and we didn't have that uh we were just

2054
01:31:21,238 --> 01:31:25,519
like okay and just write down OG Kush on

2055
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:27,400
the back and then give them whatever you

2056
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:29,560
know and and a lot of consumers think

2057
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:30,599
they're getting what they're ordering or

2058
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:32,320
they think they're getting a straight

2059
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:33,960
indica or straight sativa and that's

2060
01:31:32,319 --> 01:31:37,559
just not how it is these days and I

2061
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:37,560
didn't realize that until I became a

2062
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:43,800
grower yep so you when even when you

2063
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:47,880
were like working through as dispatching

2064
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:49,279
for like this elicit service um you you

2065
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:51,159
didn't realize at the time that it

2066
01:31:49,279 --> 01:31:52,639
wasn't uh yeah that they weren't

2067
01:31:51,158 --> 01:31:55,079
necessarily being truthful about what

2068
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:57,199
they were providing people yeah and I

2069
01:31:55,079 --> 01:31:59,238
felt awful lying to customers and

2070
01:31:57,198 --> 01:32:02,039
telling them oh yeah you're getting uh

2071
01:31:59,238 --> 01:32:05,039
Paris OG that's what you're getting but

2072
01:32:02,039 --> 01:32:07,639
it and they asked me oh is it good uh

2073
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:09,920
and I'm just like sure you know and I

2074
01:32:07,639 --> 01:32:13,279
felt bad lying but it's part of like

2075
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:15,319
their sales tactic and um and even if

2076
01:32:13,279 --> 01:32:18,158
like we had a strain that said like

2077
01:32:15,319 --> 01:32:19,599
Paris OG and we ran out of that strain

2078
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:21,679
even though it wasn't

2079
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:23,119
pariso they would lie and be like oh

2080
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:24,760
yeah we still have it and then just grab

2081
01:32:23,118 --> 01:32:27,639
another thing off the shelf and just

2082
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:29,480
package it and and I'm just I don't know

2083
01:32:27,639 --> 01:32:31,560
I think it's not fair to lie to

2084
01:32:29,479 --> 01:32:33,879
Consumers about what you're giving them

2085
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:37,719
because some people look for something

2086
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:40,359
specific you know and um some consumers

2087
01:32:37,719 --> 01:32:42,960
want that specific strain and that

2088
01:32:40,359 --> 01:32:45,519
helped them in whatever moment that they

2089
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:49,359
were you know dealing with and that

2090
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:52,239
helped them and people look for that you

2091
01:32:49,359 --> 01:32:56,479
know and I feel like

2092
01:32:52,238 --> 01:32:57,799
nowadays it's all a lie because like

2093
01:32:56,479 --> 01:32:59,198
you're not getting straight Indica

2094
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:01,400
you're not getting straight sativa

2095
01:32:59,198 --> 01:33:05,599
anymore like that's that's not a thing

2096
01:33:01,399 --> 01:33:07,638
anymore so I I dislike that a lot I can

2097
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:09,639
agree with that I feel like uh truth and

2098
01:33:07,639 --> 01:33:12,840
marketing is something that needs to be

2099
01:33:09,639 --> 01:33:15,239
a thing but like you said as a grower to

2100
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:19,480
have to grow it for way longer because

2101
01:33:15,238 --> 01:33:21,839
it's a sativa and it kind of ruins

2102
01:33:19,479 --> 01:33:24,079
production in a way or you know like

2103
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:25,520
just sets you back financially for

2104
01:33:24,079 --> 01:33:26,880
people that are trying to you know push

2105
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:29,600
their product off the shelf and they're

2106
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:31,440
having to spend more labor and time to

2107
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:34,280
grow something that takes longer I I

2108
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:36,279
totally see why it you know the industry

2109
01:33:34,279 --> 01:33:40,439
only has poly

2110
01:33:36,279 --> 01:33:43,319
hybrids but I don't think it's fair for

2111
01:33:40,439 --> 01:33:46,559
consumers for sure yeah I mean I I feel

2112
01:33:43,319 --> 01:33:48,158
like there are some poly hybrids uh or

2113
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:52,800
other hybrid strains out there where

2114
01:33:48,158 --> 01:33:54,559
they do try to uh breed for the effects

2115
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:57,440
um of something that would have been a

2116
01:33:54,560 --> 01:34:00,159
traditional sativa um but to put it in a

2117
01:33:57,439 --> 01:34:02,158
plant that is a a more squat easy to

2118
01:34:00,158 --> 01:34:05,279
control plant something that isn't going

2119
01:34:02,158 --> 01:34:08,000
to take 120 days um cuz even that alone

2120
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:09,800
it's a very hard thing to do to to keep

2121
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,238
a plant alive that long especially

2122
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:14,119
through a flowering period where you're

2123
01:34:12,238 --> 01:34:16,079
you know after a certain time you don't

2124
01:34:14,118 --> 01:34:18,719
want to spray for pests and after a

2125
01:34:16,079 --> 01:34:19,399
certain time you you know if you have

2126
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:22,158
too

2127
01:34:19,399 --> 01:34:24,479
many uh temperature and humidity

2128
01:34:22,158 --> 01:34:26,238
fluctuations especially with with the

2129
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:29,519
flower structures of some of these

2130
01:34:26,238 --> 01:34:33,079
equatorial plants being so large

2131
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:36,080
um you risk mold and you risk other

2132
01:34:33,079 --> 01:34:38,719
pathogen and and and rot and just a

2133
01:34:36,079 --> 01:34:40,800
multitude you know nutrient deficiencies

2134
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:44,079
other things as well just when you grow

2135
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:46,800
something for that long um that is such

2136
01:34:44,079 --> 01:34:49,559
a high demand plant cuz cannabis you

2137
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:52,360
know it it's it's it just eats so much

2138
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:54,320
compared to something like a cactus or a

2139
01:34:52,359 --> 01:34:56,118
a a little bonsai tree or something

2140
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:58,198
where you can feed it once a year or

2141
01:34:56,118 --> 01:35:02,880
something

2142
01:34:58,198 --> 01:35:04,479
um so I I do I do see how like the poly

2143
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:06,520
hybrids could become something where it

2144
01:35:04,479 --> 01:35:09,399
is

2145
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:12,560
like it's almost like devious to tell

2146
01:35:09,399 --> 01:35:14,799
people it's a sativa when it's not but

2147
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:16,840
if if that's where like a lot of these

2148
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:19,560
things that are like indicia

2149
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:23,840
sativa um high

2150
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:26,000
THC um I feel like a lot of it is like

2151
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:29,520
we we just got it wrong as an industry

2152
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:32,920
and we need to probably lean more

2153
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:35,679
towards uh a complete more holistic

2154
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:38,679
understanding of how all the different

2155
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:40,800
constituents um come together in you

2156
01:35:38,679 --> 01:35:43,359
know whether it be like an Entourage

2157
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:46,239
effect or however else people would like

2158
01:35:43,359 --> 01:35:47,679
to describe it um and then also to

2159
01:35:46,238 --> 01:35:50,839
understand that every person's

2160
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:53,480
endocannabinoid system is unique and

2161
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:55,920
different and so uh by finding something

2162
01:35:53,479 --> 01:35:58,279
that that does work for them you know it

2163
01:35:55,920 --> 01:36:00,480
could completely like you could

2164
01:35:58,279 --> 01:36:02,439
completely find a tpine and cannaboid

2165
01:36:00,479 --> 01:36:05,359
profile now in something that only takes

2166
01:36:02,439 --> 01:36:07,238
9 weeks to grow um and then find that

2167
01:36:05,359 --> 01:36:11,198
same tpine and cannaboid profile in

2168
01:36:07,238 --> 01:36:13,118
something that takes 12 weeks to grow um

2169
01:36:11,198 --> 01:36:15,799
that's I that's completely possible now

2170
01:36:13,118 --> 01:36:17,759
with the genetic diversity that we have

2171
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:21,400
available

2172
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:23,719
but it I feel like as a grower you know

2173
01:36:21,399 --> 01:36:26,479
that something that's a sativa or

2174
01:36:23,719 --> 01:36:29,520
something that is like a an equatorial

2175
01:36:26,479 --> 01:36:32,519
land race of some kind is supposed to

2176
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:34,560
take a long time to grow and as a grower

2177
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:36,679
you're looking at it and saying well

2178
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:39,560
who's growing these long sativas and

2179
01:36:36,679 --> 01:36:41,760
where can I get it um whereas I feel

2180
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:44,239
like definitely for like a hom grower or

2181
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:46,280
Not a Home grower but just a consumer

2182
01:36:44,238 --> 01:36:48,559
but just a consumer right someone's just

2183
01:36:46,279 --> 01:36:51,759
like I just want something that makes me

2184
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:54,280
you know feel productive or artistic or

2185
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:56,679
uh upbeat or like want to go a hike and

2186
01:36:54,279 --> 01:36:58,158
they're like that's a sativa or someone

2187
01:36:56,679 --> 01:37:00,719
who's just like no I just want to sit on

2188
01:36:58,158 --> 01:37:02,879
the couch play video games get the

2189
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:05,439
munchies because I need to eat because I

2190
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:08,719
haven't eaten all day um like and and

2191
01:37:05,439 --> 01:37:11,599
then they go and that's an indicia um so

2192
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:13,399
I feel as though there's uh just a lot

2193
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:15,840
of different misconceptions in terms of

2194
01:37:13,399 --> 01:37:19,399
what sativa and Inda are because like

2195
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:23,880
Inda as an like as the term indicia it

2196
01:37:19,399 --> 01:37:26,719
actually means of India and sativa just

2197
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:29,520
as the as the term itself means um

2198
01:37:26,719 --> 01:37:31,439
cultivated so there's other plants that

2199
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:35,400
use these

2200
01:37:31,439 --> 01:37:39,198
um monikers within their naming

2201
01:37:35,399 --> 01:37:41,279
schema to uh designate that it is a

2202
01:37:39,198 --> 01:37:45,479
cultivated plant or that it is a plant

2203
01:37:41,279 --> 01:37:48,000
that has uh of Indian descent um outside

2204
01:37:45,479 --> 01:37:49,879
of cannabis and so I know that's

2205
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,359
sometimes where like yeah and this is

2206
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:54,079
sometimes where like a lot of people are

2207
01:37:52,359 --> 01:37:56,920
uh like

2208
01:37:54,079 --> 01:37:58,679
because of the illegality of cannabis at

2209
01:37:56,920 --> 01:38:02,760
least this is my explanation because of

2210
01:37:58,679 --> 01:38:05,800
the IL illegality of cannabis we have

2211
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:10,280
used certain terminologies that are not

2212
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:13,039
accurate makes sense to other aspects of

2213
01:38:10,279 --> 01:38:17,079
Agriculture and cannabis is

2214
01:38:13,039 --> 01:38:19,679
so truly related to agriculture it it is

2215
01:38:17,079 --> 01:38:22,238
agriculture in a sense I wish youd make

2216
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:25,639
it that to use these yeah right but to

2217
01:38:22,238 --> 01:38:27,839
use these termin these terms that have a

2218
01:38:25,639 --> 01:38:31,159
an agricultural meaning to every other

2219
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:33,039
agricultural uh industry in the world

2220
01:38:31,158 --> 01:38:36,079
and then are used differently in

2221
01:38:33,039 --> 01:38:40,319
cannabis does tend

2222
01:38:36,079 --> 01:38:42,639
to confuse a lot of the the public when

2223
01:38:40,319 --> 01:38:45,319
it comes to Consumers because they're

2224
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:48,000
given these different terms as this is

2225
01:38:45,319 --> 01:38:49,359
what this means this is what that means

2226
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:52,840
even if it was something that was

2227
01:38:49,359 --> 01:38:56,439
developed like in the shadows and in a

2228
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:58,319
in an alist Market in a in a time where

2229
01:38:56,439 --> 01:39:00,359
you know saying hey let me get some of

2230
01:38:58,319 --> 01:39:02,559
that really awesome cannabis that puts

2231
01:39:00,359 --> 01:39:03,920
me to sleep you know no one's going to

2232
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:06,239
listen to you when you say that if

2233
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:08,920
you're like picking up a dime bag or a

2234
01:39:06,238 --> 01:39:10,319
dub sack back you know 15 20 years ago

2235
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:11,319
they're like oh yeah I got it just like

2236
01:39:10,319 --> 01:39:16,000
they do

2237
01:39:11,319 --> 01:39:18,319
now yeah exactly yeah um but yeah I I I

2238
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:20,439
see how like a little bit more like

2239
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:23,880
honesty and a little bit

2240
01:39:20,439 --> 01:39:26,198
more um or maybe just education feels

2241
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:28,960
like yeah feels like education is

2242
01:39:26,198 --> 01:39:31,238
heavily needed not only for the

2243
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:34,439
producers and the purveyors of cannabis

2244
01:39:31,238 --> 01:39:37,879
but also for the consumers for sure yeah

2245
01:39:34,439 --> 01:39:40,039
cuz when I worked in um the being a

2246
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:41,679
dispatcher that was like my number one

2247
01:39:40,039 --> 01:39:43,399
questions I would always get from

2248
01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:45,319
consumers list like oh what's your best

2249
01:39:43,399 --> 01:39:49,158
sativa what's your best indica and I'm

2250
01:39:45,319 --> 01:39:50,559
just like uh you know so I think people

2251
01:39:49,158 --> 01:39:54,479
really need to

2252
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:56,400
educate uh consumers that it's not like

2253
01:39:54,479 --> 01:39:59,598
that and I didn't even realize Indica

2254
01:39:56,399 --> 01:40:02,238
meant from India and sativa was meant

2255
01:39:59,599 --> 01:40:04,639
like cultivated so that was really cool

2256
01:40:02,238 --> 01:40:06,359
that you taught me that thanks for that

2257
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:08,118
yeah absolutely I I feel like it's

2258
01:40:06,359 --> 01:40:10,439
important for people to know that there

2259
01:40:08,118 --> 01:40:13,399
these terms are used outside of cannabis

2260
01:40:10,439 --> 01:40:15,839
and they're they're not uh solely

2261
01:40:13,399 --> 01:40:18,039
designated to the Cannabis industry um

2262
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:20,239
even though we've appropriated them into

2263
01:40:18,039 --> 01:40:22,519
something that they aren't uh originally

2264
01:40:20,238 --> 01:40:24,598
which it it's very fascinating the

2265
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:29,520
Cannabis industry appropriates a lot of

2266
01:40:24,599 --> 01:40:32,960
different things that um it may not be

2267
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:35,159
the best to appropriate yeah um but you

2268
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:38,840
know I feel like a lot of a lot of

2269
01:40:35,158 --> 01:40:42,198
different groups and industries do that

2270
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:46,639
um so considering that you started your

2271
01:40:42,198 --> 01:40:49,719
growing Journey so recently um I feel

2272
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:52,359
like you're a great person to ask what

2273
01:40:49,719 --> 01:40:56,079
were some of the pitfalls that you found

2274
01:40:52,359 --> 01:40:58,639
early on in growing that you were able

2275
01:40:56,079 --> 01:41:01,079
to learn from

2276
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:04,319
um that you would want to then relay

2277
01:41:01,079 --> 01:41:06,479
that information to another new grower

2278
01:41:04,319 --> 01:41:09,118
who's just getting into it so that they

2279
01:41:06,479 --> 01:41:14,399
can avoid it like so that they can learn

2280
01:41:09,118 --> 01:41:18,198
from your mistakes basically don't buy

2281
01:41:14,399 --> 01:41:20,719
CO2 that is a waste of time uh for a

2282
01:41:18,198 --> 01:41:23,359
home grow for sure a tent for sure I

2283
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:25,158
mean my teacher Matt he was like why AR

2284
01:41:23,359 --> 01:41:26,960
using CO2 and I'm like honestly cuz it

2285
01:41:25,158 --> 01:41:29,238
was just expensive for me like if I

2286
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:30,920
could afford it I would do it but I

2287
01:41:29,238 --> 01:41:33,479
really just can't so it's if it's

2288
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:34,960
something you can afford do it but it's

2289
01:41:33,479 --> 01:41:36,678
not

2290
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:40,639
crucial

2291
01:41:36,679 --> 01:41:43,000
um what else um I think that a lot of

2292
01:41:40,639 --> 01:41:44,520
people should try rock wool grow a lot

2293
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:47,079
of people are

2294
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:50,639
afraid to grow in rock wool I talked to

2295
01:41:47,079 --> 01:41:52,039
a lot of soil Growers um soil growing is

2296
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:54,679
you know more

2297
01:41:52,039 --> 01:41:56,439
common and a lot of soy Growers have

2298
01:41:54,679 --> 01:41:59,359
told me they're afraid to grow in rock

2299
01:41:56,439 --> 01:42:01,519
wool and uh they don't want issues

2300
01:41:59,359 --> 01:42:04,279
problems and it's funny because I'm

2301
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:05,960
experiencing the opposite I haven't

2302
01:42:04,279 --> 01:42:08,238
experienced any issues or problems in

2303
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:10,840
rock wall but I have seen some

2304
01:42:08,238 --> 01:42:15,439
deficiencies and issues in

2305
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:16,800
soil so um and I think yeah I think a

2306
01:42:15,439 --> 01:42:20,678
lot of people should just try different

2307
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:24,119
ways of growing um not just be stuck to

2308
01:42:20,679 --> 01:42:26,520
one thing um expand your knowledge and

2309
01:42:24,118 --> 01:42:28,198
learn different ways of how to get

2310
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:30,159
better

2311
01:42:28,198 --> 01:42:33,238
um

2312
01:42:30,158 --> 01:42:36,559
and for me I watch YouTube videos every

2313
01:42:33,238 --> 01:42:39,678
day of how to grow and different uh

2314
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:43,400
stages and what to do and um I watch a

2315
01:42:39,679 --> 01:42:46,760
lot of uh drying and curing videos just

2316
01:42:43,399 --> 01:42:48,920
because I want to perfect that stage um

2317
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:51,480
I think drying and curing is the most

2318
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:53,760
important step of

2319
01:42:51,479 --> 01:42:57,359
growing um a lot of people

2320
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:59,360
people might say otherwise but I mean

2321
01:42:57,359 --> 01:43:01,039
you can grow a beautiful flower and then

2322
01:42:59,359 --> 01:43:04,319
dry it and cure it terribly and then it

2323
01:43:01,039 --> 01:43:07,960
ends up being a mid instead of you know

2324
01:43:04,319 --> 01:43:09,319
top shelf and I think that sucks cuz you

2325
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:11,439
put in all this hard work you're

2326
01:43:09,319 --> 01:43:13,279
expecting oh I grew this [ __ ]

2327
01:43:11,439 --> 01:43:14,559
beautifully it's going to be perfect and

2328
01:43:13,279 --> 01:43:18,279
then when you dry it and cure it you're

2329
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:23,840
like what the heck so yeah my first dry

2330
01:43:18,279 --> 01:43:27,399
I experienced uh that uh hay smell

2331
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:31,079
and I was petrified and thought you know

2332
01:43:27,399 --> 01:43:32,799
my Harvest was ruined but luckily like

2333
01:43:31,079 --> 01:43:37,519
uh it went

2334
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:39,199
away so I mean it was okay um I feel

2335
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:42,480
like I'm still learning how to properly

2336
01:43:39,198 --> 01:43:45,039
dry and cure um I had mentioned to you

2337
01:43:42,479 --> 01:43:48,359
that I threw my trim in the freezer with

2338
01:43:45,039 --> 01:43:50,439
popcorn nugs and I checked on it like a

2339
01:43:48,359 --> 01:43:51,759
month maybe almost two months later just

2340
01:43:50,439 --> 01:43:54,839
to make some

2341
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:57,840
edibles uh make cannabis butter out

2342
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:59,360
of and I saw the popcorn nugs in there

2343
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:01,279
and they were looking beautiful and I

2344
01:43:59,359 --> 01:44:03,000
was like ooh so I went to go pick them

2345
01:44:01,279 --> 01:44:05,759
up to see if they like crumbled and they

2346
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:07,198
didn't they were perfect um they were

2347
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:10,119
still kind of sticky

2348
01:44:07,198 --> 01:44:12,399
too so I don't know it got me on an idea

2349
01:44:10,118 --> 01:44:16,799
of like can I cure this

2350
01:44:12,399 --> 01:44:18,439
way so I don't know I mean for sure I

2351
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:22,560
might just try one I think low temp

2352
01:44:18,439 --> 01:44:24,839
curing is a thing yeah yeah I mean I

2353
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:27,000
liked how looked the flow tasted better

2354
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:28,199
the color was still there it seemed like

2355
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:31,479
the

2356
01:44:28,198 --> 01:44:34,439
tricomes were still you know intact like

2357
01:44:31,479 --> 01:44:37,839
like when I compared my dried cure to

2358
01:44:34,439 --> 01:44:40,439
like what I did in jars to the freezer

2359
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:43,560
cure it just looked so much different

2360
01:44:40,439 --> 01:44:44,598
smelled different um the freezer cure

2361
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:47,719
was

2362
01:44:44,599 --> 01:44:50,119
better so I am a little nervous yeah I'm

2363
01:44:47,719 --> 01:44:52,719
a little nervous to you know cure in the

2364
01:44:50,118 --> 01:44:54,719
freezer but I'm going to try it not my

2365
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:57,000
whole Harvest but I'm going to try like

2366
01:44:54,719 --> 01:44:58,158
a jar or something I don't know what to

2367
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:01,439
do yet and you're going

2368
01:44:58,158 --> 01:45:04,158
to and just so like the listeners know

2369
01:45:01,439 --> 01:45:08,439
but um like it sounds like your plan is

2370
01:45:04,158 --> 01:45:10,679
to dry it fully put it in a jar and seal

2371
01:45:08,439 --> 01:45:13,158
it in that jar yes uh at room

2372
01:45:10,679 --> 01:45:15,239
temperature and then put that sealed jar

2373
01:45:13,158 --> 01:45:17,839
in the freezer yes and then when you

2374
01:45:15,238 --> 01:45:20,359
want to check on it you're your plan is

2375
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:23,119
to then pull it out of the freezer let

2376
01:45:20,359 --> 01:45:25,519
it sit at room temp until it comes to

2377
01:45:23,118 --> 01:45:27,920
room temperature and then open the jar

2378
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:30,400
to to test the buds just to avoid any

2379
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:33,319
sort of uh condensation or moisture that

2380
01:45:30,399 --> 01:45:36,198
could form on the flower itself

2381
01:45:33,319 --> 01:45:38,039
yes yeah cool I mean I try I think it's

2382
01:45:36,198 --> 01:45:41,359
a great idea cuz I've heard of other

2383
01:45:38,039 --> 01:45:43,920
people saying that they'll store um

2384
01:45:41,359 --> 01:45:46,799
cannabis that they want to come back to

2385
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:48,199
uh long term either in the fridge or you

2386
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:50,639
know I feel like I might have even heard

2387
01:45:48,198 --> 01:45:51,879
it in the freezer before but it was one

2388
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:53,840
of those things that I was like well I'm

2389
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:58,000
not going to be trying that because

2390
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:59,880
anytime I did grow at home it was uh I

2391
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,760
couldn't couldn't keep the flower around

2392
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:05,760
long enough I just I wanted to smoke it

2393
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:09,560
all um I feel like those are all great

2394
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:11,719
little tidbits of advice for new Growers

2395
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:14,280
um yeah what do you think you think I

2396
01:46:11,719 --> 01:46:17,920
should just try it and see what

2397
01:46:14,279 --> 01:46:19,359
happens I'm a little nervous yeah I

2398
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:23,840
think you should I think you should try

2399
01:46:19,359 --> 01:46:27,399
it that method um yeah drying

2400
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:30,800
in the tent try to do my 6 put like one

2401
01:46:27,399 --> 01:46:32,479
really nice flower in there um you know

2402
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:34,079
and and then the rest Just Popcorn nugs

2403
01:46:32,479 --> 01:46:36,039
or stuff that you wouldn't mind making

2404
01:46:34,079 --> 01:46:38,079
into Edibles uh like you're talking

2405
01:46:36,039 --> 01:46:40,960
about just because that way it's not

2406
01:46:38,079 --> 01:46:42,519
necessarily a huge loss to lose one one

2407
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:45,480
nice bud but then you can see how that

2408
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:47,280
one nice Bud turns out um yeah I

2409
01:46:45,479 --> 01:46:50,000
definitely suggest you know getting it

2410
01:46:47,279 --> 01:46:52,359
fully dried all the way to where like

2411
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:54,039
you could smoke it if you wanted to but

2412
01:46:52,359 --> 01:46:55,759
you want to C it to help reduce a little

2413
01:46:54,039 --> 01:46:58,639
bit of the harshness let the enatic

2414
01:46:55,760 --> 01:47:00,320
process continue um awesome so yeah I'd

2415
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:03,279
say I'd say try it why not I mean all

2416
01:47:00,319 --> 01:47:05,880
these things that we experiment with as

2417
01:47:03,279 --> 01:47:10,000
hom Growers that

2418
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:12,920
um that can be documented and relayed to

2419
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:15,198
other Home Growers um if it is helpful

2420
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:16,880
then why not especially you know it

2421
01:47:15,198 --> 01:47:20,559
makes me think of like if somebody can

2422
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:23,159
only grow one crop a year outdoor um but

2423
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:25,599
they want it to stay fresh because they

2424
01:47:23,158 --> 01:47:28,679
really like fresh flour um versus

2425
01:47:25,599 --> 01:47:30,440
something that's been cured uh at a

2426
01:47:28,679 --> 01:47:32,199
higher temperature uh for a longer

2427
01:47:30,439 --> 01:47:35,198
period of time cuz even some people like

2428
01:47:32,198 --> 01:47:37,519
that sort of peppery cannabis where

2429
01:47:35,198 --> 01:47:39,439
everything off gases other than the

2430
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:41,840
kopine where it's like just really

2431
01:47:39,439 --> 01:47:43,198
peppery and spicy but I I know some

2432
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:46,079
people like that especially in like

2433
01:47:43,198 --> 01:47:48,960
hashes and stuff um but if somebody

2434
01:47:46,079 --> 01:47:51,800
wanted fresh flour and they were able to

2435
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:54,319
take all this outdoor that they grow and

2436
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:56,360
dry it up really nice nice and then trim

2437
01:47:54,319 --> 01:47:58,158
it up and manicure it to what they like

2438
01:47:56,359 --> 01:48:01,079
and then get it into some airtight

2439
01:47:58,158 --> 01:48:03,519
container that they can then freeze uh

2440
01:48:01,079 --> 01:48:06,279
and then pull as they need to throughout

2441
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:09,280
the year to supply what their needs are

2442
01:48:06,279 --> 01:48:11,359
um I feel like you know somebody can

2443
01:48:09,279 --> 01:48:13,279
easily grow what they need in a year in

2444
01:48:11,359 --> 01:48:17,198
an outdoor plot if they have the ability

2445
01:48:13,279 --> 01:48:19,479
for it um and it's a lot cheaper so it

2446
01:48:17,198 --> 01:48:22,198
might it might be a great way for people

2447
01:48:19,479 --> 01:48:25,479
to keep flower around for longer and

2448
01:48:22,198 --> 01:48:28,479
enjoy fresh cannabis throughout the year

2449
01:48:25,479 --> 01:48:30,678
um so I'm I'm sure that there's a a a

2450
01:48:28,479 --> 01:48:33,678
niche opportunity there for other people

2451
01:48:30,679 --> 01:48:36,118
to learn from this and to apply it in

2452
01:48:33,679 --> 01:48:37,960
different ways yeah cuz I tried Googling

2453
01:48:36,118 --> 01:48:39,479
it keep a good log of it yeah yeah I

2454
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:42,760
tried Googling it and there's not much

2455
01:48:39,479 --> 01:48:45,519
on Google about it um I saw a lot of

2456
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:47,159
like Reddit comments on it and other

2457
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:48,719
people have tried it they say use a

2458
01:48:47,158 --> 01:48:52,359
frost free

2459
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:54,319
freezer um I've even came across people

2460
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:58,439
uh drying in a

2461
01:48:54,319 --> 01:49:01,158
fridge so I don't know I mean sure I

2462
01:48:58,439 --> 01:49:04,279
just want to do like what makes the best

2463
01:49:01,158 --> 01:49:07,039
cure uh because I noticed like I told

2464
01:49:04,279 --> 01:49:09,840
you when I looked at my cured buds in

2465
01:49:07,039 --> 01:49:12,439
the mason jars and then I looked at the

2466
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:14,319
cured Bud from the freezer the color was

2467
01:49:12,439 --> 01:49:15,879
better The Taste the smell was better

2468
01:49:14,319 --> 01:49:17,719
from the freezer so I was just like I

2469
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:21,960
guess it's more fresh like you're

2470
01:49:17,719 --> 01:49:23,679
saying so yeah I mean can tpin off gas

2471
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:26,079
so rapidly

2472
01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:28,960
um uh even at lower temperatures there's

2473
01:49:26,079 --> 01:49:31,840
some that will just off gas over time

2474
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:34,000
and uh so so like it seems like the only

2475
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:37,880
way to combat that is completely

2476
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:40,599
limiting light exposure um completely or

2477
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:44,000
or reducing the temperature

2478
01:49:40,599 --> 01:49:45,679
significantly um reducing the oxygen

2479
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,760
contact so that's another thing too you

2480
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:49,840
know if you keep it in a sealed jar

2481
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:52,159
through the uh enzymatic process a lot

2482
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:54,279
of the oxygen is going to be used up and

2483
01:49:52,158 --> 01:49:56,519
so you won't even have like an oxidative

2484
01:49:54,279 --> 01:49:58,479
Factor on the on the turpins after a

2485
01:49:56,520 --> 01:50:01,159
certain amount of time if it was like

2486
01:49:58,479 --> 01:50:03,158
cured properly in the jar um and you

2487
01:50:01,158 --> 01:50:05,759
like just got it to that last point

2488
01:50:03,158 --> 01:50:07,879
where it was still just like that last 1

2489
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:10,280
or 2% of curing and just throw it right

2490
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:13,359
into the freezer at that point and it

2491
01:50:10,279 --> 01:50:16,399
sounds like it would work perfectly um

2492
01:50:13,359 --> 01:50:19,000
so that's awesome I feel like uh you

2493
01:50:16,399 --> 01:50:21,479
know it seems like from what i' I've

2494
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:24,039
gathered so far from our conversation

2495
01:50:21,479 --> 01:50:25,919
some of the stuff that you do is you you

2496
01:50:24,039 --> 01:50:27,519
try new stuff out and you try to

2497
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:29,319
remember what works and what doesn't

2498
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:31,440
work yeah and then you try to say how

2499
01:50:29,319 --> 01:50:35,158
can I apply what works and then how can

2500
01:50:31,439 --> 01:50:38,000
I understand how it works um and I feel

2501
01:50:35,158 --> 01:50:41,238
like those aspects for a grower are so

2502
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:45,399
important because they allow

2503
01:50:41,238 --> 01:50:47,959
for uh a a more thorough understanding

2504
01:50:45,399 --> 01:50:50,920
of the processes of growing and curing

2505
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:54,599
and all the different aspects of of what

2506
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:59,078
um cultivating and producing cannabis in

2507
01:50:54,599 --> 01:51:02,279
tail and um like if you're always trying

2508
01:50:59,078 --> 01:51:06,319
to improve those things and glean the

2509
01:51:02,279 --> 01:51:08,960
best practices out off of them it it

2510
01:51:06,319 --> 01:51:10,238
helps just in in so many different ways

2511
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:12,639
and it it really

2512
01:51:10,238 --> 01:51:15,759
like I feel like the culmination of

2513
01:51:12,639 --> 01:51:20,359
knowledge and and information as as the

2514
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:23,039
uh as a cultivation Journey continues

2515
01:51:20,359 --> 01:51:25,759
can you can like really make these Leaps

2516
01:51:23,039 --> 01:51:28,039
and Bounds in the quality of what's

2517
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:29,599
being produced that I feel like a lot of

2518
01:51:28,039 --> 01:51:31,118
people go how did you do that like how

2519
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:33,960
did you get this good so fast or

2520
01:51:31,118 --> 01:51:36,519
something it's like just

2521
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:39,039
repetition applying what works and

2522
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:41,440
removing what doesn't it's it's like

2523
01:51:39,039 --> 01:51:43,359
there's not I don't I don't mean to

2524
01:51:41,439 --> 01:51:44,879
oversimplify it but there are some

2525
01:51:43,359 --> 01:51:47,880
aspects of it that can be really

2526
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:50,599
simplified down to use what works remove

2527
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:52,359
what doesn't work take time and have

2528
01:51:50,599 --> 01:51:53,039
patience and you'll learn from it and I

2529
01:51:52,359 --> 01:51:57,479
think

2530
01:51:53,039 --> 01:52:00,039
uh change is is good um a lot of Growers

2531
01:51:57,479 --> 01:52:01,718
get stuck in their you know routine and

2532
01:52:00,039 --> 01:52:04,639
how they do things and I think that's

2533
01:52:01,719 --> 01:52:07,960
what works but I think if you're open to

2534
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:10,118
change and open to learning different

2535
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:12,840
ways then you're going to be the best

2536
01:52:10,118 --> 01:52:15,198
grower out there because you're not just

2537
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:17,119
stuck in being stubborn and like oh this

2538
01:52:15,198 --> 01:52:19,678
is right like there's no really right

2539
01:52:17,118 --> 01:52:23,559
and wrong way like you can evolve and

2540
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:25,039
change and get better every time

2541
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:27,039
there there are so many times where

2542
01:52:25,039 --> 01:52:29,078
people have asked me how how did you

2543
01:52:27,039 --> 01:52:30,359
grow that flower like when they've seen

2544
01:52:29,078 --> 01:52:32,118
something on my Instagram or something

2545
01:52:30,359 --> 01:52:33,719
and I'll say I do it this way and

2546
01:52:32,118 --> 01:52:36,479
they'll say oh you know I've never never

2547
01:52:33,719 --> 01:52:39,800
wanted to try Hydroponics because I've

2548
01:52:36,479 --> 01:52:41,559
been growing in living soil for 20 years

2549
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:43,920
and I've been happy with the results I

2550
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:45,800
think I grow like the best cannabis I go

2551
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:47,960
well just because you've been doing

2552
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:49,920
something for 30 years doesn't

2553
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:53,078
necessarily mean that you've been doing

2554
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:55,800
it correctly or that the best um

2555
01:52:53,078 --> 01:52:58,198
that you can't learn anything else uh

2556
01:52:55,800 --> 01:53:01,320
like it it does sometimes that fixed

2557
01:52:58,198 --> 01:53:04,439
mindset does hinder a lot of a lot of

2558
01:53:01,319 --> 01:53:06,039
Growers I feel like um so it's good to

2559
01:53:04,439 --> 01:53:08,960
always be learning and always be trying

2560
01:53:06,039 --> 01:53:11,359
new things and applying those those

2561
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:13,239
Lessons Learned From trying out new

2562
01:53:11,359 --> 01:53:15,679
things yeah and definitely abolutely

2563
01:53:13,238 --> 01:53:17,839
that's great advice Growers need to

2564
01:53:15,679 --> 01:53:20,440
reach out and get help and and not be

2565
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:21,840
prideful and be like oh like this is how

2566
01:53:20,439 --> 01:53:24,279
I learned and this is how I'm sticking

2567
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:27,159
to it like no like ask for help that's

2568
01:53:24,279 --> 01:53:28,719
how you can learn and and get

2569
01:53:27,158 --> 01:53:31,198
better

2570
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:34,158
absolutely absolutely well this has been

2571
01:53:31,198 --> 01:53:35,479
a wonderful conversation and interview

2572
01:53:34,158 --> 01:53:37,759
and those are actually all the main

2573
01:53:35,479 --> 01:53:40,319
questions that I have but I do always

2574
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:42,960
wrap up the podcast with a couple of the

2575
01:53:40,319 --> 01:53:45,078
um kind of ubiquitous questions just

2576
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:49,520
that I feel like every cannabis podcast

2577
01:53:45,078 --> 01:53:51,719
needs to ask um so uh since we didn't

2578
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:54,040
touch on this uh earlier on in the

2579
01:53:51,719 --> 01:53:55,800
podcast what was your first cannabis

2580
01:53:54,039 --> 01:53:58,000
smoking

2581
01:53:55,800 --> 01:54:01,000
experience or your first one that you

2582
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:05,840
remember um my first one was with my

2583
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:07,840
sister uh she gave me a pipe and I

2584
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:10,400
smoked out of it I didn't know to use

2585
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:13,400
like the carb part so I didn't know what

2586
01:54:10,399 --> 01:54:14,960
I was doing okay I just inhaled and you

2587
01:54:13,399 --> 01:54:18,399
know I didn't really feel high I don't

2588
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:20,639
think I did it right but

2589
01:54:18,399 --> 01:54:23,879
uh um I just started smoking with

2590
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:25,719
friends in high school and learning

2591
01:54:23,880 --> 01:54:28,840
different ways to smoke and how to like

2592
01:54:25,719 --> 01:54:31,319
create things to smoke with like I even

2593
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:33,319
smoked out of a pizza by cutting through

2594
01:54:31,319 --> 01:54:34,920
the crust all the way and you pack the

2595
01:54:33,319 --> 01:54:38,039
end of the crust and then you hit the

2596
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:40,000
other side it it's weird but you know

2597
01:54:38,039 --> 01:54:42,840
like fun ways to smoke I've done it out

2598
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:45,000
of a strawberry out of a potato you know

2599
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:47,639
made your own bong out of you know a

2600
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:53,000
water bottle with a

2601
01:54:47,639 --> 01:54:56,560
pencil um but my funniest smoking uh

2602
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:59,479
memory would be uh I was at Sunset

2603
01:54:56,560 --> 01:55:02,159
Cliffs uh a really famous place in San

2604
01:54:59,479 --> 01:55:03,198
Diego for great views so I'd always go

2605
01:55:02,158 --> 01:55:08,638
there to

2606
01:55:03,198 --> 01:55:10,598
smoke um it's by the beach and uh me and

2607
01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:14,078
my friends hot boox my

2608
01:55:10,599 --> 01:55:17,800
car and I get a knock on my window and

2609
01:55:14,078 --> 01:55:19,519
sure enough it's a cop and I'm like [ __ ]

2610
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:21,880
oh no and it's literally like chichin

2611
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:24,520
Chong movie like I had to roll roll down

2612
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:28,319
my window and the smoke just like flew

2613
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:30,560
on his face and he yes and I was just

2614
01:55:28,319 --> 01:55:32,840
like oh no I'm [ __ ] and and he's like

2615
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:35,320
oh what are you guys doing just chilling

2616
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:37,880
and we're like yeah we're just chilling

2617
01:55:35,319 --> 01:55:39,479
and he's like oh it sure smells like it

2618
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:42,960
and then he just said like you guys

2619
01:55:39,479 --> 01:55:45,718
could just stay here get you know let it

2620
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:48,039
wear off wait for an hour and then you

2621
01:55:45,719 --> 01:55:53,078
can go home and I was like oh thank God

2622
01:55:48,039 --> 01:55:54,560
I got a nice one so I was lucky for that

2623
01:55:53,078 --> 01:55:57,519
I've heard I've heard a few stories like

2624
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:59,719
that where they the cops just were like

2625
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:01,360
um just don't leave for an hour or if

2626
01:55:59,719 --> 01:56:03,279
one of you didn't smoke and they're

2627
01:56:01,359 --> 01:56:05,039
sober and can drive get they usually

2628
01:56:03,279 --> 01:56:08,880
nice about it yeah

2629
01:56:05,039 --> 01:56:12,158
um yeah cuz I feel like it's since it is

2630
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:14,118
just like a uh a decriminalized thing

2631
01:56:12,158 --> 01:56:16,319
now especially in California where

2632
01:56:14,118 --> 01:56:19,238
you're only going to get a fine they

2633
01:56:16,319 --> 01:56:21,880
just have to they know like well at the

2634
01:56:19,238 --> 01:56:22,839
time it was illegal when I was when I

2635
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:27,359
was

2636
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:30,440
it was illegal so oh yeah

2637
01:56:27,359 --> 01:56:33,078
definitely yeah well okay well that's

2638
01:56:30,439 --> 01:56:35,359
definitely a a fun a funny story and and

2639
01:56:33,078 --> 01:56:37,238
uh one that I would have also just been

2640
01:56:35,359 --> 01:56:39,000
kind of yeah I would have been [ __ ]

2641
01:56:37,238 --> 01:56:40,559
bricks that would have been quite

2642
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,560
nerve-racking first thing I did was grab

2643
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:43,800
my keys at the ignition I threw it I was

2644
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:47,280
like oh my God I'm not going to get a

2645
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:51,440
DUI for smoking

2646
01:56:47,279 --> 01:56:54,800
so I was petrified but we we used to put

2647
01:56:51,439 --> 01:56:56,319
our keys in the G gas cap oh um if we'd

2648
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:58,360
hot boox our car so we'd like take them

2649
01:56:56,319 --> 01:56:59,639
out pop the gas cap put them in there

2650
01:56:58,359 --> 01:57:02,960
cuz then they're outside of the car

2651
01:56:59,639 --> 01:57:07,118
that's smart and um and I know my one

2652
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:08,480
buddy got uh rolled up on one time and

2653
01:57:07,118 --> 01:57:11,078
same thing they were like hot boxing

2654
01:57:08,479 --> 01:57:13,359
roll down the window smoke poured out

2655
01:57:11,078 --> 01:57:14,799
and the cops like were you guys planning

2656
01:57:13,359 --> 01:57:16,839
on driving and they're like no we were

2657
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:18,159
just using this to smoke in officer and

2658
01:57:16,840 --> 01:57:20,319
he's like well how do I know that show

2659
01:57:18,158 --> 01:57:22,638
me your keys and they're like they're in

2660
01:57:20,319 --> 01:57:25,238
the gas T and and or in the gas cap and

2661
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:26,840
the cop was like oh that's pretty smart

2662
01:57:25,238 --> 01:57:28,879
all right I'll let you off this time and

2663
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:30,679
it's just like I can't believe that that

2664
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:32,440
worked I mean obviously he could have he

2665
01:57:30,679 --> 01:57:34,440
could have made up the story but that

2666
01:57:32,439 --> 01:57:35,879
was the one that I heard every time I

2667
01:57:34,439 --> 01:57:38,519
heard that I was like oh put it put it

2668
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:40,039
in the gas cap did you ever play like

2669
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:41,639
where they called it baseball where you

2670
01:57:40,039 --> 01:57:42,800
had to smoke and then you pass it to

2671
01:57:41,639 --> 01:57:45,279
your friend and you have to go in a

2672
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:47,039
circle and then then you can exhale when

2673
01:57:45,279 --> 01:57:49,719
you get it

2674
01:57:47,039 --> 01:57:51,560
back uh you know I I feel like

2675
01:57:49,719 --> 01:57:53,880
potentially at one at one point when I

2676
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:56,280
was younger we did something like that

2677
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:58,599
um I feel like it was always just like

2678
01:57:56,279 --> 01:58:00,679
puff puff pass and you'd hold it in as

2679
01:57:58,599 --> 01:58:02,599
long as you could anyways because

2680
01:58:00,679 --> 01:58:04,560
usually it was like seven or eight of

2681
01:58:02,599 --> 01:58:06,319
you sharing one joint or one blunt and

2682
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:08,760
it was going to you know you only are

2683
01:58:06,319 --> 01:58:10,639
going to get three maybe four hits off

2684
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:13,280
of it before it's gone so you really

2685
01:58:10,639 --> 01:58:17,480
would try to conserve and and get the

2686
01:58:13,279 --> 01:58:17,479
best effects possible out of it yeah

2687
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:23,000
um but yeah that's that's a those are

2688
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:25,520
funny stories um so just a couple more

2689
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:27,238
of these questions here then uh so who's

2690
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:29,119
or what is your favorite strain of all

2691
01:58:27,238 --> 01:58:31,399
time uh whether it be one that you've

2692
01:58:29,118 --> 01:58:34,719
grown that you really enjoy growing or

2693
01:58:31,399 --> 01:58:37,279
one that um you've smoked that is just

2694
01:58:34,719 --> 01:58:38,679
like your favorite smoke so I really

2695
01:58:37,279 --> 01:58:42,279
love any

2696
01:58:38,679 --> 01:58:44,639
OG uh strains especially the original

2697
01:58:42,279 --> 01:58:48,679
strains back in the day like we spoke

2698
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:52,760
about finding those good oldie strains

2699
01:58:48,679 --> 01:58:58,560
um I love Skywalker OG Paris OG King

2700
01:58:52,760 --> 01:59:01,400
L um I even like uh Blue Dream Sour

2701
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:04,280
Diesel the old

2702
01:59:01,399 --> 01:59:06,719
strains okay um from like 10 years ago

2703
01:59:04,279 --> 01:59:09,158
or so exactly um I wish they would bring

2704
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:12,960
those back to more in the

2705
01:59:09,158 --> 01:59:15,238
industry um and for growing I really

2706
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:17,480
enjoy growing Green Crack it's what I'm

2707
01:59:15,238 --> 01:59:20,799
growing right now it's a resilient

2708
01:59:17,479 --> 01:59:22,919
strain uh it doesn't stress out ever you

2709
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:26,199
can top the crap out of it and it's

2710
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:28,560
still going to grow super tall

2711
01:59:26,198 --> 01:59:32,198
and it drinks a

2712
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:37,119
lot so I don't know I love it it it's

2713
01:59:32,198 --> 01:59:39,919
beautiful uh it's fun to grow it's

2714
01:59:37,118 --> 01:59:41,639
easy I I remember living in uh

2715
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:46,199
Sacramento I was going to Sacramento

2716
01:59:41,639 --> 01:59:49,239
State uh many years ago and um at the

2717
01:59:46,198 --> 01:59:51,000
time medical uh like 215 uh was

2718
01:59:49,238 --> 01:59:52,559
available and so I had my medical card

2719
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:56,760
and there was this dispens that had

2720
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:58,800
green kraak and it was like it seemed

2721
01:59:56,760 --> 02:00:01,960
like there was more tricomes than weed

2722
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:03,599
or than than like actual flower good um

2723
02:00:01,960 --> 02:00:06,039
whenever we would get it and it was it

2724
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:07,599
was crazy and I look back on it now now

2725
02:00:06,039 --> 02:00:09,800
that I've grown for as long as I have

2726
02:00:07,599 --> 02:00:12,119
and I'm almost positive that they were

2727
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:13,840
dumping like all the different keiths

2728
02:00:12,118 --> 02:00:16,598
that they would get from their different

2729
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:18,319
trimmers onto the bags of Green Crack

2730
02:00:16,599 --> 02:00:20,078
because it was the most expensive one

2731
02:00:18,319 --> 02:00:22,719
that they were selling and it was you

2732
02:00:20,078 --> 02:00:25,639
know they were like claiming 40% THC or

2733
02:00:22,719 --> 02:00:28,039
something and this was back in like 2009

2734
02:00:25,639 --> 02:00:30,199
and so I always like think back on that

2735
02:00:28,039 --> 02:00:32,639
and I'm like this is yeah they

2736
02:00:30,198 --> 02:00:34,879
definitely were doing something to it um

2737
02:00:32,639 --> 02:00:36,760
but I really liked it I can say it

2738
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:38,800
worked really well as medicine it's the

2739
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:41,800
first plant that started getting super

2740
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:44,360
Frosty right away before the others so

2741
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:46,039
cool well maybe it does just look like

2742
02:00:44,359 --> 02:00:47,519
that I've never actually seen it grown

2743
02:00:46,039 --> 02:00:51,118
because it was one of those ones that

2744
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:53,960
was uh it wasn't available in the um

2745
02:00:51,118 --> 02:00:55,519
commercial Market when I started can you

2746
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:57,679
see

2747
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:59,119
good or the light is the light too

2748
02:00:57,679 --> 02:01:01,078
bright I know it's a

2749
02:00:59,118 --> 02:01:02,759
little it's a little choppy but the

2750
02:01:01,078 --> 02:01:05,039
overall canopy looks

2751
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:07,039
great yeah the it's the one the tall

2752
02:01:05,039 --> 02:01:09,800
ones in the back are the green crack and

2753
02:01:07,039 --> 02:01:14,118
they're just loving

2754
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:17,719
it well I'll tell anybody to go to

2755
02:01:14,118 --> 02:01:21,000

2759
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:28,480
that you're growing yeah um and I'll

2760
02:01:27,118 --> 02:01:30,319
just tell them to go there to see it

2761
02:01:28,479 --> 02:01:32,359
because it's going to look a lot better

2762
02:01:30,319 --> 02:01:34,920
yeah um especially if you're listening

2763
02:01:32,359 --> 02:01:37,559
on Spotify or apple podcast and you

2764
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:40,000
aren't seeing any of the video recording

2765
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:43,719
but if you are go over to YouTube and uh

2766
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:47,279
listen up there on our premieres um so

2767
02:01:43,719 --> 02:01:49,840
uh just uh one more question actually uh

2768
02:01:47,279 --> 02:01:53,719
so favorite strain currently sounds like

2769
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:55,840
it's green crack um but if you've uh if

2770
02:01:53,719 --> 02:01:58,399
you've kind of gained an appreciation

2771
02:01:55,840 --> 02:02:01,560
for a specific breeder uh since you've

2772
02:01:58,399 --> 02:02:03,439
started growing um who would you

2773
02:02:01,560 --> 02:02:05,679
currently say is your favorite breeder

2774
02:02:03,439 --> 02:02:08,919

02:03:10,118 --> 02:03:15,198
Journey so far um you know I feel like

2799
02:03:13,158 --> 02:03:17,078
uh when people hear that new Growers are

2800
02:03:15,198 --> 02:03:20,638
getting this much success in a hom grow

2801
02:03:17,078 --> 02:03:22,238
and being able to do it with um you know

2802
02:03:20,639 --> 02:03:26,400
Financial restrictions and working

2803
02:03:22,238 --> 02:03:28,359
around those to still make it work um is

2804
02:03:26,399 --> 02:03:30,719
it I feel like it makes a lot more homeg

2805
02:03:28,359 --> 02:03:32,519
Growers hopeful about being able to do

2806
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:34,639
this and find success in it so that they

2807
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:37,320
can either grow their own medicine start

2808
02:03:34,639 --> 02:03:40,279
a new hobby or even use it as a way to

2809
02:03:37,319 --> 02:03:42,118
Pivot into the um the cultivation space

2810
02:03:40,279 --> 02:03:43,599
