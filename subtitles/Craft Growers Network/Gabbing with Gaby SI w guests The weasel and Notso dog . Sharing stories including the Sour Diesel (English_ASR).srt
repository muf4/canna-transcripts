about weed and growing and you know we

91
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,120
ideas the wheels were rolling right then

92
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,319
let's put it that way so the way I

93
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,918
remember it is that

94
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,639
we showed you some indoor weed and you

95
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:39,439
had never seen indoor weed before you

96
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,800
had grown Outdoors like for over a over

97
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:45,839
a decade but that was the first time you

98
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,560
ever saw some like indoor kind bud and I

99
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:51,079
remember you saying you can grow this

100
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,120
inside you were just you were just

101
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:56,279
shocked and amazed yeah and I was

102
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,879
shocked and amazed

103
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:00,918
um but I wasn't like really growing a

104
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,519
lot like you know I'd grow one or two

105
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:06,680
plants outside so for saying to Growing

106
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,639
for 10 years it's kind of it's you know

107
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,720
and you're only doing it a little bit

108
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,079
here and

109
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,199
there but uh so yes you s you put the

110
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,560
the wheels were rolling right there I'm

111
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,240
telling you the wheels were rolling

112
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:23,038
upstairs and I went and I got a book I

113
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,319
all my friends laughed at me I started

114
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:28,478
growing in the closet

115
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:31,639
but you before the closet it was the

116
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:34,000
fish tank remember that I don't remember

117
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,360
okay so let me let me remind you because

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,478
that's what that's what's great about

119
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,639
having multiple people here is that so

120
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:42,719
what I remember is you planted your

121
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:44,240
first seeds in a fish tank okay like you

122
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,280
just put some soil on the bottom of a

123
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,160
fish tank and you put some seeds in

124
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:52,478
there and your cat kept digging it up oh

125
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,520
my God you're

126
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:58,360
right

127
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:58,359
right cuz he thought it was a

128
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,680
lot funny you're right so that that's

129
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,839
what I was telling NATO dog and everyone

130
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,478
like I love having these conversations

131
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,119
with people cuz we all remember

132
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:14,159
different stuff yeah you know and so I

133
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,360
will never forget how mad you were at

134
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:21,639
that cat cuz like you and he he did it

135
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,598
twice not just once he did it twice but

136
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:25,680
the thing is is like I think seeds were

137
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:29,560
hard to come by like good seeds yeah

138
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,360
sure any and and and the cat was the

139
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,280
disrupted them and then I think even

140
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,240
when I put them in the containers or

141
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:38,159
whatever else I started to to learn how

142
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:41,319
to do you know he was still digging them

143
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,120
out you know what I'm saying and the cat

144
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:45,598
had to go eventually I mean in in the

145
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,240
cat's defense there's probably

146
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:51,240
significant overlap between like you

147
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,280
know like an you know an indoor litter

148
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,639
box and a nice you know smoothed out

149
00:06:54,279 --> 00:07:00,159
bunch of soil in the bottom of a of a

150
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,478
fish tank you know yeah

151
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,160
yeah smelling clean the

152
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:11,159
soil definitely yeah so what what I tell

153
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:13,479
people is that you know I inspired you

154
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,919
to plant those seeds and to grow your

155
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:19,318
original uh plants in the closet but

156
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:21,560
after that you were the one that

157
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,720
inspired me to grow so like we we

158
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:28,199
inspired each other like I had you know

159
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,080
seen indoor weed but I had actually at

160
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:34,598
that point never seen it grown

161
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:36,639
okay and and I'll never forget you had

162
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:39,399
that closet that you emptied out it was

163
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,560
like 6 feet by two feet and maybe you

164
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:46,079
put like four four foot fluoresence in

165
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,839
there I did I had eight of them eight of

166
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:51,439
them I I didn't even think it was that

167
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:54,679
many yeah I had four on each end it was

168
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:56,199
like eight feet eight feet by two foot

169
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,038
you're like you're you're right and then

170
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:01,080
I used to have them on strings like we

171
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:04,719
this is you know this is years

172
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:06,719
ago and uh it it was really primitive

173
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,800
now that I think about it it's kind of

174
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,599
embarrassing I I don't think that's I

175
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,240
don't think that's embarrassing dude I

176
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:16,000
mean I think that it it just goes to

177
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,400
show like how rudimentary knowledge was

178
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,439
right is before the internet you

179
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,878
couldn't just hop on I mean a lot of

180
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:25,519
times like in my crew like learning how

181
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,158
to grow weed was like secret knowledge

182
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,198
like you almost had to like become an

183
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:30,598
indentured servant to someone to teach

184
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,800
you

185
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:35,038
what was up you know and when I first

186
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,079
started growing I didn't know anything

187
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:38,199
about

188
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,320
electricity you know I had to like I

189
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,000
plugged in a th000 watt light and the

190
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,959
circuit blew and I had to be like well

191
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,879
why did that happen you know like you

192
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,319
it's like now the stuff that just seems

193
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:51,000
on like easy and basic and is easily

194
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,200
available to discover and you have all

195
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,480
kinds of people to teach you this is

196
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,278
prior to that where you're just you're

197
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,639
just trying to figure out how to maybe

198
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:05,000
you could buy a book or two books but I

199
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:07,039
did buy a book actually you know I think

200
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,320
it was around

201
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:13,439
Halloween all my Staten Island Buddies

202
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,278
besides Gabby at the time we went into

203
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,800
the village for the parade and we were

204
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:21,720
like hey I want to go over to Union

205
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:25,039
Square first and get a book I told them

206
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:28,360
what it was about they laughed at me how

207
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:32,519
to grow marijuana was that Sam by any

208
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:34,919
chance that laugh at you y Sam Kevin

209
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:38,000
Johnny Wheels Jerry Johnny

210
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:40,240
Wheels okay all these guys laughed at me

211
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
soon as that first crop came in they

212
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,759
were all knocking on the door where do

213
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,159
we get this stuff how do we do it and I

214
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:53,519
was like at that point I was like just

215
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:56,719
like not so dog said not so

216
00:09:53,519 --> 00:10:00,278
fast I have

217
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,000
to I'm the one that you guys laughed at

218
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:03,679
you

219
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,200
know but then you know what matters is

220
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:09,359
who laughs last we're all laughing still

221
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,440
yeah so what I wanted to what I wanted

222
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:16,800
to say is um when I met Nick and Cosmic

223
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,880
it was in this group group on Reddit

224
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:22,199
craft uh craft

225
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:26,120
marijuana and the group is basically all

226
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:29,399
about you know showing photos of what

227
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,600
they consider craft flower and sometimes

228
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,320
in the group you know if it's a homeg

229
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,560
grower and the stuff doesn't look

230
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,480
perfect they'll say oh you know we we

231
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:41,278
can't include that cuz it's not craft

232
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:43,000
and if it's um a much bigger Garden you

233
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:44,278
know like hundreds of lights or

234
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,278
something they're like oh that's too big

235
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:50,399
it can't be craft and I made the

236
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:53,320
argument that what makes cannabis craft

237
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,399
is how it's grown if it's grown with

238
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,240
love and the intention to grow the

239
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:59,919
highest quality product um then I

240
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,879
consider that craft

241
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:06,399
I use you and your first Garden as an

242
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:09,120
example because I remember that weed and

243
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,879
and so first of all if you remember weed

244
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,519
30 years later that [ __ ] must have been

245
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:17,480
good right

246
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:22,039
and we could it

247
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:24,560
up like the one in the little closet or

248
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:26,719
Clos no the first stuff you grew in the

249
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,039
kitchen no the

250
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,360
closet okay with under those fluorescent

251
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,599
lights

252
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,159
yeah okay because you could hold those

253
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,159
buds up to the light and see straight

254
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:41,600
through

255
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:45,319
them okay but when you smoked

256
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,720
it that [ __ ] tasted really good and got

257
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:52,399
us super baked and you grew that with

258
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:56,200
love and the intention of producing the

259
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,720
best flower that you could and so I I

260
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,639
think that's the greatest example of

261
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,920
craft cannabis cannabis that's grown

262
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:06,959
with love and and you did that and the

263
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:09,519
proof is that you inspired me Sam Johnny

264
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,439
wheels and all those guys they wanted to

265
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,639
grow too because of what you did like

266
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:18,160
you inspired a tremendous amount of

267
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,079
people and so you know not to kiss ass

268
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:22,198
too much but thank you partner I really

269
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:25,719
appreciate that you know what I remember

270
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:29,679
out of that first round the most that I

271
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:33,440
learned about bugs instantly had a crash

272
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:35,838
course because I took soil from straight

273
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,760
outside

274
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,760
no had no clue cuz you couldn't like you

275
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,439
could go to the store and buy it but I

276
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:45,559
didn't have we didn't know about Ross

277
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,880
yet we didn't even know about him yet

278
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:50,759
exactly we knew about

279
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:52,159
Kmart okay they sold soil could have

280
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:54,519
gone there but I didn't want anybody

281
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:56,600
know that I'm buying soil and you didn't

282
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:59,600
even know that you that it wasn't a good

283
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:03,159
idea to dig up the soil from outside we

284
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:07,399
just we didn't thing I know

285
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:07,399
is battling spidermites

286
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:15,039
from like day not like one month in I'm

287
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,720
battling spidermites and I'm like and I

288
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:19,159
I fought them off but it all right so we

289
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,879
got that round in I think there was

290
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:24,838
maybe one round in that room that's it

291
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:27,838
and then it was moved to the kitchen and

292
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:31,639
that's that's where the RFK seeds went

293
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:35,880
in the tell us about the RFK so June

294
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:38,879
Gabby and I and RFK with with the Future

295
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:42,240
orany Crew That's

296
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:43,278
there and we're searching a lot for bud

297
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,919
this is

298
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:51,439
my perspective of this the of the show

299
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:54,039
that day okay hot really hot nobody can

300
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,519
find any bud who comes back with Bud

301
00:13:54,039 --> 00:14:00,599
Gabby Gabby's got a quarter

302
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:02,720
ounce of looks like Greenhouse F like

303
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:06,360
kind of moist still kind of rolled up

304
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:10,199
looked like a cigar almost but in that

305
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,839
shape you know but like just all right

306
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:16,359
so in that bag there were I think maybe

307
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:18,160
five seeds something or right or maybe

308
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,399
there was seven seeds you got some I got

309
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,799
some I don't remember I didn't get none

310
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,759
you didn't give me any of those I got

311
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:29,359
all I know we fought over him I was like

312
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,360
I'm taking them

313
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:36,880
so I remember I had these three distinct

314
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,959
different

315
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:43,639
skunks that came out of the bag the one

316
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:47,239
two and three first one we say the RFK

317
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:51,000
one was very much like a hash

318
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:55,039
plant the number two was kind of sweet

319
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,799
smelling really nice buds but it it had

320
00:14:55,039 --> 00:15:00,159
a it was skunk plants and then the third

321
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:01,799
one was fruity I don't know we lost that

322
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:03,958
one right away but the other two

323
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:06,159
survived for a few years they were they

324
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:09,758
were nice plants that we had for

325
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:12,360
starting you know like an indoor stuff

326
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,320
again I can still taste that weed today

327
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,120
you know I have a hard time remembering

328
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,040
like conversations and certain events

329
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,440
but I can I remember what that [ __ ]

330
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:25,278
tasted like and it was amazing and the

331
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,040
reason why I just wanted to mention it

332
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:31,879
quickly is you grew that [ __ ] for years

333
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,719
you know and maybe like five years I

334
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:36,198
grew

335
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,040
it yeah so until I got

336
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:40,958
seeds from

337
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:44,759
Amsterdam and and once I came back I

338
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:47,399
ditched it I mean may may you go ahead

339
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:48,879
dude you speak I I just have a question

340
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:51,078
I want to know how you kept plants

341
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:53,559
around for five years back then I'm I'm

342
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:55,719
just curious what your process was

343
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:58,638
learned to clone just like everybody

344
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,040
else I learned to cut clones I was

345
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,519
reading books you know what I'm saying

346
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:04,919
taking every bit of knowledge that I

347
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,198
could get out of a

348
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:11,599
book and then uh I was hoping to get

349
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:14,958
into uh the horiculture system at the

350
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Bronx Community College and I got in but

351
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:19,198
I didn't stay in that I because it was

352
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,600
really hard to commute like two hours

353
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:23,679
from the other side of the city so I cut

354
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,680
that out but so like I just learned and

355
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:28,479
and read everything I could on my

356
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,638
own do you mind like do you remember

357
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,120
like what process you used for cloning

358
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,440
uh when you were first doing it like

359
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,078
were you using any sort of like hormones

360
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,279
for the roots or were you were you you

361
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:42,758
like had you like discovered

362
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:45,198
like Oasis right Roth was already in our

363
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:47,399
life at this time I wanted to bring that

364
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:49,479
up I wanted to get into Ross but I'll

365
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:53,799
quickly answer the question is we used

366
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:56,440
Oasis cubes and dip and grow okay exact

367
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:59,159
right same same thing as

368
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,519
now some technology advances some

369
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:03,318
doesn't too much you know you know I was

370
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,880
not around then so it's it's just I'm

371
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:07,399
just curious It's very fascinating to me

372
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,240
I mean one thing one thing that people

373
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:13,000
should know I think is like these

374
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,480
stories are I mean at least for me and I

375
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,519
I'm pretty sure it's the same for these

376
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,519
guys too is when we started smoking like

377
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:24,318
the two kinds of easily available weed

378
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:26,000
were Brown Mexican and green Mexican and

379
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:28,240
there could be various levels of

380
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,558
compression or various levels of quality

381
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,519
or seed but that was kind of it so

382
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:37,918
stumbling upon better weed or stumbling

383
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:41,599
upon bag seed right like I

384
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,679
think back then the only two places I

385
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:46,279
knew how to get good weed were literally

386
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,320
Grateful Dead shows and if you wanted to

387
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:49,839
go to

388
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:52,119
Amsterdam and most of my friends went to

389
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,519
Amsterdam first because it was the

390
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:56,479
literally the only source of seed that

391
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:59,839
anyone had any idea how to get that

392
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,480
wasn't Mexican because in the 90s right

393
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:03,639
then it was sort of like I don't know

394
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,919
about New York I I know Gabby had some

395
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,880
like you know Jamaican experience but

396
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,600
like in Chicago it was like there wasn't

397
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,880
any Thai or Colombian or panaman like

398
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:17,879
all that stuff was from a different era

399
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:20,960
there was Mexican and so kind bud was

400
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,840
basically anything of any quality that

401
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,000
was better than the

402
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:26,879
Mexican I mean that was pretty like it

403
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,359
was a there was a huge

404
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,159
range of you know so yeah you would go

405
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:35,038
like what he just said you would go

406
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:37,799
before shows and you would scour the lot

407
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:40,079
the parking lot trying to find somebody

408
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:42,279
selling better weed than you had so

409
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:45,359
that's thear of the century right there

410
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:48,079
kind bud was anything that wasn't

411
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:50,918
Mexican yeah 100% that sh It quotes

412
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,759
right there anything that wasn't Mexican

413
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:56,360
I'm like even like Gabby said like it's

414
00:18:52,759 --> 00:19:00,038
homegrown kind bud was like like grown

415
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:01,599
in in the states I want 55 for this a

416
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:03,640
and you hold it up and you can see

417
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:08,599
through it like Gabby said and you would

418
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:11,600
still take it because it was beg

419
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:14,359
for exactly you had to pay to pay out

420
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:16,678
the nose for it yeah and like and this

421
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:18,678
this is this is obviously five or six

422
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:21,080
years before the start of the internet

423
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:23,240
or overgrow or any of like the ways that

424
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:25,480
people could get online and learn there

425
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,599
was maybe two or three or four books and

426
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,720
High Times that was pretty much the

427
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,839
start and if you were blessed enough to

428
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,319
have one friend that was doing it and

429
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:36,439
you could like watch what they were

430
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:39,200
doing and see and get some tips however

431
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:42,519
horrific those tips might be it was sort

432
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,880
of like a entry way to get in because

433
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:47,599
the knowledge level was so

434
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,760
rudimentary you know yeah it really was

435
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:53,199
it took a while press to find any swag

436
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:55,400
anywhere remember that was I was I wish

437
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,880
I had all those seeds from my childhood

438
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,840
oh my God that I used to throw out the

439
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,720
window because used to I used to have to

440
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:04,319
like my oldest daughter um I had to like

441
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,400
go on the internet did you get muted

442
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:09,119
Francis I can't hear you can you hear me

443
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,840
I can hear you I hear you I hear you I

444
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,918
hear everybody I don't hear anything oh

445
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:17,639
everybody can hear me but

446
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,559
you so check out the show

447
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:23,559
later sounds like you guys hear

448
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:26,158
everything but I don't yeah I uh um we

449
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:29,918
used I used to I had to Google what

450
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:32,000
brick looked like right so I brick weed

451
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,799
so I could show like I have an adopted

452
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,400
daughter who's 26 and she grew up in

453
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:39,119
mesino County so she just never seen

454
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,600
it and I had to show her like because

455
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,038
when I was trying to explain to her that

456
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:43,558
like when you got a sack you had to

457
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:45,319
break it up and you had to take out all

458
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:48,038
the stem and all the seed and all the

459
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:49,759
funky bits so you could get a pile that

460
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,079
you could roll into a joint she was like

461
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,319
looking at me all

462
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:55,639
weird yeah because she grew up in the

463
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:58,960
era of like seedless and like everybody

464
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,240
knew what they were doing you know and

465
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,519
that's the point I wanted to make is

466
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,038
that like in the very in the very

467
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:07,480
beginning nobody knew what they were

468
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:09,720
doing even the most rudimentary

469
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,558
knowledge made you seem like a

470
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,919
wizard right and you just had to like I

471
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:17,119
mean I would get like Jorge cervantes's

472
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:19,919
like indoor marijuana gardening or Mel

473
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:24,038
Frank's book and I would just

474
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:26,120
read um this you know like I learned

475
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:28,599
everything I know about electricity just

476
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:31,239
from trying to like figure out how can I

477
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:34,240
plug in this dehumidifier and this

478
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,798
light and not have my circuit pop so

479
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,640
that I just went like like stuff that

480
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:42,960
seems basic now it was not basic then in

481
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:45,360
my opinion everybody had to like start

482
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,120
on this thing and then figure it out and

483
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,558
then figure out a few more things and

484
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,319
then figure out a few more things you

485
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,158
know and so yeah B like he was just

486
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:54,960
saying I'll shut up after this but bag

487
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:57,799
seed found in a sack of weed on the

488
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,159
Grateful Dead lot that came out of kind

489
00:21:57,798 --> 00:22:03,839
bud

490
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:08,200
super valuable yeah not Mexican better

491
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:09,480
weed those seeds that um that we got

492
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,640
from

493
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:16,720
RFK led to getting the chem dog from

494
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,720
Greg event really lucky to get at the

495
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,880
time I mean I don't remember the story

496
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:25,079
like that but that that's again okay we

497
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,000
should maybe just fast forward really

498
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:30,038
far since you're talking about this and

499
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,558
then go back cuz I know Noto dog is only

500
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:32,759
able to stay for a little while and he's

501
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:37,119
going to want to be part of this

502
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:42,679
conversation but the way I remember the

503
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:45,639
story is I gave him the the skunk that I

504
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:47,559
acquired by trading the Francine I never

505
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,159
gave him the RFK as a matter of fact I

506
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:53,558
never even had the RFK I know but I I

507
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:57,320
traded him oh so that's how you got

508
00:22:53,558 --> 00:23:00,319
it I gave it to you we went to the F

509
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:03,720
show yeah fish yeah fish it was fish at

510
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:07,519
the rosand ballroom right okay after

511
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:11,558
that I went up to see him in the

512
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:14,319
Hampton okay and I traded him for a cut

513
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:15,599
with I went up with there with Sam and I

514
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:20,200
we drove

515
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:23,639
up I gave him an RFK cut and the skunk

516
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:27,440
cut or another cut and I got the chem I

517
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:30,559
gave him two cuts and I got the chem I

518
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:33,400
got I'm glad we're talking because the

519
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:35,798
way I remember the story and honestly

520
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,159
you you're probably right okay I'm

521
00:23:35,798 --> 00:23:42,119
always the first to admit that I'm wrong

522
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:44,320
is that I traded him and then I thought

523
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:47,199
I gave you the chem dog but you probably

524
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:48,678
had it already you know because I had I

525
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,519
was already in in

526
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:52,919
California gave me the super skunk see I

527
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:54,839
think I gave you the if that's the case

528
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,679
that I gave you the skunk and the chem

529
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:59,720
dog because here here here's the quick

530
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:03,600
end of the story there was a guy from

531
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:06,319
Virginia that I met at the Warfield and

532
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,719
I smoked the France scene with him and

533
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:12,639
he wanted the

534
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:15,880
Francine okay so I drove the Francine

535
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,360
across country and I traded him for a

536
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,640
few clones including the VA

537
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:23,199
skunk okay it wasn't the super skunk it

538
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:27,559
was the skunk from Virginia and that was

539
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:31,798
the plant that I ended up trading with

540
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:33,278
um k dog for the chem dog I traded him

541
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:35,480
and you know hope maybe we can get him

542
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:37,038
on the show too I I think his memory is

543
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,278
probably as bad as all of ours will have

544
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:40,919
a different story yeah so and I thought

545
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:42,798
you know I gave you the chem dog but

546
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:44,919
maybe I did or I didn't I don't know

547
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:47,879
like you could have traded him the RFK

548
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:49,520
for yeah exactly I you might have

549
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,840
actually gotten it before me because you

550
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:55,119
lived out there and you know like I'm

551
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:57,359
thinking about it what happened was you

552
00:24:55,119 --> 00:25:01,918
were responsible for me making the deal

553
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:04,359
with him for the chem dog CU like I was

554
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:07,120
out east for that brief period of time

555
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:08,839
we went to that fish show but like you

556
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:12,158
you became friends with him more than I

557
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:16,759
did and and but I okay but I I think at

558
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:21,039
the time was like I didn't have a cut

559
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:23,278
available I had it but it was flowering

560
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:25,359
and I was waiting I don't know if I was

561
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:28,798
waiting for them to root or you didn't

562
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:31,278
want them that they weren't rooted

563
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:34,398
or something because I remember you

564
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:37,640
asking me about it and I said I hope

565
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:39,879
he's not mad at me I'm like about the

566
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,038
RFK

567
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:45,840
noem because I didn't have one rooted

568
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:49,440
yeah and I oh yeah I remember yeah you

569
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:52,720
can ask Greg if if he's got one you know

570
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,759
because or I don't remember exactly I

571
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,640
think that's I think that's the way it

572
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:57,640
went down because I remember asking so

573
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:01,679
you did have it that's the deal you had

574
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:03,159
it you had it before I did and I asked

575
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,120
you for it and you weren't able to give

576
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:06,760
me a cut but you encouraged me to make

577
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:10,639
the trade with Greg and and then that's

578
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:11,720
what I did because so I see I've been

579
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,278
taking the credit for giving you the

580
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,200
chem dog for Years bro yeah I mean the

581
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,919
the funny part about weed history like

582
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,038
this really is that most of it starts

583
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,080
with just small groups of friends doing

584
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:26,000
things that nobody has any idea will be

585
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:29,720
important or anyone will care about

586
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,079
later exactly and then a long time later

587
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,038
people start asking for very specific

588
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:37,519
details and people's memories are

589
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:40,119
different you know it's nice to

590
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:43,759
reminisce you know

591
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:45,678
yeah I mean I you know this is this is

592
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:46,759
like way fast forwarding but like when I

593
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:51,720
met

594
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:55,319
Gabby he gave me uh the he gave me a

595
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:59,558
skunk and um and the dog and the chem

596
00:26:55,319 --> 00:27:00,480
dog and uh I thought for years and years

597
00:26:59,558 --> 00:27:02,798
and

598
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,399
years because that's how we talked about

599
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:05,639
it that it was that it was the skunk

600
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:09,639
from

601
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:13,399
Virginia and then like a year or two ago

602
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:15,240
uh I I almost said his name but skunk VA

603
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:17,038
was like no I think that was a different

604
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,038
Super Skunk maybe he would have given

605
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:22,558
him because I think we lost it right

606
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:24,519
before Gabby met me and so you can hear

607
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:26,359
stuff and you can have like you can have

608
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:29,480
stuff that just seems normal because

609
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:32,000
your buddy told it to you yeah right

610
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,880
yeah so there was the skunk from

611
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,119
Virginia okay which got lost before I

612
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,720
met you and then I had gotten seeds from

613
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:43,518
Sensei so those were the the super skunk

614
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:46,240
and I I want to throw something else out

615
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:48,120
there uh for Klo too is that so there's

616
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,839
this we can we we'll fast forward or

617
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:51,879
whatnot but there everyone wants to talk

618
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:55,879
about the sour but the sour I mean

619
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:57,480
essentially the sour story right is that

620
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,360
there was these there was these

621
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:03,079
gentlemen that were that were getting

622
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:05,439
sacks off of weasel right over the

623
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:07,798
course of probably like an entire year

624
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,840
and they would they would anytime they

625
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:13,720
found seeds right they would they would

626
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:16,798
hoard the seeds and it seemed pretty

627
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:19,360
clear for a long time that weasel you

628
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,720
were growing the chem dog and the Vos

629
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:23,519
skunk and then all of a sudden it comes

630
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,319
up that like you're like no I was

631
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:27,720
actually growing the RFK 1 and the RFK 2

632
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:30,158
and I might have had this other super

633
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:33,079
skunk and I had the Vos Gunk and I had

634
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,799
the chem dog and if do you I mean do you

635
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:39,000

from great and I had the sister the

654
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:42,960
sister plant the sister plant whatever

655
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:45,839
he had and I I didn't have that for long

656
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:49,558
I let that go now

657
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:51,079
also at this time I had a

658
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:53,398
room

659
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:55,639
with right after coming back from

660
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:58,719
Amsterdam after the first round so now I

661
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:01,200
make my seeds and stuff now I got a room

662
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,319
of a 100 going of the 10 times the

663
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,440
Northern Lights because what I don't

664
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:08,079
know if this is true or not but what the

665
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,440
story that I was told uh I mean I think

666
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:13,639
I can say their like by by vondo and

667
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:17,558
swell is that they were getting sacks of

668
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:20,200
weed off you all 199 all

669
00:30:17,558 --> 00:30:22,519
1994 and then anytime they got a sack

670
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,840
off you that they found a seed they

671
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:26,399
would just put it in like a little B

672
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:27,439
like everybody did in the 90s or

673
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:30,079
whatever they would just had their

674
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,360
little stack of like seeds I found in

675
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:35,038
hes or whatever right or good nuggets in

676
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:36,839
a film canister whatever yeah little box

677
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:38,119
little this top of the sock drawer

678
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:39,439
everybody did it you know it was like

679
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:41,199
the most standard thing and nobody

680
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,360
labeled them carefully it was just like

681
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:47,519
good weed for later right and they said

682
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:50,119
they gathered like 12 or 18

683
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:52,240
seeds just over the course of a whole

684
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:55,759
year of buying butt off

685
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:59,200
you they did yeah so it wasn't they got

686
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:02,558
more than that okay and fact Mike and I

687
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:06,240
had a conversation not but a text back

688
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:08,519
and forth about like he reminded me and

689
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,240
this is how we were talking like hey you

690
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:12,798
see one side of the story and I see

691
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,480
another side and he had to point out to

692
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:17,798
me and I had to sit there and think

693
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:21,000
about it for like two [ __ ] days and

694
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:23,440
I'm like you know what he's right that's

695
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,960
exactly why we're talking that I have

696
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,278
that moment

697
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,558
nonstop I was like because it was wasn't

698
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:33,919
important to me that I gave him the bag

699
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:36,158
of seeds but it was so important to him

700
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,559
so it would it left an impression on

701
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,519
them I was just like I got [ __ ] 100

702
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:42,678
seeds already and these seeds I don't

703
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:47,480
want to grow because they have

704
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:50,960
Tendencies to be Mite we all struggling

705
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:54,679
at this point of like uh these rfks are

706
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:57,200
causing problems you know like they her

707
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:58,399
me get [ __ ] seeds you don't want to

708
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,080
[ __ ] up the thing is I don't want to

709
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:03,439
[ __ ] up the genetic pool you know I'm

710
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:06,000
reading in the books how bad it is you

711
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,120
know so I was trying to like no I don't

712
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,159
want that for a breeding program you

713
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:13,359
know because that [ __ ] was on my mind

714
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:15,600
about breeding already so uh NATO dog

715
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:18,558
that's the way Bondo tells the story I

716
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:20,519
recently listened to a podcast from AJ

717
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:24,720
and he tells he tells the story a little

718
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:28,399
bit differently and he gives um weasel

719
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:31,000
here more credit and I believe that this

720
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:33,638
story is more accurate but you know then

721
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,798
we'll see what what uh Mike says what he

722
00:32:33,638 --> 00:32:40,479
says is that he was buying the uh the

723
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:43,679
sour diesel from

724
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,079
Mike okay or whatever the you know I

725
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,320
think maybe AJ actually named it that I

726
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:51,240
don't know what Mike was actually

727
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:54,319
selling him at the time but AJ was

728
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:59,399
saying that um Mike was selling him the

729
00:32:54,319 --> 00:33:02,038
sour diesel and that um down the line

730
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:04,359
they found those seeds and that they

731
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:06,200
planted those seeds because Mike

732
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:09,479
wouldn't come off of a

733
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,519
cut you know so I mean that both all

734
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,038
those things could be true I mean really

735
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,519
but the point my point is is that the

736
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:17,798
original Sour

737
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:20,319
Diesel was from Mike and vondo takes

738
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:23,038
credit for it because you know he found

739
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:24,798
the seeds it's like I mean the story

740
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:26,599
that I was told and everybody and you

741
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:28,720
know and obviously we got Klo on so he

742
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:31,278
can he can differentiate is that these

743
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,480
guys were buying seeds or buying buying

744
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:35,398
sacks of weed and they would get sacks

745
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,759
of weed they were getting sacks of weed

746
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:38,599
and that they would pick out they would

747
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:41,038
find some seeds in it because whatever

748
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:43,839
he was whatever Klo was growing had

749
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:46,519
would throw beans on every now and again

750
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:48,038
and then they had this sack of beans

751
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:50,919
that they had collected over the whole

752
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:53,638
course of the year they planted

753
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:56,799
them and I guess they kept a couple that

754
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:58,519
they called diesel one and Diesel 2 and

755
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:01,638
I guess they called it diesel because

756
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:05,960
that was like the slang for really good

757
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:09,440
weed in that area yeah right and so then

758
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:11,878
apparently they took a sack of diesel 2

759
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,800
and they gave it to this dude called

760
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:16,878
Manny right and to differentiate it from

761
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,159
other people's diesel cuz diesel wasn't

762
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:22,719
like a strain diesel at the time was

763
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:26,320
just a name for fire Weed really they

764
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:28,319
wrote Our Diesel and Manny thought that

765
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,280
our had an s in front front of it and

766
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,519
apparently that's where the sour came

767
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:36,440
from so it's kind of like what they told

768
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:38,960
me was the sour came was bag seed from

769
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:42,960
weed that was bag seed from you

770
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:46,119
basically sorry guys still there yeah um

771
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,760
you know like there was a lot you know

772
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:50,800
for at this time there was a lot of sour

773
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,879
being sold to these guys much as I could

774
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:56,320
get rid of you know they want pounds and

775
00:34:53,878 --> 00:34:58,239
some had occasional seed but I don't

776
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,240
think it was that was the they they

777
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:03,439
weren't buying the sour they were

778
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:05,239
buying the number two in RFK is what

779
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,920
they were buying they didn't say they

780
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:09,719
were buying this I think here's the

781
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:12,519
thing now so now I

782
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:13,719
had the super skunk too and they were

783
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:15,400
buying

784
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:18,159
that

785
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:21,559
okay and I crossed the Northern Lights

786
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:24,960
into the Super Skunk and I

787
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:26,559
had some weed half a pound that I didn't

788
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,760
want because it had a whole bunch of

789
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:30,519
seeds in I didn't [ __ ] realize so at

790
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,560
the time you know what I'm saying like

791
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:33,639
[ __ ] what am I going to do with a

792
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:35,880
half a pound of [ __ ] of [ __ ] whole

793
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:39,159
bunch of seeds I took out what I want

794
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:41,960
jar like this right I [ __ ] sold those

795
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:44,920
guys back a qu pound of weed or half

796
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:47,720
pound of weed only people that I could

797
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,599
think got that bag of seeds and they got

798
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:53,159
so many somebody got so many seeds I

799
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:56,079
don't know if it was JJ actually tell

800
00:35:53,159 --> 00:36:00,399
the truth or [ __ ]

801
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:01,318
vond JJ or AJ the sour seeds got out

802
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,599
right

803
00:36:01,318 --> 00:36:08,440
there JJ or AJ oh

804
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,920
JJ he really didn't buy too much he

805
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:13,159
bought weed for me but he didn't he

806
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:16,960
didn't get too much we would meet at the

807
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:20,559
wetlands but I more dealt with JJ

808
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,440
because it was just easier so I think

809
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:24,679
that I think I mean I think it's obvious

810
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,639
when you look at sour that it has skunk

811
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:31,358
Heritage in it right absolutely but it

812
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:33,480
turns out that uh you know you had

813
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:36,639
Neville super skunk and you had the

814
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:39,400
Virginia skunk and you had RFK one and

815
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:42,400
two and may like you had you had a lot

816
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:46,760
more of like you had a plethora of

817
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:49,079
skunk okay at different times but you

818
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:52,079
have to also realize when as soon as I

819
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:55,599
was growing seeds from Amsterdam there

820
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:58,599
was no RFK one and two in the room

821
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:01,680
because I didn't want any it wasn't

822
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:03,280
worthy what's that it wasn't

823
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,960
worthy

824
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,800
yeah like I don't want this anymore I

825
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,720
mean there's there's a bunch of families

826
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,920
of weed that exist only because they had

827
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:17,039
a tendency to Herm and throw accidental

828
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:19,720
bag seed yeah I mean accidental bag seed

829
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:21,920
is like you know like as much history as

830
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:23,838
I've done you trace it back and you

831
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,000
trace it back and then it turns out that

832
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:28,838
it's some accidental bag

833
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,280
seed there's a lot for all the intention

834
00:37:28,838 --> 00:37:36,159
we put into breeding at times accidental

835
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:41,720
bag seed in the 90s is how like 70% of

836
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:44,719
cannabis stories begin in my opinion you

837
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:46,358
know it's it's a big component and we

838
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:48,799
used to think they're so bad and now I

839
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:51,639
think of them as like the biggest gem

840
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,480
ever because they gave us all this stuff

841
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:55,639
on accident that we didn't realize you

842
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:58,159
can make them you know if you want to do

843
00:37:55,639 --> 00:38:00,799
that you know

844
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:02,879
not a problem stress out your plants

845
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,680
yeah I guess depends on what's throwing

846
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,440
the pollen you know if it's an actual

847
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:09,000
Herm or if it's you know nanners from

848
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,599
stress or something yeah because as as

849
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,960
far as I know um you know when you

850
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,240
create your own femin seeds and you're

851
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,039
searching out the plants you know

852
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:18,719
whether it's chemically or what you know

853
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:20,400
it's very similar to you know a plant

854
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:21,639
getting stress out and throwing nanners

855
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,838
I mean one thing that should be

856
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:26,920
mentioned is that I think that like

857
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:28,799
Herms and I I'm maybe like on a on a

858
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,639
tiny percentage on this level but I

859
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,359
think

860
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:33,799
Herms like we hate we a lot of people

861
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:36,559
despise them because they want to grow

862
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:39,480
seedless but that was like a very

863
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:41,078
effective like like breeding method for

864
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,679
cannabis

865
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:45,560
forever right like if a male died if

866
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:47,919
something happened a lot of genetics

867
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:50,599
harmed because it was another way for

868
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,559
the for like to make seed and we only

869
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:54,440
decided like sometime in the 80s or

870
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:56,440
whatever that we wanted

871
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:59,079
seedless so all of a sudden we started

872
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:02,760
trying to breed out this trait that had

873
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:04,200
been in cannabis for God knows how long

874
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,400
could be thousands of years and when

875
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:10,318
everyone grew seated right or you're

876
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,599
importing seeded weed Herms didn't

877
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:14,639
matter because seeds were

878
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:16,880
normal it was only when we started

879
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:19,039
growing seedless for ourselves that we

880
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,920
decided that this is a pain in the

881
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:24,318
ass can we grow can we breed away from I

882
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,400
always would think that the farmer

883
00:39:24,318 --> 00:39:29,159
yanked the male plant out and when he

884
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,119
collectively bread I mean I actually

885
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:35,078
think like for a long time too like the

886
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:39,240
story of American weed right is that all

887
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:41,240
this seated sativa work came in as Bud

888
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:44,159
whether it was Panamanian or Colombian

889
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:47,719
or Mexican or Thai and that like the

890
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:50,679
Afghan stuff came in as hash if you even

891
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:52,919
saw it so in the beginning it was all

892
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:54,440
sativa stuff because that was the only

893
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,960
stuff that you had buds that you were

894
00:39:54,440 --> 00:40:00,119
going to pull seeds out of yeah

895
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,119
you

896
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:06,880
know cuz the rest was turned into hash

897
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:10,000
yeah and just didn't and just wasn't

898
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,640
shipped over you know like what like in

899
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,239
import import weed had free seeds that

900
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:17,639
came along with it I never got any

901
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:19,919
seedless weed from import like sometimes

902
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:23,239
I'd get Mexican that was green and only

903
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:26,880
lightly pressed and it would have few

904
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:27,959
seeds but it still had them yeah you

905
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,240
know

906
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,480
as far as as far as they were concerned

907
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:34,838
they were still getting the money for

908
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:36,760
the weight yeah I just you I mean most

909
00:40:34,838 --> 00:40:38,838
matter that seeds in it I mean most of

910
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,319
my high it's like you know Green wheat

911
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:44,239
green Mexican was the nice stuff like

912
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:47,559
super compressed Brown Mexican was the

913
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:48,679
norm at least for us so that was like I

914
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:51,679
don't even know if I would have been

915
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:53,960
able to get good weed regularly would I

916
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:55,639
have even started growing I think most

917
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,519
of my friends and this is probably true

918
00:40:55,639 --> 00:41:00,118
for Gabby and klopp or whatever you

919
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:02,440
started growing weed because you wanted

920
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:06,160
access to better weed than you could

921
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:08,039
find you're right because like

922
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:11,279
occasionally I would come across some

923
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:13,960
like Florida Citrus you know it was

924
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,920
nice but I couldn't find it all yeah so

925
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:19,480
and I was and when I did pay it I had to

926
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:22,358
pay you know back then like $40 for a

927
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:25,719
quarter like what you're like what now

928
00:41:22,358 --> 00:41:28,639
you pay $40 for a

929
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:31,279
qu hey not dog I I know you have to

930
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:33,719
leave soon and I want to uh get one

931
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,160
topic out before you do so it's it might

932
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:40,239
sound like it's a little off subject but

933
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:42,799
you gave me the nickname Staten Island

934
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:44,799
yeah I I'm I I got to let you know I

935
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,000
don't know if you've heard I'm not very

936
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,839
happy about

937
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,838
that well I mean Staten Island's a

938
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:55,838
[ __ ] [ __ ] hole yeah it really is you

939
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:58,559
it's your [ __ ] hole uh and for I was

940
00:41:55,838 --> 00:42:00,880
born in Brooklyn

941
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:03,440
and I spent my last year hold on wait

942
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:07,039
the first time I ever grew weed was in

943
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,960
Brooklyn okay okay let just let's just

944
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:11,960
rewind a second when you're telling can

945
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,199
of stories because I do a lot right it

946
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,920
becomes difficult to tell the whole

947
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:19,879
truth and nothing but the truth right

948
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:22,280
because not that you want to lie but

949
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:24,760
you're talking essentially about illegal

950
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:27,400
[ __ ] you you might

951
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:30,760
not how do I put this the right way a

952
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:33,358
lot of people do not want to be public

953
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:35,480
figures right you don't they don't want

954
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:37,318
their name out there right you don't

955
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,159
want to out your friend if they want to

956
00:42:37,318 --> 00:42:40,318
have privacy they might have moved on

957
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:42,358
they might have a different job I don't

958
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:43,639
blame you for giving me a nickname but

959
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:46,039
Staten

960
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:47,159
Island you know I is it like the first

961
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:49,480
thing that came to your head at the

962
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:51,239
moment when you were talking I actually

963
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,440
if you really want to blame oh almost

964
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:55,639
said his name if you really want to

965
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:59,000
blame it who I got it from was when

966
00:42:55,639 --> 00:43:01,400
skunk VA was talking to the podcast

967
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,039
about his story and he kept saying my

968
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,400
buddy from Staten Island oh really all

969
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:08,400
right I'm going to blame him and then I

970
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,680
mean we can mutually him and I can

971
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,119
mutually share blame for

972
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:17,279
popularizing you know uh and all that

973
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:19,519
but it's kind of like yeah it's uh it

974
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,800
you know I you're just trying to talk

975
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:23,519
about people and a lot of times like you

976
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,400
know you stop because you're so used to

977
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:28,039
saying someone's name and you want to

978
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,519
protect someone's privacy maybe they

979
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:33,159
don't want their real name out there or

980
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:36,759
whatever you know so they um you know

981
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:39,759
they uh uh so

982
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:42,599
yeah my point in bringing this up my

983
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,800
point in bringing this up is the weasel

984

[ __ ] Joe Joe you know the thing about

998
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,920
the thing about nicknames is that most

999
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,599
of the time you don't pick them yourself

1000
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,680
they are put on You by people in your

1001
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,318
circle or your friend group that's what

1002
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:34,558
I'm talking about bro you put this

1003
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:36,920
nickname on me I thought we were good

1004
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:39,319
now you're calling me like Staten Island

1005
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:41,039
at the time at Le you're not [ __ ] Joe

1006
00:44:39,318 --> 00:44:45,079
at least you're not [ __ ] Joe I mean

1007
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:47,000
Lu AEL a common enough nickname that

1008
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:50,318
people probably don't think it means

1009
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:54,318
[ __ ] Joe but it does it means [ __ ]

1010
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:56,679
Joe right so in my defense Gabby right

1011
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:58,719
when I was starting to talk about you

1012
00:44:56,679 --> 00:45:01,879
you had been retired from growing for

1013
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:05,159
some time you were a legitimate business

1014
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:07,480
store business store owner you know what

1015
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:09,719
I'm saying and like this stuff was long

1016
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,519
in your past and I didn't call you up

1017
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:14,759
and be like do you mind if I out you on

1018
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:17,400
the internet for doing a whole bunch of

1019
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:20,440
like shady ass illegal [ __ ] a long time

1020
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:22,358
ago right and so I just avoided all that

1021
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,000
by like talking about you with a name

1022
00:45:22,358 --> 00:45:25,400
that wasn't traced back to you and now

1023
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,559
that you've decided to say your name and

1024
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:30,838
show your face you're stuck with it but

1025
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:33,040
um you know that's kind of that's kind

1026
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:34,400
of how it went I'm sure for dude I keep

1027
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:37,279
wanting to say his real name I'm sure

1028
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,039
skunk VA thought the same thing when he

1029
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,319
was trying to figure out how to talk

1030
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:44,920
about you five six years ago on the

1031
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:47,960

00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:58,078
okay that people might should know is

1079
00:47:55,239 --> 00:48:01,519
that like back then weed like this was

1080
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:04,519
gold because it was so it was so rare it

1081
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:06,800
was so hard to find it was like I mean

1082
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:10,318
growing up in in Chicago and stuff like

1083
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:12,318
uh he's uh he's pass now but like one of

1084
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:16,199
Gabby and I's mutual friends that I grew

1085
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:17,920
up with um he used Sean he used to like

1086
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:20,358
you could go up to a spot and you could

1087
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,639
offer a d man a hundred bucks and he'd

1088
00:48:20,358 --> 00:48:26,480
be like [ __ ] off and then you could pull

1089
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:28,318
out a small nug of really nice indoor

1090
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,480
and handed to him and he'd be like oh

1091
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:32,358
man you're getting in right because it

1092
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,000
was like currency it was rare it wasn't

1093
00:48:32,358 --> 00:48:39,119
easy to get it wasn't you it wasn't easy

1094
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:41,519
to even if you knew someone right like

1095
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:44,480
uh I'll tell a story from my past this

1096
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:46,239
is how valuable stuff was right I might

1097
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,920
have only been three or four people away

1098
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:51,519
from a grower okay and I knew who they

1099
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:54,240
were but that grower would sell their

1100
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:57,079
herb to a friend and that friend would

1101
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:58,959
go through and like pick out nug by ug

1102
00:48:57,079 --> 00:49:01,280
the nicest half pound that they wanted

1103
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,720
out of that herb and then they'd sell it

1104
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,400
to you're not going to out him here you

1105
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:06,798
did before

1106
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,480
huh you've already outed him on your

1107
00:49:06,798 --> 00:49:11,318
podcast oh man and then and then they

1108
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,960
would pick out they would pick out and

1109
00:49:11,318 --> 00:49:14,599
they the next person to get it would

1110
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,559
pick it out would pick out all the

1111
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:20,318
nicest pieces they wanted for theirs so

1112
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:23,359
when I would get it it would be like you

1113
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:25,599
know a $50 bag of

1114
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:28,558
Smalls but it was still better than

1115
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,798
Mexicans so like every every nug was

1116
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,440
gold didn't matter the size it didn't

1117
00:49:30,798 --> 00:49:35,318
matter where it was from the fact that

1118
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:38,400
you could get it like that you had

1119
00:49:35,318 --> 00:49:40,639
access before it ran out was just part

1120
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,400
of it you know now it's like we're

1121
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:44,039
drowning and it's like a sea of boof

1122
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,280
everywhere we're just drowning in like

1123
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:48,880
enormous waves of weed but like back

1124
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:51,319
then it was like it was currency it was

1125
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,838
hard to get you said it was like gold

1126
00:49:51,318 --> 00:49:56,880
but gold wasn't worth 400 bucks an ounce

1127
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:58,679
back then no it you know like we were

1128
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,119
like it way more than if you had the

1129
00:49:58,679 --> 00:50:03,639
money you could get

1130
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,640
gold where if if you had the money it

1131
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:07,879
was not guaranteed you could get kind

1132
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:09,838
butt I mean part of the reason why like

1133
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:12,519
that story in the beginning of like

1134
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:15,159
Gabby and weasel walking around the lot

1135
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:17,880
looking for her before the show was

1136
00:50:15,159 --> 00:50:20,199
because Dead shows used to be one of the

1137
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,358
most reliable places you could stumble

1138
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:25,078
upon someone selling a sack I got them

1139
00:50:22,358 --> 00:50:27,960
excited now coming from all across the

1140
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:30,039
country Gathering somebody across the

1141
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:32,039
country was growing weed some from

1142
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:34,480
somewhere most people on dead tour were

1143
00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:36,519
pretty poor and they needed a they

1144
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,240
needed a way to get from show to

1145
00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:41,239
show um you know and they needed to make

1146
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:43,039
money somehow and so one of the

1147
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:45,358
traditional ways people would do it is

1148
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:47,880
like they're like oh if I bring x amount

1149
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:50,239
of herb with me I can sell eigh and

1150
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:51,440
quarters and half ounces and fund my

1151
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,439
whole

1152
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,720
run absolutely and so there was people

1153
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:59,720
that were going to do that and you're

1154
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:01,358
walking around the lot trying to find

1155
00:50:59,719 --> 00:51:03,719
someone that was like

1156
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:05,558
that and then once people figured out

1157
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:08,199
who they were that person could sell as

1158
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:10,559
much as they wanted that day because it

1159
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:15,318
was so rare Mike I have a question for

1160
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:17,319
you how much do you think it uh affected

1161
00:51:15,318 --> 00:51:20,358
your decision in letting us stay at your

1162
00:51:17,318 --> 00:51:21,239
house that couple of days that we had

1163
00:51:20,358 --> 00:51:23,960
good

1164
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:29,358
weed we had no money but we had we had

1165
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:29,358
good weed right it was like changing you

1166
00:51:29,639 --> 00:51:38,318
know you know like it put me back on

1167
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:43,280
the on on the on the deadlock I me just

1168
00:51:38,318 --> 00:51:46,239
just to tie it in right chem dog okay he

1169
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:51,000
the whole chem story starts with him

1170
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:52,639
buying a sack of weed at a dead lot in

1171
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:57,599
Indiana in

1172
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:58,960
91 and that same summer Gabby Colorado

1173
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:02,680
oh no it was IND theana was it was at

1174
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:05,318
Deer Creek and Gabby and that same 91

1175
00:52:02,679 --> 00:52:08,838
tour that same summer Gabby and weasel

1176
00:52:05,318 --> 00:52:10,719
walking around you know the RFK which is

1177
00:52:08,838 --> 00:52:13,400
obviously in you know on the East Coast

1178
00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:16,239
or whatnot you know uh RFK Stadium

1179
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:18,519
looking for weed um and they found a

1180
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:20,078
sack of weed that bag seed came out of

1181
00:52:18,519 --> 00:52:23,239
and that was like on the same summer

1182
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:25,760
tour so that was like that was the

1183
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:28,078
standard was people from all over

1184
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,400
America would go go on dead tour and you

1185
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:33,000
could bump into Florida people Colorado

1186
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:35,280
people California people Montana people

1187
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,159
New York people and it was sort of like

1188
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,000
a

1189
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:39,920
cross-section and it was also anonymous

1190
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,480
because you didn't know if you were

1191
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:46,680
going to see that person ever again you

1192
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:49,400
know um but in all in all honesty I mean

1193
00:52:46,679 --> 00:52:51,639
like just just real quick weasel like if

1194
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:53,960
you could have bought seeds in

1195
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:58,159
America would you would have flown to

1196
00:52:53,960 --> 00:53:02,240
Amsterdam like I literally left the

1197
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:04,039
country to go to Holland you know so I

1198
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:08,118
could find seeds I might have gone

1199
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:10,159
anyway because like for the culture I

1200
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:11,280
like to travel a lot and I've been to a

1201
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:15,558
lot of

1202
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:19,040
places so yeah at that time I already

1203
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:20,760
been to Europe in my life a couple times

1204
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:22,679
so but you wouldn't have brought seed

1205
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:27,520
backs you wouldn't you wouldn't have

1206
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:29,838
taped the seeds to your package no okay

1207
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:33,079
you told that story on on another

1208
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:35,880
podcast you taped the SC to your podcast

1209
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:38,000
package yeah I mean package that's the

1210
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,200
thing is that that was where you know I

1211
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,838
mean when when Gabby and I first became

1212
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:44,798
friends it's like we used to pour over

1213
00:53:42,838 --> 00:53:48,119
those old

1214
00:53:44,798 --> 00:53:49,599
cataloges of Neville seed bank and we

1215
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:51,000
look at them too I would with him I

1216
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,960
would look at them we'd look like look

1217
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,559
at that look at that you me you'd

1218
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:58,318
memorize garli yeah you'd have different

1219
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,160
favorites you'd have different dreams

1220
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:02,798
about going over there and which ones

1221
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:04,519
you'd grab when you were there because

1222
00:54:02,798 --> 00:54:06,358
there was just no access so you were

1223
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:07,880
just trying to you're just trying to

1224
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:10,119
figure out a way that you could get some

1225
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:11,559
and I only knew how to get it in Holland

1226
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:14,160
and Dead

1227
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:17,280
shows that was pretty much it Dead shows

1228
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:20,279
were like the Open Air

1229
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:23,319
Market but see

1230
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:26,079
Holland like we like be before Holland

1231
00:54:23,318 --> 00:54:28,358
though like say like like seven or eight

1232
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:30,318
years prior to that though I think it

1233
00:54:28,358 --> 00:54:34,558
was actually 88 or

1234
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:37,400
89 uh there was Operation green Merchant

1235
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:39,280
yep and there was a bunch of Growers out

1236
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:42,440
in California in fact all the top

1237
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:45,960
Growers were out in California growing

1238
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:47,599
these skunks and stuff and when that

1239
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,559
went

1240
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:55,400
down uh they all went over to Amsterdam

1241
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:57,920
and setup business so there were strains

1242
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:00,440
here in this country that were being

1243
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,920
nicely picked over you know they weren't

1244
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:05,079
being distributed it wasn't as like not

1245
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:08,400
just anybody could go and get them like

1246
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:10,359
I said before the internet it was

1247
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,559
literally like the best way to find

1248
00:55:10,358 --> 00:55:14,598
better weed I would say probably the

1249
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:16,440
best way in America to find better weed

1250
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:19,599
at that point was to go to a Grateful

1251
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:22,000
Dead show and wander around and make

1252
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:25,838
friends and hope somebody you backed

1253
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,559
into Gabby just left but like when I

1254
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:29,960
first met him I'll tell him I'll tell a

1255
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:32,480
story real quick before I got to go

1256
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:35,358
there was this weed uh that he called

1257
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:38,280
the Big Sir holy weed and there was

1258
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:42,639
these guys on dead tour that sold Big

1259
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:45,599
Sir holy skunk and Big Sir holy Haze

1260
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:47,879
right and Gabby said the smell was so

1261
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:50,400
distinctive that like if you walked by

1262
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:52,798
someone in the lot that had Big Sir holy

1263
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,599
in their fanny pack not only could you

1264
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:56,880
tell that they had good weed but you

1265
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:58,599
were pretty sure it was the big Are Holy

1266
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,760
because of how it smelled and there was

1267
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:02,760
a and Gabby would always say they were

1268
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:04,400
connected they know they know somebody

1269
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,640
from the dead

1270
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:09,000
family but yeah that was kind of like

1271
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:11,759
that that was I used to get that weed

1272
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,480
from him and it was in little plastic

1273
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:18,280
not plastic wax paper bags you remember

1274
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:21,440
that yeah they gave them to me in wax

1275
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:23,960
paper bags like like sandwich bags for

1276
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,599
lunches yeah yeah that's what it was

1277
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:27,798
yeah sandwich bag that's why it smelled

1278
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:30,318
so bad

1279
00:56:27,798 --> 00:56:32,000

permission it's just he doesn't he you

1320
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:22,960
know he was such a huge influence to so

1321
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:26,639
many

1322
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:31,000
people remember what naso dog said

1323
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:35,118
a lot of people don't want the publicity

1324
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:38,000
they don't want hammer on them and he's

1325
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:41,280
always been that way if you can remember

1326
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:44,400
how freaky it was like yeah

1327
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:46,760
going are the cops are the cops you know

1328
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,639
and that was because of you know maybe

1329
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:51,960
green operation green Merchant yeah you

1330
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:53,960
know like they came to his store you

1331
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:56,159
know they I don't nothing happened but

1332
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:58,000
you know like some of his friends in

1333
00:58:56,159 --> 00:59:00,920
operation business there they they got

1334
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,039
arrested at that time for thr

1335
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:04,720
equipment I think that's why I want him

1336
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:07,119
to tell his story is

1337
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:10,358
because he had that history of going

1338
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:14,079
through operation green Merchant and he

1339
00:59:10,358 --> 00:59:15,960
survived you know he continued you know

1340
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:19,000
for many years

1341
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:20,519
afterwards and he sold

1342
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,199
me

1343
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:26,199
um he sold me what's up buddy he sold me

1344
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:28,118
my first light

1345
00:59:26,199 --> 00:59:31,038
that that like you know like when when I

1346
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:34,599
tell so one of the things Mike I want to

1347
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:39,599
tell you the purpose of me doing this

1348
00:59:34,599 --> 00:59:43,039
podcast is that I want to document my

1349
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:45,920
story more for me than for anybody else

1350
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:47,559
because I'm forgetting it and you see

1351
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,680
like when we talk we remind each other

1352
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:54,720
of stuff and you know the stuff happen

1353
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:56,838
so long ago so I want to record this

1354
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:58,838
yeah I think I do

1355
00:59:56,838 --> 01:00:03,078
I mean I mean I don't know if you call

1356
00:59:58,838 --> 01:00:05,199
it Kidd like you know we all forget but

1357
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:08,039
listen my memory is not what it used to

1358
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:10,399
be for sure nobody's is you nobody's is

1359
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:13,319
but it's nice that you you want

1360
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:16,039
everybody to know and then you ask

1361
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:20,759
people about it to help

1362
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:22,559
everybody like it it it jogs my memory

1363
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:24,240
when you ask me questions because I

1364
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:27,000
wouldn't think about it all the time

1365
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:29,399
either like and be like yeah that's 30

1366
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,880
years ago and I'm like and you have to

1367
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:33,318
sit and you think about it but if you

1368
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:35,680
think about this stuff it'll come back

1369
01:00:33,318 --> 01:00:40,480
this like what like that's why I'm doing

1370
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:42,759
this Mike said about the bag seat

1371
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:45,639
because it took me a while like we did

1372
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:48,400
we came out of Ross's store and I handed

1373
01:00:45,639 --> 01:00:51,519
him those seats and it took and I can

1374
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:53,559
remember now you know just think about

1375
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:57,639
it yeah I mean

1376
01:00:53,559 --> 01:01:00,119
so what I was saying is is part of my

1377
01:00:57,639 --> 01:01:03,000
story you know East Coast Hydroponics

1378
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:05,838
that's part of my story and he's our

1379
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:08,239
friend you know by the way he doesn't

1380
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:11,719
have to be on screen he can just do

1381
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:14,399
audio you know like and you know as far

1382
01:01:11,719 --> 01:01:18,480
as I'm concerned he's a pretty famous

1383
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:20,440
dude you know like he might want to like

1384
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,559
you know try to be private but it's

1385
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:25,480
already too late for that too many

1386
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:28,480
people already know him you know and

1387
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:31,000
people know yeah and you

1388
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:33,480
know at the time you think oh my God

1389
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,838
this guy's such a pain in the ass like

1390
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:39,119
you know he would leave a sign on his

1391
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:40,759
door saying be back in 15 minutes and

1392
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:43,720
you'd come back in an hour and he still

1393
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:47,039
wasn't there and you know going to the

1394
01:01:43,719 --> 01:01:50,038
grow store back then on Staten Island

1395
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:52,720
was shady as [ __ ] right so like we

1396
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:57,000
didn't want to have to like go there you

1397
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:58,719
know nine times you know to get our [ __ ]

1398
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,400
and meanwhile he was hanging out in the

1399
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:03,598
back with somebody else smoking weed the

1400
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:05,278
entire time while he has his sign saying

1401
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:08,838
back in 15

1402
01:02:05,278 --> 01:02:10,920
minutes but like now I mean I honestly

1403
01:02:08,838 --> 01:02:13,000
love the guy you back then it was like

1404
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:15,200
[ __ ] this guy and remember he didn't

1405
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,798
even go by his real name he went by

1406
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:19,199
Bill you know like he was so paranoid

1407
01:02:17,798 --> 01:02:21,199
that anybody would know his name was

1408
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:23,639
Ross that he would call himself

1409
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:26,199
bill or is Bill his [ __ ] name do I

1410
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:29,318
have it backwards I don't even know it

1411
01:02:26,199 --> 01:02:31,278
took me years I'm I'm I probably would

1412
01:02:29,318 --> 01:02:35,318
say 10 years before I knew his first

1413
01:02:31,278 --> 01:02:38,760
name and the reason is because he used

1414
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:40,358
my my kids grandparents the father was a

1415
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,920
lawyer and he used him as a lawyer and

1416
01:02:40,358 --> 01:02:44,400
so I was referring to him in a

1417
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:47,480
conversation and

1418
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:50,798
and my kid's grandfather corrected me on

1419
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:52,199
his name I was like who so are you

1420
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:55,679
saying that I don't know what his real

1421
01:02:52,199 --> 01:02:59,798
name is or is there no comment right you

1422
01:02:55,679 --> 01:03:01,558
do but yeah you know I I think he's uh

1423
01:02:59,798 --> 01:03:06,278
he's an interesting part of both of our

1424
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:08,559
stories right yeah you know so he's very

1425
01:03:06,278 --> 01:03:11,920
interesting character I mean I remember

1426
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:14,680
getting like Oasis over there and we

1427
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,599
would buy all the down toe guos and [ __ ]

1428
01:03:14,679 --> 01:03:17,719
from

1429
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:20,760
him you know

1430
01:03:17,719 --> 01:03:23,000
so at that time when he had that small

1431
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:25,319
shop we were into the guos like

1432
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,440
everything we were doing was it was back

1433
01:03:25,318 --> 01:03:30,119

1435
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:36,760
crop powder and

1436
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:40,240
promix was that was state of the

1437
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:43,039
art so getting those bals of promix

1438
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:44,199
getting those bals of promix was shady

1439
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:46,799
as

1440
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:49,759
[ __ ] you know and and that's why it was

1441
01:03:46,798 --> 01:03:52,759
like and he's not here you know like we

1442
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:54,839

Bell 3.3 cubic feet you know those bells

1454
01:04:20,358 --> 01:04:25,400
were giant yeah you know you got to like

1455
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,640
have a little vegetable garden or

1456
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:28,720
something out front where you're just

1457
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:31,358
like oh no this is for my

1458
01:04:28,719 --> 01:04:34,278
vegetables at at Mike's first place

1459
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:35,960
there was no grass there was no Earth I

1460
01:04:34,278 --> 01:04:38,318
don't he must have like he must have

1461
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:40,880
like gone like to a neighboring Woods to

1462
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:42,079
go get the soil that he grew in you know

1463
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:45,278
because it was

1464
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:48,559
C it did

1465
01:04:45,278 --> 01:04:53,199
actually Pond remember the

1466
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:56,440
pond went over to Jack's Pond and got it

1467
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:59,759
and uh brought it back along with uh

1468
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:01,599
spiderm for your first crowd everything

1469
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,799
every other bug too probably it was I

1470
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:05,200
think they were

1471
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:08,318
wor hey like I said I still remember

1472
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:11,679
that weed as being the best you know

1473
01:05:08,318 --> 01:05:13,119
like no no one on Staten Island at that

1474
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:15,879
point had better

1475
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:19,880
weed right you

1476
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:22,798
know I think I didn't it was different

1477
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:25,960
like I like it was definitely different

1478
01:05:22,798 --> 01:05:27,199
it was I would think like the seeds were

1479
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:29,519
probably

1480
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:33,278
highgrade commercial

1481
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:35,480
Mexican that's what I think it was but

1482
01:05:33,278 --> 01:05:38,199
it was kept short and flowered really

1483
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:41,199
you know quick and then but when we got

1484
01:05:38,199 --> 01:05:45,719
the RFK se's that was the best weed on

1485
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:47,439
the island by far at the time like I

1486
01:05:45,719 --> 01:05:52,278
couldn't find anything better I was

1487
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:54,400
happy well um yeah the RFK weed that was

1488
01:05:52,278 --> 01:05:58,239
super nice I remember that weed still

1489
01:05:54,400 --> 01:06:00,559
too and it sounds like like you were uh

1490
01:05:58,239 --> 01:06:04,000
you're proud of it you you bring it up a

1491
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:07,200
lot I mean you know it's like the start

1492
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:11,039
like an indoor like doing really indoor

1493
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:14,159
and it you know like changed my life

1494
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:16,119
like completely like I realized not only

1495
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:18,480
you you can make a living at this this

1496
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:20,519
was when I was like wow like that was

1497
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:22,240
the first time you realized that that it

1498
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:24,639
was more than just personal smoke I

1499
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:27,959
don't have to go out there and swing a

1500
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:30,639
hammer anymore if I don't wna I don't

1501
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:33,079
have to go in the cold

1502
01:06:30,639 --> 01:06:36,118
freeze when when was the last time you

1503
01:06:33,079 --> 01:06:37,839
you grew a a crop this summer I did the

1504
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:39,640
sour and I did the

1505
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:42,078
chem

1506
01:06:39,639 --> 01:06:43,798
91 nice I should let you guys ask some

1507
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:46,680
questions since me and NATO dog

1508
01:06:43,798 --> 01:06:48,400
dominated the dominated the show one is

1509
01:06:46,679 --> 01:06:50,358
that the Chim that you guys remember

1510
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:54,200
from uh like the early

1511
01:06:50,358 --> 01:06:57,558
90s that's that's the what I did this

1512
01:06:54,199 --> 01:07:00,358
summer the chem 91 is the original chem

1513
01:06:57,559 --> 01:07:02,720
dog from the 91 it's the same cut that's

1514
01:07:00,358 --> 01:07:05,960
been going down the line they call it

1515
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:09,679
the 91 now to differentiate it from the

1516
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:12,199
chem D and the chem sis and the chem 4

1517
01:07:09,679 --> 01:07:14,679
you know so but back then it was just

1518
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:17,159
the chem dog and I actually just called

1519
01:07:14,679 --> 01:07:20,798
it the dog because we grew it organic

1520
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:22,920
and I refused to call the chem dog cam

1521
01:07:20,798 --> 01:07:26,639
oh because I was growing organic at the

1522
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:30,838
time okay I I

1523
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:33,798
it actually probably indor does better

1524
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:37,119
with Kim with Sals you know what I'm

1525
01:07:33,798 --> 01:07:39,838
saying yeah that's I think why he was he

1526
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:42,240
he uh he called it that because he

1527
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:44,199
couldn't do anything with it you know

1528
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:47,519
like he was struggling on him and to get

1529
01:07:44,199 --> 01:07:50,399
it to grow correctly he hit it with

1530
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:54,000
Miracle Grow that's what he told me if I

1531
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:56,720
can remember but story I'm sure you know

1532
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,719
oh yeah no no no so I I'll tell the

1533
01:07:56,719 --> 01:08:01,000
story too since it's a part of both of

1534
01:07:58,719 --> 01:08:03,838
our stories when I went and picked up

1535
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,239
the cut of the chem dog he was growing

1536
01:08:03,838 --> 01:08:08,159
it

1537
01:08:05,239 --> 01:08:11,558
hydroponically um in I'll never forget

1538
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:16,639
it was called the Emily's garden and it

1539
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:18,759
was like a 2X two tray that had a wick

1540
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,798
that went to the reservoir

1541
01:08:18,759 --> 01:08:25,560
below and that was the first time I ever

1542
01:08:21,798 --> 01:08:29,798
saw a hydroponic system was with him and

1543
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:32,199
he insisted that um you had to grow the

1544
01:08:29,798 --> 01:08:35,439
chem dog with

1545
01:08:32,198 --> 01:08:37,079
Hydroponics because it just wouldn't

1546
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:40,278
make it if you didn't it wouldn't

1547
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:42,719
survive it just such a hard plant to

1548
01:08:40,279 --> 01:08:45,159
feed and so that was the first time I

1549
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:47,359
ever saw a hydroponic system I refused

1550
01:08:45,158 --> 01:08:50,039
to accept it when he said that you can't

1551
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:52,838
grow the chem dog organic and I just

1552
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:56,359
called it the dog and I tried to grow it

1553
01:08:52,838 --> 01:08:58,679
organic and I did get

1554
01:08:56,359 --> 01:09:01,480
flower that people thought was the best

1555
01:08:58,679 --> 01:09:03,798
[ __ ] they had ever seen in their life

1556
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:07,119
but that was because of the

1557
01:09:03,798 --> 01:09:09,560
genetic okay that genetic was so awesome

1558
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:12,759
even if you didn't do it right you got

1559
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:15,839
something really good okay now when I

1560
01:09:12,759 --> 01:09:18,640
learned about using mineral salts and

1561
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:23,278
became open to it and then grew the chem

1562
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:26,440
dog then it was like oh my God now I

1563
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:28,880
really got to see what the potential of

1564
01:09:26,439 --> 01:09:32,039
this plant was what what the genetic

1565
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:34,319
potential of this plant was um it was a

1566
01:09:32,039 --> 01:09:36,838
very difficult plant to feed even with

1567
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:38,359
Hydroponics you know it didn't have much

1568
01:09:36,838 --> 01:09:41,719
foliage on it or doesn't have much

1569
01:09:38,359 --> 01:09:44,319
foliage on it and by by difficult to

1570
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:46,480
feed with Hydroponics with the knowledge

1571
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:50,000
and products that we had at the

1572
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:52,399
time you know so the plant would want to

1573
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,479
yellow and lose all of its leaves before

1574
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:57,198
it finished you know and if it didn't

1575
01:09:55,479 --> 01:10:01,399
finish it wouldn't have anywhere near

1576
01:09:57,198 --> 01:10:04,678
the to Pro Prof to profile it would have

1577
01:10:01,399 --> 01:10:06,839
as when it did so when we fed it with

1578
01:10:04,679 --> 01:10:10,319
hydroponic nutrients it would stay

1579
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:14,560
Greener longer and the plant could

1580
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:17,840
finish and you know to me it's night and

1581
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:21,199
day like and so now I don't object to

1582
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:23,039
calling it the chem dog anymore because

1583
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:26,158
on top of everything it's it's something

1584
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:28,880
that encouraged me to be open to Growing

1585
01:10:26,158 --> 01:10:30,319
With mineral salts where you know there

1586
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:33,600
was a period of time where I was like

1587
01:10:30,319 --> 01:10:39,000
nope you know it's got to be organic

1588
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:42,079
so I find the plant uh is very hard to

1589
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:44,640
feed also me got to have the pH just

1590
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:48,439
right but like I do it in soil outside

1591
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:53,360
and if I just go

1592
01:10:48,439 --> 01:10:56,158
with straight nitrogen and bat guano and

1593
01:10:53,359 --> 01:10:58,719
and you know the mixes that they have

1594
01:10:56,158 --> 01:11:01,399
you know in the

1595
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:04,239
bags uh the plant will struggle to get

1596
01:11:01,399 --> 01:11:07,238
the proper nutrients out of even out of

1597
01:11:04,238 --> 01:11:10,039
the ground even if I've enriched it and

1598
01:11:07,238 --> 01:11:12,519
everything but once I add a few salts to

1599
01:11:10,039 --> 01:11:14,158
the ground outside I never had a problem

1600
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:16,760
with this plant so you're growing them

1601
01:11:14,158 --> 01:11:18,359
actually in the ground in the ground

1602
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:21,880
always I don't put them in containers

1603
01:11:18,359 --> 01:11:26,759
anymore it's a seasonal crop my soil is

1604
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:29,679
beautiful you know and I can go away

1605
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:31,679
which is the main key not worried have a

1606
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:34,520
sprinkler come on once in a

1607
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:36,279
while I'm going to Italy I see you in

1608
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:40,520
two

1609
01:11:36,279 --> 01:11:43,158
weeks I come back and everything looks

1610
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:44,920
good you got a trim that's it you know

1611
01:11:43,158 --> 01:11:47,000
what I'm saying cut things

maybe like not even once a year but just

1624

you like his dad was a pastor right y or

1632
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:47,800
a priest a and he had some like conflict

1633
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:51,560
within him about

1634
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:56,000
growing okay because you know it wasn't

1635
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:58,480
the holy thing to do right and so

1636
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,760
so I'll never forget I want to tell a

1637
01:12:58,479 --> 01:13:02,759
story about Keith and if you remember

1638
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:07,719
any stories and I say this with all I

1639
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:09,280
love the guy immensely right but so you

1640
01:13:07,719 --> 01:13:12,920
know sometimes I would want to buy weed

1641
01:13:09,279 --> 01:13:15,439
from him and he would sell me these bags

1642
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:20,399
they'd be really small like like really

1643
01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:21,919
small buds and one day I go yeah he was

1644
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:23,679
growing but you know and I thought

1645
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,920
that's just the way it was turning out

1646
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:28,960
just small bugs right

1647
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:30,880
so one day I go to his house and we go

1648
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:33,639
to his basement to

1649
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:38,039

remember you know like people want to

1700
01:15:53,119 --> 01:15:58,399

1701
01:15:56,600 --> 01:16:01,719
Keith was

1702
01:15:58,399 --> 01:16:04,079
amazing and last

1703
01:16:01,719 --> 01:16:06,560
round

1704
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:08,119
because I went over the house one time

1705
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:10,679
and he yelled at me because I went over

1706
01:16:08,119 --> 01:16:14,319
early in the morning and I'm an early

1707
01:16:10,679 --> 01:16:15,399
bird he sleeps to 12 but um this is

1708
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:19,079
where

1709
01:16:15,399 --> 01:16:21,879
like the first batch of seeds that I

1710
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:24,000
did uh was with Keith when I came back

1711
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:26,159
from Amsterdam we did 100 seeds in a

1712
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:29,960
room and his

1713
01:16:26,158 --> 01:16:32,399
apartment it was a pretty interesting uh

1714
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:34,800
Journey with Keith and occasionally I

1715
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:36,679
see you know him and Ross and I we used

1716
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,840
to go to a music festival all the time

1717
01:16:36,679 --> 01:16:40,760
but that hasn't happened the last two

1718
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:43,400
years yeah the best story is the one

1719
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:45,039
that Gabby told definitely I can't I

1720
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:47,920
feel like we've kind of uh we've kind of

1721
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:49,399
played around with u the story with sour

1722
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:52,560
diesel we we told you know a little bits

1723
01:16:49,399 --> 01:16:55,238
and pieces but um I I personally don't

1724
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:57,840
feel like I have a clear view of you

1725
01:16:55,238 --> 01:17:01,479
know the actual creation of of the of

1726
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:05,319
the sour diesel is that um it was with

1727
01:17:01,479 --> 01:17:08,599
super skunk and with chem dog right yeah

1728
01:17:05,319 --> 01:17:11,119
but it the chem dog had already been

1729
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:13,840
bred to the Northern Lights that's where

1730
01:17:11,119 --> 01:17:15,559
that round the seeds with teeth I think

1731
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:18,199
you're muted Gabby can you guys hear me

1732
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:20,000
now now I can I was running my water

1733
01:17:18,198 --> 01:17:23,359
bottle so people have been saying it's

1734
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:25,760
the chem dog crossed with the um super

1735
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:28,719
skunk that's not true

1736
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:30,800
it okay to a certain extent it is but

1737
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:32,920
this so let's play this out so that's

1738
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:35,840
where so when I I've come back from

1739
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:39,440
Amsterdam and I have the

1740
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:41,279
seeds so you know I'm Growing Seeds and

1741
01:17:39,439 --> 01:17:43,279
and I like the Northern Lights through

1742
01:17:41,279 --> 01:17:47,399
the structure and everything the size of

1743
01:17:43,279 --> 01:17:49,198
the colar you know and uh I like the

1744
01:17:47,399 --> 01:17:53,000
taste and

1745
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:55,638
everything so I took a male of that

1746
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:58,840
plant crossed it with the chem this room

1747
01:17:55,639 --> 01:18:01,840
that I did with Keith is the 100

1748
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:05,319
seeds Okay so it's the first batch from

1749
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:09,000
that batch I tell Keith oh I like this

1750
01:18:05,319 --> 01:18:13,599
seed right here and we put the number

1751
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:16,760
one we put it into the cup we grew it 99

1752
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:18,480
plants okay that's it most of them got

1753
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:20,920
weeded out because they were males we

1754
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:26,198
were looking

1755
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:29,399
uh kept kept the female but out of those

1756
01:18:26,198 --> 01:18:31,158
other seeds that I had out of 100 seeds

1757
01:18:29,399 --> 01:18:36,679
I grew another

1758
01:18:31,158 --> 01:18:39,158
batch and I got a male from that same

1759
01:18:36,679 --> 01:18:41,600
bad and I crossed it with the super

1760
01:18:39,158 --> 01:18:44,559
skunk so that's chem

1761
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:48,120
lights times or chem times Northern

1762
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:50,880
Lights times stup skunk and that's where

1763
01:18:48,119 --> 01:18:53,679
that bag of seeds that eventually got

1764
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:56,359
out that I said earlier oh yeah it was a

1765
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:59,560

01:19:14,479 --> 01:19:19,839
lights Northern number one and thatn

1772
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:23,400
lights that you grew out it wasn't like

1773
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:25,239
um you know from got what I got from

1774
01:19:23,399 --> 01:19:27,479
sensey seed in Amsterdam

1775
01:19:25,238 --> 01:19:29,319
mhm so it was like your own feno that

1776
01:19:27,479 --> 01:19:32,678
you had hunted yourself that you know

1777
01:19:29,319 --> 01:19:34,960
you used to breed with right I right but

1778
01:19:32,679 --> 01:19:37,158
that Northern Lights was Brad to the

1779
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:39,520
chem and then from the chem took the the

1780
01:19:37,158 --> 01:19:41,679
first generation of seeds found the male

1781
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:43,560
crossed it with and it was your friend

1782
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:45,760
that bought the weed um that had the

1783
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:48,239
seed in it that actually grew it

1784
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:49,920
out well I don't you know like I

1785
01:19:48,238 --> 01:19:53,000
wouldn't say that like he's got his

1786
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:56,679
seeds I have mine I'm growing the same

1787
01:19:53,000 --> 01:20:00,198
seeds Okay this is how I feel like what

1788
01:19:56,679 --> 01:20:03,279
happened they got dis I got my own te I

1789
01:20:00,198 --> 01:20:04,439
can remember going to the cast Guild and

1790
01:20:03,279 --> 01:20:08,599
[ __ ]

1791
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:12,198
Joe moved in to the

1792
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:15,960
house uh across from where vondo had at

1793
01:20:12,198 --> 01:20:20,359
the time so they had two houses side by

1794
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:22,920
side and Joe moved in and I gave him a

1795
01:20:20,359 --> 01:20:25,519
house Waring plant for his house and

1796
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:27,960
that was my cut

1797
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:31,480
of my sour that I had grown out seeds

1798
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:33,520
and I like this plant right bondle says

1799
01:20:31,479 --> 01:20:37,158
or whatever Mike well says they did the

1800
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:39,239
same thing so it's like that's where I

1801
01:20:37,158 --> 01:20:41,279
have my story at like I don't really

1802
01:20:39,238 --> 01:20:44,039
care like if they say they want to claim

1803
01:20:41,279 --> 01:20:46,719
it they can claim it I know the SE no I

1804
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:49,238
I thought AJ actually gave you the

1805
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:52,158
credit um like in this podcast that I

1806
01:20:49,238 --> 01:20:55,519
was listening to he said that it was

1807
01:20:52,158 --> 01:21:00,000
your weed and and that it was being

1808
01:20:55,520 --> 01:21:02,280
called The Sour Diesel and that and that

1809
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,560
you wouldn't give up the cut and

1810
01:21:02,279 --> 01:21:09,519
eventually they found seeds and planted

1811
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:11,760
those and you know but you know he said

1812
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:12,960
that yours was the original one and then

1813
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:15,039
you know then

1814
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:17,920
afterwards you know they they grew some

1815
01:21:15,039 --> 01:21:19,639
seeds and and so right you know I I felt

1816
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,600
like he was I felt like he was giving

1817
01:21:19,639 --> 01:21:24,719
you the credit so when I went back to

1818
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:28,000
New York with that um

1819
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:30,639
I saw the weasel shortly thereafter uh

1820
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,198
in sheep's Meadow in Central Park and I

1821
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:34,560
I showed it to him and he was so

1822
01:21:32,198 --> 01:21:36,719
impressed with it that within two days

1823
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:40,400
he caught a flight to

1824
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:43,000
Amsterdam and uh and took his first trip

1825
01:21:40,399 --> 01:21:45,559
there and when he came back he had seeds

1826
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:48,639
with him and those would be the seeds

1827
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:53,120
that would eventually potentially

1828
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:55,000
uh father the genetics that that uh bore

1829
01:21:53,119 --> 01:21:57,840
the sour all of a sudden it was it was

1830
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:00,079
just diesel but now uh we're getting all

1831
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,920
these different things and now

1832
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:03,479
everyone's like dude please just grow

1833
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:05,520
the diesel like [ __ ] all this other

1834
01:22:03,479 --> 01:22:07,119
stuff please we just want the diesel you

1835
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,600
know if you're a grower like you know

1836
01:22:07,119 --> 01:22:10,039
like every time you try to show people

1837
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:11,560
something different there's like one

1838
01:22:10,039 --> 01:22:12,920
particular thing they want from you and

1839
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,159
it's like you can't you can show them

1840
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:16,560
the most the best thing in the world

1841
01:22:14,158 --> 01:22:19,519
they don't care so he did uh uh

1842
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:21,880
eventually start growing diesel again

1843
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:25,840
and uh but this time when it came

1844
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:30,719
out uh there were some seeds and uh by

1845
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:34,360
now these guys who uh who I had first

1846
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:37,119
introduced to the diesel had had poached

1847
01:22:34,359 --> 01:22:38,559
out uh the weasel and found him because

1848
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:40,679
it was you know it was a small scene you

1849
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:43,239
know so those guys were from Albany so

1850
01:22:40,679 --> 01:22:48,079
those guys got weed with some seeds in

1851
01:22:43,238 --> 01:22:50,158
it I got weed I found one seed in it and

1852
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:52,760
uh and and so that's kind of like where

1853
01:22:50,158 --> 01:22:55,719
it all began with like I don't listen to

1854
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:58,840
his podast I didn't it was he did for

1855
01:22:55,719 --> 01:23:01,600
someone else yeah

1856
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:03,360
um but I I I would have tried to stop by

1857
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,960
to see him this morning need didn't

1858
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:08,000
answer it's nice to have him on [ __ ]

1859
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:10,600
[ __ ] yeah I'm gonna see if he wants

1860
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,600
to come on too I never really interacted

1861
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:15,000
with him much at the time you know I was

1862
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:17,000
already out here and he was out there

1863
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:20,119
you know I had you know I knew about him

1864
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:23,000
from you so yeah I

1865
01:23:20,119 --> 01:23:25,198
like um kind of floating around now uh

1866
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,238
Gabby you got you got to cut Sour Diesel

1867
01:23:25,198 --> 01:23:31,799
is that yeah so are you doing you doing

1868
01:23:27,238 --> 01:23:33,919
tissue culture Gabby so the the Clones

1869
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:36,079
that I have the original Sour Diesel had

1870
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:37,399
come from had been tissue cultured from

1871
01:23:36,079 --> 01:23:39,359
someone that I know that had been

1872
01:23:37,399 --> 01:23:42,119
growing it for a long time and then I

1873
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:45,479
got the AJ sour was it but was it the

1874
01:23:42,119 --> 01:23:49,238
sour like was it the sour like you know

1875
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:52,119
s s yeah I mean to be honest with you I

1876
01:23:49,238 --> 01:23:55,279
don't really know what you grew you know

1877
01:23:52,119 --> 01:23:57,039
because we're living on different um

1878
01:23:55,279 --> 01:24:00,158
different coast different sides of the

1879
01:23:57,039 --> 01:24:01,479
yeah exactly and um I'm gonna talk to

1880
01:24:00,158 --> 01:24:03,879
you about this after the show it's

1881
01:24:01,479 --> 01:24:05,359
interesting with um you know you

1882
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:07,000
obviously we got the the original Sour

1883
01:24:05,359 --> 01:24:08,839
Diesel here we got you know something

1884
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,880
that came from you know the other seed

1885
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:13,719
and everything like that you know I

1886
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:15,520
wonder which which sour was the one that

1887
01:24:13,719 --> 01:24:18,560
you know became super popular with

1888
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:22,600
everyone that everyone had experienced I

1889
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:26,039
mean like we we already know that even

1890
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:28,000
back then there was a few different ones

1891
01:24:26,039 --> 01:24:30,399
right it sounds like there were two main

1892
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,719
ones that that ended up into like the

1893
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:35,719
hands of people who were calling it Sour

1894
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:39,118
Diesel and it it could have it could

1895
01:24:35,719 --> 01:24:42,118
have been either one either from it

1896
01:24:39,118 --> 01:24:45,279
could very likely yeah it very likely

1897
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:46,839
was more than two for sure and then how

1898
01:24:45,279 --> 01:24:48,920
does East Coast Sour Diesel fit into

1899
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:51,840
this um I don't know too much about the

1900
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:52,920
history on that strain but you know this

1901
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:55,119
what we're talking about it's already

1902
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:57,480
originating on the East Coast

1903
01:24:55,118 --> 01:24:58,158
you know so the West Coast I believe is

1904
01:24:57,479 --> 01:25:00,519
the

1905
01:24:58,158 --> 01:25:02,960
headband but I don't have I don't have

1906
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:04,880
as much you know like Francis or NATO

1907
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:07,960
dog would have been a better person to

1908
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:10,359
talk to about that because he researches

1909
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:12,760
all that stuff and he's probably already

1910
01:25:10,359 --> 01:25:16,719
done you know a few talks about it if

1911
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:18,480
you look it back up but um yeah and it's

1912
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:19,840
kind of weird you know it's actually

1913
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:21,919
more proof

1914
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:24,079
that you know it's kind of like Lemon

1915
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:26,760
Cherry gelato today a lot of people just

1916
01:25:24,079 --> 01:25:29,359
start to add their [ __ ] to the name you

1917
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:31,880
know um the when they started calling

1918
01:25:29,359 --> 01:25:34,479
the headband Sour Diesel it's like just

1919
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:38,760
because that you know that was more

1920
01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:41,359
popular than headband you know so but

1921
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:45,239
and you know I I will talk to not so dog

1922
01:25:41,359 --> 01:25:47,158
about it the Clone that I have um I

1923
01:25:45,238 --> 01:25:49,759
believe to be the original Sour Diesel

1924
01:25:47,158 --> 01:25:53,198
and then I have the AJ sour which is

1925
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:55,039
actually something that he you know he

1926
01:25:53,198 --> 01:25:57,439
agreed to put his name on you know they

1927
01:25:55,039 --> 01:26:00,960
call it the Philly cut you know he's put

1928
01:25:57,439 --> 01:26:04,519
his name on a on a bunch of cuts

1929
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:07,719
um so but you know and now he has you

1930

1931
01:26:07,719 --> 01:26:13,079
now he has his own sour I mean do you

1932
01:26:09,359 --> 01:26:15,479
get royalties I wonder is like somebody

1933
01:26:13,079 --> 01:26:17,479
put the weasel on that jar should I get

1934
01:26:15,479 --> 01:26:18,479
royalties for that unfortunately I don't

1935
01:26:17,479 --> 01:26:22,079
think

1936
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:24,319

someone doing that he nice nice man and

1939
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,520
he's got this sour that he says sour

1940
01:26:30,399 --> 01:26:35,079
it's

1941
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:39,000
not the the sour I say it right now it's

1942
01:26:35,079 --> 01:26:41,559
not the sour okay but he's selling it as

1943
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:43,359
the sour and grown by the weasel and I'm

1944
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:46,080
like and he comes to me look I says I

1945
01:26:43,359 --> 01:26:48,639
did this for you and I'm like I I I

1946
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:50,920
don't know what to say to the guy wait

1947
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:54,560
hold on I did this for you so where's my

1948
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:56,840
money yeah you know I'm like

1949
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:59,159
I no you're using you're using my

1950
01:26:56,840 --> 01:27:01,600
reputation to sell your weed and it's

1951
01:26:59,158 --> 01:27:04,279
like all lie so I'm going to meet with

1952
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:05,920
him soon again I just don't have time

1953
01:27:04,279 --> 01:27:08,079
right this minute I'm G to tell him well

1954
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:10,199
first of all it shouldn't say groan by

1955
01:27:08,079 --> 01:27:13,118
the weasel because now he's taking

1956
01:27:10,198 --> 01:27:15,279
credit for like I'm not I'm not Happ

1957
01:27:13,118 --> 01:27:18,759
product at all I'm like this this can't

1958
01:27:15,279 --> 01:27:20,559
this can't be this can't be I don't know

1959
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:23,320
how to break it to him though wow I'm

1960
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:25,719
just too kindhearted in a way cuz you

1961
01:27:23,319 --> 01:27:27,519
like the guy until he did this I think

1962
01:27:25,719 --> 01:27:31,000
he's doing it he says it goes to a lot

1963
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:31,800
of cancer patients so I don't you know

1964
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,520
like

1965
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:37,840
it I think it's going to a good cause if

1966
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:40,840
he's doing that well cancer cancer

1967
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:43,159
patients don't care that you grew it you

1968
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:45,920
know like that's marketing calling it

1969
01:27:43,158 --> 01:27:47,519
you know saying groan by the weasel cuz

1970
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:49,800
cancer patients just want medicine that

1971
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:51,960
makes them feel better true right like

1972
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:53,960
it doesn't matter to them if it's sour

1973
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:56,399
easel grown by the weasel I think I

1974
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:58,639
think the same cut of sour uh ever since

1975
01:27:56,399 --> 01:28:01,399
you you know originally created it yeah

1976
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:05,440
so uh my buddy

1977
01:28:01,399 --> 01:28:08,479
here in the cat skills has it also and

1978
01:28:05,439 --> 01:28:11,799
he's from Stan Island crew like it's

1979
01:28:08,479 --> 01:28:14,319
kind of funny like the GU from orany

1980
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:17,520
lived here for a while and then we came

1981
01:28:14,319 --> 01:28:20,118
here you know into the cat skills and uh

1982
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:24,480
it's it's really nice but like

1983
01:28:20,118 --> 01:28:26,359
so this is kind of like Humble County in

1984
01:28:24,479 --> 01:28:28,198
a way that's the what we say Green

1985
01:28:26,359 --> 01:28:31,158
county is like the humble of the East

1986
01:28:28,198 --> 01:28:34,118
County in the East Eastern United States

1987
01:28:31,158 --> 01:28:36,559
like this area a lot of fine Bud coming

1988
01:28:34,118 --> 01:28:38,920
out of here now it's really nice it

1989
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:40,560
always was like for the New York weed

1990
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:43,319
that's where with all the good [ __ ] was

1991
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:44,960
always coming from so my friend you know

1992
01:28:43,319 --> 01:28:48,079
like I just asked him in the spring can

1993
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:51,399
I get a cut and I get it you know I get

1994
01:28:48,079 --> 01:28:53,039
the cut I want or or I do see Cosmo

1995
01:28:51,399 --> 01:28:56,039
Cosmic you

1996
01:28:53,039 --> 01:28:57,600
know what about you so your your friend

1997
01:28:56,039 --> 01:28:59,399
currently he's uh kind of like the

1998
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,840
caregiver of your strain right now right

1999
01:28:59,399 --> 01:29:02,279
so like you don't perpetually have a

2000
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:06,360
mother he's the one who's taking care of

2001
01:29:02,279 --> 01:29:09,158
yeah he's got it yeah um what about you

2002
01:29:06,359 --> 01:29:10,599
you dra anything I got uh quite a few

2003
01:29:09,158 --> 01:29:12,359
things um I have something that's

2004
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:15,560
supposed to be Sour Diesel that I'd

2005
01:29:12,359 --> 01:29:17,559
gotten back in 2020 um from this breeder

2006
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:19,360
Collective I'm over here uh in

2007
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:21,639
California um it was this breeder

2008
01:29:19,359 --> 01:29:23,639
collective in San berino that just kind

2009
01:29:21,639 --> 01:29:26,359
of disappeared um so I can't really

2010
01:29:23,639 --> 01:29:30,239
Trace the history back on what it is the

2011
01:29:26,359 --> 01:29:32,359
turps are extremely sour um I mean as

2012
01:29:30,238 --> 01:29:34,439
far as what I understand what a sour

2013
01:29:32,359 --> 01:29:37,118
diesel should be um it seems pretty

2014
01:29:34,439 --> 01:29:40,158
close to it but um you know who knows if

2015
01:29:37,118 --> 01:29:43,238
it's if it's the real deal you know that

2016
01:29:40,158 --> 01:29:45,039
you know um but yeah I mean I have I

2017
01:29:43,238 --> 01:29:46,638
have quite the collection I've been

2018
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:49,079
learning a lot about tissue culture

2019
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:50,560
about Mary stem tissue culture so my

2020
01:29:49,079 --> 01:29:52,559
focus right now is getting better at

2021
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:54,440
that and you know hopefully creating a

2022
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,840
library of strains that I can kind of

2023
01:29:54,439 --> 01:29:58,799
play around with whenever I'm ready for

2024
01:29:55,840 --> 01:30:01,600
my next uh breeding project and you have

2025
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:04,039
both of the sour that I that I have uh

2026
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:05,520
currently Mar stem right yeah so I have

2027
01:30:04,039 --> 01:30:08,519
um the two sours I got from you and then

2028
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:11,960
I have the one still that I had um from

2029
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:13,840
2020 um and yeah I mean the Mary stem

2030
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:15,719
process is it's very very long it's

2031
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:17,800
going to take a long time for me and you

2032
01:30:15,719 --> 01:30:20,439
know I'm I'm still in the process of

2033
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:21,560
figuring everything out you know um I I

2034
01:30:20,439 --> 01:30:23,599
know it was a different you know show

2035
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:24,920
that we did but um I've successfully

2036
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:27,600
done the

2037
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:29,199
micropropagation um I've successfully at

2038
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:32,440
right now at this point um have

2039
01:30:29,198 --> 01:30:35,359
extracted you know a lot of Merry stems

2040
01:30:32,439 --> 01:30:36,479
um and I have them currently growing

2041
01:30:35,359 --> 01:30:39,000
getting to the point where they're

2042
01:30:36,479 --> 01:30:42,198
almost um at the height where I would be

2043
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:44,279
able to kind of do the same techniques

2044
01:30:42,198 --> 01:30:47,079
that I use with micropropagation on on

2045
01:30:44,279 --> 01:30:48,519
those plants so um right now my my

2046
01:30:47,079 --> 01:30:50,198
current you know process is is

2047
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:52,679
connecting those two techniques together

2048
01:30:50,198 --> 01:30:54,399
to be able to you know eventually have a

2049
01:30:52,679 --> 01:30:58,199
plant that you can grow in a garden you

2050
01:30:54,399 --> 01:31:02,238
know so um but yeah my collection is is

2051
01:30:58,198 --> 01:31:04,118
vast I think I'm around uh 90 or so and

2052
01:31:02,238 --> 01:31:07,238
and about half of those if not more are

2053
01:31:04,118 --> 01:31:08,839
already just purely tissue cultured um

2054
01:31:07,238 --> 01:31:10,678
speaking of the chem 91 I have that

2055
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:13,520
supposed to be on the way too so uh

2056
01:31:10,679 --> 01:31:16,520
that's pretty cool um I love sour I love

2057
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:18,600
chems um any kind of those strains where

2058
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:21,159
you're just like it's not it's not so

2059
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:24,440
friendly to to you know to sniff it

2060
01:31:21,158 --> 01:31:26,879
there um the TPS um

2061
01:31:24,439 --> 01:31:29,000
but yeah I mean it's been so so awesome

2062
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:30,440
to be able to talk to you and you know

2063
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,840
here here where one of my favorite

2064
01:31:30,439 --> 01:31:34,279
strains came from you know because I

2065
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:36,319
know everyone's a little bit different

2066
01:31:34,279 --> 01:31:38,279
you know with uh what they prefer you

2067
01:31:36,319 --> 01:31:40,079
know and um I feel like it has to do

2068
01:31:38,279 --> 01:31:41,439
with everyone's you know biology and

2069
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:44,439
like the chemical composition of their

2070
01:31:41,439 --> 01:31:47,000
brains and you know what what campono

2071
01:31:44,439 --> 01:31:49,359
and tpin that they react to um but I

2072
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:51,118
know personally Sour Diesel is um one of

2073
01:31:49,359 --> 01:31:54,000
my favorites for just putting me in the

2074
01:31:51,118 --> 01:31:56,079
best mood such a great mood enhancer

2075
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:59,158
find uh I like smoking it better in the

2076
01:31:56,079 --> 01:32:01,238
day when I'm working than the chem dog

2077
01:31:59,158 --> 01:32:04,759
because chem dog would just couch couch

2078
01:32:01,238 --> 01:32:07,079
potato me out I'll be like I got sit

2079
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:09,880
down not soon enough I haven't had any

2080
01:32:07,079 --> 01:32:12,000
actual it's funny it's funny

2081
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:16,319
because it's funny because I feel the

2082
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:18,000
same way like people and you know Cosmic

2083
01:32:16,319 --> 01:32:19,799
and wolf you can tell me your feelings

2084
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,800
on the subject but people would always

2085
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:24,320
tell me how the sour diesel would wreck

2086
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:27,079
them and for me it was just never that

2087
01:32:24,319 --> 01:32:31,679
potent even when done properly the

2088
01:32:27,079 --> 01:32:34,600
comparison of the potency not THC but

2089
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:36,000
just overall potency to your brain like

2090
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:39,719
the difference between

2091
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:44,479
smoking um the sour or the chem

2092
01:32:39,719 --> 01:32:46,840
dog it's like it's night and day you

2093
01:32:44,479 --> 01:32:48,638
know and maybe maybe it could also have

2094
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:50,960
something to do with

2095
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:52,520
uh you know if there was some more

2096
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:54,920
sativa in it versus I think that's what

2097
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:57,080
it is more sativa it

2098
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:59,319
you know are you growing too Nick yeah I

2099
01:32:57,079 --> 01:33:02,079
I um so I have like a little tiny home

2100
01:32:59,319 --> 01:33:05,559
grow and then uh just because where we

2101
01:33:02,079 --> 01:33:08,639
moved but I I um I helped manage a uh a

2102
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:11,320
farm as well um so we got like four

2103
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:13,880
different flowering rooms and we have a

2104
01:33:11,319 --> 01:33:16,118
I think we have like 108 or 116

2105
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:19,279
different cultivars that we keep on on

2106
01:33:16,118 --> 01:33:21,799
hand now but um we're we're also moving

2107
01:33:19,279 --> 01:33:23,519
to get some tissue cultur uh set up so

2108
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:27,039
that we can get all of all of those on

2109
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:31,520
cult because keeping 108 strains on on

2110
01:33:27,039 --> 01:33:33,639
hand is uh it's difficult it is um we

2111
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:36,000
got uh we we have like two acres of

2112
01:33:33,639 --> 01:33:37,840
outdoor that we do so we we try to like

2113
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,600
split up all those two acres between

2114
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:42,880
about 102 or 105 different strains per

2115
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:45,400
year and when you doing

2116
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:48,840
Outdoors how you doing them Outdoors uh

2117
01:33:45,399 --> 01:33:52,198
we do uh row crops with uh um drip

2118
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:54,279
irrigation oh nice yeah there's no

2119
01:33:52,198 --> 01:33:58,479
protection

2120
01:33:54,279 --> 01:34:01,559
we do um like tsts and uh and trellising

2121
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:05,839
you know we we're doing out like uh up

2122
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:08,760
here uh there was we had like 35 of them

2123
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:12,480
this Summer over on a

2124
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:14,480
farm and uh we put them on skids and

2125
01:34:12,479 --> 01:34:17,759
then on big bags and then we just keep

2126
01:34:14,479 --> 01:34:21,479
the brush back and we bring water lines

2127
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:23,960
drip lines to them but I find a d no you

2128
01:34:21,479 --> 01:34:25,519
have to be outdoors and your bringing

2129
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:28,880
the water from

2130
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:31,360
afar you got like we have a reservoir

2131
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:34,319
it's a spring so it's it's kind of hard

2132
01:34:31,359 --> 01:34:37,039
really to run the drip line so we just

2133
01:34:34,319 --> 01:34:40,840
we feed it with a hose most of the time

2134
01:34:37,039 --> 01:34:43,600
we don't use trellises so much cuz like

2135
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:45,840
we're I don't know like far apart and we

2136
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:48,840
use large staks and just kind of tie

2137
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:51,239
them up you know the trellises like a

2138
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:53,760
lot of people like them in green houses

2139
01:34:51,238 --> 01:34:55,919
but I just find it sometimes it's not

2140
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:58,079
not the ideal thing for me for sure do

2141
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:59,760
either of you guys do anything to what

2142
01:34:58,079 --> 01:35:03,960
was that Gabby well so I mean we have

2143
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:06,800
like 3500 plants in the two acres so

2144
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:08,359
it's like putting teap or putting steaks

2145
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:10,639
for each one of those would just be a

2146
01:35:08,359 --> 01:35:12,679
little bit too laborious I like I don't

2147
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:15,039
use a lot of stakes I just use like one

2148
01:35:12,679 --> 01:35:18,399
maybe this year I didn't have to use hly

2149
01:35:15,039 --> 01:35:21,000
any but we get enough wi I feel like it

2150
01:35:18,399 --> 01:35:23,039
they strengthens them and I don't have a

2151
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,158
problem with them falling over you know

2152
01:35:23,039 --> 01:35:29,118
like this the buds they kind of just

2153
01:35:25,158 --> 01:35:30,559
stay up the strong the stems you know

2154
01:35:29,118 --> 01:35:32,880
what were you asking Gabby though about

2155
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:34,600
like protection yeah do you guys do

2156
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:37,719
anything to protect them from the

2157
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:40,400
weather no um or like is it just grown

2158
01:35:37,719 --> 01:35:43,880
straight outside just straight out or

2159
01:35:40,399 --> 01:35:45,879
something some people do right we we use

2160
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:47,679
like uh we use an electric stat

2161
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:50,639
electrostatic sprayer on the back of a

2162
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:52,520
tractor um and spray like Biologicals

2163
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:56,239
and stuff to help prevent like petritis

2164
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:59,080
and powder m do and we it's we're in

2165
01:35:56,238 --> 01:36:01,000
Oregon so like the hemp russet mites are

2166
01:35:59,079 --> 01:36:03,880
everywhere so we got to battle those

2167
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:05,000
throughout the whole season to and um

2168
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:07,480
this year we didn't have much like

2169
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:09,039
thrips or spider mites or anything like

2170
01:36:07,479 --> 01:36:11,158
that it was just like the the hemp

2171
01:36:09,039 --> 01:36:13,719
russet mites and a little bit of powdery

2172
01:36:11,158 --> 01:36:15,519
mdeo towards the end I was thinking

2173
01:36:13,719 --> 01:36:19,480
protection from the wind and

2174
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:21,719
rain that trellising um we we get some

2175
01:36:19,479 --> 01:36:24,799
pretty intense winds uh in the valley

2176
01:36:21,719 --> 01:36:27,118
that we're in so will um we have like

2177
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:29,440
probably three three layers of trellis

2178
01:36:27,118 --> 01:36:33,639
per row and the rows are like um it's

2179
01:36:29,439 --> 01:36:35,879
like two rows down um straight uh

2180
01:36:33,639 --> 01:36:37,560
planted at like a 5 foot centers per

2181
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:39,440
plant then you have the tpost just

2182
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:41,159
running along the outside and then we'll

2183
01:36:39,439 --> 01:36:43,519
just pull the trellis along the whole

2184
01:36:41,158 --> 01:36:47,719
thing yeah you guys it's a the weather

2185
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:50,320
is a lot different out there than here I

2186
01:36:47,719 --> 01:36:52,359
mean it snows where you at yeah but not

2187
01:36:50,319 --> 01:36:53,960
far from you too though we get snow here

2188
01:36:52,359 --> 01:36:55,238
right but far it's far it's it's far

2189
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:56,800
enough from where I live that I don't

2190
01:36:55,238 --> 01:36:59,000
have to worry about it's snowing on my

2191
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:01,119
plants you know like you guys are that's

2192
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:03,520
a big business that you guys you're in

2193
01:37:01,118 --> 01:37:06,399
there you know we're just like small

2194
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:08,960
craft farmer here that's

2195
01:37:06,399 --> 01:37:11,960
it well that's funny that you say that

2196
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:14,639
cuz we had that discussion about what is

2197
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:17,679
craft cannabis could I could never like

2198
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:20,000
you know once you get once you get like

2199
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:22,880
above 40 plants for a single person to

2200
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:26,760
work it's a lot how do you how do you do

2201
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:29,440
that like it's becomes a full-time job

2202
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:32,159
like it is and you already have one of

2203
01:37:29,439 --> 01:37:34,599
those you know you already have one of

2204
01:37:32,158 --> 01:37:38,759
those right I have two of those familyes

2205
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:41,480
another fulltime job okay so it's like

2206
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:42,960
you're working a lot of hours trying to

2207
01:37:41,479 --> 01:37:45,638
take care of this

2208
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:48,560
plant and you're not getting as much as

2209
01:37:45,639 --> 01:37:50,719
you used to get for it so like I'm only

2210
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:52,679
going to grow like a small amount

2211
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:56,480
compared to what I used to sometimes

2212
01:37:52,679 --> 01:37:59,279
grow I don't like I don't care about

2213
01:37:56,479 --> 01:38:02,238
selling it you know it's more about

2214
01:37:59,279 --> 01:38:06,118
personal butd and giving giving it to

2215
01:38:02,238 --> 01:38:08,319
some people that don't have itas is

2216
01:38:06,118 --> 01:38:11,598
use we have to use a lot of uh

2217
01:38:08,319 --> 01:38:14,279
Automation and uh irrigation because

2218
01:38:11,599 --> 01:38:16,520
it's only two of us pretty much uh that

2219
01:38:14,279 --> 01:38:21,079
are full-time there taking care

2220
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:23,520
of four different rooms of flower and a

2221
01:38:21,079 --> 01:38:25,960
few different veg spaces cuz of all the

2222
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:28,840
bombs that we have to keep around and

2223
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:30,920
clone room and that's but I I think it's

2224
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:32,840
pretty fun I like it actually and you

2225
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:34,639
were in a facility too right Gabby you

2226
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:36,400
were working in one I'm not anymore but

2227
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:38,960
you were though what do you think of

2228
01:38:36,399 --> 01:38:41,479
like the large facilities so what I

2229
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:44,319
believe and I said this before and I

2230
01:38:41,479 --> 01:38:48,598
I'll repeat it is that I believe it's

2231
01:38:44,319 --> 01:38:52,158
possible to grow on a large scale and

2232
01:38:48,599 --> 01:38:54,159
grow craft quality cannabis

2233
01:38:52,158 --> 01:38:55,638
now it's

2234
01:38:54,158 --> 01:38:58,799
probably less

2235
01:38:55,639 --> 01:39:00,159
profitable right because if it was more

2236
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:03,599
profitable then more people would be

2237
01:39:00,158 --> 01:39:05,679
trying to do it but if what you're

2238
01:39:03,599 --> 01:39:07,119
trying to do is and we're talking about

2239
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:11,560
large scale right if you're trying to

2240
01:39:07,118 --> 01:39:14,519
create a brand known for the highest

2241
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:16,280
quality then you can't cut those corners

2242
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:17,560
and you got to accept that like at least

2243
01:39:16,279 --> 01:39:20,759
at

2244
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:23,000
first it might not be as profitable

2245
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:26,440
right but I think if you go in there

2246
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:29,319
with the proper intention and love for

2247
01:39:26,439 --> 01:39:33,118
the plant in a commercial facility you

2248
01:39:29,319 --> 01:39:35,238
can grow the highest quality product and

2249
01:39:33,118 --> 01:39:39,000
you know one thing that that I would say

2250
01:39:35,238 --> 01:39:43,238
about this is in a commercial

2251
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:47,158
facility they regularly have tools

2252
01:39:43,238 --> 01:39:51,919
available to them that the

2253
01:39:47,158 --> 01:39:54,118
average you know craft farmer does not

2254
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:57,399
you know like the amount of

2255
01:39:54,118 --> 01:39:59,519
monitoring and controls that are

2256
01:39:57,399 --> 01:40:02,719
available to these larger facilities

2257
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:04,920
it's an advantage now I think a lot of a

2258
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:08,239
lot of these facilities are

2259
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:10,199
overusing this technology and and trying

2260
01:40:08,238 --> 01:40:12,000
to push the plants too hard and that's

2261
01:40:10,198 --> 01:40:15,598
causing other problems I think a

2262
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:20,439
commercial facility can grow as good of

2263
01:40:15,599 --> 01:40:23,400
weed as anyone else can if they put the

2264
01:40:20,439 --> 01:40:26,198
proper love and and it's it's a

2265
01:40:23,399 --> 01:40:28,198
attention so when you have a commercial

2266
01:40:26,198 --> 01:40:30,198
facility you got to have enough people

2267
01:40:28,198 --> 01:40:32,079
working there if you don't have enough

2268
01:40:30,198 --> 01:40:33,479
people working there then all of a

2269
01:40:32,079 --> 01:40:37,198
sudden Corners get

2270
01:40:33,479 --> 01:40:39,559
cut but you know if you if you can have

2271
01:40:37,198 --> 01:40:41,919
enough people working there they can put

2272
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:43,520
more attention into it than in a

2273
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:45,639
situation where it's just like one or

2274
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:46,920
two people working you know four

2275
01:40:45,639 --> 01:40:49,719
flowering

2276
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:51,319
rooms so some of the flowering rooms are

2277
01:40:49,719 --> 01:40:54,118
huge you

2278
01:40:51,319 --> 01:40:57,479
know oh yeah I mean the last place I was

2279
01:40:54,118 --> 01:41:01,279
at the flowering rooms um each of them

2280
01:40:57,479 --> 01:41:03,919
had like 130 liks I think it 117 lights

2281
01:41:01,279 --> 01:41:06,639
something it was like 1,200 plants in

2282
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:09,000
every room and there was eight rooms

2283
01:41:06,639 --> 01:41:11,840
plus the veg yeah we we only have 12

2284
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:13,479
lights per room and around 108 plants

2285
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:16,639
per room I just wanted

2286
01:41:13,479 --> 01:41:17,638
to uh just wrap it up and you you know

2287
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:19,920
is there anything else that you wanted

2288
01:41:17,639 --> 01:41:22,920
to say Mike I'm good you got anything

2289
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:24,279
you want to ask yeah any any well I'm

2290
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:26,039
going to talk to you for the rest of my

2291
01:41:24,279 --> 01:41:28,158
life so I can ask more questions I'll

2292
01:41:26,039 --> 01:41:30,000
give Nick and Cosmic a

2293
01:41:28,158 --> 01:41:32,559
chance you guys have anything you want

2294
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:34,158
to talk about I mean I think I've asked

2295
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:35,560
every question that came to mind right

2296
01:41:34,158 --> 01:41:37,839
now it's probably just going to be a

2297
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:39,400
matter of um just digesting you know

2298
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:41,679
everything that we've learned today you

2299
01:41:39,399 --> 01:41:44,158
know it's um a lot of really cool

2300
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:46,039
cannabis history you know especially

2301
01:41:44,158 --> 01:41:47,839
strains that you know that we all love

2302
01:41:46,039 --> 01:41:50,599
you know um so what's your favorite

2303
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:52,360
today I mean besides the sour the diesel

2304
01:41:50,599 --> 01:41:54,079
like something else that you like

2305
01:41:52,359 --> 01:41:56,920
honestly yeah I mean Sour Diesel it's so

2306
01:41:54,079 --> 01:42:00,840
hard to beat um Sour Diesel I love

2307
01:41:56,920 --> 01:42:02,800
sfog um that's one I this is a story for

2308
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:06,520
another day um actually my my buddy that

2309
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:08,199
I did this with um about 15 years ago uh

2310
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:10,159
was at my house this weekend and I asked

2311
01:42:08,198 --> 01:42:12,638
him if he wanted to jump on this podcast

2312
01:42:10,158 --> 01:42:14,479
so that's maybe maybe down the line we

2313
01:42:12,639 --> 01:42:17,880
can hear the story from his perspective

2314
01:42:14,479 --> 01:42:20,718
but back in the day him and his mom were

2315
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:24,599
uh this about 2011 or so

2316
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:26,239
2012 um they started a uh canvas Club

2317
01:42:24,599 --> 01:42:27,639
you know so like a medical dispensary

2318
01:42:26,238 --> 01:42:30,118
they had all the paperwork done

2319
01:42:27,639 --> 01:42:32,159
everything we were legal to grow in his

2320
01:42:30,118 --> 01:42:35,799
house we had a single room that we were

2321
01:42:32,158 --> 01:42:37,719
taking care of and um I at the time I

2322
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:40,039
was delivering pizzas you know I put all

2323
01:42:37,719 --> 01:42:42,319
the extra money I had uh you know

2324
01:42:40,039 --> 01:42:43,920
because he still wanted to get money

2325
01:42:42,319 --> 01:42:46,039
from that room so we had to pay rent for

2326
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:47,760
the room that we were growing in so I

2327
01:42:46,039 --> 01:42:49,599
paid all the extra money I had for you

2328
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:52,639
know rent every month on that and then

2329
01:42:49,599 --> 01:42:54,520
all the equipment that we needed um but

2330
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:57,440
long story short he ended up getting rid

2331
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:59,280
it was a a whole deal um very

2332
01:42:57,439 --> 01:43:00,919
interesting story too again I just we

2333
01:42:59,279 --> 01:43:03,880
were talking about on Friday so I'm

2334
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:06,118
hoping that we can get him on and uh get

2335
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:07,480
him to tell his end of that but um back

2336
01:43:06,118 --> 01:43:09,719
to kind of what we were we were talking

2337
01:43:07,479 --> 01:43:12,039
about sfog was one of the strains that

2338
01:43:09,719 --> 01:43:14,920
we grew back in the days so I have that

2339
01:43:12,039 --> 01:43:16,639
personal connection from you know

2340
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:18,399
basically the the first time of me

2341
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:21,840
really you know learning how to grow and

2342
01:43:18,399 --> 01:43:24,079
then you know taking on um you know a

2343
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:27,199
room with my friend

2344
01:43:24,079 --> 01:43:28,319
um San Fernando has always just been one

2345
01:43:27,198 --> 01:43:30,799
of my favorite

2346
01:43:28,319 --> 01:43:33,599
ogs um and then as far as like kind of

2347
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:35,560
modern weed goes uh another favorite uh

2348
01:43:33,599 --> 01:43:38,639
actually I'll do a shout out for two

2349
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:41,920
more strains uh one is uh blueberry

2350
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:45,239
muffin from Humble um an amazingly

2351
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:46,840
fruity almost too sweet uh when when

2352
01:43:45,238 --> 01:43:50,079
you're trimming up the plant it's it's

2353
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:52,159
almost sickeningly sweet um but it it's

2354
01:43:50,079 --> 01:43:54,439
a really good nighttime smoke uh that

2355
01:43:52,158 --> 01:43:56,759
blueberry muffin and um I've used it for

2356
01:43:54,439 --> 01:43:59,638
several of my breing projects um with

2357
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:01,400
some really interesting results um and

2358
01:43:59,639 --> 01:44:03,520
then another one that I uh that I've

2359
01:44:01,399 --> 01:44:06,399
been growing again since 2020 is a sugar

2360
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:08,520
cane from in-house genetics uh really

2361
01:44:06,399 --> 01:44:10,479
really good hash plant you know lots of

2362
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:12,719
uh lots of frost on it so perfect for

2363
01:44:10,479 --> 01:44:14,678
making bubble hash or any kind of

2364
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:18,000
extracts and everything like that so I'd

2365
01:44:14,679 --> 01:44:21,920
say those are some of my top uh strains

2366
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:24,000
nice nice and you Nick oh man I I'm just

2367
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:27,880
because of like the volume of different

2368
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:29,520
strains that I've been exposed to um

2369
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:31,800
over the past couple years like it they

2370
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:34,760
start to get muddled but one that always

2371
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:37,320
that I really like because of like U the

2372
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:40,400
medicinal qualities of it for my uh

2373
01:44:37,319 --> 01:44:44,439
specific usage would be like uh Miracle

2374
01:44:40,399 --> 01:44:48,079
alien cookies or the Mac one cut um that

2375
01:44:44,439 --> 01:44:50,719
one and then uh there's a cross of it

2376
01:44:48,079 --> 01:44:52,840
where it was crossed to uh the in-house

2377
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:54,880
genetic slur cane and that one's either

2378
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:58,400
called like mac slurry or Mac flurry or

2379
01:44:54,880 --> 01:45:00,719
Mac Daddy um but uh that that one also

2380
01:44:58,399 --> 01:45:03,359
is it's a just a huge yielder and it's

2381
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:05,960
really potent so those are always good

2382
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:11,279
for me but then I do remember like Tahoe

2383
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:16,679
OG or san foral like sfv OG um or even

2384
01:45:11,279 --> 01:45:18,399
just like OG Kush like any OG uh is I'm

2385
01:45:16,679 --> 01:45:21,399
I'm downless yeah hey you know that

2386
01:45:18,399 --> 01:45:24,960
alien cookies uh I used that in the in

2387
01:45:21,399 --> 01:45:27,279
breeding I like the it uh it's nice I

2388
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:29,960
actually back bread it into uh my

2389
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:31,759
Underdog and Ed it to get a man we got

2390
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:34,118
to end this pretty quickly I just want

2391
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:37,000
to add to what you just said I have a

2392
01:45:34,118 --> 01:45:39,598
clone called the p855 it's the Pluto

2393
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:42,399
times the E85 and I'm going to send you

2394
01:45:39,599 --> 01:45:44,639

01:45:42,399 --> 01:45:47,920
it to your buddy that that's holding on

2396
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:51,118
to your genetics till spring but uh it's

2397
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:54,239
an amazing plant for growing indoors or

2398
01:45:51,118 --> 01:45:57,399
outside um to me it checks all the boxes

2399
