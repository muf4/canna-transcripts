[Music]

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,039
what's up everybody this is Gabby from

12
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:48,719
the craft Growers Network joined with my

13
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:52,079
co-host Nick wolf and my good and my

14
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,800
good friends NATO dog and

15
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,120
Sasha Sasha is my Hobbit brother from

16
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:01,558
Slovenia is how he likes me to address

17
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:03,679
him so um

18
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:05,759
yeah super excited about this show today

19
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,400
we're going to do part two of our

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,520
interview with Sasha and because we were

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,880
talking a lot of strain history I

22
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:15,199
decided to invite NATO dog who is a

23
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,239
specialist at conversing about these

24
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,320
topics so we're just going to get

25
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:20,798
started right away and uh I'll let you

26
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,279
continue saying what you were saying

27
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,240
before we started recording NATO dog oh

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,040
I mean I I was just saying like on the

29
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:29,319
on the other podcasts and stuff that I

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,439
do like the whole goal of it was really

31
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:34,319
to justy try to like bring like a

32
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:36,000
conversational element to it you know

33
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,559
because you know when you get into when

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,239
you get into weed or cannabis or

35
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,320
whatever you want to call it it's not

36
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:43,959
like you know anything it's like you

37
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:45,758
know what your friend group knows and

38
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:47,759
then you start getting little bits and

39
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,040
pieces of information you don't know how

40
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,359
correct it is or not maybe you start

41
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,399
reading some like High Times or you know

42
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:57,879
you get a hold of some stuff and in the

43
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,239
beginning you don't really know what's

44
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:02,000
right and what's wrong right and so like

45
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,239
for instance going back to like olden

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,478
times Gabby and I used to sit around his

47
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:10,519
house and smoke joints and read every

48
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:13,239
entry in every Seed Catalog that

49
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,719
existed like knowing nothing about those

50
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:17,439
breeders really or anything like that we

51
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,439
used to drool over oh my God this

52
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,959
thing's going to be done in six weeks

53
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,479
it's going to be this we used to think

54
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,120
that like you know breeding was like

55
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:28,119
every line was like well done and well

56
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,640
thought out and you would almost

57
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,039
memorize that stuff you would dream

58
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,399
about going to

59
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:38,479
Amsterdam you know and a lot of the

60
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,319
early strains that we got there's no

61
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:43,560
evidence behind any of it you're just

62
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:46,560
hearing the story from your buddy and

63
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,479
that could be like as accurate or wildly

64
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,120
inaccurate as imaginable because it's

65
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:55,679
just some random Stoner telling you

66
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,719
something so you know later I mean I

67
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,560
used to think when I used to read High

68
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:05,080
Times that every month I was gaining new

69
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,199
knowledge and now I'm like horrified

70
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,040
because because there's so much in there

71
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,280
that would like send you in the wrong

72
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:15,120
direction you know but you just don't

73
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,680
know it's like Wikipedia anyone can post

74
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,239
that's actually kind of the thing now

75
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,840
where it's like even with all the

76
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,319
internet and even with all the

77
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,000
information out there it's you still

78
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:27,679
need a little bit of experience to

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,598
navigate what like is really true and

80
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,400
amazing and what is like oh man that is

81
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:34,238
not what you want to do you know and it

82
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,120
makes me think of how like when you're

83
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,959
like a a beginner at almost anything

84
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,120
you're just like trying to vacuum up as

85
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,560
as much knowledge as possible but then

86
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,878
you get to a certain point where you

87
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,039
have like a good standard of knowledge

88
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:50,598
and you start to feel like you know even

89
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:52,239
less than than you should because of how

90
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:53,919
much you've absorbed and so you start

91
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,560
looking at everything skeptically and

92
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,639
start to be like I know that this other

93
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,400
thing wasn't true so how how can I look

94
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:03,359
at this with a skeptical lens

95
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,000
in America people talk about Bro Science

96
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,879
right you know the science of of weed

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,919
but like without like the scientific

98
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:12,518
method but that's kind of like all we

99
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,759
had but that's all we had we had

100
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,918
observations it wasn't so much like we

101
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,319
were wrong it's just that like we

102
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:22,240
couldn't go Gabby and I couldn't go in

103
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:25,279
1998 or 9 or whatever and be like what's

104
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,879
wrong with the chem dog like like go to

105
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:30,359
a university and be like Oh analyze this

106
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:31,839
and see how we need to it different yeah

107
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,960
yeah we couldn't do any of that so we

108
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,319
didn't have any of like the tools that

109
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,198
you other people could use and so it

110
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,759
ended up just being observation and

111
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:43,520
stories example of that is uh nutrient

112
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,960
deficiencies oh dude you want to hear

113
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:49,758
the the classic example I used to take

114
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,519
the nicest nug out of the sack and I

115
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,560
when I was in high school and put it in

116
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:57,079
this resin chamber in my pipe so that

117
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,720
every time I smoked it I was getting

118
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:02,599
hash and then that nice nug would be

119
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,560
coated in hash so when I finally smoked

120
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,199
it it would be better because it' been

121
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,639
infused and this was like this was the

122
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:12,280
top secret Tech like you'd buy a special

123
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,800
pipe with a chamber that you could fit

124
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:16,799
it in there and everyone thought you

125
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,280
were cool you know and like later on

126
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,240
obviously we realized that's garbage but

127
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,119
that was like that was well known that

128
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,720
was told to you they had whole pipes

129
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,720
built for that reason you had a resin

130
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,440
chamber with a resin chamber yeah yeah

131
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,319
you had a think the uh it makes me think

132
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:33,680
of the like Millennium blunts or

133
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,400
whatever people would call them where

134
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,120
they would take the roaches from all

135
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:38,599
their joints or Blunts and then roll

136
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,959
them up and like it gets me higher

137
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,360
because it's got all the res in it very

138
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:46,000
much so and that that kind of that kind

139
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,879
of thing it's like you don't realize I

140
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,639
mean that's the crazy part for me too is

141
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,839
like if you go back all the way like the

142
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,240
first books I bought like Rob Clark

143
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:58,279
marijuana botne or something like

144
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:01,478
that I give mad respect to that guy

145
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:04,079
because nobody nobody even knew the

146
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:06,560
information he put in there like how do

147
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,758
you get a plant to flower what does it

148
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,240
take like what do the different parts of

149
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,639
the plant do how do they respond to

150
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,038
stuff and so when it's something's

151
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,199
illegal and you can't just go read about

152
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:21,519
it you have to sort of like you know you

153
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:23,879
have to figure it out you really do yeah

154
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,839
can I ask you the a question not so like

155
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:31,598
where did you get your first conab seats

156
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:33,879
from oh so that is interesting because a

157
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:36,319
gabby will laugh at this when I was in

158
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:37,959
high school the only import that I was

159
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,080
aware of in the middle of the country

160
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:43,159
cuz I'm I was from Chicago right which

161
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:46,359
is like smack dab in the middle I got

162
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,720
green colored Mexican and brown colored

163
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,400
Mexican right and so I don't I don't

164
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,120
tell this story too much but like

165
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:56,159
my I used to when I was in high school I

166
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,000
used to sit in my room at my parents

167
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,439
house and like pick all the seeds and

168
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,519
stems out of the weed that I had bought

169
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,959
and throw it out the window so I could

170
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:08,799
clean it up before you used it because

171
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:11,159
it all came with seeds and stems and my

172
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,879
very first grow I actually took a

173
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,560
picture cuz my parents just moved out of

174
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:19,120
their house this last spring so I my

175
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:22,598
very first grow was I was mowing my

176
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,079
parents lawn in Spring and I came around

177
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:26,639
the corner and lo and behold underneath

178
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:29,198
my window where I've been throwing all

179
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,439
these all this all the seeds and stems

180
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,280
there was was three or four Mexican

181
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,560
cannabis plants about 2 feet tall

182
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,679
growing out of the

183
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,959
bushes right and they lived about before

184
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,519
you noticed they yeah they I mean it was

185
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:44,198
just they lived about 15 seconds after I

186
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:46,158
discovered them I took that lawn mower

187
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:48,478
dude and I hammered him as hard as I

188
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:50,399
could because I had know where to put

189
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,439
them I had know what to do I just knew

190
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:56,000
that like if my mom or dad saw it I

191
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:59,759
would be grounded for a long time and so

192
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,560
yeah my first huh how old were you must

193
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,038
have been a sophomore or a junior in

194
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:08,240
high school at best what me I wanted so

195
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:12,158
14 huh 15 14

196
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:15,478
15 16 right in there and then um to

197
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:18,199
actually answer your question though is

198
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:20,878
like I Gabby and I used to go to Dead

199
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,598
shows right and at the Grateful Dead

200
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,520
shows there would be people would bring

201
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:27,839
their nice weed to the parking lot or to

202
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,918
the concert and you could bump into

203
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,839
those people sometimes so I pumped into

204
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:35,399
someone and I got what we now call as

205
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:38,158
kind bud and it was very expensive and I

206
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,799
didn't know how to get it everybody that

207
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:43,000
I knew that knew how to get it was at

208
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,759
Grateful Dead shows and all my friends

209
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,360
that I had back in Chicago they knew how

210
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:51,039
to get Mexican so actually dude when it

211
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,039
comes to First cannabis seeds I went out

212
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:56,480
to Amsterdam pretty

213
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:59,599
early because I didn't know anywhere

214
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,480
else to get good weed besides literally

215
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,720
wanding around a Grateful Dead parking

216
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,600
lot and trying to make friends and going

217
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,600
to

218
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,440
Holland mhm right so when I first went

219
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,879
to

220
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,800
Amsterdam which was I believe when the

221
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:17,039
summer I turned 18 which would have been

222
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:18,199
like 1994 or something like that I knew

223
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,679
nothing about

224
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,959
Amsterdam I mean nothing right so I went

225
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:26,319
there I knew enough because the high

226
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:28,159
times I knew that that you could buy

227
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,240
weed and you could buy

228
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:32,759
seeds I I didn't know there was a red

229
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,440
light district I didn't know there was

230
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:36,679
smart shops that you could buy and when

231
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,079
I walked in as like dude as a Grateful

232
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:41,719
Dead hippie kid walking into a shop

233

where they had legally growing living

234
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:49,040

like the were like all we know it and uh

284
00:11:53,759 --> 00:12:00,799
the next year this guy had already uh

285
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:03,879
was it in it was was in in German

286
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:06,039
because he got it in German he went to

287
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:08,480
to somewhere in Austria or Germany maybe

288
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:11,278
at that time because seeds were allowed

289
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,879
at that time in Germany and also there

290
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:17,320
was a very big wheat scene in

291
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:19,759
Switzerland at that time you could buy

292
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,399
there was so much wheat in Switzerland

293
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:24,078
until 2001 2001 it stopped in

294
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,078
Switzerland they were growing High

295
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:30,838
potent THC flowers putting them into

296
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,359
bags like like like like uh you had

297
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:35,279
pillows they called them pillows and

298
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,959
they said it's aroma

299
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:40,120
therapy so it's like yeah they were

300
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:42,439
selling them in few you know Switzerland

301
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,198
is in three conton you know you have the

302
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,720
French speaking contone the German

303
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:49,599
speaking contone and the old Roman

304
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,720
speaking Italian and Roman yeah so it's

305
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:56,159
like and in few they have this law that

306
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,199
you could actually sell the the the

307
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:01,600
wheat the the the Bots for aroma therapy

308
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:05,719
so if you get into this little shop they

309
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:08,159
have buckets of kilo of wheat inside and

310
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,600
you said if you ask them what is the

311
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:13,519
best to smoke they were not selling you

312
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,440
nothing they throw you out yeah this is

313
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:19,159
not for smoking they say it's just for

314
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,880
you know because aroma therapy they sell

315
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:23,958
you the pillows but of course behind of

316
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:27,639
this was was a really big weed scene you

317
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:30,278
know so like in in America we used to

318
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:33,480
have it used to be really hard to get

319
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:36,120
stuff to smoke with I grew up in Chicago

320
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,199
so like in in that era it was really

321
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,879
hard to find the crappiest papers you

322
00:13:38,198 --> 00:13:43,439
could imagine at a gas station we had to

323
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:46,919
drive to a different state Wisconsin to

324
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,440
even get pipes right and if you because

325
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:51,278
it was all illegal and if you went in

326
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,000
like everybody everybody in America of a

327
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:57,439
certain age if you went in you were

328
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,120
buying the pipe to smoke

329
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,880
tobacco right and if you so you had to

330
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,799
call it a water pipe if you called it a

331
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:07,559
bong like for smoking weed you could be

332
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:10,240
an undercover cop trying to get the

333
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:12,039
store in trouble for selling gear that

334
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,440
was used for drugs so they would throw

335
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:17,278
you out so they would have big signs on

336
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,519
the wall right only ask for water pipes

337
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:22,559
we do not sell anything but for tobacco

338
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:25,198
use only water pipe so like even just

339
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:28,719
saying the word bong would get you

340
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:30,879
tossed out right for us this is totally

341
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,800
on you know it's ridiculous that would

342
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,039
never happen ridiculous for us too they

343
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:37,439
would never they would never arrest

344
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,799
somebody for selling bongs or something

345
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,079
because you have shops here that sell

346
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:45,359
cannabis plants in Austria but you also

347
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:47,159
have shops that are not selling Canabis

348
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,440
plant but they sell all the other stuff

349
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:53,000
for par how you say it

350
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,279
paria you know what I mean all this you

351
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,600
know they sell only for consuming but

352
00:14:55,278 --> 00:15:00,639
for example in my shop we don't sell

353
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,278
anything not even papers nothing to

354
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,799
consume we are a gardening shop we don't

355
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,879
sell you know we have you have soils

356
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:10,240
fertilizers we have seeds we have you

357
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:12,439
know pots we have uh you know all kind

358
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,079
of stimulants everything micro rasal

359
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,759
fungi everything blah blah blah but we

360
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:19,519
don't sell you bongs papers something

361
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,360
that you would consume wheat because

362
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,839
this is not our we are a library of you

363
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:28,360
know connection of makes a connection

364
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,480
yeah that yeah and actually we

365
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,360
specialized on the library you know to

366
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,920
to keeping genetics keeping good

367
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,120
genetics in a very good form but also

368
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:40,958
the old ones which everybody threw away

369
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:44,039
in Austria in the last 10 years you know

370
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:47,078
all the shops got R of the old cuts

371
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:49,559
which I was like crying for me was like

372
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:51,078
what are you doing guys you know you

373
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:54,399
forgot about the

374
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:57,039
Codex the C you know yeah I mean they

375
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,039
what I didn't realize as a kid and I

376
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,360
think this is like true of almost any

377
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,480
thing is that I thought that the weed

378
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,318
scene would stay relatively

379
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,120
static I didn't realize that like every

380
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:10,879
5 years there was going to be a sea

381
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,360
change in what you could get what was

382
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:16,360
available what would be common and easy

383
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:20,240
would become rare you know or impossible

384
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,879
or even legendary as time went on now

385
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,519
that I understand weed people and I've

386
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:27,240
spent my adult life in it I get why

387
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,519
things happen the way that they do and

388
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,079
the various things that get lost I mean

389
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,399
I can say from my

390
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:35,599
experience people laugh at me dude

391
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:38,720
because they'll be like how did you

392
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,839
collect all these amazing genetics right

393
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,879
and I'll be like it's really easy you

394
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:44,880
just hold on to things for years when

395
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,879
nobody else wants

396
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:50,399
them right like that's the thing is it's

397
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:53,120
like in all cannabis scenes I've seen

398
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,480
everyone wants what's popular and what's

399
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,000
easy to sell or move or grow at the

400
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,240
moment but what happens when something

401
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,440
goes through a period perod where people

402
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,359
don't want it for a while it might not

403
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,759
have anything to do about its quality or

404
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:07,879
whether you like it but it might go

405
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:11,919
through a period where like it's just

406
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:15,079
not popular and most people will dump

407
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,799
whatever it is if it's not popular and

408
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:19,159
they just want to hold on to the things

409
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,519
that are currently in the moment and so

410
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,558
that's what you were just saying where

411
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:24,959
it's like there's it's almost like a I

412
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:28,240
don't know what when you want to call it

413
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,160
a disease or whatever but Nostalgia it's

414
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,480
well I just I just laugh that it's like

415
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,798
I mean I literally because I live in

416
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,599
meno and I had the ability to I just

417
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:39,200
started holding on to things that I

418
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:42,159
personally

419
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,558
enjoyed right because I we I'd grow

420
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,798
whatever it was that needed for the

421
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:47,599
market but then we'd have a section like

422
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,918
for instance Gabby and I were talking

423
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,839
about it the other day the thing that

424
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:54,200
he's really famous for bringing the chem

425
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:56,158
dog West to California we never cropped

426
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,440
a ton of chem dog because it was really

427
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:02,919
ugly and most Brokers didn't want it it

428
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,320
so we would grow it for ourselves mhm we

429
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:07,120
would grow a few pounds for like us and

430
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:10,720
our friends and everything like that but

431
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:13,678
we were typically growing something else

432
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,360
to make the market happy you know and

433
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,880
then later on people were like oh my God

434
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,439
you had this legendary thing and I was

435
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,400
like dude it was so legendary nobody

436
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,200
wanted

437
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:26,360
it you know like that's not it's not

438
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:28,038
100% true like people that had smoked it

439
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:30,038
yeah people that wanted to smoke they

440
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:33,240
wanted it but people that wanted to buy

441
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:35,400
weed to sell it was a little bit risky

442
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,319
because it wasn't as and just like today

443
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,640
it's it wasn't as pretty it's ugly it's

444
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:43,279
legitimately it's I mean it's like like

445
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:47,000
I have bulldogs and they're like so ugly

446
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:49,240
they're cute you know that's kind of you

447
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,679
know like they are but that's kind of

448
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,159
like the that's kind of like the chem

449
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:56,480
dog like it but to me it's like all weed

450
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:59,400
looks the same when you roll a joint of

451
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,640
course that is my point too

452
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,559
same thing I believe in this Gabby last

453
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,038
time told me another theory like you

454
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:08,480
know but it's like we are all the same

455
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:10,679
actually you enjoy it even if you have

456
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,200
sex with a woman that is not physically

457
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:15,120
attractive to other guys maybe to me it

458
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,240
is you know what I mean I have my own

459
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:21,158
taste you know what I mean but generally

460
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,640
that that's a funny analogy dude because

461
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:24,679
I actually say there's I think there's

462
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,880
like there's there's weed out here right

463
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:29,440
now that's really gorgeous and doesn't

464
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,280
do anything for me and so all joke to my

465
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,000
friends it's like having a super hot

466
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,678
girlfriend that's really mean to you you

467
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,679
know like everybody else is impressed

468
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,200
and like they're all like so pumped that

469
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,480
you pulled this girl and you're like no

470
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,840
she actually isn't she doesn't treat me

471
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,000
very well you know like she might be

472
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:46,558
real pretty to look brother brother you

473
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,400
suffer you suffer right you know when

474
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,440
you with her you're actually suffering

475
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,240
but everybody thinks you are enjoying it

476
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:57,200
it's like no it's not like say you know

477
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:00,159
like when it comes to humans

478
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,279
80% of like our nerve end like there's

479
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:05,799
so much connectivity between our eyes

480
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:09,000
and our brain like our eyes for people

481
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:11,079
are way better than our nose or our

482
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,519
sense of taste or our hearing we're

483
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:18,240
basically like our species is really

484
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:20,519
about here you know and so like visually

485
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,079
things are really important and when you

486
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:26,000
see social media you can't see you can't

487
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:27,839
see like uh you can't sniff it you can't

488
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,720
taste it you can't squeeze it you can't

489
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:33,038
smoke it but you can see it you know and

490
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,960
I even think talking about those

491
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:38,759
cataloges High Times went in the early

492
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,558
90s late 80s from like very poor

493
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:43,679
pictures to probably by like the mids

494
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:46,839
when you and I were talking about it

495
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,080
full glossy pictures in the center of

496
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:51,918
the magazine of White Widow and great

497
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:54,839
white shark and cie mist and all these

498
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,480
things and you would drool over those

499
00:20:54,839 --> 00:21:01,079
you would look at these pictures of

500
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:03,558
these buds you know just be entranced by

501
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:06,199
like could I get that you know brother

502
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:08,200
it is like also yeah we didn't have

503
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,159
internet at that time we didn't have

504
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,759
cell phones you know we have to tell

505
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:16,720
people also this in mind that there was

506
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:19,400
no internet there was no phones so you

507
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,759
basically was on your own experience you

508
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,440
saw what you saw from year to year and

509
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:26,558
then you made a picture and then

510
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,600
everything else you know overgrow.com

511
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:32,000
when that [ __ ] came you know yeah we

512
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:34,038
were all there you were there also I

513
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,079
think too Gabby you were there

514
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:40,000
overgrow.com before it dropped I don't

515
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:43,399
know 2006 it dropped right it was over

516
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,960
so in 2006 there was the four I think

517
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,679
maybe there was this there was this seed

518
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,440
seller in Canada called Heaven Stairway

519
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:53,600
yeah stairways to Heaven that was the SE

520
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,159
which is a play on Le lead Zeppelin song

521
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:58,038
or whatever yeah and they got raided by

522
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,120
the by the government for selling tons

523
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:02,000
of seed because the big Market is always

524
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:04,678
America right so all these seed

525
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,759
companies they all get in trouble for

526
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:09,400
sending tons of seed to America so they

527
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:12,038
got rid and it turns out that overgrow

528
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:15,159
and cannabis world were both tied into

529
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:17,400
that company so when they got busted

530
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:20,720
like the two forums that everybody was

531
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:23,000
on and communicating fell off because

532
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,079
the parent company that owned it all of

533
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,319
a sudden was in trouble you know and

534
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:30,678
there was I mean Mark Emery used to have

535
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:32,439
like Mar who used to have a cannabis

536
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:34,519
Culture magazine and the back of the

537
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,320
magazine would be like a two or three

538
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:39,879
page um you know catalog of everything

539
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:42,558
he was selling but that was where I mean

540
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:46,080
we had to uh you know that that was

541
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:48,519
where you got seed I mean I feel dumb

542
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,879
like I wish that all of the stuff that

543
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:53,038
like we had done when we were younger I

544
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,039
had like put a pack or two of everything

545
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:59,359
I bought in in the freezer for later me

546
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:01,679
because I blew through so much stuff

547
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,639
picking choosing killing males getting

548
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,200
rid of anything I didn't want and I

549
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,320
didn't realize that like I wouldn't be

550
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,000
able to go back later on and get that

551
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:13,918
same stuff it would just disappear right

552
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,079
same thing the same thing you know the

553
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,200
stuff that I you know when I was talking

554
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:22,439
about the catalog that the guy showed us

555
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:25,440
you know at that time we started to buy

556
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:28,880
seeds never bought seeds before from a

557
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,840
from a catalog and those genetics not

558
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,960
only we bought it and we have the same

559
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:35,720
thing like you we lost things and but

560
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,960
other people like like luy when I was

561
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,480
telling you from the last podcast you

562
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,919
know he was also having some of these

563
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,880
trains you know the skunk number one for

564
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:48,640
example he bought in those times in the

565
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,360
'90s and my guys had like a selection

566
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,038
they have the number 11 and the number

567
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:55,918
16 it was very popular in in the Clone

568
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:58,720
form in the underground scene when it

569
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,278
was grown but people tell me now it was

570
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,000
all skunk number one but they were very

571
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:05,400
different from each other and there was

572
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,359
another one which was actually very

573
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:11,038
recessive it has the stripes like you

574
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:13,519
see on Dr greenspoon pictures today you

575
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:15,558
know uhhuh this kind of you know when

576
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,639
you have the plant you just have this

577
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:20,038
sack underneath you know where the one

578
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,240
seat should be but the whole BT was

579
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:24,879
consisting only from these little sacks

580
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,798
like you know it was stripes we called

581
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,240
them the they called it the some Jerry

582
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:33,200
some some with Jerry you know but you

583
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,038
know the genetics that came from those

584
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,960
three years I think you told in another

585
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:42,079
podcast that those was those was nville

586
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:45,038
stock stock that was still from nille

587
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:47,759
because it was yeah after since seed

588
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:49,919
bought the the seed bank they have still

589
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:52,599
his stock which they directly sold

590
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,799
actually yeah so I I didn't realize that

591
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:58,678
for the longest time but from basically

592
00:24:54,798 --> 00:25:00,158
from when they bought his stock in 1991

593
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:03,240
till about

594
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,679
1995 they literally just sold seeds that

595
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,399
Neville had already

596
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:09,640
made so for the first four years that

597
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:12,079
Sensei was selling all that they weren't

598
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,480
even making any new stuff they were just

599
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:16,240
selling like what Neville had already

600
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,960
made and then when they ran when they

601
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,679
started running low they hired him again

602
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:26,720
and he came in and that's where like the

603
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:28,440
the Jack herrer and the Black Domina and

604
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,519
some of those other things that they

605
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:35,480
started adding new stuff to the catalog

606
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:38,480
but if you get a 91 92 93 94 addition

607
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:42,000
sensey catalog it's literally the exact

608
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:45,038
same listing of strains no change one

609
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
question if if you would have somebody

610
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:52,679
in the world now that is listening if he

611
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:55,319
has a pack from 91 till 95 for example

612
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:58,798
of sensey seeds in his fridge or even

613
00:25:55,319 --> 00:26:00,960
not I mean you know

614
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:04,480
probably they are not going to sprout

615
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,360
but the question for you Noto would it

616
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:10,159
Sprout with the help of gibberelic

617
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:13,240
acid and I will say that if it was if it

618
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:16,720
was stored well there is a chance that

619
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:19,278
it will Sprout so if it's stored poorly

620
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,159
or something happens to it like

621
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:23,079
physically that's kind yeah that's kind

622
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:25,440
of a tangent but like Gabby and I did

623
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:28,519
all this work all this breeding work for

624
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,720
a long time together and uh I lost my in

625
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:34,759
an unfortunate event and I think he was

626
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,919
on vacation in Jamaica or something and

627
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:39,919
he had all of his stuff in a fridge or

628
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:41,960
freezer and the breaker popped if I

629
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:45,080
remember right and it was just the seeds

630
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:48,640
got hot in a garage for X number of

631
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:50,798
weeks you know but I've taken 20 30 year

632
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,960
old seeds and I've gotten some of them

633
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:56,000
to pop so it just depends on how they're

634
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,399
stored temperature that is not

635
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,119
fluctuating too much from plus to minus

636
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:02,918
right that is

637
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:04,678
some yeah I'll tell a story and I mean I

638
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:06,919
told it a little while ago but I'll tell

639
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:09,360
a different version of it so when I

640
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:11,640
first moved out to California my ex my

641
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:14,719
ex lady with the reason why we moved is

642
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,640
she had cancer and so I we moved out to

643
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,159
mesino County because it was like the

644
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,600
most California passed the first laws in

645
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,919
America where if you were sick you could

646
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:27,439
have access to cannabis right and they

647
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,919
had just done that the year before in

648
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,240
1996

649
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:34,320
and so we ended up planning in '97 to

650
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:36,480
move and we moved in '98 and I had a

651
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,519
friend that blew glass right and he

652
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,159
realized that like blowing glass like

653
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:43,398
spraying all that oh yeah spraying all

654
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:46,159
that gold and silver on your pipes was

655
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:48,079
unhealthy so we hired this old H this

656
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,360
old like HVAC heating and air

657
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:52,240
conditioning guy to help us build like a

658
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:54,158
hood and like all that right get a

659
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,359
little bit more professional well he

660
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,760
ended up being sick with cancer and I

661
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:02,199
felt really bad for him he was old he

662
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:04,919
was kind of poor to be perfectly honest

663
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,880
and he was kind of struggling and so I

664
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:09,000
was going through it with my ex and so I

665
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,440
gave him a quarter pound of weed or

666
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,960
something and some hash and I told him

667
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,640
you know don't even worry about it dude

668
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:19,319
just just hopefully it makes you feel

669
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:21,278
better right and so he felt so he wanted

670
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:24,480
to do something for me but he didn't

671
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:27,519
have anything really so the next time I

672
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,519
saw him he brought me a couple of seeds

673
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:33,120
in a in in a medicine thing right and he

674
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:34,759
was like man he's like I these just been

675
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,759
in my closet I used to grow weed a

676
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:39,879
million years ago I don't even know what

677
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:44,440
you'll find of them okay but but try

678
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:46,880
okay so I Sprout these things I grow

679
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,640
them up all right and one of them comes

680
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,159
out the most the only the only one that

681
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,519
lived came out the most beautiful purple

682
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:55,760
color and it ends up being called what

683
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,359
now what we call the Mendo perss right

684
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:00,278
and so I brought it back to him and he

685
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:02,000
was like oh my God this is the point of

686
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:03,720
the story I brought it back to him and

687
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,440
he was like oh man I only grew purple

688
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:09,360
weed once and that was in the summer of

689
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,240
77 in Koval which is this Podunk little

690
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:12,798
town in

691
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,599
Mendo and so really like the moral to

692
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:16,558
that is that those seeds when he gave

693
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:20,359
them to

694
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:22,000
me I was 22 or something and the seeds

695
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:25,599
were

696
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,200
21 oh so I had 21-year-old seeds and he

697
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:30,959
had just tossed them in like a cool

698
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,840
closet yeah in on his mountain house and

699
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,240
he lived on like the when you live on

700
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:38,000
like the Northeast side of a mountain up

701
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,000
in the hills you don't get very much sun

702
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,599
no you know it's like you really don't

703
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,398
like and he lived in the woods kind of

704
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:46,038
cuz he was a logger and some trees or

705
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:49,000
whatever so it was like we yeah I took

706
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:53,319
21y old seeds at the time do you think

707
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:56,398
it's from from Afghan origin I think

708
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:58,319
it's nepes but I I'm just guessing and

709
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:01,839
the only reason why I say that is

710
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:04,839
because once I met like real collectors

711
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,720
in Holland I started getting taken back

712
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:08,439
to their flats or their apartments or

713
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,159
whatever and they would like smoke weed

714
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,720
with me and we would chat and the nicest

715
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:16,120
hash they had was they were all trading

716
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,798
these nepes Temple balls they felt like

717
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:22,518
that was the best and when I smoked that

718
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:25,038
it tasted to me like the Mendo PE mhm

719
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:28,319
but I have no idea what it is to be

720
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:31,200
honest I mean um I do think I do think

721
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,278
it's that old too because it's really

722
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,278
low

723
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:38,640
THC so it kind of fits that era of

724
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:41,960
Canabis you know in the sense that like

725
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,720
most cannabis in the 70s was between 7

726
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,319
and

727
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:49,919
12% yes you know like and so it tests

728
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:52,439
kind of like between eight and 12 you

729
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,840
know really T amazing yeah but it tastes

730
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,320
amazing I mean Gabby and I actually

731
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:58,439
became friends and and when like when we

732
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:00,798
first started becoming good friends me

733
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:04,200
and my friend Sean who's passed we left

734
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:06,200
a couple joints uh of the meno on like

735
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,278
Gabby's window I can't remember like on

736
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,558
his my wind I we on his windshield or

737
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:15,119
something like that and left our number

738
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:16,599
and like yeah that's literally how we we

739
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:18,439
that's that's literally how we became

740
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:20,000
friends is we talked all this stuff and

741
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,440
we wanted to leave him a little gift and

742
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,880
so we left him a joint and so yeah you

743
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:29,480
can improperly store seeds and then you

744
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,360
might need like embryonic recovery or

745
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:35,038
something that's beyond my paygrade to

746
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:38,038
figure out how to do it but do it

747
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:40,679
through like tissue culture and uh you

748
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:42,480
can pull the embryo out of the shell we

749
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:46,200
need to find somebody to help us get

750
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:50,798
this a long process this is this is this

751
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:55,319
is it the end howo dog got his name

752
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:57,158
right there oh my God yeah I mean I I um

753
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:59,359
we Gabby and I did a ton of breeding

754
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:01,440
together and through A Series of

755
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:04,278
Unfortunate Events a bunch of it got

756
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,159
lost and then what got survived at

757
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:09,278
Gabby's went through a heat treatment

758
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:11,600
and I lost the rest in a fire in a fire

759
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:14,159
yeah yeah hey uh I want to change

760
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:16,158
direction real fast but before I do I

761
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,679
wanted to say that uh I thought the

762
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,600
question that Sasha was going to ask was

763
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:23,919
if you could go back in time and get any

764
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:24,959
one pack of seeds that you could from

765
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,960
back in the

766
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:31,240
day and for me the answer would be

767
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,278
sensey Seed Super

768
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,919
Skunk like it's like not even a I mean

769
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:37,319
there's other ones like that I'd really

770
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,759
want but if I it's like if you had to be

771
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:41,398
on a desert island and you could only

772
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:44,398
bring one thing the Sensei Seed Super

773
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:47,038
Skunk that's the one that got away I

774
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:51,000
might have two or three but but yeah

775
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:53,200
that would be one I got to choose

776
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,519
one I thought that's what Sasha was

777
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,679
asking oh yeah no I mean there's a I

778
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:01,679
mean what's funny about it too is the

779
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:05,798
way seeds are is like you could go buy a

780
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:10,360
bunch of legendary seed and get all crap

781
00:33:05,798 --> 00:33:12,398
or you know buy one pack and find a gem

782
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:14,079
you know I mean the super skunk from

783
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:16,119
Neville was so consistent we used to

784
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:18,119
hold the magazine up against our flower

785
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:20,638
every crop and be like holy [ __ ] looks

786
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:24,079
just like the that is actually true Abby

787
00:33:20,638 --> 00:33:26,959
and I we had I think it was the 1990 uh

788
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:29,240
seed bank catalog uh had a nice big

789
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,360
picture of super skunk butt in it was

790
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,399
the first year it was released and you

791
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:35,839
could take a side nug off the super

792
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:38,638
skunk that Gabby gave me and you could

793
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:42,519
hold it up to that picture and it looked

794
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:45,439
like you had picked the bud that he had

795
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:47,839
used to take that picture I mean it was

796
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,840
like it was it was a we used to joke it

797
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:55,480
was like a perfect example but it was

798
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:57,079
also it was also a bust because Gabby

799
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,000
has a different memory than me I don't

800
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:04,519
remember having carbon filters back then

801
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,798
there was and so I them I would have I

802
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:09,000
mean I don't know that I didn't buy

803
00:34:05,798 --> 00:34:11,440
maybe I remember like those like ozone

804
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,398
generators I remember having an ozone

805
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,720
generator in and then venting and then

806
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:19,000
having like it go through 25 or 30 feet

807
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:22,078
of ducting before it went out the

808
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,760
house right because when that that super

809
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,440
skunk was a bust that turp that

810
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,079
everybody's after right now yeah that

811
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,760
exact back picture that turp that

812
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:33,679

861
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,639
was in 2001 that I was in Amsterdam I

862

was a wiad before that already you know

863
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:46,078
in the '90s but you know this was just

864
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,920
like uh if traveling you know like do

865
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,318
some [ __ ] you know some crazy [ __ ] in

866
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,800
your life that then you will never

867
00:36:49,318 --> 00:36:54,759
forget it was Unforgettable experience

868
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,400
you know we were 2 months in Mongolia we

869
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,960
were hitchhiking horses you know no you

870
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,440
know you have you have like the capital

871
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,559
then you have you wrote on the back with

872
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,838
somebody else uh you know it's like they

873
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:09,119
don't have like public transportation

874
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:11,400
there it's like you have it but it's not

875
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:16,519
there is no roads like there are there

876
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:20,160
are uh them on the stars and on you know

877
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:23,800
it's crazy it's there is so vast it's

878
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:26,239
like three time of France is Mongolia

879
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:29,000
and it 2 million people like

880
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:32,519
Slovenia you understand it's like it's

881
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,639
like I mean and 1 million of people live

882
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:38,800
live at that time in UL in the capital

883
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:41,920
so it was like uh the only land world

884
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,720
that did not have possession of land

885
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:47,079
because there are nomadic people the

886
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:49,000
bers hang hang around you know like

887
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:52,880
where the G is then the cattle will be

888
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,119
fed and you know continue so it's a very

889
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,318
harsh environment to live in really

890
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,720
harsh but you have

891
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:04,800
me about how old were you uh when I was

892
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:07,838
traveling there 18 years 18 years old 19

893
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,200
19 19 years 18 to 19 yeah yeah 19 at

894
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:12,039
that time all right for example we were

895
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:13,879
many places in Mongolia like in the

896
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:17,159
South in goby desert and then in the

897
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:22,358
capital of course in First and traving

898
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:25,159
North and North is uh go uh to the of uh

899
00:38:22,358 --> 00:38:28,239
elevation and you have SE uh which is

900
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:30,838
drinkable water this is you know in

901
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:33,199
Russia there is this Bal lake is one of

902
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:36,719
the biggest lakes in the world M so

903
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:42,039
south of Bal lake is a lake called hovor

904
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:47,519
Hol n it's called Hol and it's like 40

905
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:51,279
kilomet in or 30 km uh and 50 60 km Long

906
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:54,880
Lake and it's 1% of all the drinkable

907
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:58,560
Water Supplies on Earth there in this

908
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:01,640
Lake and I was there so on the way to

909
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:05,400
this Lake there is a town called

910
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:08,598
eret and in this town you know we were

911
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:11,800
walking you know this was 2001 I and my

912
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:13,200
body and another friend were traveling

913
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,200
you know together and we were like

914
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:18,519
walking through you know this little

915
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:20,960
town the white guys you know and because

916
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:22,759
we are slovenians we stand a little bit

917
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,400
of Russian because it's like I don't

918
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,920
speak Russian but it's a Slavic language

919
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,200
my language is a Slavic language group

920
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,079
so I understand Russian because I don't

921
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:34,039
know to speak Mongolian man it's like

922
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:37,119
Mongolian is a really difficult language

923
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:40,400
you know it's hungarians have a Mongol

924
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:43,079
uh root of language like near me where I

925
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:46,280
live so it's a really it's a un finish

926
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:49,400
group of languages so you know to go to

927
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:53,079
wheat you know I'm too long wheat is

928
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:56,358
grown in Mongolia to the border to

929
00:39:53,079 --> 00:40:00,240
Russia from that Lake on there is wild

930
00:39:56,358 --> 00:40:02,960
feral which is actually aof

931
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:06,519
flowering is the basis of actually outof

932
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:09,519
flow this is a Siberian type of cannabis

933
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:12,519
it grows there in abundance you cannot

934
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:14,719
even know I mean this is white trees you

935
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:16,639
know how how you call them in English

936
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:19,919
there is this white trees with white you

937
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:22,799
know they have this white skin

938
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:26,000
and yeah and then it's only Canabis

939
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:29,119
underneath and you have this Aspen uh

940
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,440
forest in siia which are like you can

941
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:36,440
drive with the train through the Trans

942
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:39,760
Siberian uh you drive days through these

943
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,838
forests so much of that wood is there

944
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:45,760
you have to understand how big this area

945
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:48,078
is it's vast it's you know Mongolia and

946
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,880
then it's Kazakhstan next to it and

947
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:55,440
Kazakhstan is really huge also you know

948
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:58,039
it's and these areas are so un

949
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,880
inhabitated people that live if there

950
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:04,000
they don't know about conies or even if

951
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:06,519
they do it's a total different approach

952
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,440
would that be ruderalis this is

953
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:14,159
absolutely rudis yes yes and this is

954
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:16,920
like it never grows more than 40 cm you

955
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:19,679
know it knees maybe and then it's

956
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:22,039
flowering because it has no flowering

957
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:23,919
time because of the short winter times

958
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:26,318
the short yeah the short it has to get

959
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,760
it has to do it quick yeah and THC

960
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:31,599
levels are really low I mean that is we

961
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:33,640
that is maybe I don't know 5% 4%

962
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,800
something like that you know you just

963
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:37,719
get to smoke

964
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,519
more extract it it's growing wild it's

965
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:41,639
you know like it's everywhere you have

966
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:45,480
access you know you can do that spli in

967
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:48,239
your mou day of course it's right

968
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,240
everybody talks about land races right

969
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:53,318
which that obviously would be just like

970
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:55,118
wild feral populations but I don't think

971
00:41:53,318 --> 00:41:57,960
most people realize how much work it

972
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:00,280
would be to like take a land hand race

973
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,880
and bring it into something that like

974
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:05,800
modern style we would consider be happy

975
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,280
with like it's a lot of work you know

976
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,640
yeah and a lot of times we're just

977
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,760
taking work that's already been done for

978
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:15,078
decades prior with different people and

979
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:17,880
adding our own little flavor to it you

980
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:20,160
know but you know you want to take like

981
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,640
you were talking about earlier like some

982
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:25,318
Haze weed that had just like one little

983
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:27,558
KX two little KX three little KX know

984
00:42:25,318 --> 00:42:29,440
just big enough for one seed yeah that's

985
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:31,760
not what Growers want to see so you'd

986
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,720
have to take that and like breed it into

987
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,640
something and over time so it's like

988
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:38,639
hard to reinvent the wheel because the

989
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:43,239
wheel takes a lot of

990
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:46,558
work you know but so did you was there

991
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:48,639
people selling weed in Mongolia no no

992
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:52,480
one they give it to us you know we were

993
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:55,199
smoking joints in newspaper no smoking

994
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:58,358
papers there you man it's like even

995
00:42:55,199 --> 00:43:01,519
cigarettes were rolled in newspaper

996
00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:02,799
oh my God sources at that time I mean of

997
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:06,318
course now it's

998
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:09,400
2024 and it's a different story to also

999
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:13,199
know that at that time 80% of the

1000
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:15,838
population was under 20 years old when I

1001
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:19,318
was there this is it because they

1002
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:23,838
di% 80% of the population was under 20

1003
00:43:19,318 --> 00:43:25,639
years and 20 2 million and 400,000

1004
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:28,599
people was in all

1005
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:30,118
Mongolia that's the land is like three

1006
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:33,359
times

1007
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:35,720
France so just huge grass lands going

1008
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:38,239

1009
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:40,318
million uh in the land you know they

have 2 million people but they have 27

1011
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:44,519
million horses because this is the land

1012
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:45,880
of the horse you know they live with

1013
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:47,880
horses they survive with horses

1014
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,160
everything is with Hors all the culture

1015
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:52,358

you know you live your life you know

1058
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:53,199
it's also a great experience because

1059
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:53,200
you're not at home so we're not so

1060
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:59,118
alike but of course I like it when there

1061
00:45:55,838 --> 00:46:02,318
is wheat right so for example in the

1062
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:05,760
'90s you also been there we for us is

1063
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:07,318
the same thing you go there you know it

1064
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,800
from the cataloges you know it from the

1065
00:46:07,318 --> 00:46:10,880
seat Banks you know it's like wow I've

1066
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:14,318
been waiting for this moment so long and

1067
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:16,640
then I buy Bubble Bags there in 2005 or

1068
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:18,639
something when I was second time there

1069
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:21,400
and then you know bubble bags from from

1070
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:24,879
bubble man you know for the Ice Water HH

1071
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:28,119
technique so I okay so I have a question

1072
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:31,240
yeah um because we're talking about like

1073
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:33,838
your your worldly travel Sasha where is

1074
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:35,919
the craziest place that you found weed

1075
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:41,119
and were able to smoke

1076
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:44,280
it oh yeah Mongolia yeah the Mongolia

1077
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:46,599
that is the craziest place I saw it but

1078
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,240
I mean that it even exists I guess like

1079
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:50,200
where was it like something where

1080
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:53,838
because it sounds like in Mongolia it

1081
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:55,838
wasn't but but for people to have to use

1082
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:57,239
it it was just like wildly growing like

1083
00:46:55,838 --> 00:46:59,159
was there any place where you didn't

1084
00:46:57,239 --> 00:47:01,959
expect to find weed that you found it

1085
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:04,558
other than Mongolia and and and and but

1086
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:07,199
like found it in like a smokable not

1087
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:09,720
just growing out there in the wild

1088
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:12,199
everywhere I travel there was kabes

1089
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:14,159
everywhere go to antarc you know

1090
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:18,639
Antarctica it does not have wheat you

1091
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:18,639
know like you know but

1092
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:25,079
allic you know but weed is every

1093
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:28,159
everywhere weed is All Around the Globe

1094
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:31,318
I mean it's so spread now because wheat

1095
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:34,318
actually controls us the people you know

1096
00:47:31,318 --> 00:47:37,838
what I mean we die we become the food

1097
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:40,000
for those plants then actually they eat

1098
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:42,960
us sometimes people are like this in

1099
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,960
romantic fashion that like you like have

1100
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,838
you are the Whisperer of the plant or

1101
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,400
something you know like yeah yeah yeah

1102
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:52,920
you can be the Whisperer but she will

1103
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:55,000
eat you on I mean you know there's this

1104
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:57,639
uh there's this cool book if you're

1105
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,639
lucky cool book it's old now but it's

1106
00:47:57,639 --> 00:48:02,920
called the botney of desire right it's

1107
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:05,679
by this guy Michael Pan and it's a

1108
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:09,039
plant's eye view of the world right yeah

1109
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:13,118
and so instead of like focusing on us it

1110
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:16,279
focuses on like which plants used us to

1111
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:18,119
spread all over the place right and

1112
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:20,319
cannabis is one of his main examples one

1113
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:22,280
of the other ones is Apples because

1114
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:25,920
apples just come from Kazakhstan like

1115
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:29,119
you just mentioned yeah joh right yeah

1116
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:31,680
and they and used humans to go

1117
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:33,680
everywhere and now they exist everywhere

1118
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:36,480
where they used to exist just in this

1119
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:38,318
one zone right and um it's really

1120
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,358
interesting to like think about it from

1121
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:43,440
like well what does the plant want from

1122
00:48:40,358 --> 00:48:46,400
us and that's what cannabis gets from us

1123
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,838
is we have spread it all over the place

1124
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,358
yes and like when people were growing

1125
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:54,639
hemp hemp was one of the main things

1126
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:57,318
that sailors use to make rope and

1127
00:48:54,639 --> 00:49:01,719
sails so I read that

1128
00:48:57,318 --> 00:49:05,199
most sailing Expeditions would have hemp

1129
00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:09,318
seed in case they got Shipwrecked they

1130
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:11,879
could grow a crop and turn the hemp into

1131
00:49:09,318 --> 00:49:13,159
fiber so they could make sails or they

1132
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,200
could make ropes and they could try to

1133
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:18,399
get the hell out of there they could

1134
00:49:14,199 --> 00:49:21,399
make rafts whatever and so hemp seed and

1135
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:24,000
taking cannabis with them was important

1136
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:27,639
to Sailors it was probably also useful

1137
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,679
as a trade yeah and so you know yeah you

1138
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:31,159
you can trade you can make you can grow

1139
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:32,759
this thing and you can make ropes with

1140
00:49:31,159 --> 00:49:35,118
it you can do this I'll show you how to

1141
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:37,680
do it it was valuable and so they

1142
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,920
brought it everywhere and so that's kind

1143
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:42,239
of like it seems like it went everywhere

1144
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:46,159
based on you know as soon as wherever

1145
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:49,078
Sailors went it went too yes that's how

1146
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:51,239
it was spread actually right yeah that's

1147
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:53,720
pretty much you know yeah yeah

1148
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:56,159
definitely and you know the first seats

1149
00:49:53,719 --> 00:49:59,959
that we got here you know before we went

1150
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:03,039
to amster and the Cals it was actually

1151
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:04,920
land races because our guys you know

1152
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:07,318
here from Yugoslavia they could travel

1153
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:09,400
we were not under Russian uh

1154
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:11,838
Administration Yugoslavia was its own

1155
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,838
land we were the independent you know

1156
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:15,318
the the ones that you know I told in

1157
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:17,599
last podcast already about this a little

1158
00:50:15,318 --> 00:50:20,199
bit but we could travel all Africa all

1159
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:23,119
Asia almost because we we were you know

1160
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:25,960
Tito is the leader of Yugoslavia at that

1161
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:27,480
time he was like a superstar you know

1162
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,318
like a god

1163
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:32,039
he was a really really good friend of

1164
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:36,880
highis eloi the first oh

1165
00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:39,558
wow yeah yeah he was pal and Tito was

1166
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:42,039
like that you know in Tito's uh funeral

1167
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:44,839
all Hollywood came you know all all

1168
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:47,119
everybody from all the the leaders of

1169
00:50:44,838 --> 00:50:48,719
the world came for his funeral because

1170
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,680
Yugoslavia was at that time everybody

1171
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:54,399
knew what would happen because it do you

1172
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:57,440
know and then when I was young there was

1173
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:00,639
one car in America from you oslavia the

1174
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:06,920
Yugo Yugo the Yugo yeah they sold the

1175
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:09,318
Yugo over here and yeah yeah cheap and

1176
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:11,559
efficient it was the only car I've ever

1177
00:51:09,318 --> 00:51:12,599
seen in my life where the back seat was

1178
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:15,200
an

1179
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:18,000
option like you could get one without a

1180
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:20,960
back seat it could just be you know like

1181
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:24,159
it was there but you yeah it could just

1182
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:26,679
be you know so yeah but um you know it

1183
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:28,480
was affordable and you could get from a

1184
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:30,759
to be you know the story of Yugo but

1185
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,838
actually here it's a national it's like

1186
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:36,839
a Yugo was the only car you know that we

1187
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:38,798
so then I I have a question for you then

1188
00:51:36,838 --> 00:51:41,119
right which is kind of related to that

1189
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:44,440
so with the whole when I first went

1190
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:46,160
there was before the euro where

1191
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:48,079
everybody all the countries had like

1192
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:50,159
their own currencies and stuff like that

1193
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:53,839
like there'd be Deutsch marks in Germany

1194
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:58,519
or there'd be gilders in in Holland or

1195
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:58,519
Fran in France or whatever MH

1196
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:03,399
you know like when I first started

1197
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,000
going like the Iron Curtain had just

1198
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:07,960
fallen and like eastern and western

1199
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,119
Europe had been sort of

1200
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:14,480
separated by politics you know or

1201
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:16,160
governments for decades like once that

1202
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,480
started opening

1203
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:20,719
up you know like what were you

1204
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:23,798
restricted when you were young from like

1205
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:25,598
going to like Western Europe no never

1206
00:52:23,798 --> 00:52:26,880
never you could go wherever you wanted

1207
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:29,119
yes that was the difference between

1208
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,519
Yugoslavia and other countries that was

1209
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,838
under Russian

1210
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:36,798
Administration most of for

1211
00:52:32,838 --> 00:52:39,078
example Poland Czech and uh Republic

1212
00:52:36,798 --> 00:52:41,440
Czechoslovakia at that time countries

1213
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:45,000
were under Russian Administration they

1214
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:48,240
could not travel to the west but me but

1215
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:51,039
you could I could because West was here

1216
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:52,759
like few meters away from my house no

1217
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:55,318
yeah I get it and so did that was there

1218
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:58,359
as far as weed goes when that opened

1219
00:52:55,318 --> 00:52:59,798
up yeah there like a lot of exchange and

1220
00:52:58,358 --> 00:53:02,199
different things going on because all of

1221
00:52:59,798 --> 00:53:03,960
a sudden Europe was like more integrated

1222
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:07,519
you know uh interesting thing you know

1223
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:09,480
we never exported wheat to to you know

1224
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:12,639
like you know I mean some people did but

1225
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:16,559
it's like more or less we wheat from

1226
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:18,199
Albania that was your Mexican for us oh

1227
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,119
wow yeah that's what I was kind of

1228
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:21,838
getting

1229
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:23,599
at was your weed like where where where

1230
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:26,000
was weed being able to be grown like

1231
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:28,480
when things opened up because it is you

1232
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:32,679
know Alia it's in a place called you can

1233
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:36,880
Google YouTube it it's a it's a place in

1234
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:40,000
Albania that was really growing amounts

1235
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:42,838
of cannabis under also you know the

1236
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,960
government knew for that Albania was

1237
00:53:42,838 --> 00:53:48,920
like you know they you know this this

1238
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:51,720
place was so

1239
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:56,000
poor before it grew with that they

1240
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:57,759
became the most uh place in in Albania

1241
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,639
they were growing so much the whole

1242
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:03,599
village grew the whole surrounding all

1243
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:06,400
the village grew wheat and the

1244
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:09,318
neighboring Villages also did it then

1245
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:13,400
politics uh pressure on them and of

1246
00:54:09,318 --> 00:54:17,400
course it was shut down after some time

1247
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:19,200
but of course if amarat was shut down

1248
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:22,240
that does not mean you know that other

1249
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:24,639
places are still operating but it pops

1250
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:26,679
up yeah the problem is only that these

1251
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:28,798
people you know they have genetics Maybe

1252
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:31,000
that were good there to grow and

1253
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:33,400
everything but the problem is for the

1254
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,760
transport to to you know to get to

1255
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:38,798
certain places in Europe they were using

1256
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:41,160
like fuel tanks of trucks and you know

1257
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:43,199
and then the wheat was like you know

1258
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:45,719
that's you could smell the the the fuel

1259
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:48,798
you the fuel in it yeah you could it was

1260
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:50,639
totally see that I never consumed this

1261
00:54:48,798 --> 00:54:52,400
in my life because I was always

1262
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:55,000
Enthusiast you know in the '90s already

1263
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:57,119
I was H grower you know who and in the

1264
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,440
forest also I have my patch as a gorilla

1265
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:02,000
grower you know I uh me was like

1266
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:04,159
medicine you know you cannot do this

1267
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,440
with medicine it's over all right so let

1268
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:09,118
me ask let me ask you a question then

1269
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:12,480
when you were growing in the woods you

1270
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:14,440
know and all that like early on like um

1271
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:17,639
when did the weed need to finish before

1272
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:19,200
your weather got so bad that it was like

1273
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:21,000
cuz you know it varies obviously

1274
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:23,798
depending on where you live in America

1275
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,798
yeah you know some places it's really

1276
00:55:23,798 --> 00:55:28,559
hard to like get weed to finish yes in

1277
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:31,838
other places it's a lot warmer and a

1278
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:33,559
little bit nicer and all that but yes

1279
00:55:31,838 --> 00:55:34,838
but yeah when did when did weed finish

1280
00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:36,880
for you what kind of weed were you

1281
00:55:34,838 --> 00:55:38,358
growing were you getting Amsterdam Seed

1282
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,280
were you getting Holland seed were you

1283
00:55:38,358 --> 00:55:42,400
trying to grow local stuff that would be

1284
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:44,519
cool to talk about yes I can tell you

1285
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:48,760
this is very interesting

1286
00:55:44,519 --> 00:55:51,199
because you know in our places the in

1287
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:53,160
was the winter came earlier the cold

1288
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:54,279
temperatures were not like now that you

1289
00:55:53,159 --> 00:55:56,920
have in

1290
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:58,920
October you know we have in oober we

1291
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:02,119
have a weather like California does like

1292
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:05,119
we can grow late strains for for my

1293
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:07,160
perception which was in when I start to

1294
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:09,920
grow it you could not grow that kind of

1295
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:14,038
late you have to finish until end of

1296
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:16,519
September MH then the rain came yeah you

1297
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:19,760
have mold and everything but also there

1298
00:56:16,519 --> 00:56:22,038
is another thing we started to realize

1299
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:24,559
that there is some strains some genetics

1300
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:26,640
that is also produced in Switzerland and

1301
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:29,880
one of those companies or two I will

1302
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:32,639
mention now one was the Alpine seed

1303
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:35,920
company and the other one was Green

1304
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:39,759
Hornet he was from both of them were

1305
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:42,519
from Switzerland and they used genetics

1306
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,200
that finished earlier they were breed in

1307
00:56:42,519 --> 00:56:48,880
the mountains

1308
00:56:44,199 --> 00:56:50,719
outside in Switzerland in the 90s uh

1309
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:53,680
famous trains of Switzerland it's called

1310
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:56,239
ER Bly it's called strawberry St

1311
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:58,118
strawber you know that's where the St

1312
00:56:56,239 --> 00:57:00,318
strawberry comes actually from because

1313
00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:03,200
this is the airbe lead what was grown in

1314
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:07,038
the '90s in Switzerland it was a very

1315
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:09,759
fast finishing Indica strawberry plant

1316
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:12,319
they had no mold no issues with mt

1317
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,200
whatsoever it was Absol and it's a very

1318
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:17,159
fast routing it was really good for

1319
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:19,318
production and presumably they found it

1320
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:22,440
on a on a field because they could grow

1321
00:57:19,318 --> 00:57:25,440
fields of of plants at that time mhm so

1322
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:28,318
the selections was there people what who

1323
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:31,798
was doing this are wasal already at that

1324
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:35,558
time I mean just had opportunity

1325
00:57:31,798 --> 00:57:37,920
opportun you know Shanti Baba when he

1326
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:41,760
moved from Amsterdam where where did he

1327
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:44,000
go Putland of course because the

1328
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,920
opportunity was there until 2001 he

1329
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,519
could I think he's still in Switzerland

1330
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,960
and I don't know but he made a legal

1331
00:57:48,519 --> 00:57:53,280
business he's a legal producer now yeah

1332
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:55,798
yeah he made a legal business in

1333
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,920
Switzerland yeah and that's because he

1334
00:57:55,798 --> 00:58:00,639
he was in that time also when it still

1335
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,519
was legal before the illegalization with

1336
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:03,519
the

1337
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:06,199
criminalization of it happened I

1338
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:08,838
remember Gabby and I used to go to these

1339
00:58:06,199 --> 00:58:11,279
like Harvest festivals Festival might be

1340
00:58:08,838 --> 00:58:13,558
a big word Harvest Gatherings where a

1341
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,480
bunch of Growers would like they'd rent

1342
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:16,798
they'd rent a huge house and everybody

1343
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:19,679
would bring their weed and they would

1344
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:21,719
all talk shop kind of thing and it was

1345
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:23,838
still early enough that like overgrowing

1346
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:26,639
cannabis World hadn't been shut down yet

1347
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:28,880
right and I'll always remember there was

1348
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:31,118
these guys one of them was this uh

1349
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:33,400
gentleman named chip who later on made

1350
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:36,119
this soil company called royal gold in

1351
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:38,119
in California but he had gone to

1352
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:40,318
Switzerland right when they first opened

1353
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:42,680
up right and I always remember he had

1354
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:43,960
these pictures because in America it was

1355
00:58:42,679 --> 00:58:45,798
like hard to get away with it he had

1356
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:47,679
these pictures of himself standing in

1357
00:58:45,798 --> 00:58:51,400
these fields and in these huge green

1358
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:53,960
houses like with his hands up like this

1359
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:57,039
so you could see that he was just in

1360
00:58:53,960 --> 00:59:00,199
this you know football field sized

1361
00:58:57,039 --> 00:59:02,839
Greenhouse full of plants and I always

1362
00:59:00,199 --> 00:59:05,519
remember like at that time that was that

1363
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:08,440
was the biggest I'd never seen weed

1364
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:10,599
grown on that scale have you have you

1365
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:13,159
heard about a strain from Switzerland it

1366
00:59:10,599 --> 00:59:14,880
was originated from Switzerland called

1367
00:59:13,159 --> 00:59:17,879
purpura

1368
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:20,318
tiis never Dude tell me tell us about it

1369
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:23,079
yeah purp before you do it's not very

1370
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:26,480
often that people stump the genetic

1371
00:59:23,079 --> 00:59:28,599
experts so okay okay

1372
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,960
there you go yeah purpura you can Google

1373
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:33,079
it purpura

1374
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:35,639
tenses kind of a little bit of outlier

1375
00:59:33,079 --> 00:59:40,480
from hemp Fields I think you know it was

1376
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:43,318
very low low actually but okay it was F

1377
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:46,440
in some Alps region in the in

1378
00:59:43,318 --> 00:59:48,159
Switzerland region of Alps lady that had

1379
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:50,480
a really old

1380
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:53,358
garden and you can Google that story

1381
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:55,519
it's true it will tell you that story it

1382
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:58,558
was found in a garden patch of a old

1383
00:59:55,519 --> 01:00:02,000
lady a characteristic of this train that

1384
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:05,079
it has really red stems it has no

1385
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,798
deficiency but it has really bloody poor

1386
01:00:05,079 --> 01:00:09,359
poor red

1387
01:00:07,798 --> 01:00:12,280
stems

1388
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:14,440
um Switzerland breeders try to breed

1389
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:17,240
with it and they did they did many many

1390
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:21,200
crosses with it you know um to get these

1391
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:23,000
red stems you know sure because you know

1392
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:26,118
it you know have not red stems with

1393
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,960
green stems you know so but the red stem

1394
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:32,240
these poor poor red stems uh popular you

1395
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:34,720
know in you know '90s early thousands we

1396
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:36,558
when you Google this then you will find

1397
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:38,838
that you know but it's not high thsc

1398
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:41,160
strain it's a really low thsc strain

1399
01:00:38,838 --> 01:00:43,078
actually you know uh but for breathing

1400
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:45,719
purposes that you want to take some

1401
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:47,880
certain phenotypic uh character

1402
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:49,759
characteristics and you know to want to

1403
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:52,960
have it in your line you know to repeat

1404
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:54,480
it with a combination of it was adapted

1405
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,599
to the mountains it was adapted to the

1406
01:00:54,480 --> 01:01:00,199
mountain it would grow well her it was

1407
01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:02,160
adapted to the region and it finished in

1408
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:05,078
I mean in the beginning of September

1409
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:07,000
already you know it was so fast oh wow

1410
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:10,720
yeah like the ER Bly you know like er

1411
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,760
Bly was also absolutely when really fast

1412
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:14,919
and then those guys from Alpine seats

1413
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:17,000
you know which is a guy you know can

1414
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:20,880
show you a book again because I'm a book

1415
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:24,760
lover this is a book called their

1416
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:29,640
Canabis which means Encyclopedia of

1417
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:32,319
breeding guy that is called Mike m and

1418
01:01:29,639 --> 01:01:35,000
the guy who is Mike m is actually one of

1419
01:01:32,318 --> 01:01:37,279
the main guys from Alpine seeds from

1420
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,838
that company that is was Switzerland

1421
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,640
company and they did hybrids they also

1422
01:01:39,838 --> 01:01:43,639
had

1423
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:45,679
some you know they had this Larry lemon

1424
01:01:43,639 --> 01:01:49,239
Larry OG Kush you

1425
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:50,919
know yeah they had like some cams also

1426
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:52,838
but they don't have the cam dog right

1427
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:54,760
you know I mean they had some really

1428
01:01:52,838 --> 01:01:58,078
good genetics they were really on the

1429
01:01:54,760 --> 01:02:00,200
right path having having a production of

1430
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:02,119
regular seeds you know and then Green

1431
01:02:00,199 --> 01:02:05,118
Hornet also and there were also some

1432
01:02:02,119 --> 01:02:08,240
others but I know these two for sure

1433
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:10,920
they there is a Bushman sativa clone

1434
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:13,439
that is still circulating in Austria

1435
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:15,920
very early there's a Bushman sativa

1436
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:18,679
clone yeah so that's that's one of the

1437
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:20,079
things maybe I don't know this is out of

1438
01:02:18,679 --> 01:02:22,239
left field for me but if we're going to

1439
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:24,798
talk genetics tell me it's okay we're

1440
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:27,399
just sitting on the couch what are what

1441
01:02:24,798 --> 01:02:30,239
are what are your favorite genetics over

1442
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:32,720
there like what are legendary clones for

1443
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:34,558
you what are things that you really love

1444
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:36,318
that you wish you could have again or

1445
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,798
that still exist out there what were

1446
01:02:36,318 --> 01:02:40,920
famous clones that were passed around

1447
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:44,599
and grown because in America we have our

1448
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:46,639
own list yeah yeah you know okay but

1449
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:48,440
with with Holland and Amsterdam and

1450
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:50,159
different things getting passed around

1451
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:52,159
and all that you guys have your own

1452
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:55,118
stuff and they're not exactly the same

1453
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:56,759
by any means yeah no no no so like what

1454
01:02:55,119 --> 01:03:00,559
are what are the things things like do

1495
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:57,159
story of the Shiva the the the lucky

1496
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,559

1498
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:05,599
maybe for your place Mand mandle bro you

1499
01:05:02,838 --> 01:05:09,159

1500
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:11,599
people left something now deal with it

1501
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:14,399
you know the guys who are you know who

1502
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:16,278
are likeminded like us now you know you

1503
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,039
like if you get that genetic of course I

1504
01:05:16,278 --> 01:05:20,400
will be the librarian again you know I

1505
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:23,440
will keep it forever and I will until I

1506
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:25,720
die and then hopefully somebody keeps it

1507
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:31,639
so jagon is one plant and then from

1508
01:05:25,719 --> 01:05:35,038
Dragon was uh green hin the green hin

1509
01:05:31,639 --> 01:05:38,038
was uh was a really big producer so grun

1510
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:41,039
hin is a offspring of jagen because

1511
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:43,559
somebody had jagen plants and they were

1512
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:46,839
pollinated by a warlock

1513
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:49,079
male yeah and warlock was by Magus

1514
01:05:46,838 --> 01:05:52,639
genetics yeah genetics was a company

1515
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:55,079
that then Simon from Sirus uh took under

1516
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:56,838
his uh I mean he took the genetics

1517
01:05:55,079 --> 01:05:59,440
because I don't know know Magus in one

1518
01:05:56,838 --> 01:06:02,558
moment was not Magus again and all the

1519
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:06,000
strains for Magus was with serious seats

1520
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:09,359
you know in one moment right so this

1521
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,960
grun hesin was even a bigger yielder

1522
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:15,119
jagon but jagon is a beast when you see

1523
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:17,838
it on seat finder you know it has a I

1524
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:20,278
mean the prodction but I don't like my

1525
01:06:17,838 --> 01:06:23,038
personal opinion I don't like the Turpin

1526
01:06:20,278 --> 01:06:25,079
it has this it was a sativa yeah of

1527
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:28,760
course it has a really sativa flavor and

1528
01:06:25,079 --> 01:06:32,278
everything but that's not my cup of tea

1529
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:35,079
personally you know for example that is

1530
01:06:32,278 --> 01:06:38,519
also like m m my cup of tea but it was

1531
01:06:35,079 --> 01:06:40,680
called Ivory it was a clone only it's

1532
01:06:38,519 --> 01:06:43,559
just called Ivory you can also find it

1533
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:45,480
with SE finder it was clone only I it

1534
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:48,200
has a really like taste like I mean it

1535
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:50,679
tastes like mushrooms and it was it was

1536
01:06:48,199 --> 01:06:51,879
purple you know we didn't have the Mando

1537
01:06:50,679 --> 01:06:54,879
perss you

1538
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:57,000
know a strain for example called Shaman

1539
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:59,240
from Dutch p

1540
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,079
okay yeah my guys from mountain region

1541
01:06:59,239 --> 01:07:05,679
grew it a lot I mean it was a you know

1542
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:09,839
this low TC sativa with really purple

1543
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:12,078
purple Bots sell it today as regulars

1544
01:07:09,838 --> 01:07:14,119
also maybe that's one of the only

1545
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:16,240
genetics that is still really original

1546
01:07:14,119 --> 01:07:18,798
with Dutch Bion I don't know I don't

1547
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:20,719
want to insult nobody or something sure

1548
01:07:18,798 --> 01:07:22,159
no I understand yeah it's just like none

1549
01:07:20,719 --> 01:07:24,639
of none of the none of the seed

1550
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:27,639
companies ever like to admix admit that

1551
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:29,358
their mix has Chang and it's not it's

1552
01:07:27,639 --> 01:07:31,159
not it's not a problem for me to you

1553
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:33,440
know I will not go in details now I I'm

1554
01:07:31,159 --> 01:07:36,239
not the guy you know who will like like

1555
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:38,318
um others that the genetics are not the

1556
01:07:36,239 --> 01:07:43,078
same but I know that they are not the

1557
01:07:38,318 --> 01:07:45,480
same so you know 20 plus years ago

1558
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:47,318
something like that I can't remember who

1559
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:51,079
they are but Gabby had some good friends

1560
01:07:47,318 --> 01:07:53,400
of his and they gave us a warlock cut

1561
01:07:51,079 --> 01:07:56,480
and we grew the Warlock yeah we grew the

1562
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:58,240
Warlock for a number of years mhm

1563
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,599
sure I didn't know anything about it I

1564
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:02,679
didn't know where it came from or

1565
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:05,400
whatever they had they gave us a Black

1566
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:06,759
Domina too and something else I can't

1567
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,000
remember um they were some friends of

1568
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:12,400
his from somoma but but yeah the Warlock

1569
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:15,239
it was pretty tasty you know Sasha if um

1570
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:17,039
if you could get one strain back that

1571
01:08:15,239 --> 01:08:21,158
you've lost over the years what would it

1572
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:24,319
be o the two male plans from yog that I

1573
01:08:21,158 --> 01:08:27,278
got from LPA Farms little pack my

1574
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:29,920
brother Ziggy that makes these papers I

1575
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:31,159
told last time this is Ziggy papers

1576
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:35,158
right

1577
01:08:31,158 --> 01:08:38,960
mhm he went to Colorado in

1578
01:08:35,158 --> 01:08:42,039
2015 or 14 uh before the legalization

1579
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:44,079
and he's a he sold his papers there so

1580
01:08:42,039 --> 01:08:46,679
somehow he got the

1581
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:50,798
seats uh it was little pack with this

1582
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:53,039
ape you know ape Loompa Farms you know

1583
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:56,759
and uh for me you have to understand I

1584
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:58,319
never T tasted OG before

1585
01:08:56,759 --> 01:09:01,279
because everything on the market in

1586
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:05,120
Europe what was called OG at that time

1587
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:07,080
when you already had it it was not o it

1588
01:09:05,119 --> 01:09:09,719
was not when was

1589
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:13,679
this

1590
01:09:09,719 --> 01:09:17,480
uh didn't you just say 10 yeah 2014 for

1591
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:20,480
15 yeah because 14 uh everything is like

1592
01:09:17,479 --> 01:09:22,798
I was already because I was a Enthusiast

1593
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:25,959
of other strains you know Switzerland

1594
01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:28,278
old races you know like I told you and

1595
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:30,880
then the Amnesia we grow a lot you know

1596
01:09:28,279 --> 01:09:34,239
the the the corut that is circulating

1597
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:37,039
still in Austria hypro genetics is from

1598
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:39,238
hypro it's actually Super Silver Haze

1599
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:43,000
right and I talked to Shanti also about

1600
01:09:39,238 --> 01:09:45,639
it and he said you know still Rose you

1601
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,039
know for silver H right it's just a

1602
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:52,159
right really nice phenotype yeah to the

1603
01:09:48,039 --> 01:09:55,800
conclusion that is uh yet OG you know is

1604
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:58,960
from a pack of seeds that Ziggy from USA

1605
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:01,600
from Colorado brought them and had them

1606
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:03,560
in the fridge and he called me uh to his

1607
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,520
place and you know I I got something

1608
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:07,080
really interesting for you because

1609
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,320
actually you will be the one maybe that

1610
01:10:07,079 --> 01:10:11,559
will do something with that and he gave

1611
01:10:09,319 --> 01:10:15,319
me a few packs not only that because he

1612
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:18,239
was the guy that also made uh for S he

1613
01:10:15,319 --> 01:10:21,759

1624
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:54,640
me the YG seeds and uh heard about this

1625
01:10:52,279 --> 01:10:57,599
before what Loompa Farms which seed

1626
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:59,360
company and and then I'm a nerd and I

1627
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:02,280
Google it of course I wanted to know

1628
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:04,679
everything about them because when I I

1629
01:11:02,279 --> 01:11:07,319
got three seats and another friend of

1630
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:10,760
Ziggy also got three seeds from the

1631
01:11:07,319 --> 01:11:13,519
other one he got three males and I got

1632
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:17,199
two males and one

1633
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:20,880
female so there was only one female in

1634
01:11:17,198 --> 01:11:23,559
six seats we had no selection nothing

1635
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:25,880
there was just the only one plant this

1636
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:29,480
was the Y that we knew

1637
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:33,560
and it had golf ball hard

1638
01:11:29,479 --> 01:11:36,639
nuggets stinky as uh I mean not stinky

1639
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:37,600
but it had a this certain certain Aroma

1640
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:41,000
you

1641
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:43,239
know certain Aroma I never smelled

1642
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,520
something and even even saw a plant like

1643
01:11:43,238 --> 01:11:48,439
this before it was so aesthetic for me

1644
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:51,239
it was like wow it's so beautiful look

1645
01:11:48,439 --> 01:11:53,678
at the the look at the corners look at

1646
01:11:51,238 --> 01:11:56,599
the dark leaves look at that you know it

1647
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:59,279
is and then you know uh a while a clone

1648
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:01,320
you know at my facility but it was very

1649
01:11:59,279 --> 01:12:03,960
lanky it was hard to deal with it was

1650
01:12:01,319 --> 01:12:07,198
really [ __ ] you know like what you know

1651
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:09,079
but I threw away the two males because

1652
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:10,879
when I grew this you know there was two

1653
01:12:09,079 --> 01:12:13,679
males I threw them away you know like

1654
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:16,279
okay that's two males and that plant

1655
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:18,560
actually uh you know I realized genetics

1656
01:12:16,279 --> 01:12:21,198
at that point so I started to study

1657
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:23,480
mandle you know the first and the second

1658
01:12:21,198 --> 01:12:26,319
and the third rule of mandle you know

1659
01:12:23,479 --> 01:12:30,839
the Gen genetics and I kept the plant

1660
01:12:26,319 --> 01:12:34,000
and we crossed it to SK V gear to double

1661
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:36,039
Crush mail so I keep and everything that

1662
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,039
comes out is actually very dominant in

1663
01:12:36,039 --> 01:12:40,960
the yeti so we had a very big selection

1664
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:43,279
and the yeti OG that I have now in my

1665
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:45,800
facility I will tell the truth now is

1666
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:48,880
not really Loompa Farm but it's a LPA

1667
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:51,760
Farm y cross to double

1668
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:54,400
Crush yeah because I I just looked it up

1669
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:57,520
I think Yeti OG is a back Cross of uh

1670
01:12:54,399 --> 01:12:59,839
headband B yes

1671
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:02,480
definitely yeah yeah you you know this

1672
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:05,440
plant with uh with b and I know not so

1673
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:08,519
from all your uh talks in the podcast

1674
01:13:05,439 --> 01:13:11,238
that is one of your favorites right I

1675
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:13,960
mean there's a few one of the hard Parts

1676
01:13:11,238 --> 01:13:16,439
about the American weed group is that we

1677
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:18,760
make nicknames for everything and we're

1678
01:13:16,439 --> 01:13:21,399
not very good at like lineage or any

1679
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:23,719
like we so it's like one group can call

1680
01:13:21,399 --> 01:13:25,279
something one name and then it'll get

1681
01:13:23,719 --> 01:13:27,520
shifted to another group and they they

1682
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:29,599
have a different nickname and so it can

1683
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:31,920
get really difficult to figure things

1684
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:35,960
out and then people sometimes rename

1685
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:39,239
things to create confusion right like oh

1686
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:42,158
I'm not supposed to have this so I can't

1687
01:13:39,238 --> 01:13:44,039
call it this but I'll call it that and

1688
01:13:42,158 --> 01:13:46,839
they won't figure it out type of thing

1689
01:13:44,039 --> 01:13:48,760
and so when you do like strain history

1690
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:51,079
like I do it gets really difficult

1691
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:53,360
because basically like every American

1692
01:13:51,079 --> 01:13:56,359
group of dudes that like to smoke weed

1693
01:13:53,359 --> 01:14:00,319
like nicknames yeah and so Loompa

1694
01:13:56,359 --> 01:14:03,359
headband in my opinion is a very OG um

1695
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:06,319
very cush very OG Kush like what people

1696
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:09,399
know is that and uh I have a one of the

1697
01:14:06,319 --> 01:14:11,119
guys that that was in Loompa hates me

1698
01:14:09,399 --> 01:14:15,439
and the other one is one of my better

1699
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:18,279
friends so uh but yeah like Loompa OG is

1700
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:20,759
um it's basically Loompa headband is

1701
01:14:18,279 --> 01:14:23,238
basically a really good OG you know it's

1702
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:25,760
a really strong really potent really

1703
01:14:23,238 --> 01:14:28,638
flavorful anybody yes if anybody in

1704
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:30,600
America was to get like a pure Loompa OG

1705
01:14:28,639 --> 01:14:33,119
uh they would immediately just classify

1706
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:35,719
it as some kind of kush it's definitely

1707
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:37,960
I mean I supposedly have the headband U

1708
01:14:35,719 --> 01:14:40,359
which I believe he renamed it to

1709
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:42,639
Underdog OG cuz he originally thought it

1710
01:14:40,359 --> 01:14:46,079
was Da recer

1711
01:14:42,639 --> 01:14:49,719
Loompa headband part of the problem is

1712
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:52,399
that Loompa like loali the old man who

1713
01:14:49,719 --> 01:14:54,119
who ran the company for a bit he would

1714
01:14:52,399 --> 01:14:55,960
make different names for different

1715
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:59,158
Brokers and different different

1716
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:01,279
customers but it was the same the it was

1717
01:14:59,158 --> 01:15:03,638
all the same it was all the same so to

1718
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:05,119
some people it would be the underdog OG

1719
01:15:03,639 --> 01:15:08,079
to other people it would be Loompa

1720
01:15:05,119 --> 01:15:11,000
headband to other people it might be so

1721
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:13,559
that's what makes it confusing is that

1722
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:16,719
people like to name things what makes

1723
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:19,239
their life easier for sale well the same

1724
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:21,279
thing happens in Amsterdam or you know

1725
01:15:19,238 --> 01:15:23,638
when I used to go in Amsterdam you'd go

1726
01:15:21,279 --> 01:15:26,000
from one coffee shop to another and they

1727
01:15:23,639 --> 01:15:28,840
all had the

1728
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:31,119
Haze but it was labeled something else

1729
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:35,600
something else yeah you

1730
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:37,800
know story yeah just Intero we got packs

1731
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:39,320
of you know some friends not me you know

1732
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:42,440
they got you know they imported wheat

1733
01:15:39,319 --> 01:15:44,238
also from Netherlands you know and on

1734
01:15:42,439 --> 01:15:46,119
the packs normally it was written this

1735
01:15:44,238 --> 01:15:48,439
was the early days man this is really

1736
01:15:46,119 --> 01:15:50,679
the first KS that we saw and it's a

1737
01:15:48,439 --> 01:15:52,759
certain place in Slovenia where they had

1738
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:55,119
this import at the time they had the

1739
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:58,079
connection somehow they imported a lot

1740
01:15:55,119 --> 01:16:02,399
of it so in the packs was written NL and

1741
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:05,359
all of us everybody was thinking it's

1742
01:16:02,399 --> 01:16:07,879
Netherlands the Netherlands but not

1743
01:16:05,359 --> 01:16:09,759
after years we came to the idea that

1744
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:12,719
that was Northern Lights actually you

1745
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:15,280
know we don't know which one but it was

1746
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:17,439
Northern Lights you know most potent

1747
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:20,279
[ __ ] in that time you know it was

1748
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:23,279
unbelievable you know stroke you know I

1749
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:26,000
want you to talk about that Shiva is it

1750
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:29,519
Shiva skunk or Shiva Shanti or just

1751
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,359
Shiva we call it Shiva SK and also you

1752
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:34,320
now after the podcast that we had you

1753
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:37,238
know came to me and he brought the old

1754
01:16:34,319 --> 01:16:40,719
catalog uhuh we were looking through it

1755
01:16:37,238 --> 01:16:42,839
and it's the Shiva skunk picture looks

1756
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:45,840
like this plant when it's

1757
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:48,039
finished really yeah it's like like w

1758
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:50,880
that's it that's the one actually you

1759
01:16:48,039 --> 01:16:53,560
know which like so similar that I was I

1760
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:56,159
was bluffed you know I was like no way

1761
01:16:53,560 --> 01:17:01,039
man yeah

1762
01:16:56,158 --> 01:17:03,879
yeah Shiva skunk sincey renamed it when

1763
01:17:01,039 --> 01:17:08,560
Neville sold it under his brand and his

1764
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:10,679
company it was called big skunk mhm and

1765
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:13,920
it was Big Bud by Skunk

1766
01:17:10,679 --> 01:17:15,639
one and then sensey re sensey didn't

1767
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:18,119
really want people to realize that they

1768
01:17:15,639 --> 01:17:21,359
just bought Neville's company and just

1769
01:17:18,119 --> 01:17:25,359
sold all his same seeds so they changed

1770
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:28,719
not all but most of the names

1771
01:17:25,359 --> 01:17:33,319
right so like big skunk became Shiva

1772
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:37,639
skunk nl5 nl5 by Skunk one became Shiva

1773
01:17:33,319 --> 01:17:39,679

good you know they just kept they kept

1775
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:43,679
and what was weird about it though is

1776
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,520
that the drunkers were lazy and they

1777
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:48,239
kept this a lot of times they kept the

1778
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:51,199
same pictures yeah from Neville's

1779
01:17:48,238 --> 01:17:53,678
earlier cataloges and they even kept

1780
01:17:51,198 --> 01:17:55,719
some of the same verbiage in the

1781
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:58,000
descriptions they just made made it

1782
01:17:55,719 --> 01:17:59,480
shorter so you have a do you still have

1783
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,439
it do you you have a you have a nice

1784
01:17:59,479 --> 01:18:04,718

1802
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:51,000
went to lubl that was end of the ' 80s

1803
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:54,920
okay he was a roommate of a guy that uh

1804
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:57,719
of wheat in Yugoslavia times and um that

1805
01:18:54,920 --> 01:19:01,399
we dealer quit dealing so he got access

1806
01:18:57,719 --> 01:19:04,439
to his customers he started to deal with

1807
01:19:01,399 --> 01:19:07,238
uh but he was also uh because he was so

1808
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:09,399
crazy after the war you know in Slovenia

1809
01:19:07,238 --> 01:19:12,079
we were open for traveling so he could

1810
01:19:09,399 --> 01:19:14,198
go everywhere so he traveled and he went

1811
01:19:12,079 --> 01:19:17,719
to of course to Amsterdam you know in '

1812
01:19:14,198 --> 01:19:21,799
93 94 he was in Amsterdam and then you

1813
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:24,960
know 95 or 97 he went again you know he

1814
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:28,719
went many times but in 97 he brought

1815
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:32,158
this cot back home and he was like he

1816
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:35,679
tell us like guy that I know he told him

1817
01:19:32,158 --> 01:19:39,000
also that he had a cup in his jacket

1818
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:41,639
with water prepared and it he caught

1819
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:45,920
from that plant and he stole it actually

1820
01:19:41,639 --> 01:19:48,319
you know he stole it he nicked few that

1821
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:51,000
time I don't know if you can realize

1822
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:54,399
that not many people understand that if

1823
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:58,000
you cut a branch of a plant and stick it

1824
01:19:54,399 --> 01:20:00,479
in a cup with water you can actually for

1825
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,880
2 3 days you can drive around with it

1826
01:20:00,479 --> 01:20:05,599
and you can still root

1827
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:07,880
it 100% yeah well that's what he did he

1828
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:10,960
went with it from Amsterdam to lublana

1829
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:13,119
and he had a indoor uh already there you

1830
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:15,279
know because he was already growing

1831
01:20:13,119 --> 01:20:17,279
indoors after I don't know you know he

1832
01:20:15,279 --> 01:20:20,039
bought a judge pass to be on the high

1833
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:21,759
times conam cops he went from coffee

1834
01:20:20,039 --> 01:20:25,079
shop to Coffee Shop you know to test

1835
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:28,199
wheat but somehow maybe he got in some

1836
01:20:25,079 --> 01:20:30,238
we body together from the scene and he

1837
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:32,000
was so crazy you know so interesting

1838
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:33,559
also for those guys because there were

1839
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
not so many people from Yugoslavia at

1840
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:37,320
that time traveling you know or even

1841
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,520
Slovenia because we were a new country

1842
01:20:37,319 --> 01:20:41,960
at that moment you know right

1843
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:44,760
independent Slovenia we were in the news

1844
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:48,039
the Balkan War continued in Croatia they

1845
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:50,880
had really big war and Bosnia after and

1846
01:20:48,039 --> 01:20:55,079
Kosovo after and it was a bloody long

1847
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:57,279
War so but but the Shiva the Shiva came

1848
01:20:55,079 --> 01:20:59,198
because luy was not only growing the

1849
01:20:57,279 --> 01:21:01,479
Shiva you know he bought seeds you know

1850
01:20:59,198 --> 01:21:04,359
in that times already in the '90s he had

1851
01:21:01,479 --> 01:21:06,879
a really selection of different strains

1852
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:09,198
from from the '90s from Amsterdam and

1853
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:11,279
they make make mother plants and they

1854
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:14,319
cut they cut from those mod plants and

1855
01:21:11,279 --> 01:21:16,759
they repeated the the product you know

1856
01:21:14,319 --> 01:21:18,759
he wanted to standardize standard you

1857
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:21,600
know station that you have all the time

1858
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:24,000
the same product for the market lime

1859
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:26,600
breeding lime breed you no he was not

1860
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:30,719
really breeding they were just the the

1861
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:33,120
seat making a mom from the elction

1862
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:35,198
cloning it that's it so rather than

1863
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:36,719
rather than growing a bunch of seed no

1864
01:21:35,198 --> 01:21:39,399
they didn't he would pick he would pick

1865
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:41,039
a feno he would pick a feno and then

1866
01:21:39,399 --> 01:21:43,158
make a bunch of clones so he would have

1867
01:21:41,039 --> 01:21:46,279
a consistent crop that would all be the

1868
01:21:43,158 --> 01:21:48,279
same looking thing yes yes and the story

1869
01:21:46,279 --> 01:21:51,119
is that there was skunk number one which

1870
01:21:48,279 --> 01:21:54,158
was there with also with him 11 number

1871
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:56,479
16 one was very piny the number 16 was

1872
01:21:54,158 --> 01:21:58,799
absolutely [ __ ] Piney you know like

1873
01:21:56,479 --> 01:22:01,718
the pinest plant ever that I smoked in

1874
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:05,760
my life in the beginning and the number

1875
01:22:01,719 --> 01:22:07,439
11 was sweet and it was like wow it

1876
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:10,119
looks like a sativa but it fled like a

1877
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:12,079
Inda it had almost no leaves I mean it

1878
01:22:10,119 --> 01:22:16,599
has Lea very thin you know like a like a

1879
01:22:12,079 --> 01:22:19,319
sativa is but he has Inda flowers so

1880
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:21,199
very interesting plant you know you know

1881
01:22:19,319 --> 01:22:23,519
for some other plants that we have in

1882
01:22:21,198 --> 01:22:26,079
the shops at that time in the two early

1883
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:30,360
2000s you know I will asked me not so

1884
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:33,800
before was siny star from Paradise

1885
01:22:30,359 --> 01:22:36,639
seats that one man is a legend in

1886
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:38,600
Austria it's also a legend in Slovenia

1887
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:41,359
because a lot of people grow for Rick

1888
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:45,840
Simpson Oil here so when they start to

1889
01:22:41,359 --> 01:22:47,960
grow uh everybody knew that this plant

1890
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:51,600
this material the biomass will give you

1891
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:54,158
two times more oil than a normal normal

1892
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:56,679
it was so it was so potent you know it

1893
01:22:54,158 --> 01:22:59,079
was so does it still exist

1894
01:22:56,679 --> 01:23:01,319
there maybe it does you know if I will

1895
01:22:59,079 --> 01:23:03,238
say no now there will be I hope no it

1896
01:23:01,319 --> 01:23:05,119
not exist now somebody should write in

1897
01:23:03,238 --> 01:23:08,039
the comments yes we still have it you

1898
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:10,599
know yeah we still have it I think P has

1899
01:23:08,039 --> 01:23:12,960
it but the last time I got it you know

1900
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:15,840
uh in condition that I would say that

1901
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:17,560
was good we didn't know about H hop PL

1902
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:20,199
and ra virus at that time or something

1903
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:23,600
you know but I realized because I grew

1904
01:23:20,198 --> 01:23:26,359
it so long time you know and many others

1905
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:29,719
did a lot long time years for the same

1906
01:23:26,359 --> 01:23:33,319
cut so you you know when you we talk

1907
01:23:29,719 --> 01:23:35,960
Master of the plant you know of growing

1908
01:23:33,319 --> 01:23:39,238
you know may be master of growing of a

1909
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:42,399
particular phenotype a cut that you have

1910
01:23:39,238 --> 01:23:44,959
for many years that can be you can not

1911
01:23:42,399 --> 01:23:48,000
even be a master you can have you know a

1912
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:49,760
really good recipe for it yeah yeah so

1913
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,600
you get close you get close to the to

1914
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:55,600
the ideal situation that you can to the

1915
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:57,560
best end product is possible

1916
01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:00,000
I I talk about

1917
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:01,880
thatal I talk about that all the time

1918
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,800
actually I have like my own funny

1919
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:07,239
analogy on it where I feel like each

1920
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:09,679
strain I have is like a this might sound

1921
01:24:07,238 --> 01:24:12,198
weird but like is like a girlfriend

1922
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:14,760
right and so it's like this living

1923
01:24:12,198 --> 01:24:18,399
female and I need to figure out a way to

1924
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:21,039
make it happy right and like you can't

1925
01:24:18,399 --> 01:24:22,719
treat sometimes you have you have

1926
01:24:21,039 --> 01:24:24,439
something and you treat it you treat

1927
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:26,239
this new thing the way you treated the

1928
01:24:24,439 --> 01:24:29,399
old thing that made the old thing really

1929
01:24:26,238 --> 01:24:31,399
happy and the new one isn't as happy and

1930
01:24:29,399 --> 01:24:33,479
so I really do feel like when you grow

1931
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:35,679
different clones you have to build

1932
01:24:33,479 --> 01:24:37,599
relationships with them yes you have to

1933
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:39,719
figure out like how they like to be fed

1934
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:42,079
how they like to be grown how much light

1935
01:24:39,719 --> 01:24:43,319
they like to have and so you really have

1936
01:24:42,079 --> 01:24:45,679
to get to

1937
01:24:43,319 --> 01:24:47,319
know right and like to what you're

1938
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:50,800
talking about like to get the kind of

1939
01:24:47,319 --> 01:24:52,920
phenotypic expression you want yes you

1940
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:55,760
know like you have to know how to treat

1941
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:58,520
her mhm and in order to get her to

1942
01:24:55,760 --> 01:25:01,840
express in the way that you're after and

1943
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:04,719
so I almost feel like with most

1944
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:07,520
strains it's like the first couple times

1945
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:09,880
you grow it you're just winging it you

1946
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:11,600
know and then if you pay attention you

1947
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:13,960
start to learn things that make her

1948
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:17,280
happy or make her unhappy and you can

1949
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:19,279
sort of adjust what you do based on that

1950
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:21,679
and it's very similar to like being in a

1951
01:25:19,279 --> 01:25:23,559
relationship with someone you know

1952
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:24,560
because you have to you know if you want

1953
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:26,560
want what you want you you have to

1954
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:28,280
figure out a way to keep them happy keep

1955
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:31,480
them you know cuz you can make them real

1956
01:25:28,279 --> 01:25:35,639
upset too you know and that's the only

1957
01:25:31,479 --> 01:25:40,638
way I I have a question for Francis huh

1958
01:25:35,639 --> 01:25:42,400
so that's P polyamory right polyamory I

1959
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:45,679
mean yeah I you know I just look at it

1960
01:25:42,399 --> 01:25:47,799
as as plants but that's the thing is is

1961
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:49,600
that I I mean obviously I'm not like

1962
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:53,239
engaging in any kind of those activities

1963
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:55,119
with them but it's uh you know like

1964
01:25:53,238 --> 01:25:57,359
canis love your plan

1965
01:25:55,118 --> 01:25:59,158
well it it well I just meant the love

1966
01:25:57,359 --> 01:26:01,960
factor and I you know I wanted to know

1967
01:25:59,158 --> 01:26:03,799
if the love Factor matters but it's also

1968
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:07,480
like you can love something and still

1969
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:10,480
really screw it up oh yeah you know and

1970
01:26:07,479 --> 01:26:13,559
cannabis you know cannabis like they

1971
01:26:10,479 --> 01:26:16,638
require very different things sometimes

1972
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:20,119
like you know not you have to screw it

1973
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:22,760
up because if you don't make mistakes

1974
01:26:20,118 --> 01:26:24,920
you never learn it yeah you don't learn

1975
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:28,079
no you have to make the you have to make

1976
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:31,440
the mistakes mistakes are so important

1977
01:26:28,079 --> 01:26:34,000
you know like without mistakes I mean

1978
01:26:31,439 --> 01:26:36,439
you don't do any there is a old saying

1979
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:39,439
in my country where it say uh that are

1980
01:26:36,439 --> 01:26:42,799
without mix mistakes they are not

1981
01:26:39,439 --> 01:26:44,919
working yeah I mean a lot of times like

1982
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:47,480
I wor I worked with Gabby at Gabby's

1983
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:50,920
shop which we gave a ton of advice back

1984
01:26:47,479 --> 01:26:53,279
in the day and it was like you hear so

1985
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:56,039
many of the same mistakes over and over

1986
01:26:53,279 --> 01:26:58,359
and over again that just like life

1987
01:26:56,039 --> 01:27:01,560
probably half of growing is just

1988
01:26:58,359 --> 01:27:04,599
avoiding any way you [ __ ] up or you've

1989
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:06,920
seen other people [ __ ] up right like a

1990
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:09,400
lot of life is just avoiding

1991
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:11,199
screw-ups you know by what you've seen

1992
01:27:09,399 --> 01:27:12,479
and learned and you see some screw up

1993
01:27:11,198 --> 01:27:16,638
and you're like oh man I never want to

1994
01:27:12,479 --> 01:27:18,479
see that again that is not but but the

1995
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:20,679
diagnostic must be there you know you

1996
01:27:18,479 --> 01:27:22,678
have to know what you did wrong in the

1997
01:27:20,679 --> 01:27:25,800
end if you did something wrong you have

1998
01:27:22,679 --> 01:27:27,840
to analyze it and they say oh that why

1999
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:29,880
not that you [ __ ] up and then you don't

2000
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:32,039
know why and you make the same mistake

2001
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:34,039
again that's not how you how you do you

2002
01:27:32,039 --> 01:27:35,479
have to solve the problem you know what

2003
01:27:34,039 --> 01:27:36,719
you have to solve the problem you have

2004
01:27:35,479 --> 01:27:39,079
to figure out a way to do it but

2005
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:42,158
normally it's like that if you are quite

2006
01:27:39,079 --> 01:27:46,238
focused on the thing that you do I mean

2007
01:27:42,158 --> 01:27:47,920
I mean you up you know it's like yeah if

2008
01:27:46,238 --> 01:27:49,599
you meet someone like let's say let's

2009
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:52,719
say you and I were talking and you gave

2010
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:54,360
me a strain like say the Shiva yes

2011
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:57,239
because you've had a long relationship

2012
01:27:54,359 --> 01:27:59,319
ship with her you could tell me a lot

2013
01:27:57,238 --> 01:28:01,279
about what she likes and don't likes and

2014
01:27:59,319 --> 01:28:04,039
how to grow how big to get her does she

2015
01:28:01,279 --> 01:28:06,118
like to be to does she not all these

2016
01:28:04,039 --> 01:28:09,158
different little things that might take

2017
01:28:06,118 --> 01:28:11,920
me multiple years of growing her to

2018
01:28:09,158 --> 01:28:14,960
slowly figure out you could be like hey

2019
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:17,359
I've I've grown this strain a long time

2020
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:19,719
right here's what I've learned about

2021
01:28:17,359 --> 01:28:22,759
things she likes and dislikes and then

2022
01:28:19,719 --> 01:28:24,760
that person has like a huge Head Start

2023
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:27,000
mhm because they don't have to

2024
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:29,840
observationally make her happy make her

2025
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:32,520
upset figure out why they can just learn

2026
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:34,560
from your mistakes you know you know

2027
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:37,040
what a clear example of that is is just

2028
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:40,520
flowering height like what height should

2029
01:28:37,039 --> 01:28:42,279
you flower this plant at right yeah you

2030
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:44,360
know like if someone if someone just

2031
01:28:42,279 --> 01:28:46,559
tells you that simple thing like hey if

2032
01:28:44,359 --> 01:28:49,559
you flowered at this height it's going

2033
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:52,199
to get to this if you know that was like

2034
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:53,760
a you know because we were trying to

2035
01:28:52,198 --> 01:28:55,879
figure it out and then we'd wait too

2036
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:58,800
long and then the plant would be like 8

2037
01:28:55,880 --> 01:29:00,639
feet tall and not wanting to stop you

2038
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:03,039
know so or we had this or we had this

2039
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:06,880
strain a long time ago called the purple

2040
01:29:03,039 --> 01:29:10,000
Urkel right and it barely grew like the

2041
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:13,159
slowest plant on Earth to grow plant

2042
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:15,800
imaginable I know that so you kind of

2043
01:29:13,158 --> 01:29:18,079
had to grow it to get to be two or three

2044
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:20,360
or four feet tall before you flipped it

2045
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:22,920
because if you flipped it small it would

2046
01:29:20,359 --> 01:29:24,639
grow like that much and and like and

2047
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:27,800
you'd be like oh my God have this like

2048
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:30,118
Rinky Dink little thing where there's

2049
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:31,840
other strains there's other strains that

2050
01:29:30,118 --> 01:29:33,559
you could flip them that big and they'd

2051
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:38,119
get they'd grow another two or three

2052
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:40,239
feet and Branch out and like and be so I

2053
01:29:38,118 --> 01:29:42,439
mean I'm I'm a really big proponent of

2054
01:29:40,238 --> 01:29:45,319
that of like you need to learn your

2055
01:29:42,439 --> 01:29:46,238
plants what makes them happy what makes

2056
01:29:45,319 --> 01:29:49,359
them

2057
01:29:46,238 --> 01:29:53,319
unhappy that's a that's a big part of it

2058
01:29:49,359 --> 01:29:55,039
well so yeah Nursery like are there are

2059
01:29:53,319 --> 01:29:56,679
there any practice that you found where

2060
01:29:55,039 --> 01:29:58,319
you're like I really have to do these

2061
01:29:56,679 --> 01:30:00,079
certain things to make sure that I

2062
01:29:58,319 --> 01:30:01,679
preserve some of these older genetics

2063
01:30:00,079 --> 01:30:03,479
health because it sounds like some of

2064
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:06,960
the stuff that you have is at least like

2065
01:30:03,479 --> 01:30:09,678
20 years old and so yeah doing anything

2066
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:12,600
special to keep their their health uh

2067
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:14,719
for example two examples we talked about

2068
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:17,760
the plank and the Shiva cut those are

2069
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:21,399
the oldest Cuts in my facility right cut

2070
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:25,600
is very very hard to keep uh perfect

2071
01:30:21,399 --> 01:30:28,719
shape to you know it has this you need

2072
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:31,560
to to know about Trace

2073
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:34,118
elements and you need to renew the mom

2074
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:37,239
in every 3 months then you have a really

2075
01:30:34,118 --> 01:30:39,719
perfect cut with this particular strain

2076
01:30:37,238 --> 01:30:42,198
for me it's really hard to grow it for 6

2077
01:30:39,719 --> 01:30:45,600
months in a small container as a

2078
01:30:42,198 --> 01:30:49,238
mom which I do normally with other

2079
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:52,520
plants yeah until 6 months we can keep

2080
01:30:49,238 --> 01:30:54,799
them in 11 lit container with for

2081
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:56,080
production of clones

2082
01:30:54,800 --> 01:31:00,199
we have

2083
01:30:56,079 --> 01:31:03,158
a o we are feeding K

2084
01:31:00,198 --> 01:31:07,559
nutrients K nutrients is uh you know

2085
01:31:03,158 --> 01:31:10,920
I've been uh we do we did a lot of

2086
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:13,280
different uh nutrients in the past a lot

2087
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:18,039
kind of brand you could imagine you know

2088
01:31:13,279 --> 01:31:19,800
try it out we did it the thing is the

2089
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:22,198
like me say organic products that are

2090
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:25,320
certified that are not using animal

2091
01:31:22,198 --> 01:31:28,678
products uh like you know uh fermented

2092
01:31:25,319 --> 01:31:30,799
uhal matter and then know the best one

2093
01:31:28,679 --> 01:31:32,719
of your country is dragonfly Earth

2094
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:34,920
medicine I think you know countries

2095
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:38,399
there is all others but we don't have a

2096
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:40,118
so specific for cannabis you know some

2097
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:42,279
like nutrients from my guys from

2098
01:31:40,118 --> 01:31:44,479
Slovenia there's young guys you know

2099
01:31:42,279 --> 01:31:47,960
they still development in development

2100
01:31:44,479 --> 01:31:49,799
but they are successful and good Mater

2101
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:52,198
it's good what they have but in my

2102
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:54,560
facility I cannot use those products in

2103
01:31:52,198 --> 01:31:58,000
that sense because it's a you know

2104
01:31:54,560 --> 01:32:00,679
organic product ini container under

2105
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:04,039
artificial light artificial

2106
01:32:00,679 --> 01:32:06,560
environment who is who is uh you know uh

2107
01:32:04,039 --> 01:32:08,238
with himself here you know I'm not uh

2108
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:10,400
like what's the purpose of going the

2109
01:32:08,238 --> 01:32:12,919
purpose is to grow outside with those

2110
01:32:10,399 --> 01:32:15,399
things it's a really good for growing

2111
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:17,639
outside and in green houses you know

2112
01:32:15,399 --> 01:32:21,799
when you put it in soil it's really good

2113
01:32:17,639 --> 01:32:26,319
but Caron nutrients for example have

2114
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:29,840
been there since I've been a young for

2115
01:32:26,319 --> 01:32:32,039
Canabis is that Holland that is Holland

2116
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:37,480
yeah yeah and this

2117
01:32:32,039 --> 01:32:41,079
class is Der Clen Clen yeah so traveling

2118
01:32:37,479 --> 01:32:43,799
around you know Europe all and I mean

2119
01:32:41,079 --> 01:32:47,719
it's a big company today right K it's a

2120
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:53,239
really huge company that uh lines of

2121
01:32:47,719 --> 01:32:57,600
different uh you know for uh uh uh for

2122
01:32:53,238 --> 01:33:01,198
aquaone for Hydroponics right the

2123
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:04,600
science behind it it's all there did

2124
01:33:01,198 --> 01:33:06,879
this totally and in Austria they are

2125
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:10,079
really strong also they're supportive

2126
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:13,359
also and we use now because also of the

2127
01:33:10,079 --> 01:33:14,880
trace elements because the thing is when

2128
01:33:13,359 --> 01:33:17,799
you grow for a long time in closed

2129
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:20,560
containers plastic containers can feed

2130
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:22,239
uh sometime with uh P you know with

2131
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:25,159
nitrogen phosphor and

2132
01:33:22,238 --> 01:33:30,439
[ __ ] but uh uh

2133
01:33:25,158 --> 01:33:33,920
iron zinc sulfur Mangan mipan uh other

2134
01:33:30,439 --> 01:33:37,158
Trace elements start to here your moms

2135
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:39,760
uh start to die so you have to feed

2136
01:33:37,158 --> 01:33:42,399
those Trace elements to be aware about

2137
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:44,960
the water we have a luck here because we

2138
01:33:42,399 --> 01:33:47,920
have really good quality of water all

2139
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:51,239
Slovenia and also of part of

2140
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:54,319
Austria austri is also really good water

2141
01:33:51,238 --> 01:33:57,118
it's drinkable from the tap

2142
01:33:54,319 --> 01:33:59,880
so the plants like to drink it

2143
01:33:57,118 --> 01:34:02,198
too on where you live but the water is

2144
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:03,560
really really good with my facility you

2145
01:34:02,198 --> 01:34:06,759
know it's it sounds a little bit

2146
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:09,840
primitive but we grow it on soil on

2147
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:13,360
light mix we use light mix and we are

2148
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:15,520
the masters of the recipe which soil

2149
01:34:13,359 --> 01:34:18,719
it's it's like a Peete based formula

2150
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:21,920
right based formula also containing

2151
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:24,439
perlite yeah yeah yeah yeah but also you

2152
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:27,359
know Kaa has its own uh you know if you

2153

Brands now but you know cono for me is

2157
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:38,600
one of those brands that is stable and

2158
01:34:36,039 --> 01:34:40,560
they know uh they sell those few

2159
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:44,880
products that I have in line they don't

2160
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:47,440
have like this 20 bottles of one line of

2161
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:49,880
one you know how can I sell this to a

2162
01:34:47,439 --> 01:34:52,279
customer I try to sell it also to people

2163
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:54,560
also to explain to them why some certain

2164
01:34:52,279 --> 01:34:57,319
stuff is good for them you know

2165
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:59,800
why do you use the we call it in America

2166
01:34:57,319 --> 01:35:02,519
do you use the bio can like the organic

2167
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:05,679
version I used to use bio but now I use

2168
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:08,400
K Tera and K Aqua for the when the mom

2169
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:12,000
when the mom gets older I Ka

2170
01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:16,920
Aqua okay m is Young and you build up

2171
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:20,359
the mom kind of kind of line so me and a

2172
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:22,719
NATO dog we used to sell the canaline

2173
01:35:20,359 --> 01:35:25,599
were one of the I think it was first

2174
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:27,560
seven sores in the US so we're familiar

2175
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:30,199
with them I believe the

2176
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:33,320
canera is designed for use in a

2177
01:35:30,198 --> 01:35:38,000
fortified soil yes because they they

2178
01:35:33,319 --> 01:35:40,079
sold canera soil as well they still do

2179
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,840
and I'm experimenting right now with

2180
01:35:40,079 --> 01:35:45,479
that you know I have kind of oil a

2181
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:47,760
little bit I bought now to see if it you

2182
01:35:45,479 --> 01:35:50,359
know you have to try it I also I always

2183
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:52,360
tell to people that you need to try

2184
01:35:50,359 --> 01:35:54,719
certain things out I also not I'm not a

2185
01:35:52,359 --> 01:35:57,799
God I cannot know if it's good or not

2186
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:59,399
until I tried it and I I tested it and

2187
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:01,719
then I see the results and you know what

2188
01:35:59,399 --> 01:36:04,319
I mean I tried it on my mom's here you

2189
01:36:01,719 --> 01:36:05,560
know so I'm not going to flower stage

2190
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:07,599
and everything but that's the other

2191
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:10,520
stuff you know I'm not I'm business in

2192
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:14,079
Austria I sell clones in you know we

2193

2198
01:36:27,158 --> 01:36:32,399
10,000 and not in dollars in clones so

2199
01:36:29,399 --> 01:36:34,599
you're prod producing 10,000 clones a

2200
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:38,519
month and are you selling them one at a

2201
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:40,960
time 10 at a time I have many shops you

2202
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:44,119
know I Supply a lot of shops in

2203
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:46,359
Austria a lot of there is a lot of shops

2204
01:36:44,118 --> 01:36:50,399
and most of these people for example I

2205
01:36:46,359 --> 01:36:53,319
live on a very uh rural area and the the

2206
01:36:50,399 --> 01:36:56,559
square meter that I pay for the facility

2207
01:36:53,319 --> 01:36:58,679
that a rent is very low cost for me you

2208
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:01,800
know not it's not low cost but it's

2209
01:36:58,679 --> 01:37:04,760
reasonable price let me tell you that

2210
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:08,400
but if you live in Vienna or if you live

2211
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:10,920
in salsburg or Lind or Gratz on these

2212
01:37:08,399 --> 01:37:13,279
bigger cities the square meter is like

2213
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:15,760
four times or five times more expensive

2214
01:37:13,279 --> 01:37:18,800
that for me to produce the

2215
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:21,320
Clones mhm because you have if it's not

2216
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:23,520
your uh if you don't own the place you

2217
01:37:21,319 --> 01:37:26,079
have to pay rent and the rent will kill

2218
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:28,440
kill you with the with you know with

2219
01:37:26,079 --> 01:37:30,439
electricity you need helpers you know

2220
01:37:28,439 --> 01:37:32,039
people who you know you cannot have only

2221
01:37:30,439 --> 01:37:34,519
friends that come to your place and they

2222
01:37:32,039 --> 01:37:36,960
will help you out you not employees this

2223
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:39,880
is a legal business so the the

2224
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:43,800
government wants to have taxes from it

2225
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:47,319
and that's what they are having and it's

2226
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:49,880
fair people buy CBD plants there is a

2227
01:37:47,319 --> 01:37:52,599
lot of CBD production also you know do a

2228
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:55,560
lot of CBD plans for Australian Market I

2229
01:37:52,599 --> 01:37:59,920
mean two years ago our our company

2230
01:37:55,560 --> 01:38:03,639
produced almost 880,000 880,000 CBD

2231
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:05,079
plants yeah and CBG CBD CBG in a very

2232
01:38:03,639 --> 01:38:08,760
big

2233
01:38:05,079 --> 01:38:11,079
facility uh so but we have this smaller

2234
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:13,920
facility now which is our library from

2235
01:38:11,079 --> 01:38:15,960
that Library we have this CBD strain

2236
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:18,079
that we produced in 880,000 we have now

2237
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:20,599
like three

2238
01:38:18,079 --> 01:38:22,079
months you know because theand is not

2239
01:38:20,599 --> 01:38:24,400
there there is a lot of other strains

2240
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:27,639
coming but this particular train is very

2241
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:30,319
good because it's a stabilized producing

2242
01:38:27,639 --> 01:38:33,840
product for for example we sell to

2243
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:36,039
Croatia to a certain farmer that

2244
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:40,679
produces CBD and

2245
01:38:36,039 --> 01:38:44,000
CBG High you know it's like 12% CBD 03

2246
01:38:40,679 --> 01:38:46,319
THC and he produces it in Dalmatia in

2247
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:50,079
delmia Coast near

2248
01:38:46,319 --> 01:38:53,439
dnik the guy has also one of the bests

2249
01:38:50,079 --> 01:38:55,599

2251
01:38:55,599 --> 01:39:01,319
puts on the table is a quality product

2252
01:38:58,359 --> 01:39:04,519
so he wants clones for production of his

2253
01:39:01,319 --> 01:39:07,599
CBD and CBG oils which we also produce

2254
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:10,960
for him and it's like places where we

2255
01:39:07,599 --> 01:39:14,719
can export to Croatia but not THC clones

2256
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:17,319
that's not he has a permit for CBD and

2257
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:19,960
CBG clones that we can produce for him

2258
01:39:17,319 --> 01:39:23,960
and that we produce and then we we sell

2259
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:25,639
them to him and also it's like you know

2260
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:28,000

European passport for plant but I can

2262
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:35,158

grandfathers it's like that I cannot

2276
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,679
talk about it flowering when people come

2277
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:13,279
to me in the in the shop and normally

2278
01:40:10,679 --> 01:40:16,399
people understand it they just say which

2279
01:40:13,279 --> 01:40:18,639
one is best asking for a bong yeah no

2280
01:40:16,399 --> 01:40:20,519
they they asking for plans but I'm not

2281
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:24,440
the one who will tell anything that

2282
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:27,239
would be illegal for them to do

2283
01:40:24,439 --> 01:40:30,479
you understand one time you know I

2284
01:40:27,238 --> 01:40:33,118
assume that it was uh there were

2285
01:40:30,479 --> 01:40:35,399
police and they came into the shop the

2286
01:40:33,118 --> 01:40:37,238
first thing what they were asking me

2287
01:40:35,399 --> 01:40:40,158
have something for

2288
01:40:37,238 --> 01:40:42,919
smoke there was never a customer in the

2289
01:40:40,158 --> 01:40:44,279
last 6 years that would ask me that he

2290
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:48,279
could get something to

2291
01:40:44,279 --> 01:40:51,079
smoke what you know and then this lady

2292
01:40:48,279 --> 01:40:52,840
went to this to this plant and she asked

2293
01:40:51,079 --> 01:40:55,439
you know when I flower this I want to

2294
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:57,840
smoke you know it was so obvious it was

2295
01:40:55,439 --> 01:41:00,759
for me like pissing Against the Wind and

2296
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:02,920
smelling a policeman you know like like

2297
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:04,480
you know if you see the police call a

2298
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:06,199
brother you know but you will not fool

2299
01:41:04,479 --> 01:41:09,198
me you know like I have a very good

2300
01:41:06,198 --> 01:41:11,238
relation to the police I have because we

2301
01:41:09,198 --> 01:41:13,198

2302
01:41:11,238 --> 01:41:16,519

water pipes in head shops back in the

2325
01:42:12,599 --> 01:42:16,360
day when it was still you know cops

2326
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:18,880
would come in undercover and they would

2327
01:42:16,359 --> 01:42:20,158
be like I want to buy a bong what's the

2328
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,079
best one that's going to give me the

2329
01:42:20,158 --> 01:42:24,719
best hit like what a they would try to

2330
01:42:22,079 --> 01:42:26,639
trip people up and get them talking

2331
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:29,118
about it so they could get them to admit

2332
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:30,719
that it was for like a purpose that then

2333
01:42:29,118 --> 01:42:31,679
the cop could be like oh you're not

2334
01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:34,880
that's not

2335
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:34,880
allowed you

2336
01:42:35,639 --> 01:42:39,480
know there two things I want to say

2337
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:43,440
about that

2338
01:42:39,479 --> 01:42:45,879
so first a quick story in New York City

2339
01:42:43,439 --> 01:42:47,638
you could ask for a bong at the smoke

2340
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:50,239
shop you

2341
01:42:47,639 --> 01:42:53,440
know nobody cared you could say whatever

2342
01:42:50,238 --> 01:42:55,118
you want I moved to California and I

2343
01:42:53,439 --> 01:42:56,919
went to this head shop it's called The

2344
01:42:55,118 --> 01:43:00,158
Mighty Quinn in Santa

2345
01:42:56,920 --> 01:43:02,520
Rosa and first thing I do when I arrive

2346
01:43:00,158 --> 01:43:06,638
I go to the head shop and I asked the

2347
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:11,599
guy for a bong and he literally freaks

2348
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:14,359
out oh he like freaks out you know and I

2349
01:43:11,599 --> 01:43:15,760
mean I just didn't know you know there

2350
01:43:14,359 --> 01:43:17,319
were signs saying these are water pipes

2351
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:19,520
but I've called it a bong you know so

2352
01:43:17,319 --> 01:43:20,479
far all my life I didn't know so the guy

2353
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:22,560
freaks

2354
01:43:20,479 --> 01:43:25,039
out and you know then I learn the

2355
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:27,080
program and I just say waterpipe but

2356
01:43:25,039 --> 01:43:29,279
then I see him at every single Grateful

2357
01:43:27,079 --> 01:43:32,800
Dead show that I've ever been to in

2358
01:43:29,279 --> 01:43:36,000
California right always smoking weed M

2359
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:39,400
and this is I mean man this is over 30

2360
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:42,359
years ago I still go to the same smoke

2361
01:43:39,399 --> 01:43:43,399
shop and the same guy he doesn't own the

2362
01:43:42,359 --> 01:43:45,439
place he was like one of the main

2363
01:43:43,399 --> 01:43:47,839
workers he still worked there till till

2364
01:43:45,439 --> 01:43:50,279
just recently and I would tell all the

2365
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:51,800
staff that works there yeah this guy he

2366
01:43:50,279 --> 01:43:54,399
used to freak out on me if I come in

2367
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:56,679
here an Asom now they don't care now

2368
01:43:54,399 --> 01:43:59,319
it's like it it doesn't matter but back

2369
01:43:56,679 --> 01:44:01,760
then and they all you know they all

2370
01:43:59,319 --> 01:44:04,559
laugh the other thing is it was the same

2371
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:07,320
thing at the grow stores because after

2372
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:09,679
operation green Merchant yeah so when

2373
01:44:07,319 --> 01:44:11,238
you went to a grow store back in the day

2374
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:14,039
you definitely didn't say you were

2375
01:44:11,238 --> 01:44:16,799
growing weed you know people would say

2376
01:44:14,039 --> 01:44:18,000
yeah I want to grow tomatoes I me you

2377
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:20,039
know you

2378
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:21,399
would they would a lot of the grow

2379
01:44:20,039 --> 01:44:24,118
stores would sell

2380
01:44:21,399 --> 01:44:27,598
seeds like

2381
01:44:24,118 --> 01:44:30,279
flowers but I mean like I'm talking like

2382
01:44:27,599 --> 01:44:32,920
like yeah like not not can seeds but I I

2383
01:44:30,279 --> 01:44:34,719
just mean like you would often buy seeds

2384
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:38,199
they would recommend that you buy some

2385
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:40,359
flower seeds or some you know brussels

2386
01:44:38,198 --> 01:44:42,079
sprouts or some this or some that or

2387
01:44:40,359 --> 01:44:44,479
whatever because you had to have a

2388
01:44:42,079 --> 01:44:46,319
purpose for why you were growing this

2389
01:44:44,479 --> 01:44:48,919
growing this you know buying this grow

2390
01:44:46,319 --> 01:44:51,399
equipment or whatever and then even then

2391
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:53,599
like when I when I first started growing

2392
01:44:51,399 --> 01:44:56,158
we hired a friend

2393
01:44:53,599 --> 01:44:58,159
who was totally safe and was down to do

2394
01:44:56,158 --> 01:45:01,000
it and they would drive us to the store

2395
01:44:58,158 --> 01:45:02,920
in their car because the cops would

2396
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:05,760
record your license plate to figure out

2397
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:08,199
who you were sometimes so you had to

2398
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:10,159
like you had to have someone else bring

2399
01:45:08,198 --> 01:45:11,799
you there because if they would write

2400
01:45:10,158 --> 01:45:13,279
your license plate down they could find

2401
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:17,320
where the grow

2402
01:45:13,279 --> 01:45:19,599
was you know so it was sketch in that

2403
01:45:17,319 --> 01:45:21,880
regard you kind of had to you know the

2404
01:45:19,599 --> 01:45:23,239
first like uh Gabby knows what I'm

2405
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:25,880
talking about but there was this store

2406
01:45:23,238 --> 01:45:28,919
called The Brew and Grow in the Midwest

2407
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:32,000
and they they had a robust amount of you

2408
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:33,319
know actual flour you know like lies and

2409
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,639
this and that like tons of different

2410
01:45:33,319 --> 01:45:38,559
flower seeds and tons of different like

2411
01:45:35,639 --> 01:45:41,560
herbs and and and vegetables and stuff

2412
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:44,920
and you would always buy packs of seeds

2413
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:46,960
with your purchase because you

2414
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:48,039
needed purchased so it's like oh what

2415
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:50,079
are you going to grow this with what are

2416
01:45:48,039 --> 01:45:53,039
you going to choose and then so you

2417
01:45:50,079 --> 01:45:55,319
spend whatever five or 10 bucks extra on

2418
01:45:53,039 --> 01:45:57,359
some random packs of seeds so that you

2419
01:45:55,319 --> 01:46:00,319
had like a

2420
01:45:57,359 --> 01:46:03,279
reason you had a reason to buy the grow

2421
01:46:00,319 --> 01:46:06,000
light and the table you know for

2422
01:46:03,279 --> 01:46:08,238
your how many pounds of cherry tomatoes

2423
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:11,479
do you think I can grow under this

2424
01:46:08,238 --> 01:46:13,678
thousand oo you know a lot of these

2425
01:46:11,479 --> 01:46:15,718
places you know a lot of grow stores

2426
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:19,480
honestly they were

2427
01:46:15,719 --> 01:46:21,439
rare the information they had was rare

2428
01:46:19,479 --> 01:46:23,678
they could get hassled and there was

2429
01:46:21,439 --> 01:46:26,559
this cat and mouse game of of like the

2430
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:28,399
owner would try to tell the buyer as

2431
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:30,880
much as he could without getting in

2432
01:46:28,399 --> 01:46:32,519
trapped or in trouble you know because

2433
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:33,760
people didn't know what they were doing

2434
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:35,360
and so they would come in and they'd be

2435
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:37,039
like I want to grow but I don't know

2436
01:46:35,359 --> 01:46:39,799
what to buy I don't know how it all goes

2437
01:46:37,039 --> 01:46:41,920
together I don't know the system you

2438
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:43,679
know and like you said there wasn't

2439
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:46,079
internet or anything like that or it was

2440
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:48,039
very young still and so even just

2441
01:46:46,079 --> 01:46:51,118
figuring out the basics for a lot of

2442
01:46:48,039 --> 01:46:53,560
people was new fris when uh when you and

2443
01:46:51,118 --> 01:46:55,198
I were working at the Garden spout

2444
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:56,760
that's exactly what was happening right

2445
01:46:55,198 --> 01:47:00,638
people were coming in and saying I want

2446
01:46:56,760 --> 01:47:02,800
to grow but like back then we were able

2447
01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:07,319
to actually give people I'll tell I'll

2448
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:09,920
tell a funny story it's very brief but

2449
01:47:07,319 --> 01:47:11,639
because Gabby and I like when when you

2450
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:15,079
worked at the grow store it was kind of

2451
01:47:11,639 --> 01:47:17,560
like in a way it was sort of like Gabby

2452
01:47:15,079 --> 01:47:20,439
owned a porn shop or something like that

2453
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:22,480
where it was like I'm dead serious you

2454
01:47:20,439 --> 01:47:25,158
know like you would see people you would

2455
01:47:22,479 --> 01:47:27,519
see people in the grocery store that

2456
01:47:25,158 --> 01:47:30,000
absolutely would not want the public to

2457
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:32,880
know that they shopped with you they

2458
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:34,719
would give you fake names or nicknames

2459
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:37,480
because they didn't want the grow store

2460
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:39,800
to know their real name and so sometimes

2461
01:47:37,479 --> 01:47:41,118
you're in this little ass town in meno

2462
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:42,599
and you're like rolling down the aisle

2463
01:47:41,118 --> 01:47:44,238
of the grocery store and you want to say

2464
01:47:42,599 --> 01:47:46,440
hey to somebody and they're with their

2465
01:47:44,238 --> 01:47:48,959
buddies or their family and they do not

2466
01:47:46,439 --> 01:47:51,238
want those people to know that they shop

2467
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:53,960
with you or even where they know you

2468
01:47:51,238 --> 01:47:55,839
from right and you might just know their

2469
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:58,679
nickname or whatever name they decided

2470
01:47:55,840 --> 01:48:00,920
to give you you know for the store and

2471
01:47:58,679 --> 01:48:03,359
it might not be at all their real name

2472
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:05,639
or what other people call them so on

2473
01:48:03,359 --> 01:48:09,319
occasion there would be some awkward

2474
01:48:05,639 --> 01:48:10,920
unintentionally awkward stuff because

2475
01:48:09,319 --> 01:48:12,198
people did not want to get in trouble

2476
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:13,599
they didn't want to get busted they

2477
01:48:12,198 --> 01:48:15,198
didn't want their family to know what

2478
01:48:13,599 --> 01:48:17,159
they were doing maybe or their friends

2479
01:48:15,198 --> 01:48:19,598
or maybe they had a regular job that it

2480
01:48:17,158 --> 01:48:24,279
wasn't cool to do what they were doing

2481
01:48:19,599 --> 01:48:26,760
and so we knew about their secret life

2482
01:48:24,279 --> 01:48:30,158
and they did not want everyone to know

2483
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:34,239
about their secret life you

2484
01:48:30,158 --> 01:48:36,118
know brother there is there is still one

2485
01:48:34,238 --> 01:48:39,718
customer that comes to my place he's

2486
01:48:36,118 --> 01:48:43,039
from Hungaria Hungary and he comes over

2487
01:48:39,719 --> 01:48:45,679

2488
01:48:43,039 --> 01:48:49,920
buys clones but he always buys seeds you

2489
01:48:45,679 --> 01:48:53,199

2490
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:56,039

2513
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:53,760
is a different place uh for cannabis law

2514
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,599
it's really strict where restrict even

2515
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:58,119
we are in the European Union but

2516
01:49:55,599 --> 01:50:00,920
Slovenia will legalize soon and Germany

2517
01:49:58,118 --> 01:50:04,198
has already legalized and other other

2518
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:06,399
countries will follow definitely I mean

2519
01:50:04,198 --> 01:50:08,879
there is Luxembourg that only they all

2520
01:50:06,399 --> 01:50:11,359
can grow for a few years now and Malta

2521
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:12,279
that can grow for a few years now Spain

2522
01:50:11,359 --> 01:50:16,118
has so

2523
01:50:12,279 --> 01:50:18,359
many I mean Spain is not legal but it's

2524
01:50:16,118 --> 01:50:20,559
it was always in Spain like this I

2525
01:50:18,359 --> 01:50:22,359
traveled with Bobble backs that was the

2526
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:24,719
story from maybe before we want to tell

2527
01:50:22,359 --> 01:50:27,759
you bubble bags for the ice waterer hush

2528
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:29,880
it was in the early 2000s I traveled

2529
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:31,719
with this in Andalusia which is the

2530
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:35,560
place where normally the Moroccan hash

2531
01:50:31,719 --> 01:50:39,279
comes in you know it's very near Morocco

2532
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:41,639
so these guys not have a really old hash

2533
01:50:39,279 --> 01:50:43,559
culture they are not they at that time

2534
01:50:41,639 --> 01:50:46,840
they were not used to smoke flowers so

2535
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:49,360
much because I know you know we had some

2536
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:51,599
flower and they were like wow somebody

2537
01:50:49,359 --> 01:50:53,598
has flower you know like we will smoke

2538
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:56,840
marijuana you know like and that it's

2539
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:59,039
like okay but um the hash what they got

2540
01:50:56,840 --> 01:51:01,360
of course is all from Morocco but I have

2541
01:50:59,039 --> 01:51:04,078
these bags and I told them what I have

2542
01:51:01,359 --> 01:51:07,359
so one guy of those guys had a because

2543
01:51:04,078 --> 01:51:10,000
in in Spain even today I think and in

2544
01:51:07,359 --> 01:51:13,519
all this time also you have this law you

2545
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:15,158
cannot go inside in somebody's house

2546
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:18,719
because it's his

2547
01:51:15,158 --> 01:51:20,799
privacy so every they have this Henda

2548
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:23,880
you know which is like a inner Garden

2549
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:26,360
always from outside always walls but

2550
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:29,239
when you enter in Spain a traditional

2551
01:51:26,359 --> 01:51:32,439
house for in the south of Spain in

2552
01:51:29,238 --> 01:51:36,919
Andalusia you will always see a you know

2553
01:51:32,439 --> 01:51:38,839
a garden inside and uh you know uh you

2554
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:41,158
know normally it's a garden for for

2555
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:43,719
shadow and people can have R there and

2556
01:51:41,158 --> 01:51:45,920
their own privacy but of course these

2557
01:51:43,719 --> 01:51:49,880
guys were growing cannabis as much you

2558
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:53,118
can you know like even today um and they

2559
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:55,118
have clones which they put out

2560
01:51:53,118 --> 01:51:57,198
and they start to flower first because

2561
01:51:55,118 --> 01:52:00,158
they were putting them out too early in

2562
01:51:57,198 --> 01:52:01,879
the season so the light was too you know

2563
01:52:00,158 --> 01:52:04,759
so they start to flower but then they

2564
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:06,920
reved you know revegetation they made

2565
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:09,159
these strange mutations la la la and

2566
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:12,000
after 3 weeks they start to to put out

2567
01:52:09,158 --> 01:52:15,039
the vegetative state again and you know

2568
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:18,399
they came and uh I said to them cut all

2569
01:52:15,039 --> 01:52:20,599
of these undeveloped you know uh fresh

2570
01:52:18,399 --> 01:52:22,638
BTS that are there cut it from the

2571
01:52:20,599 --> 01:52:24,279
plants because they will they will have

2572
01:52:22,639 --> 01:52:26,920
you know also the for the plant is good

2573
01:52:24,279 --> 01:52:28,679
to do that you know to you know to cut

2574
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:31,880
the nails you know what I mean so she

2575
01:52:28,679 --> 01:52:34,000
can yeah so she can uh perform like she

2576
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:35,960
should uh so there was a lot of this

2577
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,880
biom material with a lot of crystals on

2578
01:52:35,960 --> 01:52:42,078
it it was in July you know so we made

2579
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:44,840
ice water har for them there in

2580
01:52:42,078 --> 01:52:48,078
Malaga and they you know those people

2581
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:50,400
were traditional in hash their father

2582
01:52:48,078 --> 01:52:53,399
and their grandfather already smoked

2583
01:52:50,399 --> 01:52:56,679
hash you know that's how integrated they

2584
01:52:53,399 --> 01:52:59,679
are has smoke has smokers and the the

2585
01:52:56,679 --> 01:53:01,800
the culture for harush is there so when

2586
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:05,039
I make the Bobble hash and they saw it

2587
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:09,400
and they tried it they said it's like

2588
01:53:05,039 --> 01:53:10,800
z00 yeah they call it z00 quality this

2589
01:53:09,399 --> 01:53:13,000
is like the the hash that you would

2590
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:16,840
normally get you cannot get it because

2591
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:19,118
Moroccans normally don't import z0 it is

2592
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:21,880
for it is for the

2593
01:53:19,118 --> 01:53:24,679
family keep going down the farther away

2594
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:27,800
from the farm it gets there's commercial

2595
01:53:24,679 --> 01:53:30,760
stuff that's made and there's the top

2596
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:33,199
level yeah so so bubble has of course

2597
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:36,520
didn't have this Aroma that were used to

2598
01:53:33,198 --> 01:53:38,319
normally from the from the dry sift poll

2599
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:40,840
pollination of har traditionally you

2600
01:53:38,319 --> 01:53:43,759
know they beat it you know in Morocco

2601
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:46,000
it's it's not gravity it falls so yeah

2602
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:47,440
so it's like uh different flavor but it

2603
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:50,279
was so strong for

2604
01:53:47,439 --> 01:53:52,039
them they say is like man that is and I

2605
01:53:50,279 --> 01:53:54,800
show them the bags and you know and of

2606
01:53:52,039 --> 01:53:57,960
course that was like bubble man you know

2607
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:59,719
uh and and Mila of course before him

2608
01:53:57,960 --> 01:54:01,800
that you know with the with the the

2609
01:53:59,719 --> 01:54:04,239
extraction but bubbleman had so many

2610
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:07,079
different grades of the of the silks you

2611
01:54:04,238 --> 01:54:10,519
know different screens so many you know

2612
01:54:07,078 --> 01:54:10,519
Moroccan hash typically

2613
01:54:11,359 --> 01:54:15,839
made well I mean where you were

2614
01:54:13,599 --> 01:54:19,000
traveling you know in Spain

2615
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:22,119
andish they call it hashish dry sift

2616
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:23,238
it's hash hashish dry sift they call it

2617
01:54:22,118 --> 01:54:24,399
po

2618
01:54:23,238 --> 01:54:27,399
Moroccan

2619
01:54:24,399 --> 01:54:30,000
poen because you can break it with your

2620
01:54:27,399 --> 01:54:33,279
it's like very Brownie and you can break

2621
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:35,359
it apart very easily it's like caca you

2622
01:54:33,279 --> 01:54:38,399
know like yeah you have you know like

2623
01:54:35,359 --> 01:54:42,000
this it's like and it's very tasty and

2624
01:54:38,399 --> 01:54:44,559
it's not strong the poen you know poang

2625
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:48,760
is really like the day smoke but then

2626

2647
01:55:35,158 --> 01:55:39,039
was like that but the the the thing I

2648
01:55:37,439 --> 01:55:41,439
saw there you know because in the

2649
01:55:39,039 --> 01:55:42,960
beginning when I come there me and my

2650
01:55:41,439 --> 01:55:45,359
friend get some hash and we were like

2651
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:47,520
trying to roll a joint on the you know

2652
01:55:45,359 --> 01:55:49,920
somewhere in the sea we eat something

2653
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:53,040
then we old guy came you know old

2654
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:54,719
fisherman and he's with his Moto bike

2655
01:55:53,039 --> 01:55:57,000
and he came and you were like hiding

2656
01:55:54,719 --> 01:55:59,198
first oh okay somebody came and that guy

2657
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:01,560
was like more than 60 years old you know

2658
01:55:59,198 --> 01:56:03,439

2659
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:06,000
saw that he eat something and then after

2660
01:56:03,439 --> 01:56:08,359
that he start to make a joint in his

2661
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:10,399
hand because Spanish people they always

2662
01:56:08,359 --> 01:56:13,639
make joints in the hand they make the

2663
01:56:10,399 --> 01:56:16,519
hashish and they rub it into the tobacco

2664
01:56:13,639 --> 01:56:18,880
or they rub it into the tobacco so they

2665
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:21,079
how they they smoke Kish with tobacco so

2666
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:23,279
that is Europeans do that you know but

2667
01:56:21,078 --> 01:56:26,198
they really Rob the hash into the day

2668
01:56:23,279 --> 01:56:29,639
like like massaging it into it you know

2669
01:56:26,198 --> 01:56:31,719
and this 60-year-old guy made a hash

2670
01:56:29,639 --> 01:56:33,840
joint there in front of us and we were

2671
01:56:31,719 --> 01:56:36,078
like watching each other like are we

2672
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:38,119
[ __ ] idiots you know like if this guy

2673
01:56:36,078 --> 01:56:41,519
is smoking like that and then of course

2674
01:56:38,118 --> 01:56:45,319
we we saw that guys are smoking joints

2675
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:48,800
in the street the police walks by nobody

2676
01:56:45,319 --> 01:56:50,679
cares nobody watch this that was in that

2677
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:53,199
time today of course we have these

2678
01:56:50,679 --> 01:56:55,480
Social Clubs you have everywhere around

2679
01:56:53,198 --> 01:56:57,198
Spain and canari islands and everywhere

2680
01:56:55,479 --> 01:57:01,479
you have these social clubs a lot of

2681
01:56:57,198 --> 01:57:04,839
wheat has been bred there um like a lot

2682
01:57:01,479 --> 01:57:07,959
of uh seed companies that you think that

2683
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:12,159
they are in-house production it's not

2684
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:14,840
it's from Spain from closets from houses

2685
01:57:12,158 --> 01:57:17,158
from I don't know what kind of places

2686
01:57:14,840 --> 01:57:18,880
you know maybe I won't tell anything

2687
01:57:17,158 --> 01:57:22,279
because I assume that it's like that I

2688
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:26,000
don't know but I assume because of uh

2689
01:57:22,279 --> 01:57:29,639
many years of experience you know uh

2690
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:32,359
yeah and there is uh for example seed uh

2691
01:57:29,639 --> 01:57:34,440
banks that pop up you know every day

2692
01:57:32,359 --> 01:57:36,399
here that is like just having a few

2693
01:57:34,439 --> 01:57:38,158
strains now you know just like we popped

2694
01:57:36,399 --> 01:57:40,319
up we have like five strains and nobody

2695
01:57:38,158 --> 01:57:42,279
even heard about them ever there is some

2696
01:57:40,319 --> 01:57:45,279
random pics you know some you see that

2697
01:57:42,279 --> 01:57:48,399
it's white label actually when you ask

2698
01:57:45,279 --> 01:57:51,679
them is it light label seed banks come

2699
01:57:48,399 --> 01:57:53,679
to your shop and um he try to sell to

2700
01:57:51,679 --> 01:57:56,118
your shop that you would resell them

2701
01:57:53,679 --> 01:57:59,440
yeah so normally I ask those kind of

2702
01:57:56,118 --> 01:58:01,238
seed banks uh do you label you know

2703
01:57:59,439 --> 01:58:04,198
normally they say it's not white label

2704
01:58:01,238 --> 01:58:06,198
but we buy from friends from Spain no

2705
01:58:04,198 --> 01:58:09,759
it's white label you know that's white

2706
01:58:06,198 --> 01:58:12,399
label that's right you know what I mean

2707
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:14,760
yeah I believe uh heres is um centered

2708
01:58:12,399 --> 01:58:17,519
in Spain is that correct have you heard

2709
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:19,320
before and then same with uh attitude

2710
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:22,119
right attitude attitude seat Bank yes

2711
01:58:19,319 --> 01:58:25,078
yes yes they move there because uh

2712
01:58:22,118 --> 01:58:26,359
genetics from um original Sensible Seeds

2713
01:58:25,078 --> 01:58:28,238
have you heard that original Sensible

2714
01:58:26,359 --> 01:58:29,679
Seeds yes I think it's all white label

2715
01:58:28,238 --> 01:58:31,879
though cuz they had a bunch of stuff

2716
01:58:29,679 --> 01:58:33,199
like I I got their Bruce Banner which

2717
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:35,159
you know as we know Bruce Banner is

2718
01:58:33,198 --> 01:58:36,638
actually from Darkhorse and everything

2719
01:58:35,158 --> 01:58:38,719
and I actually still have the plant to

2720
01:58:36,639 --> 01:58:40,800
this day it was just a phenomenal plant

2721
01:58:38,719 --> 01:58:42,158
but it wasn't you know exactly um you

2722
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:44,400
know it wasn't the Bruce braner strain

2723
01:58:42,158 --> 01:58:46,759
it was just their combination of the

2724
01:58:44,399 --> 01:58:48,238
genetics but um everything I've grown

2725
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:49,800
from you know what I I've got from

2726
01:58:48,238 --> 01:58:52,718
Spanish companies were it were all

2727
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:54,719
excellent genetics mhm do you guys know

2728
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:57,880
G proof I'm familiar I don't know him

2729
01:58:54,719 --> 01:59:01,039
very well but I know who he is

2730
01:58:57,880 --> 01:59:02,679
yeah yeah for example I got uh clink you

2731
01:59:01,039 --> 01:59:05,560
know some people ask me already for some

2732
01:59:02,679 --> 01:59:08,639
of his trains here but in some time

2733
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:11,520
Spanish resellers you could get his gear

2734
01:59:08,639 --> 01:59:13,840
but now it's almost impossible there is

2735
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:15,639
the same thing for DJ Short seats we

2736
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:18,679
could get them at a certain point of

2737
01:59:15,639 --> 01:59:20,719
time now it's impossible the old world

2738
01:59:18,679 --> 01:59:23,639
genetics that he has now or DJ Short

2739
01:59:20,719 --> 01:59:25,719
label that he has can get it you know

2740
01:59:23,639 --> 01:59:29,679
from American genetics what we can get

2741
01:59:25,719 --> 01:59:32,840
here you know from the from it is few

2742
01:59:29,679 --> 01:59:35,039
seat Banks but mostly it is like you

2743
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:37,639
know we look to America and you look to

2744
01:59:35,039 --> 01:59:40,039
Europe you know what I mean you want our

2745
01:59:37,639 --> 01:59:43,239
strength we want your strs you know it

2746
01:59:40,039 --> 01:59:45,920
is a very funny situation actually right

2747
01:59:43,238 --> 01:59:48,039
because I I want your clones you want

2748
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:49,279
mine clones actually it's like I would

2749
01:59:48,039 --> 01:59:51,639
like to try them because it's so

2750
01:59:49,279 --> 01:59:53,319
different from that what I know you know

2751
01:59:51,639 --> 01:59:55,440
I was talking with Gabby about Amnesia

2752
01:59:53,319 --> 01:59:58,000
core cut you know it is all around

2753
01:59:55,439 --> 02:00:01,479
Austria almost every second shop has

2754
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:04,520
this cut so common here Amnesia the

2755
02:00:01,479 --> 02:00:07,718
super silver ha cut you know we feel the

2756
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:09,360
same way like with Canada because

2757
02:00:07,719 --> 02:00:12,239
obviously there's a border and it's

2758
02:00:09,359 --> 02:00:14,639
different countries and so there's a lot

2759
02:00:12,238 --> 02:00:17,559
of communication now between Canada and

2760
02:00:14,639 --> 02:00:20,800
America with all the podcasting and all

2761
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:23,360
the forums and IG and all that but

2762
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:25,520
there's still a bunch of stuff up there

2763
02:00:23,359 --> 02:00:27,519
that people are interested in and stuff

2764
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:30,639
that's down here that they're interested

2765
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:33,520
in that borders just make it tough you

2766
02:00:30,639 --> 02:00:35,840
know cannabis isn't free you know it's

2767
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:38,079
not it's not free moving it still has

2768
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:39,760
issues and stuff like that and so

2769
02:00:38,078 --> 02:00:41,000
there's Pockets where yeah you look over

2770
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:43,119
and you're like oh what do these people

2771
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:47,158
have what's survived what's good over

2772
02:00:43,118 --> 02:00:49,399
there you know and um you know and then

2773
02:00:47,158 --> 02:00:52,399
all that stuff to me is like with all

2774
02:00:49,399 --> 02:00:55,158
the changes and legalization

2775
02:00:52,399 --> 02:00:58,279
like it's still hard to hold on to stuff

2776
02:00:55,158 --> 02:00:59,719
it just changes the reasons why because

2777
02:00:58,279 --> 02:01:02,158
right now it's like I would say in

2778
02:00:59,719 --> 02:01:05,719
California or America in general there's

2779
02:01:02,158 --> 02:01:07,960
this phrase purple candy gas which is

2780
02:01:05,719 --> 02:01:10,599
like you want purple weed that smells

2781
02:01:07,960 --> 02:01:13,039
kind of candish but has some gassy OG

2782
02:01:10,599 --> 02:01:15,520
notes and that sort of dominates

2783
02:01:13,039 --> 02:01:18,800
everything it's it's people are people

2784
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:21,280
get it's tough to there isn't like a

2785
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:24,159
repository yet where people can just

2786
02:01:21,279 --> 02:01:26,639
like store old strains and come back to

2787
02:01:24,158 --> 02:01:29,078
them you know like you every time

2788
02:01:26,639 --> 02:01:30,880
there's a huge like wave of popularity

2789
02:01:29,078 --> 02:01:34,799
in something you risk a lot of other

2790
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:36,480
diversity just being lost you know

2791
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:38,560
because people want to grow it's easy to

2792
02:01:36,479 --> 02:01:40,319
move yeah people want to grow what

2793
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:43,400
Brokers want people want to grow what

2794
02:01:40,319 --> 02:01:47,078
the market wants and you

2795
02:01:43,399 --> 02:01:51,238
know huh you know what else happened

2796
02:01:47,078 --> 02:01:53,000
Francis when hop vroid came around a lot

2797
02:01:51,238 --> 02:01:57,039
of people got rid of their

2798
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:59,359
genetics and didn't attempt to save it

2799
02:01:57,039 --> 02:02:01,479
you know using maram or they said oh

2800
02:01:59,359 --> 02:02:03,880
this plant's sick I got to get rid of it

2801
02:02:01,479 --> 02:02:07,319
and I wonder how many genetics we lost

2802
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:10,920
that way of just like in the H in the

2803
02:02:07,319 --> 02:02:13,599
Cannabis Community hop Leon was like our

2804
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:17,158
AIDS by the time that people realized it

2805
02:02:13,599 --> 02:02:19,159
was a problem it was all over the place

2806
02:02:17,158 --> 02:02:20,799
and people saw things plants getting

2807
02:02:19,158 --> 02:02:23,118
sick and issues happening but they

2808
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:25,560
didn't know why they didn't know what

2809
02:02:23,118 --> 02:02:28,359
was causing it they didn't know what the

2810
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:31,199
transmission was like so how to stop

2811
02:02:28,359 --> 02:02:33,519
it but uh can you can you tell me that

2812
02:02:31,198 --> 02:02:35,598
it was the damping effect you can just

2813
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:38,400
see how a wildfire goes through a

2814
02:02:35,599 --> 02:02:41,078
facility with a damping it is like that

2815
02:02:38,399 --> 02:02:44,238
because I never saw that you know it's

2816
02:02:41,078 --> 02:02:47,078
like you know we test but uh for for us

2817
02:02:44,238 --> 02:02:49,879
we are lucky on this moment what we

2818
02:02:47,078 --> 02:02:51,840
trying to to prepare for what you know

2819
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:53,599
like you know what mean like back when

2820
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:55,279
Gabby and I first became friends you

2821
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:57,800
would just take a razor blade or a pair

2822
02:02:55,279 --> 02:02:59,960
of scissors and you would just cut off

2823
02:02:57,800 --> 02:03:02,000
whatever plant you wanted until the

2824
02:02:59,960 --> 02:03:04,359
razor got dirty you never considered

2825
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:06,039
anything like that and now I would say

2826
02:03:04,359 --> 02:03:08,078
once now that we've learned how hop

2827
02:03:06,039 --> 02:03:10,679
Laton works it's almost a little bit

2828
02:03:08,078 --> 02:03:14,000
like getting a tattoo where like each

2829
02:03:10,679 --> 02:03:16,399
plant needs a fresh blade or sterilized

2830
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:19,000
blade or scissors and there's various

2831
02:03:16,399 --> 02:03:21,000
techniques you can do but that wasn't

2832
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:23,198
the standard in cannabis so like when it

2833
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:25,399
was starting to spread people were just

2834
02:03:23,198 --> 02:03:28,359
taking the same dirty scissors or the

2835
02:03:25,399 --> 02:03:30,879
same dirty razor and cutting dozens of

2836
02:03:28,359 --> 02:03:32,759
different plants and plugging them and

2837
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:36,279
not realizing that they were spreading

2838
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:39,039
it and then what really messed us up is

2839
02:03:36,279 --> 02:03:41,559
that people started buying clones from

2840
02:03:39,039 --> 02:03:43,399
nurseries so instead of just like

2841
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:47,119
growing their own moms in their own

2842
02:03:43,399 --> 02:03:49,118
houses and so once it got into a nursery

2843
02:03:47,118 --> 02:03:52,399
that Nursery might sell it to thousands

2844
02:03:49,118 --> 02:03:55,078
of customers for years before they even

2845
02:03:52,399 --> 02:03:57,399
realized they had a problem and now

2846
02:03:55,078 --> 02:03:59,759
they're taking steps to make it not that

2847
02:03:57,399 --> 02:04:01,598
way but when it was spreading the first

2848
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:05,280
four or five years it was percolating

2849
02:04:01,599 --> 02:04:08,159
around nobody was taking any steps black

2850
02:04:05,279 --> 02:04:10,000
heart Nursery out of Harbor dark heart

2851
02:04:08,158 --> 02:04:11,479
Nursery out a and then selling out of

2852
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:14,800
harbor side that was like the the

2853
02:04:11,479 --> 02:04:16,519
epidemic and then they're like for sure

2854
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:18,239
I'll be right back again gentlemen my

2855
02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:22,199
kids are calling hold

2856
02:04:18,238 --> 02:04:24,799
on noise yeah yeah so when the plants

2857
02:04:22,198 --> 02:04:26,479
got sick before they knew it was hop

2858
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:28,119
latent they might have thrown it away

2859
02:04:26,479 --> 02:04:31,000
because the plant was just growing

2860
02:04:28,118 --> 02:04:33,558
shitty and then after when they knew it

2861
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:36,479
was hop lant a lot of people destroyed

2862
02:04:33,559 --> 02:04:38,279
plants because they were just going to

2863
02:04:36,479 --> 02:04:41,078
go move on to something else that wasn't

2864
02:04:38,279 --> 02:04:44,399
sick that's how a lot of genetics were

2865
02:04:41,078 --> 02:04:46,078
lost I think you know

2866
02:04:44,399 --> 02:04:48,279
so

2867
02:04:46,078 --> 02:04:50,479
but we could have saved them we could

2868
02:04:48,279 --> 02:04:52,158
have saved them with them yeah today

2869
02:04:50,479 --> 02:04:56,439
it's actually you know that could you

2870
02:04:52,158 --> 02:04:58,598
can yeah I know that you do uh marem

2871
02:04:56,439 --> 02:05:01,000
extraction right I mean you you you do

2872
02:04:58,599 --> 02:05:02,960
it right yeah yeah so I mean um and it's

2873
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:05,679
all because of hlvd you know earlier

2874
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:07,920
this year um you know I was informed

2875
02:05:05,679 --> 02:05:09,559
about this clone company and you know

2876
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:11,078
initially we thought it was okay and so

2877
02:05:09,559 --> 02:05:15,480
I I placed a big

2878
02:05:11,078 --> 02:05:17,238
order and um I got the order and you

2879
02:05:15,479 --> 02:05:19,078
know after talking with the community

2880
02:05:17,238 --> 02:05:20,238
and you know people recommending I test

2881
02:05:19,078 --> 02:05:21,880
it I said you know let's just take the

2882
02:05:20,238 --> 02:05:24,238
step further we'll get it tested and lo

2883
02:05:21,880 --> 02:05:27,760
and behold four out of the 12 you know

2884
02:05:24,238 --> 02:05:29,279
were U Were positive and so um I'm

2885
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:30,880
sitting there freaking out like oh [ __ ]

2886
02:05:29,279 --> 02:05:32,639
dude like I just spent at least a grand

2887
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:35,239
on on these plants and now I got to

2888
02:05:32,639 --> 02:05:37,359
throw them out and so you know I had it

2889
02:05:35,238 --> 02:05:39,238
quarantined the whole time um I threw

2890
02:05:37,359 --> 02:05:41,920
out those four I waited another two

2891
02:05:39,238 --> 02:05:44,039
weeks and I retested and another you

2892
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:46,158
know four popped positive and so I was

2893
02:05:44,039 --> 02:05:48,078
like you know [ __ ] like this is crazy

2894
02:05:46,158 --> 02:05:50,359
like all my hard work um after these

2895
02:05:48,078 --> 02:05:51,960
years of feno hunting and selecting

2896
02:05:50,359 --> 02:05:54,000
these strains that I wanted to work with

2897
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:56,679
you know they're all in Jeopardy because

2898
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:58,520
I have these you know these sick plants

2899
02:05:56,679 --> 02:05:59,599
in you know inside my room of course

2900
02:05:58,520 --> 02:06:00,920
they're quarantining in their own

2901
02:05:59,599 --> 02:06:03,159
separate tent and everything like that

2902
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:04,760
but I ended up throwing all those out

2903
02:06:03,158 --> 02:06:07,359
but it really didn't sit well with me

2904
02:06:04,760 --> 02:06:10,159
you know and um that kind of started me

2905
02:06:07,359 --> 02:06:12,000
on my path of learning about you know um

2906
02:06:10,158 --> 02:06:14,238
how can you save a plant that's infected

2907
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:16,158
with you know a disease you know cuz as

2908
02:06:14,238 --> 02:06:18,479
we know it's not just hlvd but it could

2909
02:06:16,158 --> 02:06:20,279
be you know uh ferium or any of the

2910
02:06:18,479 --> 02:06:22,359
other you know fungal infections and

2911
02:06:20,279 --> 02:06:24,359
everything like that and

2912
02:06:22,359 --> 02:06:27,679
detrimental to the plant I mean we're

2913
02:06:24,359 --> 02:06:30,118
the the the the positive thing is one

2914
02:06:27,679 --> 02:06:31,760
day we're going to get to a point where

2915
02:06:30,118 --> 02:06:34,000
we're going to be able to trade a lot

2916
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:35,840
more freely maybe among states and

2917
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:39,158
countries and stuff like that with a lot

2918
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:41,239
less risk the downside of that is that

2919
02:06:39,158 --> 02:06:42,879
we're going to definitely end up having

2920
02:06:41,238 --> 02:06:45,238
that continue and there's going to be

2921
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:48,559
way more risk of pathogens fungal

2922
02:06:45,238 --> 02:06:50,879
diseases thyroids spreading around which

2923
02:06:48,559 --> 02:06:53,400
may be localized and then they're just

2924
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:55,239
going to end up all over and just like

2925
02:06:53,399 --> 02:06:58,118
hop Lon there could be something right

2926
02:06:55,238 --> 02:07:00,678
now percolating around that people don't

2927
02:06:58,118 --> 02:07:03,479
know about and is unidentified it's not

2928
02:07:00,679 --> 02:07:05,639
like hop latent is the last it's

2929
02:07:03,479 --> 02:07:08,879
probably just the

2930
02:07:05,639 --> 02:07:11,039
first I def I treat like I have a bunch

2931
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:14,760
of moms and stuff like that I treat my

2932
02:07:11,039 --> 02:07:18,960
moms like I'm a tattoo artist right

2933
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:22,719
where every single plant gets its own

2934
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:25,480
sterilized scissors or razor or gear I

2935
02:07:22,719 --> 02:07:26,639
try to take all these different steps to

2936
02:07:25,479 --> 02:07:29,799
like

2937
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:34,639
prevent transmission and even though I

2938
02:07:29,800 --> 02:07:36,320
don't have it I think I assume I do yeah

2939
02:07:34,639 --> 02:07:39,118
that's how you have to treat your faity

2940
02:07:36,319 --> 02:07:43,078
I assume like I do you know so you know

2941
02:07:39,118 --> 02:07:46,920
I mean it just is uh it's it it's crappy

2942
02:07:43,078 --> 02:07:49,118
because yeah I um I can't see tried to

2943
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:50,920
Glory because of how wet it is and um I

2944
02:07:49,118 --> 02:07:52,359
need to actually kind of attend to this

2945
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:53,239
um I have several different samples in

2946
02:07:52,359 --> 02:07:56,519
there that I'm going to be kind of

2947
02:07:53,238 --> 02:07:57,799
taking out and you know uh putting into

2948
02:07:56,520 --> 02:08:01,079
their own containers and everything like

2949
02:07:57,800 --> 02:08:03,360
that but um this one I started uh

2950
02:08:01,078 --> 02:08:06,078
probably about the end of August and it

2951
02:08:03,359 --> 02:08:08,799
was all from Mary stems so um you know

2952
02:08:06,078 --> 02:08:10,399
can you show people what a fresh stem

2953
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:13,320
looks like so they can see how much

2954
02:08:10,399 --> 02:08:17,399
that's grown it's tiny it's like a it's

2955
02:08:13,319 --> 02:08:19,960
like a sliver it's like a speck of yeah

2956
02:08:17,399 --> 02:08:21,638
right because you know most most people

2957
02:08:19,960 --> 02:08:23,000
look at that go that's just a little

2958
02:08:21,639 --> 02:08:26,159
plants growing in there but they don't

2959
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:27,599
realize that came from virtually nothing

2960
02:08:26,158 --> 02:08:29,078
you know like he has to do these

2961
02:08:27,599 --> 02:08:31,840
cuttings under a

2962
02:08:29,078 --> 02:08:33,599
microscope so here's one from the

2963
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:35,760
seventh sorry I have a little bit it's a

2964
02:08:33,599 --> 02:08:39,279
little dirty here let me see if

2965
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:41,360
I so just right there it's from the sth

2966
02:08:39,279 --> 02:08:44,639
it's tiny yeah yeah so that's what

2967
02:08:41,359 --> 02:08:46,279
almost 20 days you know so it's tiny and

2968
02:08:44,639 --> 02:08:48,239
I have to use a microscope I work in

2969
02:08:46,279 --> 02:08:50,519
front of a laminar Flo hood you know to

2970
02:08:48,238 --> 02:08:52,799
make sure it's you know as sterile of an

2971
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:55,599
environment that I could work because

2972
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:57,320
you know um as far as the media that

2973
02:08:55,599 --> 02:09:00,159
you're using in here if there's any

2974
02:08:57,319 --> 02:09:02,799
specs of um yeah anything it'll take off

2975
02:09:00,158 --> 02:09:06,519
you know so you have to have a um

2976
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:09,159
sterile area of working and um for

2977
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:11,239
micropropagation you know uh as Gabby

2978
02:09:09,158 --> 02:09:13,598
he's talked about before you know um you

2979
02:09:11,238 --> 02:09:15,479
work with essentially a still air box

2980
02:09:13,599 --> 02:09:16,719
and it's not you know a perfect still a

2981
02:09:15,479 --> 02:09:19,959
box because you don't have like the the

2982
02:09:16,719 --> 02:09:21,239
gloves in it but um I don't think that

2983
02:09:19,960 --> 02:09:23,039
you could do the same with Mary stem I

2984
02:09:21,238 --> 02:09:24,399
think Mary Sim definitely would require

2985
02:09:23,039 --> 02:09:26,920
a

2986
02:09:24,399 --> 02:09:28,519
flood just the contact time alone you're

2987
02:09:26,920 --> 02:09:31,359
working with it for longer than a

2988
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:32,000
smaller cutting mhm yeah I feel like

2989
02:09:31,359 --> 02:09:34,759
I've

2990
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:36,639
got definitely quicker at it um and I

2991
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:38,599
can extract a Mary Simmon I'd say

2992
02:09:36,639 --> 02:09:42,078
anywhere from five to 10 minutes you

2993
02:09:38,599 --> 02:09:43,159
know so but that's still a long time if

2994
02:09:42,078 --> 02:09:45,039
you're not sitting there in front of the

2995
02:09:43,158 --> 02:09:48,039
flo

2996
02:09:45,039 --> 02:09:50,800
Hood but actually it's great that we

2997
02:09:48,039 --> 02:09:54,359
it's it's coming this age where hom

2998
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:56,960
Growers will also do uh marem extraction

2999
02:09:54,359 --> 02:09:59,920
or noal maybe at home you know what I

3000
02:09:56,960 --> 02:10:02,359
mean that that we have a possibility

3001
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:04,760
that you know there is systems out there

3002
02:10:02,359 --> 02:10:08,279
that uh allow you to do that you know

3003
02:10:04,760 --> 02:10:10,599
this small you know one came in out from

3004
02:10:08,279 --> 02:10:13,559
this guy from American guy right uh

3005
02:10:10,599 --> 02:10:16,719
Graham yeah I mean crazy that's crazy

3006
02:10:13,559 --> 02:10:18,159
you know that's wow I have I have photos

3007
02:10:16,719 --> 02:10:21,000
and I'm going to share them in this

3008
02:10:18,158 --> 02:10:24,039
video of tissue culture that I did with

3009
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:27,359
his kit and and it works and you know

3010
02:10:24,039 --> 02:10:30,760
the one thing about noal tissue culture

3011
02:10:27,359 --> 02:10:34,158
is um while it may not remove

3012
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:37,840
virus you have clean clones of like

3013
02:10:34,158 --> 02:10:39,719
mildew and bugs and so like if you know

3014
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:41,760
everyone that shared a plant with me

3015
02:10:39,719 --> 02:10:44,158
throughout the years had given me a

3016
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:45,840
plant grown even with nodal tissue

3017
02:10:44,158 --> 02:10:48,359
culture that would have saved me a lot

3018
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:50,360
of headaches from I mean got spidermites

3019
02:10:48,359 --> 02:10:52,880
countless times from people sharing

3020
02:10:50,359 --> 02:10:55,880
plants with people minus the whole thing

3021
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:58,639
but I definitely think it has its

3022
02:10:55,880 --> 02:11:00,199
uses abely I would say another huge one

3023
02:10:58,639 --> 02:11:02,719
especially from all of us you know

3024
02:11:00,198 --> 02:11:04,799
enthusiasts who love every single strain

3025
02:11:02,719 --> 02:11:07,158
we come across or you know just without

3026
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:08,880
but um the fact that I've had this in a

3027
02:11:07,158 --> 02:11:11,519
dish and then you know now in in this

3028
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:13,679
container for uh what what are we

3029
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:16,079
looking at like 3 months or so like the

3030
02:11:13,679 --> 02:11:17,599
ability to keep your genetics on a shelf

3031
02:11:16,078 --> 02:11:20,279
without having to worry about the SP

3032
02:11:17,599 --> 02:11:22,279
that the mom plant takes up or feeding

3033
02:11:20,279 --> 02:11:24,000
it even like I just let it sit there and

3034
02:11:22,279 --> 02:11:25,078
chill and once it gets big enough you

3035
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:27,399
know I I'll move it to a different

3036
02:11:25,078 --> 02:11:29,000
container and I'm getting ready my my

3037
02:11:27,399 --> 02:11:30,039
next plan actually this week um

3038
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,439
especially like with this bigger one

3039
02:11:30,039 --> 02:11:33,559
that's kind of yellowing a little bit on

3040
02:11:31,439 --> 02:11:35,479
the leaves I'm going to cut that one off

3041
02:11:33,559 --> 02:11:37,360
of the little um callus at the bottom

3042
02:11:35,479 --> 02:11:39,519
and Transplant it to another container

3043
02:11:37,359 --> 02:11:41,399
that I'm going to prepare with some uh

3044
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:45,960
plant growth Regulators so everything

3045
02:11:41,399 --> 02:11:49,039
that far it has plant growth Regulators

3046
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:51,239
at all this is all just agar sugar and

3047
02:11:49,039 --> 02:11:53,840
uh M&amp;S or you know I always [ __ ] up the

3048
02:11:51,238 --> 02:11:55,718
name it's like miraga and scoy or so

3049
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:57,840
actually you you do your own agar you

3050
02:11:55,719 --> 02:11:59,480
mix your own agars for the purpose

3051
02:11:57,840 --> 02:12:03,039
whether you let it grow or you related

3052
02:11:59,479 --> 02:12:04,359
to root right right but I mean he

3053
02:12:03,039 --> 02:12:08,198
doesn't put

3054
02:12:04,359 --> 02:12:11,519
hormones he's not he's not putting so

3055
02:12:08,198 --> 02:12:13,759
one thing that I you know like CU not so

3056
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:15,840
you know he has concerns about it right

3057
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:17,760
yeah he told in one podcast I wanted to

3058
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:20,520
ask him about this

3059
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:23,840
conern yeah yeah I wonder if you have

3060
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:26,280
concerns if you knew he's not using

3061
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:28,679
hormones like those plants are basically

3062
02:12:26,279 --> 02:12:31,158
growing in water and

3063
02:12:28,679 --> 02:12:33,719
sugar you know so

3064
02:12:31,158 --> 02:12:38,759
like I I think that kind of addresses a

3065
02:12:33,719 --> 02:12:41,039
lot of your concerns so here I um I have

3066
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:42,880
to deal with this today or but look at

3067
02:12:41,039 --> 02:12:46,920
all the roots coming out of this one

3068
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:48,239
like there's no hormones in that at all

3069
02:12:46,920 --> 02:12:49,239
like this is going to be quite the for

3070
02:12:48,238 --> 02:12:52,198
me to

3071
02:12:49,238 --> 02:12:53,919
untangle but like like barely even any

3072
02:12:52,198 --> 02:12:54,879
green growth at the top you know like

3073
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:57,639
it's kind of hard to see that on the

3074
02:12:54,880 --> 02:13:01,520
camera but just look at all the

3075
02:12:57,639 --> 02:13:03,440
we yeah that's insane and again no

3076
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:05,000
hormones at all that's just the plant

3077
02:13:03,439 --> 02:13:08,078
doing you know what it does with the

3078
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:10,719
hormones already in in that

3079
02:13:08,078 --> 02:13:12,599
like everything you you mentioned about

3080
02:13:10,719 --> 02:13:14,559
like storing genetics and having them

3081
02:13:12,599 --> 02:13:16,319
grow slowly and having them be healthy

3082
02:13:14,559 --> 02:13:20,279
and having them not take as much space

3083
02:13:16,319 --> 02:13:22,359
up I like a whole bunch I will say my

3084
02:13:20,279 --> 02:13:25,039
experience has been and I think

3085
02:13:22,359 --> 02:13:27,839
meristem is it's obviously expensive and

3086
02:13:25,039 --> 02:13:31,039
timec consuming for most people I do

3087
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:33,800
think it cleans up like pesticides or

3088
02:13:31,039 --> 02:13:35,679
herbicides or you know different things

3089
02:13:33,800 --> 02:13:39,599
that might have been like sprayed on the

3090
02:13:35,679 --> 02:13:43,399
plant it doesn't seem to me sadly that

3091
02:13:39,599 --> 02:13:45,119
marem solves The Hop latent issue you

3092
02:13:43,399 --> 02:13:48,558
know or at least I've

3093
02:13:45,118 --> 02:13:50,198
heard plenty of failure you know like

3094
02:13:48,559 --> 02:13:52,800
when it comes to like thinking that that

3095
02:13:50,198 --> 02:13:54,319
was going to be the Cure and I have I do

3096
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:56,639
think like with any I don't want to say

3097
02:13:54,319 --> 02:13:59,639
it's new technology but like new to

3098
02:13:56,639 --> 02:14:02,118
cannabis I worked in a a farm in Santa

3099
02:13:59,639 --> 02:14:05,920
Barbara where we got about 880,000

3100
02:14:02,118 --> 02:14:09,439
uh tissue culture clones and they had

3101
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:12,480
been treated with some kind of hormone

3102
02:14:09,439 --> 02:14:14,359
okay and so when we grew them all out we

3103
02:14:12,479 --> 02:14:18,479
planted them in our beds and we grew out

3104
02:14:14,359 --> 02:14:21,839
Acres of them and they all threw male

3105
02:14:18,479 --> 02:14:24,959
balls like multiple times like I'm

3106
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:26,520
talking I had the head guy I won't say

3107
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:29,880
the company name because that would me

3108
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:32,280
mean but I had the head grower visit the

3109
02:14:29,880 --> 02:14:36,359
farm and he was like I want to see how

3110
02:14:32,279 --> 02:14:39,279
bad this male problem is right and so he

3111
02:14:36,359 --> 02:14:41,759
walks up and there's like 40 or 40 like

3112
02:14:39,279 --> 02:14:43,039
the workforce down there is all Hispanic

3113
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:46,199
or whatever so there's like a bunch

3114
02:14:43,039 --> 02:14:50,279
there's dozens of people picking

3115
02:14:46,198 --> 02:14:51,879
off male flowers and he walks up and I'm

3116
02:14:50,279 --> 02:14:53,639
like you want to see how many there are

3117
02:14:51,880 --> 02:14:56,800
look down and he looks down and we had

3118
02:14:53,639 --> 02:14:58,840
like two or three five gallon buckets

3119
02:14:56,800 --> 02:15:00,920
full of male flowers that they'd already

3120
02:14:58,840 --> 02:15:03,400
picked before he got

3121
02:15:00,920 --> 02:15:06,520
there like that many it really and then

3122
02:15:03,399 --> 02:15:08,439
as you guys know when a plant gets light

3123
02:15:06,520 --> 02:15:11,119
when seated it doesn't matter if it got

3124
02:15:08,439 --> 02:15:14,319
lightly seated or heavily seated it

3125
02:15:11,118 --> 02:15:17,039
stops growing flour the way that it

3126
02:15:14,319 --> 02:15:19,639
should and it focuses on finishing the

3127
02:15:17,039 --> 02:15:22,078
seed that is been like finishing what's

3128
02:15:19,639 --> 02:15:24,760
been pollinated so instead of like

3129
02:15:22,078 --> 02:15:26,519
getting these big robust plants about

3130
02:15:24,760 --> 02:15:28,599
two and a half or three weeks in it all

3131
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:31,280
got pollinated then we got dink dink

3132
02:15:28,599 --> 02:15:34,279
dink dink dink dink dink of these nugs

3133
02:15:31,279 --> 02:15:36,639
and it was basically just they messed up

3134
02:15:34,279 --> 02:15:39,519
on on their hormones on their levels on

3135
02:15:36,639 --> 02:15:41,679
their agar or whatever they were doing

3136
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:43,440
and so it was to the point where they

3137
02:15:41,679 --> 02:15:46,000
basically I think ended up going out of

3138
02:15:43,439 --> 02:15:48,000
business the genetics they Gene no it

3139
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:49,719
wasn't it was their stuff but it was

3140
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:53,039
crazy because it was a big enough Farm

3141
02:15:49,719 --> 02:15:56,639
we were running about 38 or 40 different

3142
02:15:53,039 --> 02:15:58,880
things all 12 things from them did the

3143
02:15:56,639 --> 02:16:02,920
same thing and nothing from anyone else

3144
02:15:58,880 --> 02:16:05,000
did it wow so it was just oh my God

3145
02:16:02,920 --> 02:16:06,719
that's crazy

3146
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:09,520
selection that's but that's also

3147
02:16:06,719 --> 02:16:10,960
addressed by Cosmic but I just mean well

3148
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:13,320
I just meant more like there's a

3149
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:15,760
learning curve we don't know you know I

3150
02:16:13,319 --> 02:16:18,359
almost think in a way and maybe I'm

3151
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:21,280
wrong but I also got like I have some

3152
02:16:18,359 --> 02:16:23,238
photos on my phone of like getting a 100

3153
02:16:21,279 --> 02:16:25,759
plants at a time from a different

3154
02:16:23,238 --> 02:16:28,078
company that was doing tissue culture

3155
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:30,440
that didn't give us any issues at all

3156
02:16:28,078 --> 02:16:33,718
except for the Clones were literally

3157
02:16:30,439 --> 02:16:36,920
like this big in these tiny little

3158
02:16:33,718 --> 02:16:38,638
rooted like plugs and you had to plant

3159
02:16:36,920 --> 02:16:41,200
them and then we had to make in the

3160
02:16:38,638 --> 02:16:44,000
field we had to make like

3161
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:46,359
little you rip open the top I can show

3162
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:49,439
you pictures Gabby of like there were

3163
02:16:46,359 --> 02:16:54,000
these like 100 clones fit into a tray

3164
02:16:49,439 --> 02:16:56,120
like that big you know and yeah I've got

3165
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:58,120
you know they grew fine but you needed

3166
02:16:56,120 --> 02:17:00,280
to Baby the heck out of them for the

3167
02:16:58,120 --> 02:17:02,920
first week to 10 days to get them

3168
02:17:00,280 --> 02:17:05,200
because it's such a small amount of

3169
02:17:02,920 --> 02:17:08,359
plant it could

3170
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:11,079
die those clones took an extra month to

3171
02:17:08,359 --> 02:17:13,479
grow so I mean it literally took it it

3172
02:17:11,079 --> 02:17:16,239
took one month till they looked like a

3173
02:17:13,478 --> 02:17:19,718
clone that you would normally have

3174
02:17:16,239 --> 02:17:22,638
freshly rooted purchased from a nursery

3175
02:17:19,718 --> 02:17:25,759
they were tiny dud like for me at least

3176
02:17:22,638 --> 02:17:28,000
so far from what I've seen I think

3177
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:30,398
cleaning up plants and trading plants

3178
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:33,040
amongst friends using tissue culture or

3179
02:17:30,398 --> 02:17:34,799
going through Marist stem is cool but if

3180
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:37,599
I was doing something production

3181
02:17:34,799 --> 02:17:40,599
oriented I would want to grow that plant

3182
02:17:37,599 --> 02:17:44,679
out in a normal fashion once it's been

3183
02:17:40,599 --> 02:17:47,558
cleaned up and get a big big vigorous

3184
02:17:44,679 --> 02:17:50,040
mom and start taking tons of clones off

3185
02:17:47,558 --> 02:17:52,438
it the way I normally do because then I

3186
02:17:50,040 --> 02:17:54,840
can start with a clone that's like this

3187
02:17:52,439 --> 02:17:56,599
big if I want you know what I mean or I

3188
02:17:54,840 --> 02:17:58,840
can leave extra leaves on it it's just

3189
02:17:56,599 --> 02:18:00,200
going to root and go and I'm not so I'm

3190
02:17:58,840 --> 02:18:02,519
not saying it's a negative I'm just

3191
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:06,960
saying that like it requires its

3192
02:18:02,519 --> 02:18:06,960
own like application to be

3193
02:18:07,359 --> 02:18:10,760
successful so that's like the

3194
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:12,960
application that companies like jungle

3195
02:18:10,760 --> 02:18:14,960
boys use it for where they're not doing

3196
02:18:12,959 --> 02:18:16,879
actual micropropagation it's more just

3197
02:18:14,959 --> 02:18:19,398
genetic preservation and then pulling

3198
02:18:16,879 --> 02:18:21,839
out clean mothers and actually vegging

3199
02:18:19,398 --> 02:18:25,358
them out producing

3200
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:28,120
this is a the last 10% of your

3201
02:18:25,359 --> 02:18:30,800
production actually as a facility for

3202
02:18:28,120 --> 02:18:34,160
example I'm this Library yeah me because

3203
02:18:30,799 --> 02:18:37,119
I I met Mike uh from J boys Mike Hydro

3204
02:18:34,159 --> 02:18:39,478
yeah in Barcelona two years ago we were

3205
02:18:37,120 --> 02:18:41,399
speaking about this and he tell asked me

3206
02:18:39,478 --> 02:18:44,959
because I like how he approached me he

3207
02:18:41,398 --> 02:18:48,000
said to me you know if it's the last 10%

3208
02:18:44,959 --> 02:18:50,358
in your facility then it's something

3209
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:53,120
that it's okay for you you know the flow

3210
02:18:50,359 --> 02:18:56,359
uh the linar flood the starter kit that

3211
02:18:53,120 --> 02:19:00,200
they have you know uh but if you're not

3212
02:18:56,359 --> 02:19:01,840
having your uh you know your your Sops

3213
02:19:00,200 --> 02:19:03,639
already you know if you're having

3214
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:06,960
dealing with that and still not

3215
02:19:03,638 --> 02:19:10,959
developed your company until that moment

3216
02:19:06,959 --> 02:19:12,759
it's no use for you because you know he

3217
02:19:10,959 --> 02:19:15,518
he sells you a product but then he sells

3218
02:19:12,760 --> 02:19:19,040
you it you must be on 90% now if you

3219
02:19:15,519 --> 02:19:22,639
want to to buy this because otherwise it

3220
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:25,319
will not have a use for you

3221
02:19:22,638 --> 02:19:27,679
yeah something that is true actually

3222
02:19:25,318 --> 02:19:30,039
because if you don't know how to grow

3223
02:19:27,679 --> 02:19:33,200
good moms with healthy healthiness you

3224
02:19:30,040 --> 02:19:36,840
know in a basic you know about growing

3225
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:38,479
tables or any kind of forms that means

3226
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:40,280
that you have to learn something before

3227
02:19:38,478 --> 02:19:42,478
that and then you can go to tissue

3228
02:19:40,280 --> 02:19:45,960
culture not not

3229
02:19:42,478 --> 02:19:47,438
before I under canopy lighting like you

3230
02:19:45,959 --> 02:19:49,318
don't want to use under canopy lighting

3231
02:19:47,439 --> 02:19:51,639
unless you already have everything else

3232
02:19:49,318 --> 02:19:53,600
dialed in and you can't get any more out

3233
02:19:51,639 --> 02:19:55,519
of that space without adding more light

3234
02:19:53,600 --> 02:19:57,399
it's just like it's maxing out your

3235
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:59,120
production potentials but it's it's not

3236
02:19:57,398 --> 02:20:01,760
worth it if you're not already

3237
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:03,880
there yes of course I mean tissue

3238
02:20:01,760 --> 02:20:05,559
culture it's very hard on the xplant you

3239
02:20:03,879 --> 02:20:07,679
know the the portion that you cut off so

3240
02:20:05,559 --> 02:20:09,239
if your mom plant's not healthy already

3241
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:11,398
you know you're going to have a bad time

3242
02:20:09,239 --> 02:20:13,680
with it there's one other thing I to

3243
02:20:11,398 --> 02:20:15,398
kind bring up too that could potentially

3244
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:16,840
I mean we don't know if it was the

3245
02:20:15,398 --> 02:20:18,840
hormones that they used for the tissue

3246
02:20:16,840 --> 02:20:21,200
culture that you know affected the

3247
02:20:18,840 --> 02:20:24,200
genetics to make you know um produce a

3248
02:20:21,200 --> 02:20:25,760
bunch of you know male pollen sacks um

3249
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:28,399
but I do know one one thing that I've

3250
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:31,520
read about is the potential for genetic

3251
02:20:28,398 --> 02:20:32,639
drift and um from what I understand and

3252
02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:33,880
of course people can correct me in the

3253
02:20:32,639 --> 02:20:36,318
comments see this is something I just

3254
02:20:33,879 --> 02:20:39,159
briefly read but every plant has two

3255
02:20:36,318 --> 02:20:41,239
sets of chromosomes and sometimes when

3256
02:20:39,159 --> 02:20:43,239
you do the tissue culture uh process

3257
02:20:41,239 --> 02:20:45,600
what will happen is the second set of

3258
02:20:43,239 --> 02:20:48,239
chromosomes will kind of take over and

3259
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:49,880
that plant that you grow out will not um

3260
02:20:48,239 --> 02:20:52,239
it won't be the same plant that you you

3261
02:20:49,879 --> 02:20:54,719
tissue cultur from it will be almost

3262
02:20:52,239 --> 02:20:57,318
like this you know kind of um you know

3263
02:20:54,719 --> 02:20:59,920
like like I've seen you I've seen people

3264
02:20:57,318 --> 02:21:02,959
that that paid uh you know four five

3265
02:20:59,920 --> 02:21:07,439
$6,000 to have their heirloom plant

3266
02:21:02,959 --> 02:21:09,799
Marist stemmed and then they grew um you

3267
02:21:07,439 --> 02:21:12,200
know what they got back next to their

3268
02:21:09,799 --> 02:21:14,398
old you know what they had kept in their

3269
02:21:12,200 --> 02:21:17,000
mother plants or whatever and like the

3270
02:21:14,398 --> 02:21:20,959
new marem plant had more Vigor and more

3271
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:23,398
Health but came out different flower

3272
02:21:20,959 --> 02:21:25,438
than they were used to and so there was

3273
02:21:23,398 --> 02:21:27,959
a change there I've always heard that

3274
02:21:25,439 --> 02:21:29,960
called like somaclonal variation where

3275
02:21:27,959 --> 02:21:31,959
you're where the chromosomes are

3276
02:21:29,959 --> 02:21:33,719
actually like uh dedifferentiated I

3277
02:21:31,959 --> 02:21:35,239
believe is what it's called and like

3278
02:21:33,719 --> 02:21:38,199
because genetic drift is something that

3279
02:21:35,239 --> 02:21:40,079
happens within a population over time uh

3280
02:21:38,200 --> 02:21:42,920
you wouldn't get genetic drift within a

3281
02:21:40,079 --> 02:21:44,559
single cultivar you get genetic drift

3282
02:21:42,920 --> 02:21:46,120
just with cloning as well a different

3283
02:21:44,559 --> 02:21:49,439
term he's saying

3284
02:21:46,120 --> 02:21:51,520
it's he's saying it's a different ter

3285
02:21:49,439 --> 02:21:53,280
genetic drift is the wrong term genetic

3286
02:21:51,520 --> 02:21:55,560
drift is something that happens like if

3287
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:57,920
you had like a population of wild

3288
02:21:55,559 --> 02:22:00,279
cannabis where it would Reed itself and

3289
02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:03,000
reede itself season to season but it and

3290
02:22:00,280 --> 02:22:05,399
then it would adapt in in that area that

3291
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:07,439
would be called genetic drift but the

3292
02:22:05,398 --> 02:22:09,599
what we're experiencing within like

3293
02:22:07,439 --> 02:22:12,479
having a clone be different than what

3294
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:15,000
its mother plant uh presented when in

3295
02:22:12,478 --> 02:22:17,039
flower would be called something called

3296
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:18,359
I have a hard stop that I have to do

3297
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:21,560
because I have to do something with my

3298
02:22:18,359 --> 02:22:24,399
children so I hate to be uh I hate

3299
02:22:21,559 --> 02:22:26,079
well they are getting it's I have to

3300
02:22:24,398 --> 02:22:27,840
take one of them to a practice even

3301
02:22:26,079 --> 02:22:29,959
though they're off for uh for

3302
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:32,719
Thanksgiving break or whatnot I still

3303
02:22:29,959 --> 02:22:35,478
have some dad responsibilities so I'm

3304
02:22:32,719 --> 02:22:37,920
getting frantically waved at that I'm

3305
02:22:35,478 --> 02:22:39,519
drifting into a bad time you don't have

3306
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:41,600
to guys don't have to stop talking but I

3307
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:44,720
need to

3308
02:22:41,600 --> 02:22:47,920
bail I love you too wonderful meeting

3309
02:22:44,719 --> 02:22:51,000
you wonderful meeting you know yeah me

3310
02:22:47,920 --> 02:22:52,760
too I think we will we will talk will

3311
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:55,239
you guys all have a lovely

3312
02:22:52,760 --> 02:22:57,159
day you know we cannot stop that's the

3313
02:22:55,239 --> 02:22:59,920
basic thing you we are friends who sit

3314
02:22:57,159 --> 02:23:02,318
down on the couch guys you know like we

3315
02:22:59,920 --> 02:23:05,280
are I that's a great thing you know like

3316
02:23:02,318 --> 02:23:07,199
that's you know I mean we've been

3317
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:09,479
drifting a little bit but it's always

3318
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:12,560
like that it's very the best thing about

3319
02:23:09,478 --> 02:23:15,559
it is that you have this uh that is uh

3320
02:23:12,559 --> 02:23:18,039
Happening by you know by itself natural

3321
02:23:15,559 --> 02:23:19,760
it's not like oh we have a script now uh

3322
02:23:18,040 --> 02:23:22,520
I have some things that I didn't tell

3323
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:24,439
you yet no it's not like that you know

3324
02:23:22,520 --> 02:23:26,200
well I I've been writing down questions

3325
02:23:24,439 --> 02:23:27,559
as we've been talking and of course we

3326
02:23:26,200 --> 02:23:30,560
didn't get to

3327
02:23:27,559 --> 02:23:33,639
like we'll have to continue again in the

3328
02:23:30,559 --> 02:23:36,278
future yeah yeah hopefully part three

3329
02:23:33,639 --> 02:23:37,959
hopefully part three real soon yeah one

3330
02:23:36,279 --> 02:23:39,880
thing I wanted to say before we left I

3331
02:23:37,959 --> 02:23:42,358
wanted to say this about the tissue

3332
02:23:39,879 --> 02:23:45,599
culture um

3333
02:23:42,359 --> 02:23:49,200
is when you do Maris them you're not

3334
02:23:45,600 --> 02:23:53,000
guaranteed to remove virus okay this is

3335
02:23:49,200 --> 02:23:55,840
this is what um NATO dog was saying but

3336
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:59,600
when you do Marist stem and then you do

3337
02:23:55,840 --> 02:24:02,520
it again and then you test and then you

3338
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:04,680
grow things at then it's possible to

3339
02:24:02,520 --> 02:24:08,520
remove the virus

3340
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:10,398
so it it's just a process it you know

3341
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:13,319
where some people say well I Mar stemmed

3342
02:24:10,398 --> 02:24:15,920
it now it's clean well no you've Marist

3343
02:24:13,318 --> 02:24:17,840
stemmed it now you have to grow it out

3344
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:21,159
you have to and and the problem with the

3345
02:24:17,840 --> 02:24:24,478
hopen vroid is because it hides so well

3346
02:24:21,159 --> 02:24:28,359
mhm you have to grow it and test it for

3347
02:24:24,478 --> 02:24:31,159
some time before you know if if the work

3348
02:24:28,359 --> 02:24:34,840
actually was done but it's definitely

3349
02:24:31,159 --> 02:24:36,680
possible it's just not as easy as any of

3350
02:24:34,840 --> 02:24:39,398
us would like it to be from what I read

3351
02:24:36,680 --> 02:24:41,279
it's about a 50% chance to be able to

3352
02:24:39,398 --> 02:24:43,159
extract you know marriage stem that is

3353
02:24:41,279 --> 02:24:45,000
completely healthy free viroids if it

3354
02:24:43,159 --> 02:24:46,600
was coming from an infected mom but yeah

3355
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:48,398
like you said it's it's almost like a

3356
02:24:46,600 --> 02:24:50,079
process of refinement of just doing it

3357
02:24:48,398 --> 02:24:51,719
over and over again until you know you

3358
02:24:50,079 --> 02:24:54,239
have that end product that you want you

3359
02:24:51,719 --> 02:24:56,199
know which is a clean and healthy plant

3360
02:24:54,239 --> 02:24:58,520
but can you tell me do you know do you

3361
02:24:56,200 --> 02:25:00,840
know about how it transmits over seed

3362
02:24:58,520 --> 02:25:02,680
production also I mean how how much

3363
02:25:00,840 --> 02:25:05,318
percent of the seeds when you cross

3364
02:25:02,680 --> 02:25:07,520
something that is infected MH you make

3365
02:25:05,318 --> 02:25:10,760
seeds and then you sell those seeds as a

3366
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:12,479
breeder or something if I remember um

3367
02:25:10,760 --> 02:25:14,760
there's a great article from I think

3368
02:25:12,478 --> 02:25:16,039
it's like The nathal Institute of Health

3369
02:25:14,760 --> 02:25:17,800
or something it's like an actual

3370
02:25:16,040 --> 02:25:19,880
government article that they did a study

3371
02:25:17,799 --> 02:25:21,119
from I believe it was in the high 80

3372
02:25:19,879 --> 02:25:23,879
percen

3373
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:25,680
80 you 80 yeah like originally they were

3374
02:25:23,879 --> 02:25:26,679
thinking oh it's which is actually

3375
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:30,120
pretty

3376
02:25:26,680 --> 02:25:33,040
low well it's pretty low if you consider

3377
02:25:30,120 --> 02:25:34,160
that 20% of them of the crosses won't

3378
02:25:33,040 --> 02:25:36,800
have

3379
02:25:34,159 --> 02:25:39,799
hlvd you know like you could actually

3380
02:25:36,799 --> 02:25:41,840
like grow that out can identif or

3381
02:25:39,799 --> 02:25:44,318
whatever well I mean you got to grow

3382
02:25:41,840 --> 02:25:46,960
them out and then test them you know and

3383
02:25:44,318 --> 02:25:49,000
you might sick and you you know plants

3384
02:25:46,959 --> 02:25:51,519
next to healthy plants and stuff and

3385
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:54,398
there's so hot and viral is you know

3386
02:25:51,520 --> 02:25:55,960
like how NATO dog said it's like AIDS

3387
02:25:54,398 --> 02:25:58,318
you don't have to worry about shaking

3388
02:25:55,959 --> 02:26:01,239
hands with somebody with

3389
02:25:58,318 --> 02:26:03,559
AIDS you have it's not that way with hot

3390
02:26:01,239 --> 02:26:05,039
lant yeah there could be like cross

3391
02:26:03,559 --> 02:26:07,278
contamination from water you know if

3392
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:10,720
they not careful there could be well so

3393
02:26:07,279 --> 02:26:12,840
that's why I said there's there there's

3394
02:26:10,719 --> 02:26:14,278
things that you can do to make sure that

3395
02:26:12,840 --> 02:26:17,760
you're not sharing

3396
02:26:14,279 --> 02:26:20,760
water and so that uh you're not sharing

3397
02:26:17,760 --> 02:26:23,159
scissors like like a dirty needle

3398
02:26:20,760 --> 02:26:25,520
yeah well in in um I believe it was a

3399
02:26:23,159 --> 02:26:27,520
study out of gual in Canada that uh

3400
02:26:25,520 --> 02:26:29,880
found that it could transfer from

3401
02:26:27,520 --> 02:26:31,720
contact so like they they found that

3402
02:26:29,879 --> 02:26:33,239
like one plant didn't have it it was

3403
02:26:31,719 --> 02:26:34,679
next to a plant that did have it and

3404
02:26:33,239 --> 02:26:37,959
then it had it later and it they weren't

3405
02:26:34,680 --> 02:26:39,559
sharing any um like irrigation streams

3406
02:26:37,959 --> 02:26:42,438
or anything like they weren't connected

3407
02:26:39,559 --> 02:26:46,119
to the same Reservoir anything like that

3408
02:26:42,439 --> 02:26:48,840
before so like the potential is there uh

3409
02:26:46,120 --> 02:26:51,319
it's you know there is a there is a

3410
02:26:48,840 --> 02:26:53,920
study also that there is one plant you

3411
02:26:51,318 --> 02:26:56,239
they measured the the lent virus and

3412
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:58,840
they found that in the upper part of the

3413
02:26:56,239 --> 02:27:00,799
plant there was no latency there was no

3414
02:26:58,840 --> 02:27:03,040
virus there present you know they

3415
02:27:00,799 --> 02:27:05,239
couldn't measure it but on the lower

3416
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:08,000
branches there were virus you know

3417
02:27:05,239 --> 02:27:11,879
places of the plant it's mov the

3418
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:13,359
vascular yeah yeah yeah but that's why

3419
02:27:11,879 --> 02:27:15,920
marem

3420
02:27:13,359 --> 02:27:18,439
works yeah because you are out

3421
02:27:15,920 --> 02:27:21,079
outgrowing the virus and then you take

3422
02:27:18,439 --> 02:27:23,359
before the virus came to this tissue you

3423
02:27:21,079 --> 02:27:25,680
you you cut it away and you try to to

3424
02:27:23,359 --> 02:27:28,800
culture it right so that is the idea

3425
02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:31,398
right I mean all the banana and all the

3426
02:27:28,799 --> 02:27:33,358
the Ora and all the everything in the

3427
02:27:31,398 --> 02:27:36,680
world you know food production is

3428
02:27:33,359 --> 02:27:41,359
relying on marem and culture as itself

3429
02:27:36,680 --> 02:27:44,359
for 100 years I mean a guy 100 years ago

3430
02:27:41,359 --> 02:27:47,120
uh developed this right it's like a very

3431
02:27:44,359 --> 02:27:49,960
old we are talking about something that

3432
02:27:47,120 --> 02:27:53,560
if somebody 100 years ago could do that

3433
02:27:49,959 --> 02:27:56,478
or the basics of it how could today more

3434
02:27:53,559 --> 02:28:00,159
than 100 years later we cannot do it at

3435
02:27:56,478 --> 02:28:03,438
home every you know not every grower

3436
02:28:00,159 --> 02:28:05,719
home grower but a lot of them the ones

3437
02:28:03,439 --> 02:28:09,398
that are dedicated with the

3438
02:28:05,719 --> 02:28:11,358
heart you know with a small system I'm

3439
02:28:09,398 --> 02:28:13,559
I'm doing it at home so it's it's

3440
02:28:11,359 --> 02:28:15,318
possible you know yeah yeah yeah you you

3441
02:28:13,559 --> 02:28:17,879
are a perfect example of it that's what

3442
02:28:15,318 --> 02:28:20,760
I want to say and I mean realistically

3443
02:28:17,879 --> 02:28:23,398
um it's only maybe

3444
02:28:20,760 --> 02:28:24,439
$2,000 I probably put in my lab you know

3445
02:28:23,398 --> 02:28:26,358
probably a little bit more because I got

3446
02:28:24,439 --> 02:28:29,000
a lot more supplies but you know the

3447
02:28:26,359 --> 02:28:31,920
microscope you know was about 700 my Flo

3448
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:34,439
Hood was 500 and the pressure cooker um

3449
02:28:31,920 --> 02:28:36,359
was about 160 180 somewhere around there

3450
02:28:34,439 --> 02:28:38,000
and those are the biggest parts of a lab

3451
02:28:36,359 --> 02:28:40,559
that you would need everything else is

3452
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:41,959
relatively inexpensive so if you can get

3453
02:28:40,559 --> 02:28:45,318
those three big Parts knocked out you

3454
02:28:41,959 --> 02:28:48,519
can definitely build yourself a home

3455
02:28:45,318 --> 02:28:50,840
lab well definitely hope we have Sasha

3456
02:28:48,520 --> 02:28:53,720
on for a part three again soon

3457
02:28:50,840 --> 02:28:55,520
yeah definitely there is few strains you

3458
02:28:53,719 --> 02:28:57,879
know there is few strains I had on the

3459
02:28:55,520 --> 02:28:59,680
list I didn't even mention to Noto

3460
02:28:57,879 --> 02:29:01,559
because he asked me and then I have like

3461
02:28:59,680 --> 02:29:04,398
and then we stopped because all of these

3462
02:29:01,559 --> 02:29:06,439
trains have so much history you know

3463
02:29:04,398 --> 02:29:08,639
they have a story behind that is not

3464
02:29:06,439 --> 02:29:10,760
like you know you cannot say like oh

3465
02:29:08,639 --> 02:29:12,278
that was that train and like in one a

3466
02:29:10,760 --> 02:29:14,159
minute and a half I will tell you the

3467
02:29:12,279 --> 02:29:16,399
story about it like that's not like it

3468
02:29:14,159 --> 02:29:19,639
easy you cannot because it it has so

3469
02:29:16,398 --> 02:29:23,398
much Story episode just on the Shiva

3470
02:29:19,639 --> 02:29:26,239
skunk and another one on the Santa Maria

3471
02:29:23,398 --> 02:29:29,079
Plank and so there is so many others you

3472
02:29:26,239 --> 02:29:31,719
know yeah and I hope people will come up

3473
02:29:29,079 --> 02:29:34,799
now in Austria you know because other

3474
02:29:31,719 --> 02:29:37,719
and shops and uh Librarians like me also

3475
02:29:34,799 --> 02:29:39,079
maybe maybe they could uh give us a

3476
02:29:37,719 --> 02:29:41,438
signal and they could join the

3477
02:29:39,079 --> 02:29:44,639
conversation that would be nice that

3478
02:29:41,439 --> 02:29:46,680
would be great or any part of the world

3479
02:29:44,639 --> 02:29:49,559
