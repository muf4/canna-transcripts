show Kevin um one thing I want to say

34
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:47,359
before we started is

35
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,718
that I had heard your name before I knew

36
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,920
about Wonderland

37
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:55,319
Nursery but I didn't really know that

38
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:58,478
much about you and I saw some clips over

39
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:01,000
on the first smoke of the day and

40
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:03,759
honestly I was just blown away Way by

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,879
those clips and I I friend requested you

42
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,239
on Instagram and I guess you followed

43
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:11,038
back and you know I asked you if you

44
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,920
wanted to do the show and I was so

45
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:16,238
excited when you said that you did so I

46
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,799
have not watched the rest of the first

47
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,599
smoke of the day because I always like

48
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,959
it to be as much of a surprise when I

49
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,439
record my podcast but I am going to

50
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,280
encourage everyone at some point to go

51
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:30,199
check out the first smoke of the day and

52
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,919
the interview that Kevin did with them

53
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:34,839
so anyway Kevin we're just going to give

54
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:37,559
you the mic and tell us your

55
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,280
story um you know we were just talking

56
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,840
be like before we get into the story

57
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,280
story we were talking about this really

58
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,719
cool event that I went to this weekend

59
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,640
that was called the high tea and it was

60
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:50,519
put on by Nick founder of essential

61
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,759
extracts and they had it over at the

62
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,879
ganier campus in southern humble and it

63
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,000
was the second year they did it and it

64
00:02:55,878 --> 00:02:59,878
was so interesting because I I like tea

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,680
but I'm not hyper knowledgeable about

66
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:04,840
about it and they have a group come in

67
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,439
I'm trying to remember their name but

68
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,959
they're uh Americans but they've spent a

69
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,359
lot of time in China as tea importers

70
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,439
exporters and so their knowledge of tea

71
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,000
was really comprehensive and they bring

72
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:19,959
all these really interesting varieties

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,439
of tea and what they do is they get

74
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:27,319
together with Nick's team which is Alex

75
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:30,878
Shera Tyler and Lindsay who uh prepare

76
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:33,878
the food and then um this G named Sarah

77
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:37,120
Jane does the the tasting bar and then

78
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:39,919
Lena Burns does the hookah bar and so

79
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,120
Lena's a uh she was uh one of there two

80
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:45,359
like true Frenchie apprentices that

81
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,280
turned Master that's Belle out of um

82
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,079
Mendo and Lena out of humble and both of

83
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,479
them were Frenchie's um full-time you

84
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,239
know developed worker and then became

85
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,078
masters of their own so like her

86
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,878
knowledge of hash is unbelievable and

87
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:03,239
her ability to create good hash Sarah's

88
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:08,598
and her fella fantastic

89
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:10,319
at um flavor uh component and then Alex

90
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:12,438
and his team are phenomenal in Chef so

91
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:16,358
what they do is they take a look at the

92
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:19,238
tea and then they match the food

93
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:22,478
pairings and the hash pairings with it

94
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:24,159
so it's these crazy flavor Centric

95
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,560
profiles and it's over the course of

96
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,880
like you know eight hours so every hour

97
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,959
another flight of hash comes out another

98
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:34,000
flight of food and another type of tea

99
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:36,079
and so and you can you can smoke what

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,399
was previous but you keep getting these

101
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,719
fresh

102
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,599
experiences and it's held up like set up

103
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,360
in at the ganier campus in soam and so

104
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,720
Derek's spot is I think like 240 acres

105
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,919
on top of a

106
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,520
mountain and so when you're up there man

107
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,359
you basically just swept Into the

108
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,639
Wilderness of Humble County and you're

109
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,960
drinking all this aged tea and you're

110
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:01,639
smoking all this hash and you're eating

111
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,638
all this food and

112
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:07,399
you're you're you're kind of like sucked

113
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:09,478
into a Vortex of of gustatory

114
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:12,319
goodness and when you leave you're kind

115
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:14,000
of sad that it had to end because wish

116
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,599
you could spend every day just drinking

117
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,759
really good tea and smoking really good

118
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,479
hash and eatting really good food in in

119
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:23,800
an environment filled with people that

120
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:25,639
were you know vibing the same so if they

121
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,160
ever do another one man or if if you

122
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:29,199
ever get a chance to go to one of those

123
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,840
type of pairings you know I'd recommend

124
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,639
it it's just an absolute I was going to

125
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:34,119
ask is fascinating experience was it

126
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,680
open to the public or was it by

127
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,639
invitation only it was invitation you

128
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,639
you you paid to get into

129
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,720
it but the the concept doesn't have to

130
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,199
be you could create one of your own

131
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,800
where you you know you one of your

132
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,840
friends is is good at the The Culinary

133
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,360
one of your friends is good at the the

134
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,079
hash collection meaning like assembling

135
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,720
the hash to match the food and then you

136
00:05:54,079 --> 00:06:00,399
get somebody who's really knowledgeable

137
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,360
about the Tea end of it and

138
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:06,399
it's just really fun because the the

139
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:08,038
thing with the tea was it's such an

140
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:11,918
ancient

141
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:14,399
culture and when I was in Asia what I

142
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,359
noticed was the Tea Ceremony matches the

143
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:19,120
presser ceremony matches the hash

144
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,520
consumption ceremony and so there's

145
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,759
these periods through the day where you

146
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:27,719
pray you you take tea and you smoke and

147
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,919
we kind of we kind of and it's it's

148
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:34,680
ritualistic but ritualis in a in a

149
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:36,439
really healthy way so I think that you

150
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,519
know the ability for people to be able

151
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:40,360
to sit down and enjoy these things in

152
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:42,159
this regard because for at least 15

153
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,439
minutes you know you stop what you're

154
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,479
doing you give thanks you drink tea

155
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:49,560
which clears your head um kind of opens

156
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:51,839
you up and then the Cannabis makes you

157
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,639
connect into the the

158
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,839
universe that sounds incred favorite

159
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,879
combination oh my God you're talking

160
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:03,399
about something that is happening here

161
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:06,840
in my area with a family member of mine

162
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:10,120

163
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:14,478

00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,918
ritual like we say and uh you know

168
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,439
everything you tell now is like home you

169
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:33,639
know to me like we are

170
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:36,160
I'm the European correspondent here

171
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,160
so first of all it's really big honor

172
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,479
for me to talk to you I mean I've been

173
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,479
listening to it's my pleasure man we

174
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:45,839
we're all C

175
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:48,240
like I got lucky then I spent the

176
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,598
majority of my career hiding right so

177
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,960
the majority of your career when you're

178
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,839
in the hustle is you know you making

179
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,279
sure nobody knows who you are except

180
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:57,638
everybody you hustle with so you develop

181
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:00,399
a really good strong like name

182
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:04,439
reputation but I was never really on

183
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:06,638
forums I didn't I I I use social media

184
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:10,439
kind of on a minimal level if you really

185
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:14,079
take a look at my output it's low what

186
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:16,000
what's high is my engagement and me

187
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,878
being involved with other people's work

188
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,598
in that regard because it it makes it

189
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,759
fun but if if I have to do it myself it

190
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:26,439
feels

191
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:28,280
forced and because I and and it's

192
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:31,759
nothing it's not against people who live

193
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:34,360
online if just purely if you're living

194
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,080
in cannabis with licensed Opera even in

195
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,639
the past like large operations you're

196
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,800
running a large operation you don't have

197
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:44,240
time to be online all day

198
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:46,919
so it it just never fit my life and then

199
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,680
when I get older because I'm older the

200
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:52,439
online lifestyle wasn't so critical it's

201
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:55,679
just a really great tool to meet people

202
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:58,000
and I I use it in kind of like a duality

203
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,519
where I'm a a sports freak and I don't

204
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
mean like I like watching sports I like

205
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:05,600
I like sports science and I like being

206
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,399
athletic and so the internet lets me

207
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,399
keep track of all these people around

208
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:13,440
the world that I got to train with and

209
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:16,039
got to work with so I get like all my

210
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,040
sports related connections and then I

211
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:21,199
get um hobby stuff and then I get

212
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,919
cannabis so it lets me have like a

213
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,240
really diverse Global friend

214
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:29,519
base but I I just kind of look at it

215
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,480
like that so I don't I don't get so

216
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,720
triggered so online stuff doesn't like

217
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,879
you know like it to me it's it's not

218
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,440
real if if for most people if they shut

219
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:42,480
down their Instagram their whole game

220
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,760
ends that day and it doesn't end my game

221
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:49,159
at all because I have functional

222
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:51,480
physical businesses and operations and

223
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:55,838
I'm I actually work in the industry

224
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:57,720
globally so for me the enjoying the

225
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,079
conversation is what I dig and that's

226
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,440
why you know as I took a look when you

227
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:03,719
guys first popped up and then I saw the

228
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,600
interview you did with Mark and then I

229
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,360
saw there was wolf on the other day and

230
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,879
and and I love wolf he it [ __ ] genius

231
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,839
and he's just an interesting Dude too

232
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:14,838
because he's such a salty

233
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,480
bastard and and he has to be because he

234
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:19,000
is he's salty as hell but I love him

235
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,278
because I respect what he did was he

236
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,559
really really really did his homework

237
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:25,838
and he did create that initial what we

238
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:28,078
would call Sea a green where ultra high

239
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,360
density planting sites and he developed

240
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:33,639
cultivars that fit that that that

241
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,440
methodology and then his knowledge of

242
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:39,240
lighting is is is primo so like I got

243
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,279
lucky that when it comes to lighting I

244
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,159
was able to spend time with brilliant

245
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:44,159
light scientists from around the world

246
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:48,799
on

247
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:50,519
projects so it it allows me to get

248
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,599
access to information I otherwise

249
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,039
wouldn't but for the average individual

250
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,839
that isn't hanging out with light

251
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:59,639
scientists from the Bill Gates

252
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:02,760
Institute um wolf is probably the most

253
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:05,278
accessible smart person you can get and

254
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:07,319
and he's not afraid to really break the

255
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,799
information down because he's not afraid

256
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,760
to you taking it and suddenly surpassing

257
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:14,479
him you'd have to spend your whole life

258
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:17,679
studying it in order to catch him and

259
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,759
it's not like he's paused either so I

260
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:22,000
that's what I love about you know good

261
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,799
guest so when I saw the good guest and I

262
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,559
was checking it out and I think I said

263
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:27,919
you Gabby like oh you know good show and

264
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,278
then that's kind of began our

265
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,519
conversation

266
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:34,360
and I just think that you know the

267
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,759
intent of what you're trying to do is

268
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:40,159
good and for me being able to be on

269
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:43,639
podcast with people that want to explore

270
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:45,120
the world wein is critical and it's and

271
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:48,200
like I said it's it's not that I think

272
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,639
there's a rank in cannabis it's it's

273
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:55,160
just that most spend their time in their

274
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:57,519
house so your your totality of what you

275
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:59,000
see is relatively small it doesn't mean

276
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,078
your product isn't phenomenal it could

277
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,519
be the best in the world coming out of

278
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:06,239
your one lighter in your bedroom and

279
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,399
that's real it's just really about

280
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,799
exposure

281
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:12,120
to a totality a bigger picture and I

282
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:15,479
think that that's kind of what I got

283
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:18,240
lucky to have is that my

284
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:21,839
career was built during like the peak of

285
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,959
the drug war and when I got into medical

286
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,519
cannabis I was already around 40 years

287
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:28,799
old by that point so I already had you

288
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:32,278
know since I was what 12 so I already

289
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:35,159
had you almost 28 years of playing in

290
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:37,480
the sandbox before I got into medical

291
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:39,719
cannabis and medical cannabis to me is

292
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,920
not that I had a 215 which is the

293
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,199
medical recommendation in California I

294
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,799
had that in

295
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:48,799
96 because I knew Dr mcara we were

296
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:51,519
friends so I grabbed the

297
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:54,198
215 but it was to protect me from having

298
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,919
like an ounce in my pocket I knew it

299
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:57,838
wasn't going to protect me on the level

300
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,319
I was at because my plant counts were

301
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,079
insane so

302
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,839
it wasn't it was a little different

303
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:05,958
reason and so I never considered myself

304
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,680
medical I just had a 215 I knew the

305
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:09,679
architects of that era we were friends I

306
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:12,239
had

307
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:14,919
access it was when I got into running a

308
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,079
dispensary that I officially said I'm in

309
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,198
medical cannabis because the emphasis of

310
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:20,958
your work

311
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:22,559
changes and you get into the dispensary

312
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,559
end of it and you think you're going to

313
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,039
be doing like storefront sales and you

314
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:30,399
don't really understand that you're

315
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:32,799
becoming a a semih hospice

316
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,078
and you start to see this reality of

317
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:38,919
people who use cannabis in this

318
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:42,838
essential method essential need and it

319
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:45,759
changes your perspective of what you

320
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,959
do and because I was already what I

321
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,600
would say successful I didn't get into

322
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:52,239
medical cannabis because that was my

323
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,879
time to come up I was already up I

324
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,919
actually lost money going into medical

325
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,879
cannabis because I had to give up all

326
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:02,679
the Crooked hustling I was doing which

327
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:04,838
was really where the money was but I I

328
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:06,919
knew there was like this two-part reason

329
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:09,360
there was one that it was the only path

330
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:10,958
forward because I knew that the world we

331
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,919
were in was going to

332
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:16,239
change and once I get involved in the

333
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:19,278
medical end of it it was it was this

334
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,120
catharsis of um helping people that you

335
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:24,519
don't know that have no ability to help

336
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,560
you back it kind of links you into The

337
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:30,039
Human Experience in a way I'd never been

338
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,239
linked in and it it made my life really

339
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:33,759
kind of

340
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,720
like rich in a in a way I never

341
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:39,159
experienced I wanted to say you know you

342
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:44,360
have this kind of uh thing that you live

343
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:47,639
in your your life a way of life and then

344
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:50,079
because of the system you see the way

345
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:52,799
and you choose the way to do it in

346
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:54,319
another way like from from your

347
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,278
perspective from my perspective and your

348
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,560
perspective would be the term from

349
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:03,078
illegality to legality how to make it

350
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:06,039
legal now you know and and you are you

351
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:08,758
know of course from From perspective

352
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:11,559
Europeans now we are just legal not

353
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:13,800
legalizing decriminalizing now the

354
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:16,239
system that you have now is like you

355
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:20,519
already have 10 years of legalization

356
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,680
behind you we don't tot it's different

357
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,879
perspective yeah it it is it is and I

358
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:26,799
knew that I knew that it's like

359
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,120
everything you do in life right you you

360
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,599
can't take skills from one it's called

361
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,839
extrapolating where you take something

362
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,079
from something and apply it to something

363
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,360
else and the problem is that there's

364
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:41,399
these assumptions that the skills or the

365
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:45,039
information transfers lineally and it it

366
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:48,720
it's not linear it it's big gaping holes

367
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:50,639
of lack of understanding and so when I

368
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,560
got that opportunity to take over that

369
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,159
operation and it was it was neat too

370
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:55,958
because the operation I took over was

371
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,919
one of the second or third dispensaries

372
00:15:55,958 --> 00:16:00,518
in the state of California it was one of

373
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:03,599
the oldest operations in the country and

374
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:06,078
it was failing the management was

375
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,120
confused and it had a great team the

376
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,799
people that I like ended up you know

377
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,639
running were good people they were about

378
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:16,838
the job they were good with people but

379
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:18,959
your management was off and they didn't

380
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:20,279
understand really at at a bad

381
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,359
fundamental level they didn't understand

382
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:24,159
drug dealing they didn't quite

383
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,039
understand like what the needs of the

384
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:29,879
people who come in the store

385
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:33,198
are and how these little things we do

386
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:35,078
make that experience so much different

387
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:38,039
and so when I came in I took over the

388
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:39,638
spot as the cultivation director but I

389
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:42,480
really kind of ended up becoming like

390
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:45,519
cultivation director SL operational

391
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,600
manager and I changed the way we

392
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,600
operated the business and so I took a

393
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,480
business that was going bankrupt and

394
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,399
failing and the first two years I ran it

395
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,039
we won best dispensary in Northern

396
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,120
California two you know for two years in

397
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,519
a row and I always tell people that I

398
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,720
said listen I have never had a day of

399
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,519
retail experience in my life never

400
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,160
worked in a restaurant never worked in a

401
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:07,879
store never I don't have I spent my

402
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,720
[ __ ] life in the do

403
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,760
game what people need to understand is

404
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,318
that we we do understand people pretty

405
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:18,359
well on terms of how they want to be

406
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:20,798
treated and if you understand how people

407
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:22,879
want to be treated you can do your best

408
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,119
to satisfy you're never going to do

409
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,160
perfect all the time you're going to

410
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:29,038
fail and you're going to make mistakes

411
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,840
but if you put the effort out people

412
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:33,038
forgive you for your

413
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:35,079
failures because they see that there's

414
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:38,200
an effort that is

415
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:39,839
genuine and what happens is they learn

416
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,919
to kind of meet you in the middle and

417
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,678
then they teach you how to help them

418
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:47,919
better and so I allowed the people that

419
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:50,960
came in the business to kind of guide me

420
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:53,080
as to what they wanted and needed and it

421
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,600
allowed me to better understand and I

422
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:57,038
think like you know one of the jokes was

423
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:59,678
that I took my office I took my desk out

424
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:02,400
of my office and I put it in the

425
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:05,320
lobby so I had an empty desk in the

426
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,080
lobby that I sat at to do all the you

427
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:07,960
know

428
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:09,720
conversation and what it did is it

429
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,400
allowed anybody who came in the business

430
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,200
to access somebody

431
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,840
that when you talk to people at a

432
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,880
counter you you don't feel powerful

433
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:23,158
because you feel there's a filter but if

434
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,120
you can talk to the manager and you can

435
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:27,000
get access to them and the same

436
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:30,158
information from the manager's mouth is

437
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,480
coming out of the workers mouth

438
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:36,280
it validates the worker so now when

439
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,798
people come in they start to understand

440
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:40,000
that the people that are at the counter

441
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:41,400
are intelligent too so like that's the

442
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
sin of like when I came into the

443
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,679
business nobody wanted to talk to me at

444
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
first right so I laughed so I had my

445
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:48,720
secretary go to the store go to Staples

446
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,679
right the office by said go get me a

447
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,519
badge here write this and it said

448
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:54,798
cultivation director in my name right

449
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:56,240
and I put it on I said watch this [ __ ]

450
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:57,960
people look at you then they look at

451
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,519
your badge and it says cultivation

452
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,120
director instant you're smart so I said

453
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:05,319
every said we all need badges that just

454
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:07,519
say bad [ __ ] on them anybody

455
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:10,399
looks at this thing automatically thinks

456
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:12,558
you're you're elevated and now the

457
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,559
conversation is different because the

458
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:17,720
issue with cannabis is that because

459
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:20,158
people spent so much time in seclusion

460
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,880
semi seclusion working with it

461
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,600
developing it they've developed some

462
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,640
unbelievably strong relationship

463
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:31,599
ties but their overall knowledge of the

464
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:34,679
picture in many cases most is kind of

465
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:36,359
skewed and so when they come into stores

466
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,080
they always want to tell everybody I

467
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,798
know more than you because you're just a

468
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:43,000
worker in a store and I'm this person

469
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:45,679
who knows all this what happens is the

470
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,119
worker and the the customer can't find

471
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,798
common ground to communicate and

472
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:53,079
neither's left happy the bud tenders

473
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:54,879
like these jobs suck and the people who

474
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:57,359
come into stores are always saying the

475
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,440
bud tenders you're stupid and it's not

476
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:02,839
true it's just

477
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,679
this kind of conflict it's like your

478
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:07,279
transmission isn't working correctly

479
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:09,480
because the clutch isn't stopping the

480
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:11,038
flywheel and you're not able to shift

481
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,319
the synchronizers aren't working so

482
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:16,158
you're just grinding grinding but when

483
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:18,759
you can align everything everything

484
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,400
meshes and I I think that's what I was

485
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:24,798
really trying to do most was create that

486
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:27,080
meshing and it

487
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:31,319
relationship yeah and it hadn't been

488
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:33,119
done because the the world of cannabis

489
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:36,319
even in storefront was all this you know

490
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:39,158
secrecy still and what it did is it

491
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:41,918
created a lack of information

492
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:43,799
transmittal so you you weren't creating

493
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,919
information in the facility and getting

494
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:47,599
it into the hands of the public and so

495
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,600
what I did is I kind of ripped the doors

496
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:53,599
off the place and let the people come in

497
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,319
and then I left the place and brought

498
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:59,240
the information into the public and it

499
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:01,798
wasn't about information about the shop

500
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,120
it was just really how do you look at a

501
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:06,400
topic and and I don't think I'm

502
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:09,599
omnipotent like it's funny I'm outspoken

503
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,200
on stuff and and sometimes I'm I'm prone

504
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:14,959
to add a little bit to it where when I

505
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,519
say all I really mean the majority right

506
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,919
and so when I say everybody does this

507
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:19,000
people like no there's an outlier I'm

508
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,840
like I know but if you can find an

509
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,960
outlier it means most and so I kind of

510
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:26,199
work on these

511
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:29,480
generalities but what it does it makes

512
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,640
it simple to make decisions and move

513
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,960
things

514
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,960
quickly and it allowed me to be able to

515
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,319
help people understand these are the

516
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:41,000
things that are inside dispensaries

517
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:43,038
these are how we use these products if I

518
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,119
was you on a budget this is how I would

519
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:48,079
approach it and and I didn't try to send

520
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:50,599
you to my store I wasn't worrying about

521
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:52,639
it drugs don't need to be advertised

522
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:54,839
they they just have to be

523
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,400
presented and I think that's where a lot

524
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:58,278
of people in retail don't quite catch

525
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,798
dope dealing that you don't really sell

526
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:02,240
drug drug you just provide them and they

527
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:05,639
sell themselves and people give you

528
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,679
money as an exchange for this rare item

529
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:11,159
and if you can get cool about the

530
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:14,720
process you you have Word of Mouth your

531
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:16,720
story sounds so similar to

532
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,079
mine and you know this is like a

533
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,440
reoccurring theme that you know we all

534
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:25,000
you know even Sasha it's like we're so

535
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,679
similar 6,000 miles away yeah but I

536
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,679
opened up my hydro store the garden

537
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,480
spout in

538
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:35,798
2002 and when I opened up my

539
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,480
store the general practice when you

540
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:40,278
walked into a grow shop was you said as

541
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,038
little as possible to the people that

542
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:45,159
worked there you grabbed your [ __ ] and

543
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:46,679
you got out okay and when you got out

544
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:49,679
you like looked both ways to make sure

545
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:53,038
nobody was following you and you used

546
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:56,240
your cousin's car yeah exactly yeah and

547
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:58,158
so when I opened up my shop I did

548
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,558
something a little bit different it was

549
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,520
actually very different nobody had done

550
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:04,798
it at the time um first of all my store

551
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:07,038
was in downtown Willets you know right

552
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:09,798
in the center of town and when you were

553
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:12,558
driving north or south through Willets

554
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:15,918
you basically had to drive by my store

555
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:17,839
and I had a th000 watt grow light on a I

556
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,440
think it was called the Omega Garden the

557
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:22,558
spinning garden with a th000 watt light

558
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,600
in the middle of it and and the it was

559
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:25,599
on that little cam in the

560
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,599
plants but like people that were driving

561
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,798
by like they were just blown away but

562
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,719
what they were seeing a high press

563
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:37,639
sodium light in a window at a grow shop

564
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,480
this was this was pretty unheard of at

565
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:44,240
the time and another thing I did was I

566
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:48,558
put a coffee bar in my

567
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,919
store so when people came in I gave them

568
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:53,240
an espresso or whatever they wanted and

569
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:56,720
they had a place to sit down and I made

570
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:59,558
it a place where the customers felt

571
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,880
comfortable talking to us totally and

572
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:03,000
and that was something that had never

573
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,080
happened at a grow store before you were

574
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,400
actually told exactly the opposite is

575
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:09,678
don't talk to us please don't mention

576
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,400
cannabis specifically Tomatoes we're

577
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:15,278
growing tomatoes everybody was a [ __ ]

578
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:17,278
tomato farmer but you have to be bold in

579
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:18,880
order to break through

580
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:21,919
dogma

581
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,720
and for me you know I got lucky in that

582
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:28,480
regard I really believe it that I just I

583
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,319
entered public Canabis at the right time

584
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,000
because I was already grown and I

585
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:34,038
already had a good reputation in the

586
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,798
hustle which is why the the legal worked

587
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:38,119
for me so well because once I get in the

588
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:40,879
legal I was able to reach out to all the

589
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:43,439
people I had done business with in the

590
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,159
illegal and it instantly allowed us to

591
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:51,000
start moving plant material at large

592
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:53,440
quantities and so all of that stuff was

593
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,759
I really believe because I was 40 and I

594
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,558
already you know I already fought a

595
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:59,640
couple felonies and already I already

596
00:24:57,558 --> 00:25:02,839
had a lifetime of like struggle and

597
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,679
grind and then real money so when I got

598
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:06,558
into this it was more like an education

599
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:08,278
of what's the future going to be I just

600
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:11,639
didn't realize I was going to get this

601
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:14,079
education on medical cannabis the way I

602
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,200
did and it was this incredible

603
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,720
experience but out of that facility is

604
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,840
where the the plant ACDC came from that

605
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,558
was the first CBD plant development in

606
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,558
the

607
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,000
country and over the next couple years

608
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:28,558
you know I mean I ended up personally

609
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,519
releasing hundreds and hundred hundreds

610
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:34,119
of thousands of free CBD based plants

611
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:36,519
globally so at one point in time I was

612
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:39,398
like this I was I was like this this

613
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:41,200
genetics stallion in hemp because all

614
00:25:39,398 --> 00:25:43,000
these countries around the world began

615
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,600
their hemp programs with genetics they

616
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,159
got from us and people couldn't believe

617
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,398
that you know I was giving it away for

618
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:52,520
free but I I I had this idea that when

619
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:55,558
we started the

620
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:59,038
project it was it was it was originally

621
00:25:55,558 --> 00:26:01,720
designed to help the doctor's wife

622
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:04,079
and he had this idea that if we could

623
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,600
increase the cannabinoid stimulation and

624
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:09,319
get the ECS activated with with

625
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:11,359
cannabinoids in acid form we should be

626
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:13,720
able to see an overall health

627
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:15,119
increase and once we started to see it

628
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,798
because remember you're running a shop

629
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:20,158
right so we have uh canopy and we have

630
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:21,839
customers so now we bring in data

631
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,278
collection and we bring in other people

632
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:26,720
to work with the patients so we can

633
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:28,679
really start to find out what's the

634
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,278
cannabinoids doing and what the other

635
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,880
things around you doing and it it just

636
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:34,919
gave me this Insight that was

637
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,640
unbelievable because no one in history

638
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:39,960
up to that point had ever had this

639
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:43,278
happened right so even even the Israelis

640
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:45,480
who like find these molecular compounds

641
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:46,839
I talk to them because they do not have

642
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,120
the number of people coming through

643
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:52,918
their programs we did like we dwarfed

644
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:55,000
people in in what was taking place and I

645
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:56,720
was I was just a facilitator I didn't

646
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,319
come up with the idea I didn't do the

647
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,919
breeding I just said to the doctor when

648
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:03,918
he approached me I said wow this is so

649
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:06,320
interesting I don't think canabo therapy

650
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:09,799
could do that much so I was totally

651
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:11,519
wrong but I believed it could do 10% and

652
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:12,879
I said if we could just get 10% of

653
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,519
what's coming out of your mouth to

654
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,240
happen it's worth it and it ended up

655
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:21,200
being 200% 300% greater than what came

656
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:26,359
out of the mouth so I took this

657
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:28,480
risk for a a a very limited benefit for

658
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:30,479
what but but the benefit if 10 people of

659
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,919
100 have a better life it's worth the

660
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,240
risk but it it was this it was the

661
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:36,720
Forerunner of it and no one knew no one

662
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,480
knew what to do with the plants like

663
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,440
they run the program doctor created for

664
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,798
his wife but no one knew how to monetize

665
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,840
it because nobody wanted pot that didn't

666
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:47,319
get you high there was no alternative

667
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:49,639
canono medicine at that time this is the

668
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:53,278
beginning like [ __ ] day one

669
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:55,480
[ __ ] and I realized though from the

670
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:56,960
patients and what was happening because

671
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,278
the people we were working with weren't

672
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:03,399
cannabis smokers they were people who

673
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:07,079
were in horrific levels of inflammatory

674
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:09,959
pain they had internal uh stomach pain

675
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:11,879
they had they had um pain in the

676
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,200
intestines they had they had rheumatoid

677
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,200
arthritis they had all these issues of

678
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,600
aging and falling

679
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,480
apart they were the ones that we really

680
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:24,519
came into the program and adopted it

681
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,919
most and so what I saw was this Sudden

682
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:29,599
Change in validation for people who

683
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:32,000
consume cannabis Psych Pro actively

684
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:34,678
because they started to understand that

685
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,960
if I can drive a benefit from something

686
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:39,919
who am I to say you're wrong with the

687
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,399
way you derive benefit so I knew that if

688
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,720
I drove the genes into the system and I

689
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:47,678
got people to benefit in a non-

690
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,440
psychoactive manner then the work that I

691
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,519
do which I'm interested in which is what

692
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,640
I do as a farmer as a nursery operator

693
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:58,440
is psychoactive cannabis it would allow

694
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:01,278
that to exist so I had an agenda of

695
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:04,038
benefit but really was a benefit of how

696
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:06,480
do you get people to reverse their

697
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:09,720
stance on the drug war right so like I'm

698
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,278
born in 66 that was when Nixon as a as a

699
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,278
um when he was in the Senate puts out

700
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:15,558
that first note then I'm I'm I'm

701
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:19,558
teenager in

702
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:22,319
1980 when Reagan comes in 83 I catch my

703
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:24,440
first uh multif felony right for

704
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:26,119
distribution uh cultivation I get

705
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,200
dragged out of high school and spend

706
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:31,639
[ __ ] the the 11th grade in car erated

707
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,240
I get out of high school and my

708
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,799
neighborhood's a crime Zone and my

709
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,038
family's in organized crime so like I

710
00:29:35,798 --> 00:29:40,359
grew up going to prison to visit

711
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:41,480
relatives and which wasn't traumatic and

712
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:44,158
then when I was locked up it wasn't

713
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,200
traumatic either it was normal and the

714
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,480
problem was all my friends were about to

715
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,960
go do life sentences and and I watched

716
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,919
it happen they either got killed or they

717
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,558
killed somebody or they caught you know

718
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:59,200
M multi multi- deade sentences for

719
00:29:55,558 --> 00:30:01,079
criminal activity RICO Act [ __ ]

720
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,159
and I didn't want it right I was 18 I

721
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:05,519
was like [ __ ] like is this is this and I

722
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:08,278
loved weed but I was like if

723
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:09,558
this this can't be my life like I really

724
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:12,000
don't want to spend the rest of my life

725
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:13,759
in goddamn prison and and everyone I

726
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,398
mean I when I get to be 18 we used to

727
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:18,000
swing by the prison and go visit our

728
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:19,879
friends through the [ __ ] fence at the

729
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,119
medium security prison because we knew

730
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,278
their yard time and we would roll up in

731
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:25,479
the car and [ __ ] yelled to each other

732
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:29,240
through the

733
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:31,640
fence like it was that normal and so I

734
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,319
go in the military so I could go get an

735
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,159
education in dive Salvage so I figured

736
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:37,678
you know what I'm going to do I'm going

737
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:40,399
to go get a job as as a salvage diver

738
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,519
and I'm gonna go work globally on oil

739
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:45,079
rigs that's how I'm going to get out of

740
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:45,960
the crime of my neighborhood when I go

741
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:48,038
in the

742
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,519
military and become a

743
00:30:48,038 --> 00:30:53,919
diver it was the peak of the drug war it

744
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:56,599
was 1985 right so they start loaning me

745
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:59,840
out to the DEA and the

746
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:01,599
doj to go be the diver that they drop

747
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:04,599
out of helicopters on these [ __ ]

748
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:07,519
vessels so all of a sudden I'm 19 years

749
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:10,119
old and I'm looking at hundreds of tons

750
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:13,000
of weed I'm looking at [ __ ] tons of

751
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:15,599
cocaine and I'm just like this is crazy

752
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,558
right and I'm dying because I mean it

753
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:21,278
was so opposite of what I had done but

754
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:24,558
when I was on one of those drug

755
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:26,319
raids they raided a a Canadian group

756
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:27,720
that had never been busted but were

757
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:31,480
always being looked at so they had like

758
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:34,079
a 200 foot ship it was sterile but they

759
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:36,120
were International killers and I'm in

760
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:37,960
the galley the kitchen and I'm hanging

761
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:39,359
out in my wet suit and [ __ ] because I I

762
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,960
done I just got done doing the hull

763
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:42,599
inspection and all the other [ __ ] and

764
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,720
they bring all the crew members into the

765
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:46,759
galley to hold them while they search

766
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,600
the whole vessel right so there's Ships

767
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:51,038
coming and there's [ __ ]

768
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:52,398
helicopters and I'm chilling and the

769
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:55,480
captain says me

770
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:57,439
yo um we're all salvage divers too like

771
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,558
we're all divers we start talking diving

772
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,200
and [ __ ] and I grown up around [ __ ]

773
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:02,440
criminals right so I wasn't tripping on

774
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,440
the fact that these guys were all

775
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:07,080
criminals and the captain says to me

776
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,440
what did you do before you went in the

777
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:12,480
military and I looked around and I was

778
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,278
like the same [ __ ] you guys do but at a

779
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,440
smaller level and he was like you know

780
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:19,440
why did you stop and I said because I

781
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,399
caught a case and I said and my whole

782
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,480
neighborhood's all doing life we call it

783
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:26,038
life on the installment plan where you

784
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,960
basically you're in prison for two

785
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:29,638
you're out for three you're in for four

786
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,600
you're out for two you're in for [ __ ]

787
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:34,879
three you're out for two you're in for

788
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:38,158
six and so a lot of my partners ended up

789
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,559
doing this just a life of [ __ ]

790
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,639
incarceration and and I just said I I

791
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:45,158
just didn't want to do it and he was

792
00:32:42,638 --> 00:32:47,798
like herb is the

793
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:49,399
future he said it's way better he goes

794
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:51,278
you don't want to be a diver you don't

795
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:53,038
want to do dive Salvage you don't want

796
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:56,278
to work for the oil companies they're

797
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:58,879
they all suck he goes you're a you're a

798
00:32:56,278 --> 00:33:01,278
piece of [ __ ] hamburger to these guys

799
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,399
and what you want is you want to go back

800
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:08,638
to what you did before and he said just

801
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:12,038
trust me the world will change and so it

802
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:14,079
caught me because I was far more

803
00:33:12,038 --> 00:33:16,200
comfortable speaking to him honestly

804
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:19,079
than I was anybody I worked

805
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,720
with so all the people that you know

806
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:23,398
you're around in your life if you're if

807
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,319
you're raised in a criminal family where

808
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:27,959
like you learn not to [ __ ] rat as a

809
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:29,798
little kid and you're used to seeing

810
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,079
relatives pull [ __ ] robberies and

811
00:33:29,798 --> 00:33:34,359
[ __ ] and you're used to seeing stolen

812
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:36,038
goods and you're used to having family

813
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:41,038
members in the newspaper for [ __ ]

814
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:43,158
shooting people um you're okay with that

815
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:46,319
but when you go into the normal world

816
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:48,600
it's really difficult so I I mean I can

817
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:52,200
function mentally in that world but in

818
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:57,199
terms of operationally it's so different

819
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:59,399
because our world is what it was and I

820
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,480
was more comfortable talking to the team

821
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:04,439
that was being raided than the guys that

822
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,079
they had put me with to do the

823
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:10,760
raiding and it just it it all clicked so

824
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:14,079
when I got off of that mission and went

825
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:16,079
back to Hawaii I bought my first like

826
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,800
plant science books because I started

827
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,200
growing around 80 so 78 I start smoking

828
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,200
the neighborhood's

829
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:26,759
trafficking I get lucky in this weird

830
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:28,480
way that my neighborhood was where all

831
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,599
the fishermen would go go out into the

832
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,358
bay and get the weed from all the boats

833
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,559
so ship all the herb was being still

834
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:38,078
shipped in through vessel right and so I

835
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:41,119
got to see

836
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,879
quantity that was from Global from

837
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,399
people that had their [ __ ] together so

838
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:47,039
they'd be able to tell you this is good

839
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:48,918
and this is not good the good batch

840
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:50,800
usually comes in around then when it

841
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:53,598
comes in we'll come by and grab you and

842
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,639
we'll show it to you so I got this crazy

843
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:59,200
education from these older

844
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:01,160
criminals about quality drugs you know

845
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:02,679
and and they knew where the Bales were

846
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:04,879
coming from and so they would say hey

847
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:07,118
this is Mexican weed I remember when the

848
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,440
first indoor came out in that early 80s

849
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,599
out of Pennsylvania so in 84 I think was

850
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,440
the first time I saw

851
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,240
indoor and it was gorgeous and I said

852
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:20,639
whoa that's crazy because everything was

853
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:22,439
it was a change and so you you had this

854
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,559
background so then I started growing in

855
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,679
like 1980 with my friend Gary but I

856
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:28,279
didn't have a a green thumb I had a

857
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:32,799
brown thumb I killed every than I

858
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:35,440
touched so when I realized that I wanted

859
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,519
to get into cannabis I only really

860
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,760
understood like you grow it or you sell

861
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:42,440
it I didn't understand the million

862
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,040
things that were going to emerge from it

863
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,159
but I said all right let me go get some

864
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:48,279
books and I started to study plant

865
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:51,480
science and the day I got out of the

866
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,480
military in ' 89 I used the government

867
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,760
vehicle in uniform to go to Berkeley

868
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,240
indor Garden to go buy all my grow

869
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,280
lights and spark up an Oakland because I

870
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:03,439
was ready and I love that place I was

871
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,760
[ __ ] good Victor was was cool as [ __ ]

872
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,039
that was at the time when you had to

873
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,880
have a driver's license to buy

874
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:12,759
hydroponic equipment because they made

875
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:15,039
you register all your [ __ ] oh and I I

876
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,240
showed up Victor was still there but I

877
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,559
didn't have to show ID yeah NE I didn't

878
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:20,519
have to either because it was this weird

879
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,159
thing I walked in the store the first

880
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:26,039
time because I I just wanted to check it

881
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:27,920
out and I was in the service then and

882
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:31,199
they had a major Plumbing Leak water was

883
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:34,159
[ __ ] spraying out of the the wall and

884
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:37,159
and because I had all this work on on

885
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:39,318
shipboard water and and and dewatering

886
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:41,078
and so I understand [ __ ] water flow

887
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:42,519
well so I said hey wait a second I said

888
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:44,280
I think I could just [ __ ] fix this

889
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:47,639
for you while I'm here until you get a

890
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,280
plumber to come in so I shut it all down

891
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:51,559
and he was so happy that his store

892
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,480
wasn't get when he got [ __ ] up that he

893
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:56,679
remembered me and so when I came back he

894
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,719
had them put the lights on his [ __ ]

895
00:36:56,679 --> 00:37:01,799
tab nice so like I paid for it but it

896
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:03,279
was all under Victor's name so so at

897
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,680
that time I didn't have to worry about

898
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:10,920
you know the the follow through and then

899
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:13,440
I spark up in Oakland and my my boy AEL

900
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,480
who uh he's passed but he was like older

901
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,599
brother he hooked me up with some of the

902
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,000
Oakland Hustlers so I had a a Jamaican

903
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,200
partner named Greggy I had another

904
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,519
brother named Ricky and I had this white

905
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:26,199
chick named Sue and Sue is where all the

906
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:28,318
ultra high level products were coming

907
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:31,358
from like out of the mesino area so

908
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:33,480
through Sue I got to see my first real

909
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:36,119
Exquisite California

910
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,800
outdoor it was I mean stunning right so

911
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:40,760
I had a pipeline to that through Ricky

912
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,480
it was it was good quality and gregy

913
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,000
same thing they both had really good

914
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,880
access and I had so had this killer

915
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,079
group that I could [ __ ] with and then I

916
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:53,358
ended up tying in with this dude named

917
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:55,280
alandro and I was trying to do business

918
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:57,119
with him but I was being filtered by

919
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,720
this cat we called jailbird Pat so me

920
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,680
and Ja Pat with buddies but he was

921
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:03,159
always in and out of the joint and I

922
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:05,159
said to him I said listen I said you're

923
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:07,358
you're slowing down my [ __ ]

924
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:11,000
distribution business so why don't you

925
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:12,559
just sell me the contact let me just buy

926
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,719
it from you tell me how much this

927
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:17,119
[ __ ] guy's phone number's worth and

928
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:19,159
then give it to me and then I'll just go

929
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,079
to the guy direct so me and Pat worked

930
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:24,759
out a deal on how much the connect was

931
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,880
worth and then I tie into alandro when I

932
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,359
tied into alandro alandro was tied right

933
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,720
into the Mex

934
00:38:28,358 --> 00:38:33,199
Pipeline and so what I started doing

935
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:37,199
with Al was having the people from

936
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:39,318
Mexico come in to NorCal and I would

937
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:42,000
gather what I considered really good

938
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:44,119
commercial samples and we'd show it to

939
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,760
them so they could understand the

940
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:49,680
quality level we needed to beat that

941
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:53,160
product so it allowed us to start

942
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:55,358
steering what was moving into the bay

943
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:58,000
and then I was pushing that [ __ ] into

944
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:59,400
the east coast and we got it to a point

945
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,358
where I could only really I only had to

946
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,760
work like three days a month right so I

947
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:07,159
could do three days of work in the bay

948
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,200
and then not come home for a month so

949
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:11,519
for a good like year and a half I was

950
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:12,960
only home for like little touch points

951
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:15,719
because I was busy [ __ ] around as a

952
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,800
young dude with money and I I would go

953
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:19,358
to the Bay hook up with alandro we'd

954
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,400
[ __ ] tear it up in Rage because he

955
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:25,358
was a a [ __ ] nut and then I had a

956
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,519
warehouse that I rented and that's where

957
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:29,838
we would go and put all the units CR

958
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:31,800
everything up get it set [ __ ] ship it

959
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:35,559
out on Monday and then I'd

960
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:37,560
go so all that barrier time you know it

961
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:40,440
it was incredible but so much of it was

962
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:42,519
really the the and I still I just still

963
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,720
hear those that guys voice in my mind to

964
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:48,599
this day you need to go

965
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:50,199
back and I'm grateful because I think I

966
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:52,960
would have had a really good life doing

967
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:56,000
what I was doing but I would never have

968
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,800
had the exposure to so many diverse

969
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,480
people see I think that that you can you

970
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:05,240
can make money doing a lot of [ __ ] but

971
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:06,920
being in cannabis it touches so many

972
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:09,279
different

973
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,720
demographics that it allows me to have

974
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,680
this [ __ ]

975
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:16,559
Network that's just absolutely mind

976
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:19,039
bended to me that I'm touching people

977
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:21,358
that are happy with nothing and people

978
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:25,159

993
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:09,199

996
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:16,318

998
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:21,480
which is like few meters away you know

999
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:25,599
but it is a privilege to be with

1000
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:28,838
somebody that is uh down to earth so

1001
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:31,599
much that he can Ste travel and he's

1002
00:41:28,838 --> 00:41:36,119
interested in other cultures and other

1003
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:39,039
perspectives and other kind of uh uh how

1004
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:42,240
you look at the columus plant and and

1005
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:43,639
you give back to them as well right

1006
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:46,759
you're not you're not just going there

1007
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:49,118
and stealing their genetics and proping

1008
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:52,319
I'm not Ste I didn't steal

1009
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:55,440
any so I need you know like I rub some I

1010
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:57,318
rub some [ __ ] feathers the wrong way

1011
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,400
and and it's just because in life if you

1012
00:41:57,318 --> 00:42:03,000
do what you do you will you you can't

1013
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,559
worry about being somebody who pleases

1014
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,679
every single person with every action

1015
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:09,279
you do or you'll never [ __ ] do

1016
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:11,318
anything right so like anytime you do

1017
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,160
anything there's going to be an opinion

1018
00:42:11,318 --> 00:42:14,880
on

1019
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:16,719
it but the stuff that was in cannabis

1020
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,119
was when I was a kid and I started like

1021
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:19,919
I remember I was in I was I was a

1022
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:23,480
cannabis freak since I was

1023
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:26,119
12 the idea that I had this dream as a

1024
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:29,039
kid that one day I would go to Every

1025
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:32,318
cannabis producer region on Earth and I

1026
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:35,239
would just get to see it I wasn't I

1027
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:37,838
wasn't trying to do anything profound I

1028
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:40,399
just wanted I just wanted to see the

1029
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:42,838
world that built our world and over the

1030
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:47,160
course of my life I kind of did but

1031
00:42:42,838 --> 00:42:49,480
Pakistan was you know the Untouchable

1032
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:53,078
because you know I'm American and like

1033
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:55,240
holy [ __ ] we nonstop war and conflict so

1034
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:56,640
when the pakistanis reached out to me

1035
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,838
and said you know we'd love to have you

1036
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:01,199
come over and I'm like for what like

1037
00:42:58,838 --> 00:43:03,358
what's what is it that you want me to do

1038
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:06,759
and they said we really just want to

1039
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:09,039
expose you to our world and hopefully

1040
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:11,079
when you leave you'll be able to bring

1041
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:14,039
that good memory back with you and let

1042
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:16,800
other people know and their

1043
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:19,400
desire wasn't just cannabis Centric at

1044
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,039
all it was that can it which is was

1045
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,480
important it was that cannabis was the

1046
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:27,400
vehicle the tool that was going to

1047
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,880
create the connection between us because

1048
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,440
what they want is they wanted to be able

1049
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:34,079
to show Pakistan as a totality where

1050
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,960
when you went to the Village to look at

1051
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:39,079
the weed how did the people treat you

1052
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,199
when you had food with the people after

1053
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:43,240
looking at the weed how did the people

1054
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:47,919
treat you while you were looking for the

1055
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:51,639
weed what was the country like and so it

1056
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,800
was such a elegant beautiful idea that

1057
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:56,440
the land race genetics team and let's be

1058
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:59,640
friends Pakistan had that once they laid

1059
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:02,079
it out to you know over the phone I was

1060
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:03,558
like I'm down I would love to go and the

1061
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,280
irony is that as soon as I'm getting

1062
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:07,400
ready to get on the plane I get all

1063
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,000
these texts on my phone and I still got

1064
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:12,358
don't one if I still kept it it opens up

1065
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,519
with they're gonna cut off your [ __ ]

1066
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:15,759
head and and I'm laughing because you're

1067
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:17,159
about to get on a plane to go to

1068
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,160
Pakistan right and people are say to you

1069
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:20,598
they're gonna cut up your [ __ ] head

1070
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:22,239
and I'm cracking up and I'm like no

1071
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:25,280
they're not gonna cut off my

1072
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:27,199
head and what I don't think people catch

1073
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,960
is that because I I go to all these odd

1074
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:33,078
[ __ ] locations over the course of my

1075
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:36,760
career that most would not go to

1076
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:38,839
and it's it's really learning about risk

1077
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:41,520
mitigation like you learn how to weigh

1078
00:44:38,838 --> 00:44:43,679
your odds and so if you live in the

1079
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:46,239
hustle and then you do dangerous deadly

1080
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:49,078
[ __ ] for a job you start to kind of

1081
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:51,479
learn like where you feel safe and where

1082
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:54,680
you don't and when you don't feel safe

1083
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:57,240
you're really pretty honest with why and

1084
00:44:54,679 --> 00:44:59,399
so you logically Move Yourself to

1085
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:01,279
position assurity where you say I think

1086
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,838
the the odds are good I'll come back

1087
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,760
with my [ __ ] head attached to my

1088
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:07,440
shoulder but if I didn't feel that

1089
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,960
there's no point in going because you're

1090
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,400
not there to be a martyr to get your

1091
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,679
[ __ ] head locked off on a video so

1092
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,680
what I what I knew was the people that I

1093
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:19,598
was speaking with they were really clear

1094
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:22,399
about their agenda and their agenda was

1095
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,559
to highlight the beauty of the country

1096
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,318
through

1097
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:28,599
cannabis

1098
00:45:25,318 --> 00:45:30,480
specifically once we started really talk

1099
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:33,400
they weren't aware that there was this

1100
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,318
man in Humble named Douglas fur so Doug

1101
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:38,280
fur is this local back to Lander you

1102
00:45:35,318 --> 00:45:39,480
know 1968 gets here one of the original

1103
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,519
back to land

1104
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,400
groups and they're raiding cannabis in

1105
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:45,559
like late October then because

1106
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,280
everything they were growing in

1107
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:50,359
California was what [ __ ] Southeast

1108
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,359
Asian Mexican and Colombian the

1109
00:45:50,358 --> 00:45:54,519
broadleaf [ __ ] hadn't really come into

1110
00:45:52,358 --> 00:45:56,598
Cali until

1111
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:58,239
7880 that's when it really first started

1112
00:45:56,599 --> 00:46:01,640
coming in

1113
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:04,239
and the the impetus was if we can get

1114
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:06,679
plants that finish a month earlier than

1115
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:09,759
the raid we'll have our crop out of the

1116
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:13,000
ground so Doug and his buddy connect

1117
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:18,760
with a rug dealer out of Eureka who was

1118
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:21,880
Pakistani and they fly to Islam Abad and

1119
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:24,359
they travel out to the Tia Valley and

1120
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:27,519
they gather the jeans and then he ships

1121
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:30,199
that kilo back in 10 packages or 12

1122
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:34,159
packages and six of them arrived and six

1123
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:37,838
of them didn't make it so half a key 500

1124
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:40,558
grams a pound um of seed makes it to

1125
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:43,039
Doug direct into Humble County and what

1126
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:45,319
he did that was different than anyone

1127
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:47,920
else that had received any Afghani lines

1128
00:46:45,318 --> 00:46:48,880
Pakistani lines was he shared the stock

1129
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,720
with the

1130
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:54,160
locals and what it did is it kickstarted

1131
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:58,399
the broadleaf revolution in our

1132
00:46:54,159 --> 00:47:00,480
area and it lets people harvest on time

1133
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,280
and then you get into that mid 80s Zone

1134
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,519
and indoor is on fire and it was those

1135
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,440
plants that could flower under those

1136
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:10,679
conditions because the equatorial just

1137
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:13,159
don't Thrive commercially in those

1138
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:16,480
situations right so all these things

1139
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:19,440
line up and it also lines up with where

1140
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:22,358
America changed its desire of effect so

1141
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,920
like America in the 60s and 70s was

1142
00:47:22,358 --> 00:47:27,960
looking to get high and spiritually

1143
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:30,720
uplifted you get into like 1980 when you

1144
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:33,358
get into the Reagan Era and if you take

1145
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:35,919
a look at drug usage and and general

1146
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:38,159
tone you start to see that disparity

1147
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,480
between people who made money rising up

1148
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:41,279
in the chart and people who were

1149
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:44,400
typically workers who made good money

1150
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:46,640
dropping in the chart so 1980 in America

1151
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,280
is like a critical date because it's the

1152
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:50,519
change of the

1153
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,519
society's state of

1154
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:56,400
mind and that's when you started to

1155
00:47:52,519 --> 00:47:58,519
notice cocaine and heroin re explode and

1156
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,480
cannabis mirrors these other drugs and

1157
00:47:58,519 --> 00:48:02,239
so we went from having taii weed

1158
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,719
Colombian and Mexican which you get on

1159
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:07,799
import into broadleaf and people didn't

1160
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:10,799
[ __ ] that they weren't getting their

1161
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:14,359
old type of high because the new

1162
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:16,240
consumers coming in felt weight on them

1163
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:19,239
remember the end of the 70s America was

1164
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:23,159
a [ __ ] hole we we we we were in

1165
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:25,799
hyperinflation we had the the Iranian

1166
00:48:23,159 --> 00:48:27,920
issue where our Embassy had been seized

1167
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:31,240
we had you know he had debacle in the

1168
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:34,000
Vietnam War so like the public sees

1169
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:36,719
their country negatively and because of

1170
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,960
it they see the world negatively and it

1171
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:41,519
starts to change drug usage so what I do

1172
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:44,199
is like to this day I look at what's

1173
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:46,880
taking place in the society around me

1174
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:49,000
and I use that to interpret why are the

1175
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,280
things that people consume

1176
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,760
popular and it's Critical with drugs

1177
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,839
because it mirrors it so clearly and so

1178
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:59,119
it helps me understand Trends are we in

1179
00:48:56,838 --> 00:49:02,119
Trend that's Rising is it is it is it

1180
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:03,960
flat or is it declining and it helps me

1181
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:06,440
understand genetic development where is

1182
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:08,400
it worth getting into that direction or

1183
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:10,280
do I think it's going to have a quick

1184
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:15,639
Peak and

1185
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:18,640
so that that time period was so

1186
00:49:15,639 --> 00:49:22,519
tumultuous but it let you kind of see

1187
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:24,400
these transitions from the 70s and then

1188
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:26,759
we get into the 80s the drug walk kicks

1189
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,639
in the valuation explodes cannabis is

1190
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,680
worth a thousand in Humble it goes up in

1191
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:33,480
some cases you know

1192
00:49:30,679 --> 00:49:37,399
six and the the money pours in it

1193
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:39,760
changes completely but Doug is a really

1194
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:41,838
nice down toe dude who still lives in a

1195
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,079
cabin who still lives off grid who still

1196
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:47,159
makes tea for you in a in a with a

1197
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:49,839
[ __ ] like a propane torch you know

1198
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:53,159
and the idea that I was going to get to

1199
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:56,000
go to Pakistan and walk the ground that

1200
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:58,480
my friend walked just really caught me

1201
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,199
so I told the team in Pakistan I said

1202
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,880
hey we need to call this like the

1203
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:05,480
footsteps of Doug

1204
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:06,480
fur and they all got caught up in it too

1205
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,039
where we

1206
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,079
like they could understand what I was

1207
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:14,519
trying to do which was start to connect

1208
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:16,240
the dots so that we could tell the story

1209
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:19,880
so that PE people could see the

1210
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:21,759
relevance and understand that a few

1211
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:24,160
people went to these countries and

1212
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,440
brought back the genes that launched $50

1213
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:27,279
billion doll

1214
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,159
Empire and

1215
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,519
the people that that gave us the seed

1216
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:34,558
stock in all intents and purposes got

1217
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:37,119
[ __ ] because they never made any

1218
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:39,839
longlasting benefit from the

1219
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:43,039
relationship and so what we tried to do

1220
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:45,798
was recreate the footsteps of Doug fur

1221
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:48,960
but instead of just Doug walking the

1222
00:50:45,798 --> 00:50:51,719
silk route into Pakistan I wanted the

1223
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:54,039
silk route to extend into the United

1224
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:57,159
States and let the pakistanis walk into

1225
00:50:54,039 --> 00:50:59,558
our our lives too so I said hey I think

1226
00:50:57,159 --> 00:51:01,960
I have an idea how like we can frame it

1227
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:04,079
and it it went really well and they

1228
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:06,559
brought in a you know team of people

1229
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:09,359
from uh Europe they brought in my buddy

1230
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:11,160
Danny from Green walrus who does you

1231
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:13,639
know does the documentary work and he

1232
00:51:11,159 --> 00:51:16,399
came in with John who's a

1233
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:18,239
filmmaker and our other partner who's a

1234
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,480
filmmaker as well who now does Major

1235
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:23,279
League Baseball stuff but in film and so

1236
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:25,039
they were able to capture so much like

1237
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,200
some of the footage that was

1238
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:31,880
captured it's it's all inspiring and so

1239
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:36,199
what you got to do was look

1240
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:39,200
at not just weed we we traveled for 1300

1241
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:41,159
miles through the kurakura mountains so

1242
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:43,919
you know you're you're we're walking the

1243
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:46,759
silk route you're seeing the roads that

1244
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:49,039
the hominids and the Andals merged on

1245
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,640
you're finding all this native cannabis

1246
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:52,920
running wild in the mountains that

1247
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:56,838
humans are not playing with every

1248
00:51:52,920 --> 00:52:00,119
village you went to had a crop Kevin

1249
00:51:56,838 --> 00:52:02,440
farmer was kind the tell me just how it

1250
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:04,960
how it is to look at the mountains there

1251
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:08,079
you know to see this This

1252
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:10,519
Magnificent you know it's crazy just

1253
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:12,318
explain the feeling you man tell tell

1254
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:15,239
because I was in these places not in

1255
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:18,480
this but Mongolia I was but this is very

1256
00:52:15,239 --> 00:52:20,959
similar you know it's just so the

1257
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:23,440
environment has so much

1258
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,559
impact live I live in the mountains of

1259
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,400
humble right so I'm on I'm in I'm in the

1260
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:30,040
Pacific range

1261
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:32,039
and and I've been to Colorado a bunch

1262
00:52:30,039 --> 00:52:32,838
and you know and and and seen that type

1263
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:35,880
of

1264
00:52:32,838 --> 00:52:38,119
elevation but Pakistan was the first

1265
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:40,838
time I ever really understood

1266
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:43,680
verticality where we were walking around

1267
00:52:40,838 --> 00:52:47,119
at 10,000 feet and when you looked up

1268
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:49,199
there was another 15,000 above you yes

1269
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:52,519
and you look down these canyons and

1270
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:54,960
there was miles of distance to the to

1271
00:52:52,519 --> 00:52:57,358
the base and you look up and there's

1272
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,280
miles above you

1273
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:01,159
and

1274
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:03,240
it it helped me understand the mountain

1275
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:05,000
culture similar as like all my part A

1276
00:53:03,239 --> 00:53:07,479
lot of my good friends and like what I

1277
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:11,880
call family are Polynesian right so

1278
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:13,480
Samoan Hawaiian talaan

1279
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:16,720
Tongan

1280
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:19,119
and that's boat culture those were

1281
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:21,318
ancient Navigators and sailors and they

1282
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:24,240
sailed these massive Outriggers all over

1283
00:53:21,318 --> 00:53:26,119
the ocean and just but it's boat culture

1284
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:28,279
and boat culture is you learn to shut

1285
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:31,640
the [ __ ] up and work together or they

1286
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:34,119
throw you off the boat and so it's this

1287
00:53:31,639 --> 00:53:36,118
teamwork type environment because you

1288
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:37,838
have to be a team player on a [ __ ]

1289
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:42,200
canoe out in the middle of the

1290
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:44,400
ocean I don't see that in many cultures

1291
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:47,318
because we just don't have the need but

1292
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:49,119
in the kurakura mountains I saw it again

1293
00:53:47,318 --> 00:53:51,639
and what I saw was that you had to be

1294
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:54,760
nice to strangers because if you were a

1295
00:53:51,639 --> 00:53:57,759
stranger in those places you definitely

1296
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:59,240
needed a way out of the environment

1297
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,480
it was so

1298
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:04,919
massive that there there's no photos no

1299
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:07,240
pictures until you see the the the

1300
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:09,200
Hooper Glacier you don't quite catch

1301
00:54:07,239 --> 00:54:12,358
what a glacier looks like you don't

1302
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:14,919
realize it's an ice flow coming out of a

1303
00:54:12,358 --> 00:54:17,759
mountain and every little Ripple in it

1304
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:19,720
is like 150 feet tall the fins that are

1305
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,799
on the top of these things you know

1306
00:54:19,719 --> 00:54:25,318
you're talking 10-story building

1307
00:54:21,798 --> 00:54:28,519
Ripples and massive moving through these

1308
00:54:25,318 --> 00:54:32,079
regions it just made you feel so

1309
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:34,519
insignificant and vulnerable and why

1310
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:37,640
were you at such an elevation that's the

1311
00:54:34,519 --> 00:54:39,358
b Pakistan is the rooftop of the world

1312
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:41,199
so once you get off of like you go to

1313
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:43,279
you know the coast what that karach you

1314
00:54:41,199 --> 00:54:45,960
go down to the the ocean part they

1315
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:48,200
didn't go that that far we spent our

1316
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:51,119
whole time up in those hindukush

1317
00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:53,239
Himalaya kurakura Mountain Range once

1318
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,400
you get into those you're at base

1319
00:54:53,239 --> 00:54:57,679
elevation 10 grand but there's no

1320
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:00,079
cannabis growing at 10 ,000 ftct sure

1321
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:02,399
there is it is yes

1322
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:04,160
10,000 coming from yeah all this is

1323
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,280
coming at 10 the best sheet is coming

1324
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:08,399
from there yeah oh it was incredible and

1325
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:10,079
the native herb was it was crazy looking

1326
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,280
because when you get to see Wild

1327
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:15,200
cannabis what you get to see is these

1328
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,519
plants that are built for survivability

1329
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:21,118
and what is survivability for cannabis

1330
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:23,759
not too much um biomass which would te

1331
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:27,440
technically rot and so what you have is

1332
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:30,319
you have big giant trikes on small brck

1333
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:33,318
small small flower

1334
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:35,400
sets but just insane Aromas and you

1335
00:55:33,318 --> 00:55:37,880
would just see anywhere where there was

1336
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:40,440
water that deposited you'd see this and

1337
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:43,798
in your mind you can see the people

1338
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:46,318
moving across the silk route eating seed

1339
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:48,639
[ __ ] it out seed moving around

1340
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:50,558
animals eating seeds [ __ ] it out

1341
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:53,159
people getting seed to eat and dropping

1342
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:57,599
it and you realize that it was this

1343
00:55:53,159 --> 00:56:01,679
massive gene flow through this entire

1344
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:03,838
region and it's humbling it it allows

1345
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:05,919
you to understand that you know that and

1346
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:07,599
everywhere we went I asked every village

1347
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,200
like how long have you guys been making

1348
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,359
hash how long you've been working in you

1349
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:13,960
know in this your family and they said

1350
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:17,400
well we all got here you know 1500 years

1351
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:19,639
ago 1,00 years ago 2100 years ago and

1352
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:22,838
everyone said the same thing herb was

1353
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:25,679
here when we got here so our families

1354
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:28,279
only know herb and you're talking to

1355
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:30,279
hashme ERS who when you're talking to

1356
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:33,440
them they're telling you the first

1357
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:37,798
memories I have as a child is helping my

1358
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:39,599
dad beat hash in the shack and their dad

1359
00:56:37,798 --> 00:56:43,318
had beat hash and their grandfather had

1360
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:45,798
beat hash for [ __ ] 2,000 years so

1361
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:48,798
when they held resin in their hands and

1362
00:56:45,798 --> 00:56:51,920
they moved it in their fingers and it

1363
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:53,759
was just so familiar and and it just

1364
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,440
helped you understand how much we we

1365
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,599
[ __ ] up the entire education of

1366
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,000
cannabis because the drug war took all

1367
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:02,359
this information out and removed

1368
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,199
it Hey Hey Kevin do you mind uh

1369
00:57:02,358 --> 00:57:06,318
describing some of the Tarpin that you

1370
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:08,159
were finding on the living cannabis up

1371
00:57:06,318 --> 00:57:10,038
at 10,000 ft like what were some of the

1372
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:12,239
most memorable ones that you that you

1373
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:14,559
experienced there you know what's funny

1374
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:17,000
is like the wild

1375
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:19,760
populations you know you saw a myriad of

1376
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,239
Aromas present because it it was it

1377
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:25,000
survival but when you're talking about

1378
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:27,719
like fixed populations and remember now

1379
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,000
like so India doesn't do any culling of

1380
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:32,759
male or female so it's total open

1381
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,880
population but Pakistan and

1382
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:37,720
Afghanistan they select males so they

1383
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,039
leave all the females they select the

1384
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:40,558
males and so what they do is they go

1385
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:44,079
through the males in the field and they

1386
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:46,000
they leave the ones that have the best

1387
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:47,880
characteristics but it's not as a single

1388
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,719
planets this one had great Aroma this

1389
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:51,599
one had great survivability this one

1390
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:55,439
right here had great flower set this one

1391
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:56,680
had um you know in in in incredible

1392
00:57:55,440 --> 00:58:01,000
braze

1393
00:57:56,679 --> 00:58:02,358
so it's they they they don't go after I

1394
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,838
was in discussion the other day about

1395
00:58:02,358 --> 00:58:06,759
this but it was about like fenal hunting

1396
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:08,199
in the idea that cannabis we feno hunt

1397
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:10,319
and I said they don't do that in a and

1398
00:58:08,199 --> 00:58:12,960
people say yes they do fenal hunt a but

1399
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:14,558
most a is in beeding right so if you're

1400
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:17,760
if you're hunting

1401
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:20,640
plants that

1402
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,559
are able to reproduce on themself which

1403
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:24,679
is considered a perfect plant you're

1404
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,519
finding a plant but it's through seed

1405
00:58:24,679 --> 00:58:29,358
production and the genetic movement it

1406
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:31,480
is not just that single organism

1407
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:35,119
cannabis we go through huge populations

1408
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:36,119
to find a plant the problem is that

1409
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,680
you're having to go through huge

1410
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:40,318
population to find a plant that means as

1411
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:41,838
a breeder you're not doing a good job

1412
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:45,199
that's poor breeding because you're not

1413
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:47,880
able to neck the traits down so when you

1414
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:50,078
go into like open pop it's everything's

1415
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:53,880
everywhere and and you'll but you'll see

1416
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:57,880
still patterns with clothes pop you see

1417
00:58:53,880 --> 00:59:01,240
what the farmers like so Farm chooses

1418
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:04,798
the males they want to work with

1419
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:07,639
and what I noticed from the my journals

1420
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:10,440
was that the Aromas

1421
00:59:07,639 --> 00:59:12,598
matched the crops that were grown around

1422
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:15,159
them so when we first come down like

1423
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:17,359
into nger Valley it's when you started

1424
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:21,038
to get like into all the mangoes and

1425
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:24,000
fruits because there was more of apple

1426
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:26,240
and fruit that they were around and then

1427
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,880
as we start to go into the areas where

1428
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:31,118
had you know like Walnut and and and

1429
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:34,400
other types of nut tree there was other

1430
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:38,039
profiles and then um the the the potato

1431
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:40,000
other profiles and so when I journaled

1432
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:42,400
the whole thing and then looked at the

1433
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,760
picture like what was the big

1434
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:48,000
clusters what you had was you had what

1435
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,799
we would call like the traditional

1436
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,559
earthy profiles that we we associate

1437
00:59:50,798 --> 00:59:53,679
with

1438
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:56,039
broadleaf and then you get into what we

1439
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:59,798
would call fuel here but I also call it

1440
00:59:56,039 --> 01:00:02,039
chemical but chemical that was turned up

1441
00:59:59,798 --> 01:00:03,920
and I mean like Hairspray that had been

1442
01:00:02,039 --> 01:00:06,880
blasted in your face and then lit on

1443
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:08,680
fire smells that were penetrating like

1444
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,640
you know an acre away from where you

1445
01:00:08,679 --> 01:00:13,960
shook the plant people were like whoa if

1446
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:17,558
the wind move that stuff was coming and

1447
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:19,280
so it was these really interesting sets

1448
01:00:17,559 --> 01:00:22,000
and then we noticed that like around a

1449
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:24,559
lot of the the potato was those the Deep

1450
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,920
volatile sulfur which is you know septic

1451
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:32,240
tank ratting meat

1452
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:34,079
um Decay really heinous foul Aromas but

1453
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:36,118
what I didn't see in that sounds

1454
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:38,920
delicious it was great it was great but

1455
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:41,440
what I didn't see in the hash was any

1456
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:44,200
fuel profiles and I asked them why and I

1457
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:46,798
said with all this chemical and fuel why

1458
01:00:44,199 --> 01:00:49,960
don't I see it in the product they said

1459
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:52,559
because we off gas it we allow the

1460
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:55,240
plants to sit at Harvest we let them sit

1461
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:57,079
out in the cold and I said and that

1462
01:00:55,239 --> 01:00:59,318
process is do what he goes it's letting

1463
01:00:57,079 --> 01:01:02,160
us get a lot of these other volatiles

1464
01:00:59,318 --> 01:01:04,358
off the plant that we don't like as a

1465
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:07,159
consumer and I said why don't you like

1466
01:01:04,358 --> 01:01:09,000
that type of effect and he's like it was

1467
01:01:07,159 --> 01:01:11,639
hysterical because it was so honest he

1468
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:15,599
said oh we'll get too high and fall off

1469
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:17,239
the mountain and die yes and you you

1470
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:20,160
it's hard to explain this to somebody

1471
01:01:17,239 --> 01:01:23,959
but like we were at the hunza Inn which

1472
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:25,440
is this killer spot in hza and me and a

1473
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:26,960
bunch of the Pakistani Brothers went

1474
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,119
hiked up the the mountain early in the

1475
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,079
morning and we're like struggling to

1476
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:34,119
climb this mountain and all of a sudden

1477
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:36,160
it was time to go to school for the kids

1478
01:01:34,119 --> 01:01:37,680
and all these kids come skipping down

1479
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:40,480
the mountain like a bunch of [ __ ]

1480
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:42,199
goats and there's old men carrying

1481
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,519
children on their back and I mean like

1482
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:47,038
we're climbing like we're fighting for

1483
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:48,920
our lives and these guys are skipping

1484
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:51,880
down this [ __ ] and if we anybody falling

1485
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:55,480
you die and we're cracking up because

1486
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:58,400
they're so acclimated to it but they

1487
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:00,079
don't like to have reduced awareness

1488
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,440
because they just know that you can't

1489
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:05,400
make mistakes in that type of situation

1490
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:09,358
so they said no we gas all that off and

1491
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:11,079
it opens up this and what it was was it

1492
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:13,358
was hash that had you know like

1493
01:02:11,079 --> 01:02:16,039
traditional hash that you almost never

1494
01:02:13,358 --> 01:02:17,480
see with all these subtle fruit and

1495
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:19,400
floral

1496
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:21,278
influences that's the first time and

1497
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:24,119
I've seen a lot of [ __ ] hash I've

1498
01:02:21,278 --> 01:02:26,599
never seen hash when they broke up a a

1499
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:27,920
chunk of it you thought were in a fruit

1500
01:02:26,599 --> 01:02:30,480
and a flower

1501
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:33,119
shop and it was because they had off

1502
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:35,318
gassed all these other masking agents

1503
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:37,599
that they don't like as a impact and it

1504
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:41,278
revealed all this other stuff

1505
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:43,798
so it was it was just really it was a

1506
01:02:41,278 --> 01:02:45,838
beautiful experience and I I I really

1507
01:02:43,798 --> 01:02:48,079
hope that that and that's what we we

1508
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:49,679
tried and we did because they did it

1509
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:52,798
again last year I just couldn't make it

1510
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:55,318
out because I had my farm running so

1511
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:58,480
they were able to get people who saw the

1512
01:02:55,318 --> 01:03:01,199
trip believe that it was a healthy safe

1513
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:03,318
experience went back with them on the

1514
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:04,480
journey and they went over to some

1515
01:03:03,318 --> 01:03:07,199
different

1516
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,440
regions and it's the beginning of it to

1517
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:11,118
where you start being able to bring

1518
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:14,240
value to the people who are trying to

1519
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:16,318
bring value to the farms and the farmers

1520
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:19,439
and it starts to get us in cannabis in

1521
01:03:16,318 --> 01:03:22,199
the US to realize for so many of us that

1522
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:24,960
we're not we're not the [ __ ] like the

1523
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:27,399
story we're we're a chapter of the story

1524
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:30,240
we're the ones that have best internet

1525
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:32,358
but we don't we don't own the Cannabis

1526
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:34,038
World in any way shape or form in terms

1527
01:03:32,358 --> 01:03:36,278
of like usage or knowledge because

1528
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:39,079
really we're us like Australia are the

1529
01:03:36,278 --> 01:03:41,000
last on the [ __ ] list so Eastern

1530
01:03:39,079 --> 01:03:45,720
Europe has had [ __ ] herb in it for

1531
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:47,400
six 7,000 years we only only you know

1532
01:03:45,719 --> 01:03:50,239
herb comes into the United States you

1533
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:52,440
know through through hemp in the eras

1534
01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:54,519
when they had to create hemp's rope but

1535
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:58,880
drug cannabis really kind of comes into

1536
01:03:54,519 --> 01:04:01,639
the US in the 19 unds from Mexico and

1537
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:04,278
that begins the American smoking culture

1538
01:04:01,639 --> 01:04:07,400
and musicians and that Southern

1539
01:04:04,278 --> 01:04:09,358
California feel instantly it gets

1540
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:11,200
demonized by the media so that's when

1541
01:04:09,358 --> 01:04:13,558
they start to use marijuana as a

1542
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:14,719
negative word and I always tell people

1543
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:16,278
if you take a look at the paper in

1544
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:18,118
America and it tells you the Mexicans

1545
01:04:16,278 --> 01:04:20,318
are going to take your [ __ ] jobs

1546
01:04:18,119 --> 01:04:23,599
realize that was the headline in 19

1547
01:04:20,318 --> 01:04:25,599
[ __ ] 10 too so in 1910 it said

1548
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:27,760
Mexicans going to steal your jobs then

1549
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:29,559
they they realized that they could get

1550
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:31,520
the blacks caught up in it too you know

1551
01:04:29,559 --> 01:04:33,480
and at that time we're talking you know

1552
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:36,440
America's racist like just coming out of

1553
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:39,039
the [ __ ] slave area basically so you

1554
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:41,079
got these slave master mentality running

1555
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:44,880
the country they're like oh we can go

1556
01:04:41,079 --> 01:04:48,400
[ __ ] to Mexican and as a benefit we can

1557
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,960
[ __ ] the black so they swept the black

1558
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,798
up and they use a narrative to go

1559
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:54,639
against the black they sweep the Mexican

1560
01:04:51,798 --> 01:04:57,559
go the narrative there they use uh

1561
01:04:54,639 --> 01:04:59,759
marijuana as his derogatory term and all

1562
01:04:57,559 --> 01:05:01,359
this usage of cannabis had nothing to do

1563
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,960
with cannabis it was the fact that the

1564
01:05:01,358 --> 01:05:04,798
people that were running the US were

1565
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:08,240
[ __ ] brutal

1566
01:05:04,798 --> 01:05:10,798
racists and demonized the substance to

1567
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:13,038
get an agenda and then when you know the

1568
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:14,278
industrial cronies figure out the value

1569
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:16,799
of it and they realize it's a

1570
01:05:14,278 --> 01:05:19,679
replaceable product for for

1571
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:22,079
petroleum Hurst who didn't want to lose

1572
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:25,159
the forests right you know so Rand

1573
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:27,318
Randol Hurst is the newspaper magnate so

1574
01:05:25,159 --> 01:05:29,719
he has the ability to create anything he

1575
01:05:27,318 --> 01:05:33,199
wants in the news he's also the world's

1576
01:05:29,719 --> 01:05:36,078
largest Timber holder and so hemp was a

1577
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:38,480
direct threat to H's Timber [ __ ]

1578
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:40,519
production Dupont had just came out with

1579
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,480
nylon not that long before and he was

1580
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:46,239
like oh [ __ ] you I'm not losing this

1581
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:48,318
patent and Rockefeller was was

1582
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:50,078
basically Rockefeller is a unique

1583
01:05:48,318 --> 01:05:53,079
[ __ ] guy and if you really look at

1584
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:55,318
Rockefeller and the the the the way he

1585
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:57,160
was raised by his dad where his Dad

1586
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:59,719
tried to [ __ ] him over every day him and

1587
01:05:57,159 --> 01:06:01,879
all his brothers the dad was trying to

1588
01:05:59,719 --> 01:06:04,838
teach him how to be ruthless brutal

1589
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:07,400
businessmen so rockefeller's background

1590
01:06:04,838 --> 01:06:10,278
is just [ __ ] brutal and he was the

1591
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:12,760
right guy to be brutalized because he

1592
01:06:10,278 --> 01:06:16,039
internalized that brutality and then

1593
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:17,119
exemplified it in his business practices

1594
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:20,799
and when

1595
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:22,720
he gets broken up as a as a monopoly by

1596
01:06:20,798 --> 01:06:24,599
the US is when almost every Oil Company

1597
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:26,439
in the United States is formed because

1598
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:29,000
he owned the [ __ ] country I mean [ __ ]

1599
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:32,000
his choke hold on oil was similar to

1600
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,039
Hershey's choke cold on chocolate so at

1601
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,960
one point in time in the US I think like

1602
01:06:34,039 --> 01:06:39,559
95% of all chocolate sold was from

1603
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,920
Hershey so when you have a control like

1604
01:06:39,559 --> 01:06:45,599
that you know it it also takes a certain

1605
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:47,599
type of individual so rockefeller's just

1606
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:49,599
[ __ ] lunatic to me when you really

1607
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:51,838
look at the way he approached business

1608
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:55,000
and cracks [ __ ] down and he switches

1609
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:57,159
into education the educational system he

1610
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:00,119
switches too same thing it's

1611
01:06:57,159 --> 01:07:02,278
anti-cannabis but it's also anti-

1612
01:07:00,119 --> 01:07:04,039
expression because what he wanted from

1613
01:07:02,278 --> 01:07:06,639
the educational system was [ __ ]

1614
01:07:04,039 --> 01:07:10,079
workers to work in the factories so the

1615
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:12,159
US educational system was

1616
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:13,480
developed and I'm not an educational

1617
01:07:12,159 --> 01:07:16,480
expert but like mean you could read this

1618
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:21,000
[ __ ] was really developed to get people

1619
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:22,599
from agrarian lifestyle into factories

1620
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,358
how do you get people to work in a

1621
01:07:22,599 --> 01:07:26,240
factory you got to bring them in a

1622
01:07:24,358 --> 01:07:28,199
building you got to let them piss on a

1623
01:07:26,239 --> 01:07:30,759
schedule you got to make them hold the

1624
01:07:28,199 --> 01:07:32,358
hand you put standardized information in

1625
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:34,640
front of them that's designed to figure

1626
01:07:32,358 --> 01:07:36,798
out who's good at running the job who's

1627
01:07:34,639 --> 01:07:39,679
good at working on the job and if you

1628
01:07:36,798 --> 01:07:42,639
don't fit into that window you're [ __ ]

1629
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:45,679
and cannabis to me was a drug that

1630
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:47,558
allowed people to transcend the

1631
01:07:45,679 --> 01:07:49,038
brainwashing and I think that that was

1632
01:07:47,559 --> 01:07:51,720
one of the things that you know we

1633
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:54,720
really don't talk about in terms of why

1634
01:07:51,719 --> 01:07:57,679
it was so easily demonized by so many

1635
01:07:54,719 --> 01:08:00,358
entities is that they realize that not

1636
01:07:57,679 --> 01:08:02,399
only does it compete with these products

1637
01:08:00,358 --> 01:08:05,199
but herb allows you to see people in a

1638
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:08,119
more human way and so when and it it

1639
01:08:05,199 --> 01:08:10,038
does bring races together when you're

1640
01:08:08,119 --> 01:08:13,119
all smoking weed they're not Mexican

1641
01:08:10,039 --> 01:08:16,520
black Asian and white you're just four

1642
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:19,239
people and and I think that Herb's

1643
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:23,040
ability to create these these internal

1644
01:08:19,238 --> 01:08:26,000
Ties That Bind based off of decent

1645
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:28,600
decency is a [ __ ] problem

1646
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,039
when you're trying to segregate Nations

1647
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:32,679
so that you can have internal conflict

1648
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:34,359
and now we just use the internet now we

1649
01:08:32,679 --> 01:08:37,000
just throw some [ __ ] on the net everyone

1650
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:39,279
loses their [ __ ] minds nervous

1651
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:41,520
breakdowns I mean like fullon nervous

1652
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:44,080
break I I watch this [ __ ] I'm just like

1653
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:46,719
wow you're losing your [ __ ] mind what

1654
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:50,519
are you doing in the rest of your

1655
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:53,000
day I mean so but it's always been done

1656
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:55,520
and herb is this substance that

1657
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:58,920
inherently brings I think really nice

1658
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:02,159
traits out in people and and that's kind

1659
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:04,679
of what I wanted to be able to do like

1660
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:06,238
through that those medical era was to

1661
01:09:04,679 --> 01:09:08,759
get people to be able to benefit from

1662
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:11,519
the plant in its totality even though I

1663
01:09:08,759 --> 01:09:15,838
barely understood it so I had I just

1664
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:18,920
know that when you have benefit derived

1665
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:21,519
by individuals with very little

1666
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:23,239
reciprocity required meaning that all

1667
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:26,640
they have to do is basically show up and

1668
01:09:23,238 --> 01:09:28,439
be decent it allows you to make massive

1669
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:32,039
massive cultural

1670
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:34,358
changes and and I had really no idea of

1671
01:09:32,039 --> 01:09:36,319
the totality of cannabis usage in terms

1672
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:37,880
of how it was used historically where I

1673
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:39,759
mean [ __ ] like we knew it was a thing

1674
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:42,239
but like when you go to Pakistan every

1675
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:46,000
single Farm Has a Field that they

1676
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:48,519
harvest for the seed for food and then

1677
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:51,880
the resin for medicine and you're and

1678
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:53,880
the seed is critical they stack [ __ ]

1679
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:56,079
bags of that [ __ ] up because they need

1680
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:58,440
it for the winter

1681
01:09:56,079 --> 01:10:01,279
so it's a it's it's a life-saving food

1682
01:09:58,439 --> 01:10:02,519
source in their world for two three

1683
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:05,158
th000

1684
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:07,600
years did you try any dishes that were

1685
01:10:05,158 --> 01:10:11,519
specifically uh designed around cannabis

1686
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:14,079
seeds no no we we ate cannabis seeds but

1687
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:16,880
they don't they don't have that same we

1688
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:18,920
do we weave all these things like and I

1689
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:21,239
would say you have like bong and stuff

1690
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:22,679
in India but that's just the milk milk

1691
01:10:21,238 --> 01:10:24,759
drink of that you're and honey that

1692
01:10:22,679 --> 01:10:25,840
you're drinking cannabis in but

1693
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:29,760
otherwise

1694
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:34,520
it was they integrated the smoking with

1695
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:36,520
the tea with the prayer so the the the

1696
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:38,600
the prayer was Heavy where like if

1697
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:40,600
because Pakistan's the the most Muslim

1698
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:44,239
country in the world and so you get to

1699
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:47,560
see people who are very religious

1700
01:10:44,238 --> 01:10:51,198
Believers of their faith and and how

1701
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:53,719
they enact it and how they practice it

1702
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:56,879
and the the the prayer is just to stop

1703
01:10:53,719 --> 01:10:59,119
and say than thank you and that I'm

1704
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:02,119
insignificant so it's a it's a it's a

1705
01:10:59,119 --> 01:11:04,439
moment of humility and then the t is

1706
01:11:02,119 --> 01:11:06,960
tranquility and then the Cannabis is is

1707
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:09,479
like uplifting changes your tone and so

1708
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:12,000
you notice through the course of a day

1709
01:11:09,479 --> 01:11:13,279
the prayer the the tea and the smoke all

1710
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:18,279
kind of went

1711
01:11:13,279 --> 01:11:20,599
together and they they wo it in in this

1712
01:11:18,279 --> 01:11:22,800
really seamless

1713
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:24,760
Manner and that was what was so

1714
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,880
fascinating was that they had it with

1715
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:28,880
them for so

1716
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:30,800
long that it was normal so like they

1717
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,640
didn't smoke flour but I mean there was

1718
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:35,039
nobody we bumped into that didn't have a

1719
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:38,400
[ __ ] ball Ash in their

1720
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:40,158
pocket I mean like it was really

1721
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:42,319
interesting I mean I got to smoke a lot

1722
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:44,799
of [ __ ] good Ash when I showed up

1723
01:11:42,319 --> 01:11:48,840
they had half a key for us so they had

1724
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:52,159
500 gram [ __ ] balls and then new me a

1725
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:55,000
p in numi man he had a a a [ __ ] bag

1726
01:11:52,158 --> 01:11:57,799
from Tia that was a goat ball right like

1727
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:00,600
goat ball hash they took the testicle

1728
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:01,960
ball sack off of a [ __ ] goat and they

1729
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:04,760
because that's that was the original

1730
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:06,840
Ziploc bag right so humans have been

1731
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:10,039
used whenever you see people drinking

1732
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:12,440
water in the past they were using like a

1733
01:12:10,039 --> 01:12:13,840
goat skin that was sealed and and they

1734
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:16,439
would carry it they would drink out of

1735
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:18,639
the goat now we consider that [ __ ] just

1736
01:12:16,439 --> 01:12:20,000
impossible well the reality was for

1737
01:12:18,639 --> 01:12:23,239
thousands of years you were drinking out

1738
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,198
of [ __ ] goat skin so the goat balls

1739
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:28,039
aren't fresh in the bag they've been

1740
01:12:25,198 --> 01:12:30,319
going for a while but the bag because of

1741
01:12:28,039 --> 01:12:33,359
the way it holds the temperature and it

1742
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:35,840
also has microbial life it interacts

1743
01:12:33,359 --> 01:12:38,359
with the hash and it's almost kind of

1744
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:40,039
like a semif ferment and and I've really

1745
01:12:38,359 --> 01:12:42,198
I've had people ferment stuff but I've

1746
01:12:40,039 --> 01:12:46,039
never been over to like maloi and try to

1747
01:12:42,198 --> 01:12:48,119
maloi cob in maloi so I don't know

1748
01:12:46,039 --> 01:12:50,000
you've never fermented a goat ball sack

1749
01:12:48,119 --> 01:12:51,800
before yeah they doing

1750
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,079
something but like you know you're

1751
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:55,480
cracking up and you're like I'm going to

1752
01:12:53,079 --> 01:12:57,359
smoke the goat ball hash and it was just

1753
01:12:55,479 --> 01:12:59,439
[ __ ] phenomenal right so you know

1754
01:12:57,359 --> 01:13:01,679
you're dying because we're showing

1755
01:12:59,439 --> 01:13:03,559
pictur this [ __ ] and all the new people

1756
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:06,600
in cannabis are losing their minds

1757
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:08,760
because nobody's wearing rubber gloves

1758
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:10,239
th this isn't sterile and clean how

1759
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,639
could these people survive and you're

1760
01:13:10,238 --> 01:13:13,638
like well they've been smoking this [ __ ]

1761
01:13:11,639 --> 01:13:15,960
for [ __ ] thousands of years I think

1762
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:18,760
if there was a rob' be dead by now

1763
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:20,679
[ __ ] kill it with fire it's crazy

1764
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,880
yeah it was it was just really just so

1765
01:13:20,679 --> 01:13:26,000
pure and

1766
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:27,600
simple and and and humbling you know and

1767
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,840
the the Muslim culture was really

1768
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,639
interesting because I've never really

1769
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:34,279
been exposed to

1770
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:36,679
it and the the way they approach

1771
01:13:34,279 --> 01:13:39,079
visitors and tourists and

1772
01:13:36,679 --> 01:13:42,359
strangers was one

1773
01:13:39,079 --> 01:13:44,238
of absolute reverence to the individual

1774
01:13:42,359 --> 01:13:45,960
so no matter where I went and so it

1775
01:13:44,238 --> 01:13:47,879
wasn't orchestrated because we [ __ ] we

1776
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:50,840
traveled 1300 miles you can't bribe

1777
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:53,279
everybody for 1300 miles so no matter

1778
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:55,719
where we went the locals that would bump

1779
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:57,198
into you were amazed that especially cuz

1780
01:13:55,719 --> 01:13:58,639
me cuz I'm [ __ ] white right they they

1781
01:13:57,198 --> 01:14:00,279
haven't seen a white person in 20

1782
01:13:58,639 --> 01:14:02,039
[ __ ] years like maybe some for some

1783
01:14:00,279 --> 01:14:03,439
of these people ever like they wanted to

1784
01:14:02,039 --> 01:14:07,119
touch you and see if the [ __ ] was coming

1785
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:08,879
off your arm yeah it was this purity of

1786
01:14:07,119 --> 01:14:10,479
like why are you here and I'm like oh

1787
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,679
I'm here to visit the country and and

1788
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:13,638
they're like and you're having a good

1789
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:14,800
time I said I'm having a great time and

1790
01:14:13,639 --> 01:14:17,960
it almost made them look that they were

1791
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:21,719
going to cry because they wanted to see

1792
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:23,158
the image of their country Change 911

1793
01:14:21,719 --> 01:14:25,880
[ __ ] them up when we you know Bin

1794
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:28,638
Laden was in the caves when we went to

1795
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:31,520
war and did all that that that reap that

1796
01:14:28,639 --> 01:14:34,039
Havoc it just destroyed the Pakistani

1797
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,800
economy and so many people had to leave

1798
01:14:34,039 --> 01:14:39,238
the

1799
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:42,239
country to go find survival and success

1800
01:14:39,238 --> 01:14:43,678
but they also are Pakistani and so years

1801
01:14:42,238 --> 01:14:45,839
later they can look back at their

1802
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:47,719
country and say wait a minute how do we

1803
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:50,719
do something for our native

1804
01:14:47,719 --> 01:14:52,600
home and that was how land race Pakistan

1805
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:55,760
and let's be friends Pakistan kind of

1806
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:59,719
came to existence was grown men who were

1807
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:01,679
sharp who are Pakistani by descent who

1808
01:14:59,719 --> 01:15:03,119
wanted to be able to do something

1809
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:06,639
positive for their country and their

1810
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:09,719
people and you could tell the purity of

1811
01:15:06,639 --> 01:15:11,560
the the desire from the way you were

1812
01:15:09,719 --> 01:15:13,840
treated and the way everyone around them

1813
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:16,560
was treated it was just it was a

1814
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:18,840
beautiful beautiful experience it really

1815
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,639
was it was it was 10 times greater than

1816
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:22,800
I thought it was going to be and I had

1817
01:15:20,639 --> 01:15:26,199
dreamt of walking in Pakistan my whole

1818
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:28,960
life you said that you filmed it um is

1819
01:15:26,198 --> 01:15:31,359
is that film is it being produced or is

1820
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:33,158
it already released no I'm not in

1821
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:35,039
control of the film part Danny Danny's

1822
01:15:33,158 --> 01:15:37,119
team did all the film work so he

1823
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:38,359
releases Clips but I believe at some

1824
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:39,960
point you know how it is when you do

1825
01:15:38,359 --> 01:15:42,479
film it's the

1826
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:43,639
editing that's brutal right when you

1827
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:46,879
when you when

1828
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:48,639
you with the podcast when you gotta edit

1829
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,520
down you gotta cut you gotta cut and

1830
01:15:48,639 --> 01:15:52,600
clip and break and then and then put it

1831
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:57,040
all together in a form that allows

1832
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:59,280
people to want the the the sit down time

1833
01:15:57,039 --> 01:16:01,800
it's it's comprehensive but

1834
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:04,800
Ralph brought they brought drones and

1835
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:06,960
the Drone footage is absolutely all

1836
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,840
inspiring like the quality of the

1837
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:11,920
footage that they took it was like Nat

1838
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:13,400
Geo level [ __ ] gorgeous because is a

1839
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:17,560
really really talented filmmaker and

1840
01:16:13,399 --> 01:16:20,719
so's John he he's uh read films online

1841
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:22,880
and he just got an award for his um his

1842
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:25,560
uh short he's been doing some like

1843
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:27,800
horror shorts and he's doing good man

1844
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:31,080
he's a talented young guy and so you had

1845
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:33,320
and and Danny Danny's infectious with

1846
01:16:31,079 --> 01:16:34,800
his enthusiasm for what he does and so

1847
01:16:33,319 --> 01:16:38,759
what you had was you had a really good

1848
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:40,880
like media team capturing it so I know

1849
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:42,400
at some point it'll come out and what

1850
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:45,279
we've tried to do is just basically

1851
01:16:42,399 --> 01:16:47,238
anytime they release a clip then we just

1852
01:16:45,279 --> 01:16:49,920
all Network up to push it out so people

1853
01:16:47,238 --> 01:16:51,959
can get a view of these regions in a way

1854
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:54,960
that you normally can't are there some

1855
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:57,399
of these clips on your Instagram or um

1856
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:59,920
can go to and I would say go to GW smoke

1857
01:16:57,399 --> 01:17:03,279
break and then and then there's if you

1858
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:05,399
go over to um what I'll do too is I'll

1859
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:06,920
I'll share you over um a deal you can

1860
01:17:05,399 --> 01:17:08,519
send me the link later and I'll add it

1861
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,679
to the show one of the guys that we were

1862
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:11,880
with there is a professional

1863
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:13,560
photographer really talented so a lot of

1864
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:16,159
the stuff you see me sharing all the

1865
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:20,039
time that's him sending me footage of

1866
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:21,399
him exploring Pakistan cool and so I

1867
01:17:20,039 --> 01:17:24,639
just told the guys I said yeah let's

1868
01:17:21,399 --> 01:17:26,198
just create this this window so that

1869
01:17:24,639 --> 01:17:29,359
people who want to see something

1870
01:17:26,198 --> 01:17:31,719
beautiful Ken and then we did the

1871
01:17:29,359 --> 01:17:33,359
collection I gathered up all the stock

1872
01:17:31,719 --> 01:17:36,480
for him and it was beautiful we got to

1873
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:39,198
do it as a team right so it was talented

1874
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:41,839
pakistanis Europeans and myself all

1875
01:17:39,198 --> 01:17:46,678
looking for outliers out of all these

1876
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:49,480
fields and then I was able to get uh the

1877
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:50,960
a chunk of the collection sent back and

1878
01:17:49,479 --> 01:17:52,359
I was able to give it out and provide it

1879
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:54,000
to people and so I brought a bunch of it

1880
01:17:52,359 --> 01:17:56,479
to the high te but I I gave it out all

1881
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:00,399
over the place so that people could get

1882
01:17:56,479 --> 01:18:03,439
access to things that you normally can't

1883
01:18:00,399 --> 01:18:06,158
and you get to experience a world that

1884
01:18:03,439 --> 01:18:08,719
doesn't exist today in terms of flavor

1885
01:18:06,158 --> 01:18:10,799
profile so it gives you what I always

1886
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:12,840
call like new paint it gives you new

1887
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:15,760
paint to be able to work on things that

1888
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:18,079
are existing and work like and we'll use

1889
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:20,079
like the Oreo clone right so the Oreo

1890
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:22,679
clone is probably one of the best plants

1891
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:25,760
you could ever grow in

1892
01:18:22,679 --> 01:18:29,600
every it it just does it grows as well

1893
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:31,800
but it's kind of bland and so it has

1894
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:34,239
incredible agronomic

1895
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:36,960
qualities but it's kind of like purple

1896
01:18:34,238 --> 01:18:39,919
punch purple punch is a sexy sexy girl

1897
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:42,679
but she's got no flavor I think purple

1898
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:44,760
punch has no flavor but I think Oreos is

1899
01:18:42,679 --> 01:18:47,520
nice I think Oreos is

1900
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:51,239
underappreciated I like Oreos as a light

1901
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:53,239
smoke but if we looked at it as a how

1902
01:18:51,238 --> 01:18:55,279
does the market look at it right bigger

1903
01:18:53,238 --> 01:18:57,919
picture than just me and you

1904
01:18:55,279 --> 01:19:00,960
low on the appreciation people don't

1905
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:03,000
like it so I like a lot of stuff people

1906
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:05,639
don't like though yeah but that's okay

1907
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:08,840
what we do is we use those products that

1908
01:19:05,639 --> 01:19:11,359
carry such incredible traits and then we

1909
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:12,920
repaint them so when your house looks

1910
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:15,880
like [ __ ] you don't burn it the [ __ ]

1911
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:17,840
down you just repaint it and I think

1912
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:20,000
that that's the way you approach

1913
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:23,319
genetics is that what we've done now is

1914
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:26,600
we've steered towards agronomics and

1915
01:19:23,319 --> 01:19:28,840
coas more than we've steered towards

1916
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:32,719
experience because the vast number of

1917
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:35,319
people who shop shop off of price and

1918
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:38,359
potency so when the metrics of purchase

1919
01:19:35,319 --> 01:19:40,158
of price and potency the majority and

1920
01:19:38,359 --> 01:19:41,960
and I'd say everybody does it but no

1921
01:19:40,158 --> 01:19:45,679
[ __ ] majority

1922
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:47,920
do that changes what fits into the

1923
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:50,719
system and when you're trying to pitch

1924
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:52,719
money to build an operation you got to

1925
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:55,359
let these people know you're gonna get a

1926
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:57,600
100 grams per square you're going to get

1927
01:19:55,359 --> 01:20:00,920
it every 62 days or they don't give you

1928
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:04,440
the money so once you commit to

1929
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:06,079
this process you're kind of stuck in it

1930
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:09,638
and what it does it only there's only so

1931
01:20:06,079 --> 01:20:11,719
many cultivars that give you 29% in 62

1932
01:20:09,639 --> 01:20:13,079
days that the market will take and and

1933
01:20:11,719 --> 01:20:14,679
then then the buyer has to be able to

1934
01:20:13,079 --> 01:20:18,000
put it on Instagram too or otherwise

1935
01:20:14,679 --> 01:20:19,880
it's not [ __ ] real so you take all

1936
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,880
these new varieties that have been

1937
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:26,800
steered and pushed and you bring back in

1938
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:28,639
the Vigor you bring back in and outcross

1939
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:31,560
from separate genes genes that are

1940
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:34,279
completely unrelated and you get in my

1941
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:39,000
opinion a degree of like semiosis you

1942
01:20:34,279 --> 01:20:41,158
get a a higher level of vigor right so

1943
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,399
it's not true F1 because they're not

1944
01:20:41,158 --> 01:20:44,960
inbred lines right so your line and this

1945
01:20:43,399 --> 01:20:47,839
line isn't inbred but genetically

1946
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:49,800
they're as [ __ ] far apart as you get

1947
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:51,920
and what it does it allows you to start

1948
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:56,239
to see

1949
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:58,719
what the things from Pakistan part to

1950
01:20:56,238 --> 01:21:00,718
the things that we have now and when I

1951
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:02,840
use these tools over the last couple

1952
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:06,719
years you know what I get out of it

1953
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:09,480
almost always is a way better um water

1954
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:12,679
usage where the plant only has to water

1955
01:21:09,479 --> 01:21:15,599
half as often as it did prior so the the

1956
01:21:12,679 --> 01:21:18,039
uptake mechanism changes dramatically I

1957
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:21,400
get an ability to produce at a lower

1958
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:23,519
food load so the plants have been built

1959
01:21:21,399 --> 01:21:26,638
on Lower humus levels because really

1960
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:29,480
it's this this calcium rich

1961
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:31,960
Sandy I'd say Sandy LOM but it's like

1962
01:21:29,479 --> 01:21:34,919
Sandy Lish clay it's this gritty man the

1963
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:37,039
soil is gritty it's all it's all Glacier

1964
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:39,480
so very little biological matter to give

1965
01:21:37,039 --> 01:21:42,519
you nitrogen so

1966
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:44,359
nitrogen nitrogen you get it from animal

1967
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:47,320
deposition when they take the fields and

1968
01:21:44,359 --> 01:21:48,799
compost but but where's your where is

1969
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:50,158
all your biological material that's

1970
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:53,320
going to break down and form it you

1971
01:21:50,158 --> 01:21:57,759
don't have it so the plants adapt to

1972
01:21:53,319 --> 01:22:02,439
that and I also see um better cold

1973
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:04,119
hardiness and I also see um uh profiles

1974
01:22:02,439 --> 01:22:08,198
that we just don't

1975
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:10,158
have so the ability to create a profile

1976
01:22:08,198 --> 01:22:13,279
that's a chokey sulfur that when you

1977
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:15,799
smoke it that [ __ ] is grabbing you and

1978
01:22:13,279 --> 01:22:17,158
shaking you like a dog and you're not

1979
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:20,119
going oh I'm gonna take another one

1980
01:22:17,158 --> 01:22:22,000
you're trying to find oxygen in the room

1981
01:22:20,119 --> 01:22:24,519
and your nose and your mouth is you're

1982
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,039
running that kind of stuff is like old

1983
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:29,560
School experience for when you're a kid

1984
01:22:27,039 --> 01:22:32,719
and that's kind of what I get out of the

1985
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:35,520
hybridization using it and so I do pure

1986
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:37,880
preservation where I take and if you're

1987
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:39,960
doing preservation for anything that's

1988
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:42,880
like this you really need like 10,000

1989
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:45,319
plants so I know that these aren't true

1990
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:48,079
preservations they're steered

1991
01:22:45,319 --> 01:22:50,920
preservations but at least we're holding

1992
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:53,439
something and we're able now to be able

1993
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:56,920
to connect like the farmers of gazy

1994
01:22:53,439 --> 01:22:59,879
Afghanistan people in Oregon the farmers

1995
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:02,239
from from nager Valley Pakistan to the

1996
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:06,239
people in southern humble you know that

1997
01:23:02,238 --> 01:23:08,479
this is where this came from and the the

1998
01:23:06,238 --> 01:23:10,000
ability for you to use it as a tool is

1999
01:23:08,479 --> 01:23:11,919
critical and the only way that you can

2000
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,840
really hold things is in

2001
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:15,480
seed right because if you're holding

2002
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:17,920
cologne the idea of holding cologne

2003
01:23:15,479 --> 01:23:19,238
forever do that [ __ ] your whole life and

2004
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,480
tell me that's how you want to spend

2005
01:23:19,238 --> 01:23:23,718
your whole life where you never-endingly

2006
01:23:21,479 --> 01:23:26,039
have a [ __ ] house full of plants that

2007
01:23:23,719 --> 01:23:28,079
are priceless that must be tended

2008
01:23:26,039 --> 01:23:32,039
continuously how many times you gone on

2009
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:33,559
vacation how many times you it it's like

2010
01:23:32,039 --> 01:23:35,399
I've been doing my whole life that's

2011
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:37,440
what got me into commercial Nursery work

2012
01:23:35,399 --> 01:23:39,079
it's what we got me into cryo banking

2013
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:41,319
it's what the the basis of the Grateful

2014
01:23:39,079 --> 01:23:44,399
head is it's this idea that I just

2015
01:23:41,319 --> 01:23:49,559
[ __ ] do not want to hold plants at

2016
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:51,920
scale personally and so we can S1 stuff

2017
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:54,800
but you're having the [ __ ] genetic

2018
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:56,560
and and selfing is fine when we're doing

2019
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:58,560
we're steering for production needs

2020
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:00,600
we're trying to create breeding lines

2021
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:04,000
but for preservation you want as much

2022
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:06,800
gene pool as possible and what I learned

2023
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,238
from the the pakistanis and the afghanis

2024
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:11,079
which and I also learned that from a

2025
01:24:08,238 --> 01:24:15,638
redwood propagator which really changed

2026
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:18,079
my view of preservation was that you you

2027
01:24:15,639 --> 01:24:20,440
you have to make selection but you have

2028
01:24:18,079 --> 01:24:21,960
to include as much as material as

2029
01:24:20,439 --> 01:24:24,759
possible because you don't know where

2030
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:28,920
the alals that are needed for resistance

2031
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:32,719
in a problem in the future live so when

2032
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:34,520
you start to narrow a line your it's

2033
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:36,960
it's kind of like genetic drift right

2034
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:39,760
but it's accidental genetic drift is

2035
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:41,800
where you and I are breeding a project

2036
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:44,880
and we have traits of interest that are

2037
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:48,719
are are Focus over the course of the

2038
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:52,760
project we lose focus and we start to

2039
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:54,960
move the selection away from those

2040
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:56,600
original selections

2041
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:58,480
and what happens over the course of so

2042
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:01,280
many years is the thing that you're

2043
01:24:58,479 --> 01:25:03,359
working with is the same gene pool but

2044
01:25:01,279 --> 01:25:05,118
the traits that you wanted are no longer

2045
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:06,759
present that that [ __ ] isn't in it so

2046
01:25:05,118 --> 01:25:08,439
people like you could take anything and

2047
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:11,159
get anything out of it I'm like no you

2048
01:25:08,439 --> 01:25:12,799
[ __ ] can't it doesn't work that way

2049
01:25:11,158 --> 01:25:14,519
if that shit's not present anymore

2050
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:17,119
because in the Gene transferral and

2051
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:18,040
movement of the breeding it left it's

2052
01:25:17,118 --> 01:25:20,960
not

2053
01:25:18,039 --> 01:25:22,719
present so what we want to be able to do

2054
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:25,359
is have as much as possible so the way

2055
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:26,760
the pakistanis worked it is even if they

2056
01:25:25,359 --> 01:25:29,759
have let me get this plugin so we don't

2057
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:32,920
lose power even if they had their

2058
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:35,360
favorite plant right they didn't just

2059
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:39,520
use the favorite plant they just threw

2060
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:40,359
in one or two more handfuls of seed into

2061
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:44,719
the

2062
01:25:40,359 --> 01:25:46,639
bag so every female yielded seeds but

2063
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:49,480
they would just always throw a little

2064
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:52,000
bit more of their favorite [ __ ] so they

2065
01:25:49,479 --> 01:25:55,000
had a little more of their favorite [ __ ]

2066
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:57,359
cycling through but what they know is

2067
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:59,840
that when you make a mistake with

2068
01:25:57,359 --> 01:26:02,279
Agriculture and you focus on agronomics

2069
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:04,400
and you don't focus on survivability

2070
01:26:02,279 --> 01:26:06,759
what you get is [ __ ]

2071
01:26:04,399 --> 01:26:08,839
starvation and so it was this really

2072
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:11,320
really clear picture where for the first

2073
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:13,639
time I could see it in person and it was

2074
01:26:11,319 --> 01:26:16,198
the same with sharing jeans no farmer

2075
01:26:13,639 --> 01:26:18,960
hoarded anything if your neighbor wanted

2076
01:26:16,198 --> 01:26:21,238
your [ __ ] they got it if there was

2077
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:23,800
better genes in Afghanistan and similar

2078
01:26:21,238 --> 01:26:26,198
regions they brought it in it didn't

2079
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:28,119
make a difference nobody hoarded each

2080
01:26:26,198 --> 01:26:31,279
person every village I'm like what's

2081
01:26:28,118 --> 01:26:34,158
your lines and they said oh we have we

2082
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:37,118
have just common Gene poool and we share

2083
01:26:34,158 --> 01:26:40,279
and we always try to steer towards best

2084
01:26:37,118 --> 01:26:42,479
diversity best outcome you know what

2085
01:26:40,279 --> 01:26:44,800
this this is because in these kind of

2086
01:26:42,479 --> 01:26:47,599
cultures everybody relies on the

2087
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:49,279
neighbor everybody relies this is the

2088
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:51,719
survival in this regions you cannot

2089
01:26:49,279 --> 01:26:53,920
survive without being uh you know

2090
01:26:51,719 --> 01:26:57,198
normally this is not the Western culture

2091
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:59,279
and culture means like you have your

2092
01:26:57,198 --> 01:27:01,799
door closed and lock down but in these

2093
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:04,679
cultures like also my culture was like

2094
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:07,320
this in Yugoslavia even now we don't

2095
01:27:04,679 --> 01:27:08,760
have our door locked yeah we we have a

2096
01:27:07,319 --> 01:27:11,279
very different

2097
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:14,239
culture all right questions this way

2098
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:17,719
this way other we're just running on oh

2099
01:27:14,238 --> 01:27:21,198
man you honestly we're talking about it

2100
01:27:17,719 --> 01:27:23,439
and you know you're similar to Michael

2101
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:27,319
wolf seagull that you talk and you don't

2102
01:27:23,439 --> 01:27:28,678
breathe but honestly for us this is

2103
01:27:27,319 --> 01:27:30,359
great we're just sitting on the couch

2104
01:27:28,679 --> 01:27:32,560
listening to you and and even when I

2105
01:27:30,359 --> 01:27:34,359
want to ask a question I realize I

2106
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:36,320
should probably just shut up because if

2107
01:27:34,359 --> 01:27:38,479
I say anything I'm just going to throw

2108
01:27:36,319 --> 01:27:41,198
you oh we lost him

2109
01:27:38,479 --> 01:27:43,079
again due the technical

2110
01:27:41,198 --> 01:27:46,479
