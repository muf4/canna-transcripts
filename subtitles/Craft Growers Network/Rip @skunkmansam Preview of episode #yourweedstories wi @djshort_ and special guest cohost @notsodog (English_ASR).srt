00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:19,920
what's up everybody and welcome to your

3
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,598
weed stories on the craft Growers

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,920
Network today we're super excited to

5
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:28,640
have what I am comfortable calling a

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,760
legend in cannabis as well his name is

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:38,520
DJ Short he's one of the most well-known

8
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:40,599
breeders from the US from the past so um

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,359
like I said he was responsible for the

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,520
blueberry and the flow and we're super

11
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:47,558
excited to have him on the show so

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,079
welcome

13
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:53,159
DJ hey thank you great to be here thanks

14
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,359
and before we started I wanted to take a

15
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,518
moment to acknowledge that this week we

16
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:01,160
lost skunkman

17
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:03,198
Sam and

18
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:06,840
you know

19
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:08,319
he's he's a very what is it called when

20
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,079
people want to choose one side or the

21
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:15,000
other polarizing polarizing figure

22
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:17,798
exactly thank you Francis he's my uh my

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,519
dictionary he's a very polarizing figure

24
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:22,320
as is Neville I think a lot of people

25
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,319
have felt throughout the last years that

26
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,758
they either have to choose one side or

27
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:30,000
the other and frankly I think that

28
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:33,280
they've both contributed tremendously to

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,599
our community and they should both be

30
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,478
honored and you know I I don't think now

31
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,798
is the time to discuss any controversies

32
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:47,599
I think that we need to all send our

33
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:50,479
best wishes to their families and you

34
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:53,478
know for a second just think about he

35
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:56,319
did make tremendous contributions to our

36
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:58,640
cannabis community and uh NATO dog you

37
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,599
were saying something before we started

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,399
I think uh it's a valid point that if

39
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,798
you want to say it again yeah I mean

40
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,359
well I'll do two points one I was

41
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,039
talking to a friend and I kind of feel

42
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:13,400
like Neville was sort of like the the

43
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:17,359
Johnny apple seed of our community right

44
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:21,360
and uh Sam skunkman and Rob Clark were

45
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:25,200
sort of like the Luther bbanks in a way

46
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,000
um because you know Neville was the

47
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,598
first person where you could just like I

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,680
mean and Gabby and I did this a ton you

49
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:32,919
could open up a catalog and there was an

50
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,640
order sheet and you could write down

51
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:37,079
what you wanted and you could send that

52
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:39,479
dude money and you could get seeds and

53
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,800
that was impossible before you had to

54
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:45,079
know someone right uh Neville was the

55
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,319
first person where it was like here's a

56
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:53,519
catalog right and here's an address you

57
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:55,359
know and um and so he made it very very

58
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,920
much easier to get

59
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,840
seed you know because before it was

60
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,280
really a who you know m you know you had

61
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,080
to know someone you had to know someone

62
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,919
in your little circle uh and Sam didn't

63
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,599
do that he was a bit different but he

64
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,798
did when he was fleeing persecution in

65
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:15,839
America he did bring an enormous amount

66
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:17,640
of genetics um that he both had worked

67
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,400
on and things he had gotten from his

68
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:22,119
friends over to Europe and then when

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,480
those things blended with what the

70
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,360
Europeans were doing that was sort of

71
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,719
the

72
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,959
foundation for all these you know like

73
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,680
me or Gabby or kids looking through

74
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,400
cataloges and being like ooh there's

75
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,159
there's people of a certain generation

76
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,599
that have all those first cataloges

77
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:42,798
almost memorized because you would sit

78
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:45,919
there and smoke a joint and read and

79
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,640
dream you know and uh so those guys

80
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:53,518
created a lot of

81
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:56,438
dreams and um you know I mean I think uh

82
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,239
you know there's uh yeah there's there's

83
00:03:56,438 --> 00:04:00,639
controversy and stuff like that but I

84
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,519
think that I think that when somebody

85
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,719
passes or something like that they have

86
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,000
they have you know maybe they wives

87
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:10,079
children loved ones friends people that

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,598
have known them forever and we're all

89
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,400
flawed so it's better to focus on what

90
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:16,879
people's contributions were what the

91
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,478
positive things about you know people's

92
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:22,399
lives were and uh it's all easy to tear

93
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,279
each other down it's a lot better I

94
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,918
think to like lift each other

95
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:29,519
up and so that's kind of uh that's all I

96
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:31,758
have to say about the Vietnam War uh

97
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,120
thank but but I will say and then we

98
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,720
won't touch on it when I first went to

99
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:40,879
Amsterdam like you know there are beefs

100
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,759
in cannabis there are conflicts and I

101
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,959
would say that like that was one of the

102
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:48,080
oldest ones and so we weren't there we

103
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:50,719
don't have to rehash it but um we can be

104
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:54,359
a cantankerous bunch and we don't all

105
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,880
get along all the time you know so kind

106
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,600
of like Sasha our Slovenian Hobbit Sam

107
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:04,478
was a bit of a Hobbit you know he he

108
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:07,960
wasn't in the public eye and

109
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:12,199
so I think it's kind of unfair

110
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:14,399
to to even try to choose sides when most

111
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:17,560
of us don't even know a fraction of the

112
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:20,879
story you know we just know what the

113
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:23,478
people that were more vocal said from

114
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,319
from our perspective right basically

115
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:29,879
everybody in this room both Sam and Sam

116
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:32,280
and uh and Neville did a whole bunch to

117
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:33,680
make good genetics more accessible to a

118
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:37,679
lot more

119
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,360
people and they played a huge role in

120
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,800
that they really did I think there's no

121
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,960
denying that well I'll say on you know I

122
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,639
got my first copy of that catalog it was

123
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,439
a mograph

124
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,360
sheets right just just standard paper

125
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,800
sized with the list on there I think

126
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:59,639
they were what 30 bucks for 10

127
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:02,360
seeds and at the time I was I I

128
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,800
understood the value of the land race uh

129
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,919
genetics I had some friends that were

130
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,598
going over to Amsterdam Europe other

131
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:12,240
places and always put feelers out say

132
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:14,159
hey find me these land race but it was

133
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,038
right around that era that they

134
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,439
disappeared pretty much everything they

135
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:22,159
were selling was some cross they did

136
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:26,319
they weren't selling the bag seed per se

137
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:29,720
um collected from country of origin

138
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,800
so that little um

139
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,240
ju or what do you call it bifurcation in

140
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:38,280
the road where making our own seed as

141
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,478
opposed to land race kind of happened in

142
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:42,119
that

143
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:45,279
era so that's just another little little

144
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,280
side point to that like I said I I tried

145
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:50,198
but I wasn't interested in in other

146
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:53,198
people's work I saw the the the flaw in

147
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:56,120
that or I saw the value in in those land

148
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,919
races and that became the focus at the

149
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,079
time but they weren't selling like I

150
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:04,159
said land race uh

151
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,159
varieties straight from the country
