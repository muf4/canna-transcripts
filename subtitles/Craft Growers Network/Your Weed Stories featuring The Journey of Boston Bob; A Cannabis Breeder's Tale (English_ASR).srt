15
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:57,280
just want to say a couple of

16
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,439
words um we're recording this on New

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,039
Year's

18
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:04,118
Eve and

19
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,680
I had gotten a message from

20
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:10,319
Bob that he wanted or that he enjoyed

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,080
the show and that you know if we wanted

22
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:15,758
to have him on the show that uh he'd

23
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:17,478
love to do it and when I asked him a

24
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,159
little background about himself and I'm

25
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:22,719
going to read this he says I'm a hobby

26
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,880
breeder I release seeds through FCP with

27
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,719
all proceeds going to Peter for the good

28
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:29,599
work he does been doing podcasts for a

29
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,118
couple years main focus is on projects

30
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:34,839
and methodology I tried to share for

31
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:38,438
small Growers um he'll said I smoked in

32
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,799
the 70s hint at my age U my first IG

33
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:42,879
account closed two years ago with 900

34
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,439
picks and 15,000

35
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:48,839
followers and so the first thing I

36
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:52,239
thought to myself was you know this is

37
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:57,719
great because I've been having some

38
00:01:52,239 --> 00:02:00,919
major players on the show like um Kevin

39
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:05,359
JRE and Michael will seagull who I think

40
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:07,679
is super important and I wanted to try

41
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,878
to have some

42
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:13,560
smaller um

43
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:16,439
more I would say you know regular people

44
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,680
doing the show so we agreed and we

45
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:23,759
scheduled it then yesterday I called Bob

46
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:27,920
up you know just to SK you know talk a

47
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:32,079
little bit before the um the podcast

48
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:35,159
today and I didn't want to get too much

49
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,120
information um because I like to be

50
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:40,280
surprised when I do the podcasts I like

51
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,800
my reactions to be genuine I don't want

52
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,439
him to retell a story but he did start

53
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,280
to tell me a few

54
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:54,719
things and I have to say I was just

55
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:58,199
blown away and while um Bob may not be

56
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:00,000
as well known as Kevin JRE or some of

57
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:03,439
the other people that were going going

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,280
to interview on this

59
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:08,878
podcast he seems like an amazing person

60
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,759
with a compelling story and so I know

61
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:16,518
you guys are going to enjoy it Bob is a

62
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:19,598
professional and he does not um he does

63
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:23,239
not sell cannabis everything that he

64
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:26,439
grows he gives away and because he's a

65
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:29,799
professional he wants to stay Anonymous

66
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:31,598
so we are not going to show Bob's face

67
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,120

68

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,480
first cannabis exper experiences you

00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:17,639
cool things you're doing today with

84
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,879
breeding and you know I don't want to

85
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,799
give up too much yeah and then we'll get

86
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:24,040
it to males because I like how we we

87
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:26,519

88
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:30,400
conversation yeah we're going to the

89
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:34,038
conversation will will weave in that out

90
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:37,599
wherever you want so I guess the very

91
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:40,839
beginning um I probably SM not probably

92
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,360
cuz I know I did I smoked weed in

93
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:47,679
1970 so I was in seventh

94
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:53,160
grade I was in private

95
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:55,439
school and uh it was more a school

96
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,800
for wealthy

97
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,160
delinquents so and my parents didn't

98
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,879
have money so my grandparents paid and I

99
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,320
get sent to private school and I smoked

100
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,519
weed in seventh

101
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:09,759
grade and

102
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:12,599
actually uh I got

103
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,919
caught I got

104
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,639
suspended I told my mother it's the

105
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:19,439
first time I have a smoke pot and I

106
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:23,319
can't believe I got caught the first

107
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,719
time uh I went back to that school and

108
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:28,680
then in eighth

109
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,319
grade I got caught again with four other

110
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,400
people

111
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,160
they let the other four people back into

112
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:37,439
school and I got kicked out

113
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,199
permanently and I told my mother I can't

114
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,038
believe only the second time I smoked

115
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,120
pot I got caught

116
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:46,038
again so I'm I'm thinking she probably

117
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,680
didn't believe it but you know I was a

118
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:54,199
kid was it true no absolutely

119
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:57,160
not I was smoking weed all the time um

120
00:05:54,199 --> 00:06:00,560
it it it was a very early introduction

121
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,199
so and back in those days

122
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,000
we weren't even getting really brick

123
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:10,199
weed um we got Panama red and aaoca gold

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,598
those are probably the two main

125
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,120
strains or they didn't even have names

126
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:17,959
for strains back then but we were

127
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,120
smoking Panama Red aapco Gold on

128
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:22,519
occasion if stuff was really dry you'd

129
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,879
get some brick weed but brick weed for

130
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:27,918
me uh didn't come till later so we

131
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:30,038
always smoked pretty good weed and back

132
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,918
in the day

133
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:33,879
uh at least on the East Coast it was

134
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,879
called a lid and it was either

135
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:39,360
four-finger lid or a FiveFinger lid and

136
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:43,279
for me it was 15 bucks cuz it was Panama

137
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,879
Red and that's what we smoked so that

138
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:48,799
was the beginning for me

139
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:50,199
um and then you know going through high

140
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,639
school and that kind of stuff and then

141
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:53,639
out of high school and into my

142
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:57,478
20s I think for a while I was a pretty

143
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,479
good wake and

144
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:01,478
Baker um

145
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,959
yeah I think another turning point was I

146
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:10,318
think I was

147
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:12,198
a sophomore in high school so that would

148
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,840
have been about

149
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:18,280
74 I bought my first

150
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:19,318
pound uh it was Mexican brick I paid $90

151
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:23,679
for the

152
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:26,319
pound so um that that was my Early

153
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,120
Adventures as a young age and I smoked

154
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,720
quite a bit and and then frankly in my

155
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,680
mid 20s I I kind of get out of it and I

156
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,879
was out of the game for 25

157
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,959
years um you stopped smoking Canabis for

158
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:43,280
25 years I smoke a couple times a year

159
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:46,318
that was it but I went I literally went

160
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:49,638
from you know I'd smoke in bed before I

161
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,960
got out of bed and then in my mid 20s it

162
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:55,000
was um I I had different focuses and I

163
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,318
just kind of gradually stopped smoking

164
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,959
wheat and back in you know when I was in

165
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,560
high school I had some plants in a

166
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:04,560
closet you know who who knows if I even

167
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,759
knew what 1212 meant back then um but I

168
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,280
was trying to grow weed and I grew it in

169
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:12,120
in the in my basement Closet in in my

170
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:16,359
mother's house what year was this

171
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:20,000
approximately oh 74 and

172
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,639
75 and what were you using for light oh

173
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,560
just a flour just a

174
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:27,879
lamp just just a lamp hung upside down

175
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,918
in the closet keeping it on I mean I

176
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,000
honestly I don't even remember smoke any

177
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:34,838
of it I just remember trying to grow it

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,080
get it in the closet

179
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:40,919
um you know cuz there was always seeds

180
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,320
right you you you any weed you got had

181
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:45,000
seeds in it I think the other thing that

182
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,399
I remember and I remember this very

183
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
distinctly CU it was

184
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,360
probably

185
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,240
1971 or

186
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:58,360
72 I smoked my first

187
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,200
cinia didn't have a name the only thing

188
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,000
that today that I can think of that

189
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,800
looks like it is like Fruity Pebbles

190
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,240
like it looked like Fruity Pebbles all

191
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,120
the other stuff was you know Panama Red

192
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,759
was dark green with a little bit of red

193
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,639
hint the aaoca gold was you know green

194
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:17,679
gold weed it it was always pretty

195
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:20,838
consistent in terms of the color through

196
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:23,399
the whole bag and then somebody got this

197
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,399
weed and all we called it it was just

198
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,078
called camir at the time and it was had

199
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,839
some Reds in it had a little bit of

200
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:33,159
yellows and greens I I mean it was

201
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:36,120
really goodlook weed it was very upwe it

202
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:38,679
wasn't indicia so you know worst case it

203
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,399
was a sativa hybrid back then and the

204
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:42,838
only thing we knew was it came from the

205
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,399
Pacific Northwest so that was the first

206
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:48,399
time I ever smoked Cinema had no

207
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,720
obviously no seeds in it the weed was

208
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:54,679
unbelievable I still remember it today

209
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,720
um yeah it was really really nice and

210
00:09:54,679 --> 00:10:00,199
that was it's either the end of 71 or

211
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,839
the beginning of 72

212
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,360
so that was a big change for

213
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,519
me so then I guess my real

214
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:13,600
reintroduction was

215
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:16,759
probably 10 years ago 2014 2015 I was

216
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,600
out in Denver I forget the name of the

217
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:20,919
dispensary but I bought a strain called

218
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,720
Cindy

219
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:27,559
White

220
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:31,839
and it was unbelievable weat just

221
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:34,879
absolutely loved it up happy High

222
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:39,000
clear um and it made me

223
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:42,480
realize that I could grow weed and make

224
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,879
weed in in any direction I wanted

225
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,000
because of the different stuff out there

226
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:49,320
so that's when I kind of Dove back in so

227
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,720
it's probably been 10 years almost 10

228
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:55,920
years um and then I just started

229
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,680
collecting I just you know I I did a

230
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,919
bunch of emerald cups and met a whole

231
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,519
bunch of people

232
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,799
uh did

233
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,039
Instagram

234
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:09,159
um and and really just started

235
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:11,838
collecting and building a library right

236
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:15,439
so honestly I probably

237
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,440
have 300

238
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:20,799
strains and what I do is if I'm bre if

239
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:23,559
I'm doing breeding or I'm doing a

240
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:26,240
project they all revolve around a line

241
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:28,359
or two lines I want to bring together so

242
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,959
I've got this huge library and then in

243
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,720
addition I I'm not even I don't do a ton

244
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:36,479
of seeds anymore unless I'm doing some

245
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,160
kind of hunt um because somebody else

246
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,360
will have done the work and picked a

247
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:43,600
really good cultivar so I can use a cut

248
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,480
of that cultivar which we can talk about

249
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,159
a little later on from different people

250
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,680
out in the you know in the community so

251
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:52,759
somebody else has done that work and

252
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:55,799
I've done that myself I've I've got a

253
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:58,240
few strains where you know I find a

254
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:01,078
really really good plant and I've passed

255
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,839
the P plant out to to a couple people um

256
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:05,479
like you mentioned before I don't sell

257
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:07,200
anything so I don't put any restrictions

258
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,839
on it people can do whatever they want

259
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,200
with it good plant's a good plant and I

260
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,959
wouldn't have been able to do some of

261
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,959
the stuff I've done if people didn't

262
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:19,159
give me good plants so I I I try to keep

263
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:24,479
that Circle

264
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:27,799
going um I an interesting story so it's

265
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,278
got to be at least five or six years ago

266
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:31,958
I'm on Instagram I've got you know

267
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:34,439
15,000

268
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:37,958
followers you know a bunch of kids a

269
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,560
bunch of you know it it was a it was a

270
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:41,319
you know it's a it's a good amount of

271
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:43,799
following but that was not my intent

272
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:47,560
like I mentioned to to you the other

273
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:49,278
day Instagram is my notebook right I'm

274
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:51,518
getting older and it's easier to forget

275
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,159
so instead of my notepads and in

276
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,519
addition to my notepads where I'm

277
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:58,078
keeping track of everything and and and

278
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,959
and writing everything down when I do

279
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:01,439
something I post it on Instagram so it's

280
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,159
a lot easier than digging through

281
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,480
notebooks I just flip back through the

282
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:07,719
pictures and I'm like okay I did this

283
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,680
then this went in flower then this is

284
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,480
how many days I have left so I I like

285
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:15,799
Instagram because it's like my video

286
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,480
note or you know actually it is it's my

287
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:22,000
video notebook but

288
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,639
so uh show the I sent you one picture of

289
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,600
the plant in a

290
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:31,320
basement it's the last one I sent

291
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:34,519
um it said I think three number one or

292
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:40,760
basically it's a it's it's an almost 8ot

293
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:44,440
plant and that plant is pr1 Panama

294
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:47,480
Red so what happened is that a male or

295
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:51,800
is it a female yeah that's a male oh my

296
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:54,519
God yeah we I we were joke I I I posted

297
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:56,278
it when when I opened my new Instagram

298
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:59,919
account a year or two ago I put that as

299
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:02,320
one of the first pictures um but

300
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,719
what happened with so it's a it won't be

301
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:09,480
too long

302
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,480
but I was at the emerald Cup in

303
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:15,039
2016 and spent a bunch of time with John

304
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:19,240
at snow High

305
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:22,719
seats and Snow's always had some really

306
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,600
good land race stuff right he he likes

307
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,879
the esoteric long

308
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:31,240
flowering so you know we we hung out for

309
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:32,838
a pretty good amount um really enjoyed

310
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,799
talking to him we've done a couple

311
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:38,560
things back and forth since then but

312
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:40,319
what he did was he gave me a bud of

313
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:44,159
Panama

314
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:48,360
Red and on the bud it ended up I think

315
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:51,719
there were almost 40 seats so we did one

316
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:54,720
grow and it was good I mean it wasn't

317
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:59,759
special but it was good and then we did

318
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:02,759
another grow and I picked a mail which

319
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:05,278
was panar red 4 just you know notes for

320
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:07,039
myself so that I know what I'm doing we

321
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:07,958
separate the males and we start growing

322
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,360
out the

323
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:12,879
females and

324
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,039
literally 3 weeks into

325
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,838
flower you know where everything should

326
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,559
be showing and the pistols are coming

327
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:20,959
and it's you know 3 weeks is pretty good

328
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:24,078
to Heaven flower we looked at one of the

329
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:27,638
plants and it was a male so the entire

330
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:30,318
time the the maale never showed anything

331
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:32,680
and then finally around the third week

332
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:35,559
in flower realized there's a male in the

333
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:37,239
room and it was an absolutely beautiful

334
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:41,000
plant thought it was going to be a great

335
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:43,560
girl so what I did is I junked the the

336
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,318
original male that I had selected and

337
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:48,758
took him and put him in that seller and

338
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:52,039
that's the picture you have of that male

339
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:54,959
and that male literally was probably 4

340
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:57,879
and A2 5 feet tall and if you look at

341
00:15:54,958 --> 00:16:00,599
the plant the top two feet of the plant

342
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:03,879
this not e this barely any leaves it's

343
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,839
just straight flower I mean it it it

344
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:08,000
pushed out flowers like you can't

345
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,759
believe I mean we would joking or right

346
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,799
when we collected pollen we collected on

347
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:17,079
a fulllength mirror like a like the

348
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:18,958
mirror had to be 5et long right I mean

349
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:21,198
it was unbeliev all you had to do is

350
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,359
just take the mirror near the plant and

351
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,719
shake the plant I mean I was joking

352
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,079
around at the time that we were

353
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:31,959
collecting pollen with a shovel I I mean

354
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:36,078
that so and I probably bred that

355
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:38,518
plant over the next four or five years

356
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:42,359
at least a dozen times so something

357
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:45,198
about that plant is you know it's um the

358
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,318
photo that we have is you know it's it's

359
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:50,599
not the best photo and it's on Instagram

360
00:16:47,318 --> 00:16:53,278
and you sent a screenshot of it but it

361
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,639
looks like a Christmas tree so like you

362
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,198
know often people will talk about like

363
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,919
you know a female plant that looks like

364
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:01,879
a Christmas tree this this actually from

365
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:06,558
this photo it looks like a Christmas

366
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:09,000
tree um pretty incredible photo yeah I I

367
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,720
kept them I I you know you clone you

368
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,359
know some days you're you feel like all

369
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,120
you're doing is cloning stuff right just

370
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:18,719
to keep it going but I think I kept him

371
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:22,198
going for four or five years and

372
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,558
everything I hit the same thing happened

373
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:28,000
it ended up with more

374
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:29,720
potency and carrier fene either went to

375
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,558
the top or be became one of the top

376
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:35,000
couple of turps so all the stuff was had

377
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:37,119
a little bit of spice in it and it it

378
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,839
wasn't quite pepper but it was more

379
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:45,000
spice um but it increased the potency I

380
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:47,839
think in every cross I did you know we

381
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,160
um yeah we hit a bunch of strains I

382
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:53,000
think I hit five different orange

383
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,558
strains um doesn't seem to didn't seem

384
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,679
to mix too well with some of the

385
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:59,359
blueberry stuff but it mixed really

386
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:01,679
really well with the fruit so I kept

387
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:04,759
most of it on the fruit side cuz then

388
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:09,080
you get in the spice and the fruit it

389
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:13,200
was one um called berer which was bag of

390
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:17,319
oranges from um Randy useful seeds who

391
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,640
um sadly passed away last spring um but

392
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:21,960
we went through five different orange

393
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,480
drains uh the buer story is kind of

394
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,000
it'll be quick but it's really kind of

395
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,360
funny so well they don't need to be

396
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,119
quick no I know but I I was going off

397
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,759
track I wanted to talk about the pan I

398
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,599
read and and one of the one of the

399
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:36,759
crosses and one of the interactions on

400
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:39,798
on Instagram but on the berer so we get

401
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:42,200
bag of oranges we grow it out um I get a

402
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:45,279
beautiful female and they and they're

403
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:49,000
all fem so

404
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:51,000
um this one turned black when it was

405
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,558
finishing and it was absolutely

406
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:59,880
beautiful so I pollinated it with the

407
00:18:54,558 --> 00:19:01,720
Panama Red it's probably a 4ot plant

408
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,520
and I start from the

409
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,600
bottom and you know I'm crushing it up

410
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:08,440
I'm saving the KE I'm literally just

411
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:11,399
looking for seeds I don't really care

412
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,798
about the the weed so much as as getting

413
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,640
the seeds I went through the entire

414
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:20,279
plant when I got to the apical Bud the

415
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:23,000
last Bud on the top there was one seed

416
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:27,000
so in this entire breeding I got one

417
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
single seed and you know Murphy's Law I

418
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,519
didn't keep a cut of the B bag of

419
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,919
oranges so I couldn't so I couldn't go

420
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:36,359
back and do it again with the same plant

421
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,360
so I grew out that one plant so it's bag

422
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,479
of orange is in Panama Red so I just

423
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:44,240
named it

424
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:48,120
berer uh and the guys around here still

425
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,759
have it um there's there's a couple guys

426
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:53,038
that it's their regular stable no matter

427
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:56,240
what else they grow they keep it growing

428
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:59,079
I actually lost the plant about a year

429
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,120
and a half ago and got it back again I

430
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:04,480
don't know about two months ago so it

431
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:08,319
stays around it's an unbelievable plant

432
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:11,480
um and and because it was only the one

433
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:15,359
seed and I was afraid of losing it again

434
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:17,720
I created a bunch of uh s1s so I

435
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,359
reversed it cloned it hit it with the

436
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,319
you know hit the Clone with the reverse

437
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:25,119
plant and then made a bunch of seeds so

438
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:29,279
it's still out there um and

439
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:32,678
then maybe 4 years ago when Ren was

440
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:34,639
running useful seeds um I gave him a

441
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:36,320
bunch to give away his freebies yeah

442
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,440
it's just the Boop is just a really good

443
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:42,200
plant it's spicy on it's happy it's

444
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,679
really social um the weed's really

445
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,960
really nice and that was one of the the

446
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:50,000
the good ones that came out of the

447
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:52,038
Panama Red but when I grew that Beast

448
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,319
that story I want to tell about

449
00:20:52,038 --> 00:20:57,158
Instagram is you know you get you get

450
00:20:55,319 --> 00:21:00,439
all these different feeds you seeing all

451
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:05,080
these different plants um and and this

452
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:11,080
guy uh his name is Will lived in Seattle

453
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:15,639
and he crossed a killer Malo to a

454
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:17,960
pooya so the pya he actually picked up

455
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,320
in Colombia so he went down to Colombia

456
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:25,200
for two months trying to

457
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:29,480
sort the red right poter Roya and he

458
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:33,400
said after about you know so he finally

459
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:36,240
um um one of the highs he had which his

460
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:39,320
description is if you're sitting down

461
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,480
and you smoke to punya he said it feels

462
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:46,480
like you're being elevated off the chair

463
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:49,120
you just you're bing up off of the chair

464
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,960
so he way he brought those back to

465
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:55,239
Seattle and did did a couple of crosses

466
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,038
and he did this CR this killer Malawi

467
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,440
and he called it red

468
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:00,879
death so

469
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,120
I don't know how many he had he had a

470
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,559
dozen maybe growing and this one red

471
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:09,719
death number six just looked like a

472
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:12,960
perfect match for the Panama Red so I

473
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:15,360
wanted the plant and he doesn't know me

474
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,679
I don't know him so the pan I red so

475
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:20,439
will will hunted the punter Roya and

476
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,559
then he did the killer Malawi cross and

477
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,759
then he's got a dozen of those so

478
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:28,639
growing in Seattle and again nobody

479
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:31,119
knows who anybody is so I contact them

480
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,360
and I'm like I'd like a cut of the

481
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:36,119
plant and I said you know I'm come from

482
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:41,240
Boston I'm coming out to

483
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:44,678
Seattle um on a business trip and I'd

484
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:47,798
like the plant so he said

485
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:48,960
fine so you know time I think it was

486
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:50,639
probably a month between the

487
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,200
conversation and the time I was going to

488
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,840
Seattle and I'm all psyched CU now I get

489
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,480
to to do these you know these nice I I

490
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:00,599
get some Colombian with the pya which

491
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,720
which I like with the Panama Red The

492
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:05,480
Mala adds a little bit of little bit of

493
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,798
Spike little bit of little bit of Z zest

494
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,599
to it um and I think it's going to be a

495
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:14,278
really good cross so we're going back

496
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:17,759
and forth and about a week before I fly

497
00:23:14,278 --> 00:23:19,440
out um he calls me up and he said um I'm

498
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,200
not going to be

499
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,120
around

500
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,519
so it's it's hard to frame it but like I

501
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:28,038
said you don't know who's going to be

502
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:29,879
who on Instagram so all of a sudden I

503
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:31,558
think I'm going to Seattle I think I'm

504
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,480
going to get this plant and then right

505
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:35,918
before I get to go out there the

506
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,240
person's telling me that

507
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:42,120
um that he's not going to be around so

508
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:45,240
I'm a little bit bummed out and um he

509
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:48,119
calls me back two days later and he said

510
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:51,440
look I rent a house and my landlord's

511
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:55,839
around he'll let you in the house he

512
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:59,440
doesn't know me for mam right so um I

513
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:02,399
fly out is his landlord meets me at the

514
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,159
house go inside the house I don't know

515
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,320
how he showered cuz the bathroom was

516
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,760
full of plants the back porch was full

517
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:13,158
of plants and I literally he left me

518
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:14,879
some um you know not chiam masas but

519
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:17,559
whatever he he he he left me some

520
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,080
scissors and two two water bottles to

521
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:22,399
take the cuts so he left all the stuff

522
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:25,079
for me opened up his house wasn't even

523
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,159
around I go out in the back his landlord

524
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:31,119
knew what was going on yeah yeah his his

525
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,919
his landlord was in a house close to him

526
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:36,759
um and also smoked weed so they're all F

527
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,600
so they're all fine with it um but I

528
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:41,440
literally went out on the back porch and

529
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:43,879
I you know there was a 10 12 plants

530
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:48,840
whatever there was on that back porch

531
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:50,559
and um I knew the plant right away so um

532
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:52,240
I went over and I checked and it was it

533
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:54,000
was the it was the number six so I took

534
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:59,038
a bunch of

535
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:01,880
cuts um and then I went to a supermarket

536
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:06,079
because this stuff still really

537
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:08,159
wasn't um you know legal yet and what I

538
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:12,199
did is I bought a

539
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:14,640
salad and I took the like three or four

540
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,558
cuts and I wrapped them into some paper

541
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,799
towels and then stuck lettuce over them

542
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:22,599
and put them in the thing like I was

543
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:25,158
taking a salad and I brought it on the

544
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:28,719
plane with me and flew back to

545
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:30,440
Boston you know what that is one of the

546
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,480
most

547
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,200
interesting ways that I've heard of

548
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,759
smuggling clones or you know moving

549
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:41,159
clones from place to place um I might

550
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:44,038
have to use that in the future because I

551
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:48,720
think it's actually a a great

552
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:50,119
idea um yeah that's crazy yeah so so I

553
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:55,159
brought it back in a

554
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:57,839
salad um BR read that plant and as I

555
00:25:55,159 --> 00:26:00,919
typically do I've made a couple of of

556
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:02,678
different decisions but 90% of the time

557
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:04,799
I'm just naming stuff that's the name of

558
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:06,440
the parents right cuz I think it's

559
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,480
easier to figure out and if people are

560
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,080
tracking stuff down and they want

561
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,720
something from a line it's easier to

562
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:17,519
figure out so I named it Panama Red

563
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:20,600
Death um and the plants Panama Red Death

564
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,398
17 I I know a guy in the in the I I

565
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:24,918
believe he's in the black market in

566
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:27,678
brookin um he's been selling it for

567
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:29,720
years I actually sent him the cut that

568
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,399
the cut exist a couple places but not

569
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,558
many and he he's I it's been three or

570
00:26:32,398 --> 00:26:38,000
four it's been at least 3 or 4 years

571
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:39,918
maybe more and he said it's um it's it's

572
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,880
one of his more popular strains that

573
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:45,679
people are buying so they like it it's

574
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,200
out there uh I don't have that plant

575
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:51,159
anymore I I I'll I'll eventually get it

576
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:54,080
back from him to do another line with it

577
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:56,120
but um yeah that Panama Red Death turned

578
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:58,798
out to be really really good weed

579
00:26:56,119 --> 00:27:01,558
actually I I'm I'm I getting to the

580
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:05,000
point now where I've got to go to f3s on

581
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:08,319
it but the few seeds um that were

582
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,720
available that I put on uh uh the FCP

583
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:14,879
FCP site of over at dagger they those

584
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:17,079
move right away um and the interesting

585
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,600
part is when I give him to to Peter to

586
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:22,480
help raise money for the future cannabis

587
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:23,959
project I generally don't even say

588
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,798
prices like he can sell them for

589
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,278
whatever he wants he can do freebies

590
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:31,038
it's it's my way of helping him do the

591
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:32,798
stuff um and then and getting the seeds

592
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:36,798
out so people can grow hopefully some

593
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:39,519
really good weed so to to finish up so I

594
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:42,960
get the plant get it home I still never

595
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:44,918
met him he's never met me he let me in

596
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,679
his house hooked me up with the landlord

597
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:49,360
and then set me up with the equipment so

598
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:51,640
that I could bring the Clones back home

599
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:54,319
and now this I'm not real claring the

600
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,080
time but it was probably a year later he

601
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:58,678
was going to a wedding in

602
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:01,639
Maine and I said well stop by and have

603
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:04,640
dinner so stopped by with his girlfriend

604
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,320
and the wife and I had dinner and there

605
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,799
was you know theoretically they were

606
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,200
going to have dinner and head up to

607
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:12,519
Maine I think they left around 1:30 or

608
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,120
2:00 in the morning I mean we just sat

609
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:19,519
there for hours and hours and hours uh

610
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:22,000
and as it turns out he's he opened up uh

611
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:26,359
like a bed and breakfast in Columbia

612
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,839
he's gone he left Seattle um took the

613
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:30,959
young lady and they set up shop in

614
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:33,119
Columbia whether I ever get down there

615
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,720
to visit him or not will be interesting

616
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:38,278
but um yeah really really good guy and

617
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,278
and it's the same thing like I had no

618
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:42,558
idea what he looks like no idea on

619
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:44,119
anything it's like yeah stop over for

620
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:46,798

00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:58,278
ahead what I wanted to say is these are

625
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:59,119
the type of stories that this channel is

626
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:01,798
all

627
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:03,839
about there's good people out there

628
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:08,639
what' you say there's good people out

629
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:09,720
there there really is you know and it's

630
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,480
sometimes you feel like you know

631
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,679
everybody in the world is [ __ ] and then

632
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:17,558

634
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:22,519
experience lately because of the podcast

635
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:25,000

638
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:32,679
to say this you know right now that I

639
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:34,960

640
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:38,679
lifelong friendship for us yeah thank

641

you that'd be great yeah I you

642
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:46,240
know people complain about Instagram and

643
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:48,599
Instagram can be awful right because

644
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,599
we're doing stuff in legal states that

645
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:54,959
don't have any issues and they still

646
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:57,480
give the Cannabis guys a hard time so

647
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,120
that kind of sucks you know and then you

648
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,679
get the kids out there that you know

649
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:03,439
they don't finish reading the sentence

650
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,640
before they're replying back on

651
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,759
something negative because they know

652
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,759
everything so that that's the plus of

653
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:11,640
losing my account before is I've lost

654
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:14,158
those

655
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,440
accounts and now I'm dealing with people

656
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:20,559
who love the plant and and and like

657
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:22,000
making good weed so it's pretty nice you

658
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:23,839
know and you mentioned before how I

659
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,079
don't take any

660
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:31,319
money um I don't trade either right I

661
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:33,519
mean I'm I'm in a unique position where

662
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:35,000
I don't really need the money I'm

663
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:37,480
actually I'm in a position where I I

664
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,480
can't even take the money so I take

665
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,759
nothing and I don't even trade right

666
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,599
because if I

667
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:47,679
trade then trade implies you know value

668
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:51,959
for value and somebody could be

669
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:54,360
disappointed and I'd rather give and not

670
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,600
expect anything in return so the only

671
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:58,519
thing that can happen is I can get

672
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:00,879
something in return

673
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:03,159
sometime in the future and I'm only

674
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,639
going to be happy about it right I'm not

675
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:08,120
going to think wow that was a bad trade

676
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:10,479
so for me it's a really positive

677
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:12,319
experience all the way around I the one

678
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,759
thing I'll say about that and I heard

679
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:17,839
you say that

680
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:21,558
yesterday um when we chatted briefly

681
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:24,599
is I mean I understand you know you

682
00:31:21,558 --> 00:31:28,038
don't need to trade and

683
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:31,599
but I think that you could trade if if

684
00:31:28,038 --> 00:31:34,200
you just went into it with little

685
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:35,519
expectation you know like if somebody

686
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:39,399
says hey look I have something really

687
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:41,720
special I'd like to trade you for it um

688
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:45,158
you know you you would be giving it to

689
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:49,839
him anyway so if you don't s get

690
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:52,039
something that's you know awesome it

691
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:54,278
doesn't really matter you know but

692
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:55,960
there's a potential that somebody is

693
00:31:54,278 --> 00:32:00,519
giving you something really

694
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:03,720
special so I didn't understand the the

695
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:06,440
no trading for that reason just

696
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:09,200
because and and the other thing is you

697
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,558
know someone someone's trying to give

698
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,200
something to you that they really want

699
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:15,440
you to have well that see you said it

700
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:20,278
though they're giving it to me I'll do

701
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:22,120
that but I'm not trade implies value so

702
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:25,319
I'm not looking for any value out of the

703
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:28,359
plant I'm just I'm looking to get it out

704
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:30,599
to people and

705
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:33,398
you know frankly I mean when it comes

706
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:37,038
down to it why am I doing it I'm doing

707
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:39,278
it for my ego I I want to make good weed

708
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:41,558
I want people to go Bost to Bob's weed's

709
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:43,159
really good that's what I want right I

710
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:46,720
don't need the money I'm looking for

711
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:49,559
accolades like I I'm I it's it's funny

712
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,200
hearing me say it but it's true like it

713
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:54,879
it's it's an ego thing for me I I you

714
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,679
know I I've done a bunch of stuff before

715
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,440
I understand breeding I got my OCD which

716
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:03,480
is is going to keep me wired in I'm not

717
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:05,639
going to be able to give up um so and

718
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,679
then and so I want I the value

719
00:33:05,638 --> 00:33:12,359
proposition for me doesn't exist like

720
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:15,960
like actually right now in

721
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:18,079
Massachusetts there's two legal

722
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,240
entities you know one of them's got

723
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:23,119
60,000 square feet and the other one's

724
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:26,038
got you know Acres that they do

725
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:28,839
sungrown um I work with them I give them

726
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:30,638
the seats right I will I work with them

727
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:33,158
in terms of the genetics and right now

728
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:36,000
in Massachusetts it it's funny cuz I was

729
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:39,240
thinking about am I a homeg grower am I

730
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,278
a craft grower or breeder it's like I'm

731
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,960
not really a hom grower because I got

732
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:46,278
five different strains that are right

733
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,919
now in dispensaries in

734
00:33:46,278 --> 00:33:51,119
Massachusetts and and I'm doing that

735
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:53,240
because those guys don't have to pay

736
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:53,959
anything I'll work with them to get the

737
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,079
right

738
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:01,519
strain and then you know they can run a

739
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:03,278
bench so I can see 80 plants right and

740
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,240
and then I can make a selection That I

741
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:08,440
Want from males and females that I could

742
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,480
never do on my own that would take me

743
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,918
years right I mean for me for me when

744
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,960
I'm going through stuff maybe I go

745
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:18,878
through 40 plants at a time but to be

746
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,199
able to go through a 100 and make that

747
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:23,118
selection you know I that's a pretty

748
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:24,838
unique opportunity and the weed's good

749
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,720
enough where the dispensaries can sell

750
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:28,119
it right cuz the kids are still buying

751
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,638
by the number so it's got got to be

752
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:33,399
strong enough for the dispensaries to

753
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,358
sell and you know this one place has an

754
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:38,598
R&amp;D room so they'll try different stuff

755
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:41,598
I'm like here's one I've never even

756
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:44,720
tested but the parents are really good I

757
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:48,000
know this and this is likely to happen

758
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:49,838
but you know we all know best intentions

759
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,119
right I mean just because everything is

760
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:53,759
great doesn't mean the weed's going to

761
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,320
be that good so having somebody who's

762
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:00,240
okay doing R&amp;D with you it's a huge Plus

763
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:03,119
for me so it it helps me get to my goal

764
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:05,959
of producing really good wheat do you

765
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,800
know if either of those

766
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:13,639
facilities um Greg chemdog is involved

767
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:15,760
in because I know that he's um in

768
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:16,960
Massachusetts um you know working at a

769
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,200
licensed

770
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,280
Farm yeah he's not on the tube that I'm

771
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:24,919
that I'm doing stuff with now he's not a

772
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,920
part to either of them cuz I I know who

773
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,639
owns this other one and it's just you

774
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:32,800
know it's a massive facility and they're

775
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:35,159
really good people so you know that

776
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,680
that's an advantage that I have

777
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:39,279
also goinging to think of another Panama

778
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:42,039
Red story so I got the

779
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,480
berer I got the Panama Red Death that

780
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,759
came

781
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,400
[Music]

782
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,400
in yeah that's been a a really great

783
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,720
plan you talked about the Panama Red do

784
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,400
you have any other breeding stories that

785
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:53,519
you want to tell or stories about people

786
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,160
that you

787
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:59,000
know Al so um Jr at Saturn Ilia seeds in

788
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:01,719
the last coup couple

789
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,440
years the pan I think the Panama Red

790
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:07,559
would go really good with Federated

791
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:11,318
Federation Hawaiian

792
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:13,199
sativa so I think he sells seeds he does

793
00:36:11,318 --> 00:36:16,358
some stuff he's a really good farmer

794
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:18,439
nice guy and and we got chatting a few

795
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:19,480
years back to try to get it going so I

796
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,800
sent him

797
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:25,760
paen and it didn't

798
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:29,200
take and then he sent me a cut of his

799
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,640
mother and then I tried poen and that

800
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:32,439
didn't

801
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:37,598
take

802
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:41,720
and I got Panama Red Death

803
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:45,240
pollen uh and that was an accident and I

804
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:49,159
got maybe 20 seats I think I I got very

805
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:51,598
very few seats I think on that one um

806
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:53,279
but because of the Panama Red and

807
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,599
because we were both trying to get it

808
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,800
going and eventually I I'll you know

809
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:00,119
I'll have to go to f3s and and get the

810
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,839
panom my red back into that Federation

811
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:06,000
haian sativa I think he I think he's up

812
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:08,559
to either F7 or f8 so it's really nice

813
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,039
and stable it's an absolute you know he

814
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,639
gave me he sent me a cut and that the

815
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:15,719
plant's

816
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:19,559
absolutely stand out it it literally

817
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:22,159
smells like um like citrus shoe polish

818
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:25,039
like if you had a can of black kiwi shoe

819
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:28,318
polish and and it and it was you poured

820
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:31,199
citrus acid on or orange is that's what

821
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:34,480
it smells like it's it's it's it's a

822
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:37,000
great smell it's a really clean up high

823
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,960
love the plant um and because of that I

824
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,880
think I've bred that thing three or four

825
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:46,760
times already you know and and in my

826
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:50,800
this is just my opinion I like I would

827
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:53,680
never do a filial generation

828
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,560
increase on somebody else's

829
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:58,118
plant right because they've done the

830
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:01,279
work

831
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:02,680
and for me to go and and take it in a

832
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,400
different direction than they were

833
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:08,000
taking it it doesn't seem right to me so

834
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:11,160
if I get a plant from somebody I get a

835
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,679
cut um I'm basically only doing

836
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:15,799
outcrosses now on a rare occasion I

837
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:17,559
might go back and do a back cross with a

838
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,519
plant that I really like but that's

839
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:22,400
pretty rare I I I doesn't seem right to

840
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:25,639
me to take somebody's work and go ahead

841
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,838
and do F2 so like in JR's case I've read

842
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:30,679
that that Hawaiian

843
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:32,639
um I think four times and then what I'm

844
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:36,358
doing is I'll send him 100

845
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:38,078
seeds right so that if you he he could

846
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:40,039
he can give them away throw them away

847
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,920
grow them do whatever he wants but you

848
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:45,079
know it's it's my way of saying thank

849
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,559
you for um for letting me have that cut

850
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:50,119
so I I still have that cut right now

851
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:53,039
it's it's a really nice plant and it all

852
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:55,599
started again with that the Panama Red

853
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:57,920
mail the one thing that the Panama Red

854
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,160
mail did for me

855
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,720
was it made me

856
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:06,279
Focus even though it's anecdotal because

857
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:09,679
it's a oneshot deal um the males that

858
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:12,000
show last you know we we we we started

859
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:15,000
to chat yesterday about the mail piece

860
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,760
which I love um honestly I have more

861
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,400
much more fun hunting males than females

862
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:24,079
because it's a little harder and you

863
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,760
have to have a little yeah a little but

864
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,720
you know it's interesting it's it to me

865
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,760
it's intense

866
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:34,919
right it's it's not the perfect male

867
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,520
it's the perfect male for the cross like

868
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,000
what do you trying to get out of the

869
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:41,280
Cross and and and what's that what's the

870
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,318
intent on the breeding because if you

871
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:48,599
have two people with the same set of of

872
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:53,559
genetics and one person's looking

873
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:56,599
for you know tall wispy you know 16 we

874
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:59,679
plant and somebody's looking for tighter

875
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:03,000
nod something that they can grow inside

876
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:05,078
it's likely I mean it may take some time

877
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,199
but it's likely that that both of those

878
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:10,920
people can find a male that will help do

879
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:15,279
that job so there's not one perfect male

880
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:17,920
to do all the jobs you know we like you

881
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,760
know we mentioned DJ Short real real

882
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:24,240
briefly and that at least and I don't

883
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:28,520
know him but my understanding is he

884
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:31,559
likes a male for a structure and and

885
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:34,920
doesn't add anything so that he can keep

886
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:38,159
the female traits that he likes and make

887
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:40,280
a bigger bit a stronger plant right so

888
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:44,078
with that intent he's looking for a

889
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:45,640
specific kind of male me personally I'd

890
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,480
rather have a male bring something to

891
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:50,279
the dance right I I'm I'm looking for

892
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,039
the combination that's going to increase

893
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:56,440
me something and that so I've had a

894
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:58,679
number of people tell me that that's the

895
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:03,800
way they breed

896
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:06,838
um which way where they want a male

897
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:10,318
that allows the female to

898
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:13,000
shine right but then it seems like

899
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:18,400
you're not really making a cross you're

900
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:21,599
just trying to get your female into seed

901
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,760
form you know so I really don't

902
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,680
understand that logic okay

903
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,920
so particularly when you doing regular

904
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:31,719
seeds

905
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,800
so I have a friend that he he does a lot

906
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:35,318
of

907
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,800
feminized and for

908
00:41:35,318 --> 00:41:42,838
feminized and you know we both agree him

909
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:48,000
and I that selfing can cause problems

910
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:50,920
right so he prefers to use a male that

911
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:55,400
has traits of

912
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:57,760
vigor um flower size and yield but he

913
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,000
wants something that's not going to give

914
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,599
the

915
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:06,760
tpin okay and that way you know if he's

916
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,720
Crossing it to you know whatever let's

917
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,800
say

918
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:15,559
runts the progyny is going to be runs

919
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:20,440
and that it's not going to have you know

920
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:24,639
the tpine and even the high of the

921
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:27,358
parent plant so when you're doing

922
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:30,358
feminized plants

923
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:34,480
I I guess I can wrap my head around that

924
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:36,558
but when you're doing a cross with

925
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,960
regulars it's harder for me to

926
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:42,880
understand why you would want a male

927
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:47,000
that isn't giving much besides

928
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:50,519
fertility you know so no I so I agree

929
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,440
with you I I my preference is I want the

930
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:54,679
males to bring something to the party I

931
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,159
you

932
00:42:54,679 --> 00:43:00,919
know and if you so do turp profiles I

933
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:06,078
test all my stuff so I know where the

934
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:08,079
Tes are I know where CBG CBC CBD like

935
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,880
especially lately when I'm doing the

936
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:13,640
longer flowering stuff I don't want any

937
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,960
CBD at all because all it's going to do

938
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:19,000
is it's it's going to muffle that that

939
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:23,119
nice high from the long flowering so I I

940
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,800
I go through and and test everything so

941
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,480
but on that on your piece I agree with

942
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,920
you that the meals that I I like I want

943
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,719
to bring something to the table that I I

944
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:36,280
will say though I'd like clarification

945
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:38,879
from you on s1's MH because I've never

946
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,800
had a problem with self and plants and

947
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,680
and I've never I've never had a problem

948
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:48,119
with any of the seeds and my guess

949
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:51,838
is 90% of them come out just like the

950
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:54,200
mom right I mean I guess I don't

951
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:57,920
understand whether everybody's taking

952
00:43:54,199 --> 00:44:00,439
separate clones or their STS or or

953
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:03,960
reversing a plant and taking seeds from

954
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:06,960
the plant that's reversed now if you did

955
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,838
that and I I posted on one of the forums

956
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,199
recently because guys were talking about

957
00:44:08,838 --> 00:44:12,838
sing and seemed like they were doing it

958
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:15,598
for the first time and they were getting

959
00:44:12,838 --> 00:44:18,279
the you know the ratio right for so you

960
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:22,079
know sodium tho sufate and and the

961
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:25,640
silver nitrate to get that going but I

962
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:27,720
think maybe an issue with some of the

963
00:44:25,639 --> 00:44:30,598
fem is

964
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:31,919
is they're taking seeds from the plant

965
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:35,200
that's being

966
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,599
reversed now then I could see an issue

967
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:39,279
because now you're stressing the plant

968
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,920
and you're asking it to produce its

969
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,000
babies at the same time you're putting

970
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:46,880
it under that stress so how many people

971
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,079
do that honestly I have no idea maybe

972
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,318
Nobody Does it I think I think that

973
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:55,000
that's what most people are doing yeah

974
00:44:51,318 --> 00:44:57,719
that's crazy I mean you you you you set

975
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,358
up the you you clone the plant

976
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:01,159
right and so if you especially if you

977
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:04,358
want to keep it you get two or three

978
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:08,159
clones and then you grow the

979
00:45:04,358 --> 00:45:11,159
Clone till it's you know two weeks in

980
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:13,558
flour a week and a half in flour so so

981
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:15,799
it's just starting to kick in and and

982
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:18,839
stretches slowing down then you start

983
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:22,519
STS in the other plant so the plant

984
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:25,039
that's producing the female pollen is

985
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:27,039
hitting the Clone it's not hitting that

986
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:28,800
same plant I mean technically it's the

987
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:31,000
same genetics but it's physically not

988
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,839
the same plant so now you've got a

989
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,920
healthy female taking in pollen I've

990
00:45:34,838 --> 00:45:40,119
never had problems I've never had a male

991
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:42,480
come up I've never had any kind of real

992
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:44,200
pheno variation

993
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,159
heroism

994
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:49,159
zero and the one thing that I now and

995
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:50,838
and again I don't have the data to say

996
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:54,519
this is true

997
00:45:50,838 --> 00:45:54,519
but my guess

998
00:45:54,559 --> 00:46:03,640
is the harder the concentration of

999
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:06,920
STS it takes to reverse a

1000
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:10,358
plant is how stable it

1001
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:12,440
is so some some of them you have a

1002
00:46:10,358 --> 00:46:17,799
really really tough time I think those

1003
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:21,519
are less likely to pass on um the

1004
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:24,800
Herms I think the hermaphroditic traits

1005
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:27,318
if you if you used an STS solution and

1006
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,800
let's say you know you used a just call

1007
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:32,838
it you know five was your solution which

1008
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:34,720
is a combination of the two and and and

1009
00:46:32,838 --> 00:46:37,920
you put half the solution on the plant

1010
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:39,879
turned really quickly then it's not that

1011
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,358
strong a male that's also why I like

1012
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,160
these late showing

1013
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:47,719
males right I mean that's i i i the

1014
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:50,239
Panama Red showed me what a strong male

1015
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:52,719
and through the progyny it proved itself

1016
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:54,799
it was a strong meal it added strength

1017
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:57,919
it added the the spice it did all I

1018
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:02,720
wanted so if I get down to having four

1019
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:04,119
males left you know um I'm not picking

1020
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:06,399
the one that's first in flower

1021
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:08,880
especially everything else is even what

1022
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,358
what I've generally done over time

1023
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,480
because I feel pretty strongly about it

1024
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:17,440
is I'll start with 40

1025
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:20,559
plants and when I put the males in flow

1026
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:23,639
I take the first 10 to 20% that show sex

1027
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:26,079
and I just kill them I I don't even I I

1028
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:28,639
don't even flower them out I I want the

1029
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:31,280
ones that show up at the at the end now

1030
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:32,799
doesn't have to be the very last one but

1031
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,960
I want them in the last

1032
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:39,160
25% because I think those are stronger

1033
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:42,559
it's it's hate saying it but the old

1034
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:44,199
adage about the you know the buck and

1035
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,200
the the old buck and the young buck up

1036
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:47,679
at the

1037
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:49,719
hill and and the Young Buck says hey

1038
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:52,440
let's run down there and get get some of

1039
00:47:49,719 --> 00:47:54,399
the get get get a female and and the old

1040
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,519
bug says you know what let's walk down

1041
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,318
and get them

1042
00:47:55,519 --> 00:48:01,000
all right I mean honestly I think that's

1043
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:04,558
the way the males are I I think I think

1044
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:07,159
if they take longer I they at least in

1045
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:11,240
my experience they've been

1046
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:13,598
stronger and so you've tested it out you

1047
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:15,919
you've done the the ones that flower

1048
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:18,720
faster and the ones that flower

1049
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:21,639
slower I I did it once other than that

1050
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:24,838
and it it's the ones that that flower

1051
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:28,000
early I have no interest in at all well

1052
00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:29,960
I'm going to let me make comment about

1053
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,760
this

1054
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:34,960
um I I don't believe I have as much

1055
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,680
experience breeding as you do you know

1056
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,318
you've been doing this for focusing on

1057
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:45,679
it for many

1058
00:48:39,318 --> 00:48:47,558
years but to me and I hope you'll not be

1059
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:49,879
offended by you know what I'm going to

1060
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:53,319
say because it's not directed directly

1061
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:57,400
at you it's directed at the idea oh okay

1062
00:48:53,318 --> 00:48:58,639
go ahead okay but the idea that we can

1063
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,639
select a

1064
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:06,879
male based

1065
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:08,759
on how fast it flowers a stem rub um the

1066
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,838
structure of the

1067
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:14,839
plant to me it's a little bit of

1068
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:18,400
arrogance you know and I think that the

1069
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:21,838
only way that you can really know what

1070
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:25,200
this male is going to give you is the

1071
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:27,279
same way that we only know what a female

1072
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:33,759
is going to give you and and that's by

1073
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:36,079
growing it and so the way I do it you

1074
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:40,400
know particularly when I'm going to do

1075
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:42,920
like an F1 hybrid is I try to use as

1076
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,079
many of the males as I can

1077
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:48,680
separately so let's say you know I start

1078
00:49:45,079 --> 00:49:51,400
20 seeds and I get 10 males okay I'm

1079
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:54,719
going to try to keep those 10 males you

1080
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:57,798
know clone them and one at a time I'm

1081
00:49:54,719 --> 00:50:02,239
going to flower them with the

1082
00:49:57,798 --> 00:50:05,000
females then you test out the seeds that

1083
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:09,118
are grown with those and then after

1084
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:12,880
you've seen you know the 10 different

1085
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:16,519
males what they've produced then you can

1086
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:20,160
select because we're not guessing we

1087
00:50:16,519 --> 00:50:23,440
have data you know

1088
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:27,358
and that to

1089
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,920
me is the only way I can see doing it

1090
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:35,078
you maybe it's because I don't have the

1091
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:37,200
skill set but I also worry you know my

1092
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:39,680
my family heritage is Jewish so I guess

1093
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:43,399
Jewish people they worry a lot but I

1094
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:46,838
worry like what we could lose when you

1095
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:51,318
do that by having that arrogance in

1096
00:50:46,838 --> 00:50:52,880
thinking that you can visually make a

1097
00:50:51,318 --> 00:50:56,759
selection

1098
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:59,280
so I can't disagree with you because

1099
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:01,680
because the only real true

1100
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:05,040
test is the

1101
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:08,078
progyny right is the male producing

1102
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:11,759
something that's better than something

1103
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:14,440
else but the reality is to do that I

1104
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,680
mean right now my average project takes

1105
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:21,720
years work oh yeah I

1106
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:24,798
mean so yeah I I I I mean I can't do it

1107
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:28,159
so I I live and die by the sword I I

1108
00:51:24,798 --> 00:51:30,079
have um I'll give you an example how how

1109
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:32,558
about an example how my stuff didn't

1110
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:35,880
work so I got

1111
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:38,680
lavender um it's gone out to a couple

1112
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:42,960
people it's a absolutely great

1113
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:47,039
plant um and I bred it to a chili

1114
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:50,880
verie which was called chill lavender

1115
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:52,719
turned out to be a fabulous strain um

1116
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,480
I've still got one of the girls that

1117
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:58,838
I'll have for a long long time it tests

1118
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:02,559
high it's got flavor it's a really nice

1119
00:51:58,838 --> 00:52:04,558
high so it's it that breeding worked

1120
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:07,480
really really well and the lavender was

1121
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:09,960
a plant that worked really really well

1122
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:12,000
so then I I took a chil avender mail so

1123
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,559
chili Verdi and lavender and went back

1124
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,798
to the lavender

1125
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:21,000
again to try to make it a little more

1126
00:52:16,798 --> 00:52:24,079
creamy I want a creamy kind of floral

1127
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,719
and when I went through and picked the

1128
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:29,798
mail

1129
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:33,480
uh was so first of all like I I I talked

1130
00:52:29,798 --> 00:52:36,119
about you know last to show but honestly

1131
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:40,599
I probably my number

1132
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:43,559
one um item that I'm looking at is root

1133
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:44,960
growth right I I I need to see good root

1134
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:46,280
masks because then I know the plants

1135
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,079
will have Vigor and the plants are going

1136
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:51,040
to be healthy if if if I've got you know

1137
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:53,318
five of them and two of them the roots

1138
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:56,558
look like hell and the and the other

1139
00:52:53,318 --> 00:52:58,558
roots are twice as much um I'm not even

1140
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:00,280
going to look at those plants they

1141
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:02,920
they're they're gone because root root

1142
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:04,798
growth is Big so then I got structure

1143
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:07,358
then I got different growing Tendencies

1144
00:53:04,798 --> 00:53:11,280
I got Leaf morphology depends whether I

1145
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:13,279
want to do a complimentary Cross or you

1146
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,640
know I I want I want to have a a

1147
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,720
conflicting cross where I'm going to

1148
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:19,639
bring something out so there's different

1149
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:23,879
reasons to look at the mail but so I

1150
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:27,400
used my general process of root growth

1151
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:29,318
structure last to show and then I bred

1152
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:31,798
it for the lavender batross now a bunch

1153
00:53:29,318 --> 00:53:34,519
of people have grown it out and the

1154
00:53:31,798 --> 00:53:37,880
weed's real good but

1155
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:40,960
somehow I brought out these recessive

1156
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:43,960
traits and they have weak

1157
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:46,079
branching so the weed's really good and

1158
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:47,760
if you know if you grow it in a A scrog

1159
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:50,480
or a sea green or something like that

1160
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,520
it's probably going to be fine but the

1161
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:55,199
reality is the branches can't hold the

1162
00:53:52,519 --> 00:53:57,000
way to the buds and it's not because the

1163
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:59,239
buds are giant they're just weak

1164
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,159
branches yeah they're weak

1165
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:04,879
branches you know and and may may maybe

1166
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:07,039
I could silica or calcium up and and and

1167
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,680
change the feeding but the reality is it

1168
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:12,159
doesn't have the structure it doesn't

1169
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:14,199
have the structure but so let me um so

1170
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:18,078
that was add something to that real fast

1171
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:19,239
yeah so um and you know you have to

1172
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:22,400
understand that I come from a different

1173
00:54:19,239 --> 00:54:24,959
generation than you um my generation was

1174
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:27,039
the chem dog generation and you know

1175
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:30,798
that's kind of what I'm known for

1176
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:33,039
but if the chem dog was a male for

1177
00:54:30,798 --> 00:54:36,039
instance and we were

1178
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:37,558
using these type of

1179
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:39,639
selection

1180
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:44,000
processes it would have been

1181
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:45,960
tossed because it grows like [ __ ] it's

1182
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,599
it's not a strong

1183
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:52,119
plant

1184
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:54,760
um yeah it's it's it's a it's a poor

1185
00:54:52,119 --> 00:54:56,838
grower um with poor

1186
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:58,280
structure um

1187
00:54:56,838 --> 00:55:01,880
but then it's

1188
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:06,000
producing the highest quality flow with

1189
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:09,000
the tpin that we love right so that's

1190
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:12,599
why I believe that the only way to

1191
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:16,599
really know is to grow the stuff out and

1192
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:18,880
you know to be honest with you um if the

1193
00:55:16,599 --> 00:55:21,440
chem dog was grown you know I believe he

1194
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:25,318
only had like six seeds or something

1195
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:27,318
when he started this but if he had 100

1196
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:30,000
seeds you

1197
00:55:27,318 --> 00:55:32,038
know that plant might have just been

1198
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,559
lost you know

1199
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:37,960
because it it literally grew so poorly

1200
00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:40,079
and it was a difficult plant to

1201
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,798
feed

1202
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:44,839
so you know I know the work is

1203
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:47,159
impossible to do it's not like it's

1204
00:55:44,838 --> 00:55:51,798
difficult you know

1205
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:54,639
but it's one thing to say hey look you

1206
00:55:51,798 --> 00:55:57,038
know I'm I'm just doing the best I can

1207
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:59,759
in an Impossible Project

1208
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:03,440
it's another thing to say I'm selecting

1209
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:05,520
it because of this because this is what

1210
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:09,358
I think makes it

1211
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:11,679
better because like I said you know like

1212
00:56:09,358 --> 00:56:16,038
the most interesting thing that I've

1213
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:18,558
heard as far as selecting a male is

1214
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:22,000
someone told me that and I've never done

1215
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:24,400
this that people will reverse a male to

1216
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,039
get it to put out female

1217
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:31,599
flowers so that then they can rub those

1218
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:35,079
flowers to try to get um a smell off of

1219
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:37,559
them a tpine not just a stem rub but

1220
00:56:35,079 --> 00:56:40,640
like of an actual flower I said oh well

1221
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:43,440
you know that's at least giving us more

1222
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:47,000
information to to go with I don't know

1223
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:50,760
how valid it is well so let take the

1224
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:54,318
take that that statement right there

1225
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:56,720
so if I'm going to look for a

1226
00:56:54,318 --> 00:57:01,558
male let's say that I'm looking looking

1227
00:56:56,719 --> 00:57:03,399
for a F1 male to make f2s so I've

1228
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:05,920
already grown out a whole bunch of

1229
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:08,000
females I've already picked the one that

1230
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,880
I like best and and we would tend to

1231
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,920
agree that it's not terribly hard to

1232
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:14,358
pick the best female after you grow a

1233
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:16,440
whole bunch out right right you're right

1234
00:57:14,358 --> 00:57:19,519
you you test it you smoke it and it's

1235
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:23,039
the one you like or not so now I've

1236
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:26,798
already grown at least one maybe two

1237
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:29,720
runs of the females and

1238
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:31,679
and if it's an F1 and let's say the

1239
00:57:29,719 --> 00:57:34,919
stuff isn't crazy you basically have

1240
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:37,440
three main phenotypes right you got 50%

1241
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:39,639
that are a combination of both parents

1242
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:43,079
and you got 25 that lean to the mom and

1243
00:57:39,639 --> 00:57:45,199
you got 25 that lean to the dad so and

1244
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:47,160
if the one you picked the one the female

1245
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:49,759
that you like the best was in the

1246
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:52,078
middle then you generally know what the

1247
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,640
leaf morphology looks like you know what

1248
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:57,119
the node structure looks like so you

1249
00:57:54,639 --> 00:58:00,598
know what that plant looks like so now

1250
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:03,559
go run 30 or 40 Ms and you're going to

1251
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:06,599
have the same distribution roughly of

1252
00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:08,400
the phenotypes so now you take if you're

1253
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:10,960
if you're breeding to the middle then

1254
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,559
you can Lop off 50% of the plants take

1255
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,880
the ones that lean to the mom take the

1256
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:16,559
ones that lean to the dad and get rid of

1257
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:19,480
those now when you're looking at the

1258
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:21,559
male I'm still looking at root growth

1259
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:23,280
I'm still looking at structure but and

1260
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:25,160
when I'm looking at the leaf morphology

1261
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,559
what I'm really trying to do is I'm

1262
00:58:25,159 --> 00:58:30,440
trying to pick a m

1263
00:58:27,559 --> 00:58:32,680
that looks as close to the female that I

1264
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:37,400
like and that's how I'm going to get to

1265
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:39,239
my f2s and and the reality is it's it's

1266
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:42,240
nothing's going to be identical but it's

1267
00:58:39,239 --> 00:58:43,798
going to be close so now when I get f2s

1268
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:47,279
even though I'm going to get a broader

1269
00:58:43,798 --> 00:58:49,280
range of fenos right on the f2s I might

1270
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,400
have literally you could have up to 10

1271
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:54,440
different fenos right stretching from

1272
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:57,039
the mom to the dad but you find that

1273
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,960
next one and and you find the plant

1274
00:58:57,039 --> 00:59:01,440
that's similar to the male that you used

1275
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:04,679
before which is similar to the female

1276
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:06,920
now I can do a back cross and that gives

1277
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:09,798
me something that's very very close to

1278
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:11,440
the original mom or I could try to pick

1279
00:59:09,798 --> 00:59:14,440
two that are the same which is a little

1280
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:17,119
more risky bottleneck it even farther

1281
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:19,039
and then produce the f3s so it's the

1282
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:22,559
intent of what you're trying to do with

1283
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:22,559
the male

1284
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:29,559
so it it really depends on intent for me

1285
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:31,759
and and I think you're right that

1286
00:59:29,559 --> 00:59:35,240
progyny decides the

1287
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,880
mail but except for this lavender fail

1288
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:39,479
where I'm not happy with the structure

1289
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:42,358
of the plant going through the process

1290
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:45,639
when I'm trying to do an outcross or or

1291
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:47,798
a complimentary cross I know kind of

1292
00:59:45,639 --> 00:59:49,759
what I'm looking for and I'm and I'm

1293
00:59:47,798 --> 00:59:52,519
looking for that in the plant and the

1294
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:54,319
other thing is you grow a bunch of

1295
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:56,719
plants and I send them to the lab and I

1296
00:59:54,318 --> 00:59:59,119
know what the tur profile is

1297
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:01,558
so I know that I want to highlight a

1298
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:03,760
certain tur profile I I don't want to

1299
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:05,960
bring merine in right like what I'm

1300
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:09,240
doing right now and I who knows if I'll

1301
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:12,199
be successful I want terpinolene and

1302
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:14,279
carop philene and I want mercing way

1303
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:16,919
down on the list

1304
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:19,359
right but it's not necessarily easy to

1305
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:21,599
do because mering's all over the place

1306
01:00:19,358 --> 01:00:23,119
so I'm testing the different plants I

1307
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:25,160
know what the structure of the plants

1308
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:27,519
are it's one of the reasons it takes a

1309
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:29,038
couple years to do do it because you

1310
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:31,519
you're out there going through a couple

1311
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:34,000
of different runs like I the people that

1312
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:36,798
I and there's plenty of Growers that are

1313
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,480
much better Growers than I am and I

1314
01:00:36,798 --> 01:00:40,599
think the people that I respect that

1315
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:43,199
grow most of them have said the same

1316
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:45,720
thing you you get the the plant dialed

1317
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:48,078
in on your third run the first run

1318
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:50,038
you're finding out about the plant the

1319
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:52,440
the second run you're finding out really

1320
01:00:50,039 --> 01:00:56,160
trying to dial in the feed and the Third

1321
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:58,798
Run is when you actually

1322
01:00:56,159 --> 01:00:59,838
in the plant so how long's it take to do

1323
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:03,519
three

1324
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:08,159
runs right and that's just to find one

1325
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:11,599
plant so it it takes a lot and and to to

1326
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:14,598
run a 100 or to even to run 20

1327
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:16,519
males and then breed them all out and

1328
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:18,318
figure out which is the best by smoking

1329
01:01:16,519 --> 01:01:21,440
the progyny you're looking at two or

1330
01:01:18,318 --> 01:01:23,798
three years yeah right I mean it's time

1331
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,440
to do it it takes a long time so you

1332
01:01:23,798 --> 01:01:28,798
live by the sword you die by the sword

1333
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:31,079
I've had some really really nice ones um

1334
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:34,400
and I like I said the weed on the

1335
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:36,960
lavender it's good weed but unlike chem

1336
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:39,358
dog it's not so special that I'm willing

1337
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:43,358
to take this viny flopping over can't

1338
01:01:39,358 --> 01:01:46,558
holding up the buds plant right um and

1339
01:01:43,358 --> 01:01:50,119
the one thing that I would say on the

1340
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:53,240
approach that I tend to use for

1341
01:01:50,119 --> 01:01:58,599
males is I don't

1342
01:01:53,239 --> 01:02:03,719
think the plant that you trying to get

1343
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:07,960
to um has to be I don't know how to say

1344
01:02:03,719 --> 01:02:10,199
this I I want structure first like I'm

1345
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:12,039
not taking a special plant

1346
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:13,598
necessarily and then saying I'm going to

1347
01:02:12,039 --> 01:02:15,680
breed to this because it's a special

1348
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:17,519
plant doesn't mean I haven't done that

1349
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:20,239
but what I'm doing is if I get a male

1350
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:25,318
and I want to breed it to a a a female

1351
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:28,118
that I like I want obsessive root growth

1352
01:02:25,318 --> 01:02:30,440
right I want to see that thing just cuz

1353
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:34,559
the old adage of more Roots more fruits

1354
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:36,278
still applies so I I want massive root

1355
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,519
growth if I don't get the root growth

1356
01:02:36,278 --> 01:02:40,358
I'm not using it actually we don't have

1357
01:02:38,519 --> 01:02:42,199
to bring up the the graph right now but

1358
01:02:40,358 --> 01:02:46,519
catfish is one that I've worked on for

1359
01:02:42,199 --> 01:02:49,598
the last little bit and I was trying to

1360
01:02:46,519 --> 01:02:53,079
hopefully find it a male and I had two

1361
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:56,440
females that literally were 50 to 75%

1362
01:02:53,079 --> 01:03:00,359
more root mass than any of the

1363
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:02,639
males so seeing that I just killed all

1364
01:03:00,358 --> 01:03:04,519
the males I'm like if I don't have a

1365
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:06,598
male that's good enough to have the same

1366
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:08,719
root growth as one of the plants I'm

1367
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:10,519
selecting then I'm going to have to go

1368
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:12,399
through it again and maybe when I go

1369
01:03:10,519 --> 01:03:14,599
through it again only the females have

1370
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:17,960
good root mess I I'll find out the next

1371
01:03:14,599 --> 01:03:21,160
time I try to do it but I I I think if

1372
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:24,119
you create the Next Generation with a

1373
01:03:21,159 --> 01:03:26,399
strong plant and to me a strong plant is

1374
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:29,318
root growth mostly

1375
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:31,240
now those seeds now if you find the

1376
01:03:29,318 --> 01:03:34,038
special one it's still going to be a

1377
01:03:31,239 --> 01:03:37,318
strong plant when you take one of these

1378
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:39,960
other ones that you know the roots

1379
01:03:37,318 --> 01:03:42,880
aren't that strong the plants kind of

1380
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:44,559
spindly but the weeds really really good

1381
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,160
you breed that you you're going to have

1382
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:50,119
a lot harder time I think if you bred a

1383
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:52,318
stronger male to that

1384
01:03:50,119 --> 01:03:53,760
series then you're going to end up with

1385
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:56,440
stronger plants and you're still going

1386
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:59,400
to find something so I I'd rather start

1387
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:01,519
with a strong plant first but will you

1388
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:03,400
find the the next chem dog will you find

1389
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:06,679
the next bag seed that turns out to be

1390
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:09,440
great I mean probably

1391
01:04:06,679 --> 01:04:11,639
not right so I mean that's kind of my

1392
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,440
two cents on the males I the other thing

1393
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:14,960
is I I've been fooling around with

1394
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,798
pulling out recessive

1395
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:21,199
traits that to me is a is a lot of fun

1396
01:04:17,798 --> 01:04:23,798
because if you have really good quality

1397
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:25,798
plants and I can pull out the recessive

1398
01:04:23,798 --> 01:04:27,440
traits now I'm getting something that

1399
01:04:25,798 --> 01:04:30,079
nobody's seen

1400
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:32,440
before and and if the genetics are good

1401
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:35,039
on the plants that I'm using which I

1402
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:39,679
think they are and I hope they are then

1403
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:42,119
it's likely that 25% of those plants

1404
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:43,558
could be special I'm not expecting them

1405
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:45,640
mall to be

1406
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:48,839
special

1407
01:04:45,639 --> 01:04:51,798
um yeah actually I wouldn't jump in

1408
01:04:48,838 --> 01:04:54,558
Cosmic before you do yeah I want to

1409

meet you yeah nice to meet you Cosby I'm

1423
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:40,038
working on my intros okay doing a good

1424
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:43,679
job Bob thanked me for his intro too and

1425
01:05:40,039 --> 01:05:46,200
and um they're both truly

1426
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:47,879
heartfelt I want to bring up we we we

1427
01:05:46,199 --> 01:05:52,318
talked about the males we talk about the

1428
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:54,559
seeds and intention so cornbread Ricky

1429
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:56,480
um who is one of the the two guys at

1430
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:59,119
Swamp Boy seeds

1431
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:01,719
I had a conversation with him with my

1432
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:06,240
son seven or eight years

1433
01:06:01,719 --> 01:06:08,719
ago and it made a really really big

1434
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:10,838
impression and it it's a kind of a

1435
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:13,679
different way to think about things he

1436
01:06:10,838 --> 01:06:14,920
said there's only two kinds of seeds

1437
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:18,960
that's

1438
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:22,480
it the seeds where you grow a

1439
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:24,159
plant and you grow and get what's

1440
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:28,798
expected from the

1441
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:30,920
plant or or you try to find a plant and

1442
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:33,759
those are the two kinds of seeds you're

1443
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:37,440
either growing or you're finding and if

1444
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:40,278
you look at the the the retail

1445
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:42,039
Market especially in dispensaries right

1446
01:06:40,278 --> 01:06:44,719
or cultivation

1447
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:47,640
facility those guys get mother plants

1448
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:50,798
and get 200 clones and all the weeds not

1449
01:06:47,639 --> 01:06:53,879
not it's not close it's exactly the same

1450
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:57,920
it's the same plant

1451
01:06:53,880 --> 01:07:00,880
so I see the value in doing the

1452
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:03,680
first which is making seeds where if you

1453
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:07,160
grow a plant you get the plant you

1454
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:09,838
expect right and you plant 100 seeds

1455
01:07:07,159 --> 01:07:12,399
nine you know 100 seeds 90 of them are

1456
01:07:09,838 --> 01:07:14,000
going to be the same kind of plant so

1457
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:18,160
that really takes place probably around

1458
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:20,199
F4 maybe if you're lucky F3 but F4 F5 F6

1459
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:23,318
they're all going to be like that and

1460
01:07:20,199 --> 01:07:25,639
people are are getting the lines but the

1461
01:07:23,318 --> 01:07:28,519
other side is

1462
01:07:25,639 --> 01:07:30,278
do I want to buy a seed and grow Jack

1463
01:07:28,519 --> 01:07:32,440
herrer right there's a couple guys that

1464
01:07:30,278 --> 01:07:34,599
have f8 f9s I think they're beautiful

1465
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:35,559
plants right and and there's a whole

1466
01:07:34,599 --> 01:07:39,119
bunch of

1467
01:07:35,559 --> 01:07:41,160
strains that have been filial generation

1468
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:43,480
enough into the

1469
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:45,920
seeds

1470
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:48,358
where you know what you're going to

1471
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:49,639
get and then there's the people who want

1472
01:07:48,358 --> 01:07:52,278
to find a

1473
01:07:49,639 --> 01:07:54,440
plant and the find a plant to me is much

1474
01:07:52,278 --> 01:07:56,639
more fun I I think the interesting part

1475
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:59,039
is I think a bunch of people who buy

1476
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:01,278
seeds don't necessarily know the

1477
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:03,680
difference between growing and

1478
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:06,760
finding and and I think there's less

1479
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:09,480
information available when somebody's

1480
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:12,160
got seeds whether they're buying selling

1481
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:14,358
growing that they know where they are in

1482
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:17,798
what generation and what to

1483
01:08:14,358 --> 01:08:19,318
expect right the most people probably

1484
01:08:17,798 --> 01:08:20,198
realize f1s you're going to have three

1485
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:23,159
main

1486
01:08:20,198 --> 01:08:26,198
phenos not many people I think realize

1487
01:08:23,158 --> 01:08:28,119
on F2 you could literally have 10 or 12

1488
01:08:26,198 --> 01:08:30,519
fenos and

1489
01:08:28,119 --> 01:08:32,039
then you know Gabby like you said if

1490
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:33,880
you're running a whole bunch of stuff

1491
01:08:32,039 --> 01:08:36,838
like you're running that's close to open

1492
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:39,359
pollination even right so that starts

1493
01:08:36,838 --> 01:08:42,439
the whole process over and if you get to

1494
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:44,440
F3 and F4 then you expect some kind of

1495
01:08:42,439 --> 01:08:47,399
consistency in the

1496
01:08:44,439 --> 01:08:48,838
cultivar but who's growing For What and

1497
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:50,519
when you're buying do you know what

1498
01:08:48,838 --> 01:08:53,519
you're actually buying you're buying to

1499
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:56,000
grow you're buying to find

1500
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:58,400
so I like the finding

1501
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,880
the finding is much more fun because if

1502
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:02,399
you find that special plant you clone it

1503
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,359
you give it to your friends it goes to

1504
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:07,639
the dispensaries they're selling on the

1505
01:09:04,359 --> 01:09:10,600
market versus you know getting a stable

1506
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:13,480
line but the way that you may find that

1507
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:16,640
plant you probably have to use a plant

1508
01:09:13,479 --> 01:09:18,238
that's come from a stable line right

1509
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:21,000
because if not you get in these poly

1510
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:24,718
hybrids and all the stuff is the same

1511
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:27,198
yeah right so what I found is you can

1512
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:29,640
work a line and then bring in something

1513
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:33,399
that's that's been worked you know let's

1514
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:35,039
say F4 to F7 that's going to be stable

1515
01:09:33,399 --> 01:09:36,759
bring it into something in a in an

1516
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:39,519
outcross and then find something that

1517
01:09:36,759 --> 01:09:41,838
wasn't there so I think you can do that

1518
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:43,679
but that's that's you still need both

1519
01:09:41,838 --> 01:09:46,079
seeds right you need the grow seed you

1520
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,960
need the fine seed and then how you

1521
01:09:46,079 --> 01:09:50,519
bring in them together bring two grow

1522
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:52,920
seeds together you know you're going to

1523
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:55,560
get something you bring two two fine

1524
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:58,520
seeds together I think it's more po

1525
01:09:55,560 --> 01:10:02,719
hybrid and I I think it's a little muddy

1526
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:04,600
so um actually might be a good time to

1527
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:07,679
let's talk about the

1528
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:11,039
cfish okay um and is that one that you

1529
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:13,199
sent the photo of it is so okay let me

1530
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:16,279
pull it up well actually yeah you know

1531
01:10:13,198 --> 01:10:19,599
go to the albino first all

1532
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:21,319
righty so and I got to look for mine too

1533
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:26,400
okay give me one

1534
01:10:21,319 --> 01:10:28,319
sec so albino

1535
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:30,920
it depends where you see it but the the

1536
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:33,920
numbers are 1 in a th000 to 1 in 10,000

1537
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:38,000
you get an albino plant and this is 100%

1538
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:39,158
not variegation it's an albino plant so

1539
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:43,520
what I

1540
01:10:39,158 --> 01:10:45,960
did was I bred to bring out recessive

1541
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:50,280
traits did I know I was going to get the

1542
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:52,239
albino I had absolutely no clue right

1543
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:54,559
but when I when I show you this other

1544
01:10:52,238 --> 01:10:56,319
one and we go to the chart on um on the

1545
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:59,080
cfish

1546
01:10:56,319 --> 01:11:01,158
uh I I thought there's a there's a way

1547
01:10:59,079 --> 01:11:04,079
to bring out recessive tra so do me a

1548
01:11:01,158 --> 01:11:07,000
favor bring up uh the one that's number

1549
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:11,079
three it's kind of grayed out it's a p

1550
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:14,238
it's a p pedigree chart so what happens

1551
01:11:11,079 --> 01:11:16,198
is and I think I I thought this came

1552
01:11:14,238 --> 01:11:19,879
from Miracle

1553
01:11:16,198 --> 01:11:21,238
15 which is the male that capul used to

1554
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:24,640
make the Mac

1555
01:11:21,238 --> 01:11:27,559
one and the reason I thought that is if

1556
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:29,079
we're on the the number three graph Now

1557
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:30,840
with uh the

1558
01:11:29,079 --> 01:11:34,559
catfish

1559
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:36,199
so cfish then the parents and go to the

1560
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:39,639
grandparents so in the

1561
01:11:36,198 --> 01:11:41,559
grandparents both dads are fish piss

1562
01:11:39,639 --> 01:11:44,600
they're fish piss number

1563
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:47,360
four um has been a really good strain

1564
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:49,480
for me uh and I'm going to go off topic

1565
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:52,439
just for a second and for Gabby so in

1566
01:11:49,479 --> 01:11:55,359
this particular one Gabby on fish fist

1567
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:57,158
when I when I selected the male

1568
01:11:55,359 --> 01:11:59,880
not only did I go through my regular

1569
01:11:57,158 --> 01:12:03,439
process about root growth and structure

1570
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:06,840
I actually put these in flower pulled

1571
01:12:03,439 --> 01:12:09,678
off all of the pollen sacks and then

1572
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:12,840
sent it to the lab to have the stock and

1573
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:16,359
the stems tested for

1574
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:18,679
THC and the variation was 1 and 1 half

1575
01:12:16,359 --> 01:12:22,319
to 2 and 1 12% with most of them around

1576
01:12:18,679 --> 01:12:25,440
two and fish piss number four uh came

1577
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:27,719
out at almost 2.6% THC just From the

1578
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:30,158
Rough plant itself so that's actually

1579
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:32,880
how I selected this male and this is

1580
01:12:30,158 --> 01:12:36,319
another one where almost everything I've

1581
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:38,520
touched um like the Cecil's green and

1582
01:12:36,319 --> 01:12:41,359
the macf fish Mac fish is in at

1583
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:43,400
dispensaries but Cecil green is is still

1584
01:12:41,359 --> 01:12:47,279
out in the dispensaries the fish piss

1585
01:12:43,399 --> 01:12:48,879
has done really really well so I this I

1586
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:51,880
don't know really what to call it but if

1587
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:53,960
you look at the Top Line and and you go

1588
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:56,239
up from Catfish to Cecil's green and

1589
01:12:53,960 --> 01:13:01,760
then look at the parents fish fish piss

1590
01:12:56,238 --> 01:13:06,559
and OCD M15 so what Top Line I see Fish

1591
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:08,239
piss and then Underneath It O ocdm 15

1592
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:10,960
right so those are the parents for

1593
01:13:08,238 --> 01:13:12,718
Cecil's green so what I'm doing and and

1594
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,399
literally it takes a couple years to do

1595
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:18,719
this I take the fish

1596
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:23,119
piss and I breed it to OCD

1597
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:28,920
M15 and there's nothing related in the

1598
01:13:23,119 --> 01:13:31,880
OCD M15 to fish piss so it's an

1599
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:34,679
outcross then drop down to the bottom

1600
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:39,000
parents underneath that and it's fish

1601
01:13:34,679 --> 01:13:40,960
piss and Mac one right okay so same

1602
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:44,359
thing there's no relation but what

1603
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:49,000
happens is if you take this two that a

1604
01:13:44,359 --> 01:13:51,399
circle OCD M15 and Mac 1 and go back up

1605
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:54,800
they both have the same

1606
01:13:51,399 --> 01:13:58,960
Father which is M15 of Miracle 15 which

1607
01:13:54,800 --> 01:14:02,079
is the the the lone mail that cap used

1608
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:04,119
uh to make these plants so I

1609
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:06,519
intentionally want the

1610
01:14:04,119 --> 01:14:09,039
great-grandfathers of the unrelated

1611
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:12,239
plants to be the

1612
01:14:09,039 --> 01:14:16,359
same so when the fish piss goes in and

1613
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:19,000
it meets Mac one it's interacting with

1614
01:14:16,359 --> 01:14:21,479
those genetics on the bottom to make Mac

1615
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:24,679
fish and then when the fish piss goes

1616
01:14:21,479 --> 01:14:26,718
into OC dm15 it's making Cecil's green

1617
01:14:24,679 --> 01:14:28,239
these are two different plants but the

1618
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:31,840
difference is if you look at the

1619
01:14:28,238 --> 01:14:34,119
genetics behind it the dad's the same

1620
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:36,880
and then the grandfather or the

1621
01:14:34,119 --> 01:14:39,800
great-grandfather is the same so what

1622
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:43,800
happens is when the AL match up on the

1623
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:47,199
genes whether it's a a multi- alil gene

1624
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:49,320
or just the two it's going to probably

1625
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:53,439
make

1626
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:55,799
homo recessive traits you you'll find

1627
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:58,198
something that that was didn't exist in

1628
01:14:55,800 --> 01:15:00,199
this previous generation like you got to

1629
01:14:58,198 --> 01:15:03,719
go back three or four generations to get

1630
01:15:00,198 --> 01:15:06,079
this done so when I did this I figured

1631
01:15:03,719 --> 01:15:07,600
I'm going to get some weird stuff this

1632
01:15:06,079 --> 01:15:10,238
is not a

1633
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,960
complimentary uh breeding whereas if I

1634
01:15:10,238 --> 01:15:14,238
did similar plants and brought them

1635
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:16,520
together this is a contrasting a

1636
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:18,238
contrasting breeding where I think I can

1637
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:20,280
bring out recessive traits so that's

1638
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:23,559
actually why I did this and then if you

1639
01:15:20,279 --> 01:15:26,079
go back and you look at the the um the

1640
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:29,880
albino the AL oo which is supposed to be

1641
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:35,119
one in a, is 20 to 25% of these

1642
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:37,480
seeds right so literally they grow up as

1643
01:15:35,119 --> 01:15:39,238
seedlings there's zero chlorophyll so

1644
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:41,839
somewhere back in the history and I

1645
01:15:39,238 --> 01:15:46,559
think we figured it out it's actually

1646
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:48,800
the the miracle 15 father starf

1647
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:51,000
fighter so there's some type of

1648
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:54,159
recessive trait all the way back in that

1649
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:57,560
starf fighter Gene that has has

1650
01:15:54,158 --> 01:15:59,679
something that shuts off

1651
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:02,440
chlorophyll

1652
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:05,239
um and so what happens is that's how I

1653
01:16:02,439 --> 01:16:07,000
get them and I literally it's 20 at 25%

1654
01:16:05,238 --> 01:16:09,439
which According to mendal which is what

1655
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,520
you should have right when you when you

1656
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:13,119
split those fenos and the re and I

1657
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:16,960
always thought it was Miracle

1658
01:16:13,119 --> 01:16:19,319
15 and um I got a note from Rick who

1659
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:21,800
runs U mosca seeds if you know mosa

1660
01:16:19,319 --> 01:16:24,439
seeds he he's come out with some really

1661
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:26,000
really nice stuff he I I like him a lot

1662
01:16:24,439 --> 01:16:30,638
he was tell telling me in his pink

1663
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:33,960
animal crackers he's had the occasional

1664
01:16:30,639 --> 01:16:36,440
albino and if you look at the pink

1665
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:39,359
animal crackers he's got a bunch of

1666
01:16:36,439 --> 01:16:41,399
starf fighter in there and I and I know

1667
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:43,000
the fish piss so I was pretty I was

1668
01:16:41,399 --> 01:16:45,679
pretty sure it didn't come from the fish

1669
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:49,479
fiss and that it came from the the you

1670
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:52,279
know the Mac dad um so I bring out

1671
01:16:49,479 --> 01:16:57,319
recessive traits

1672
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:59,960
now so if I grow out 20 seeds and 20 to

1673
01:16:57,319 --> 01:17:01,840
25% of them are albinos I don't even

1674
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:03,319
have to pick ones to kill they're dead

1675
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,560
in two

1676
01:17:03,319 --> 01:17:08,960
weeks right I mean there's no

1677
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:11,440
chlorophyll it can't grow and basically

1678
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:13,399
the codons generally hold food for what

1679
01:17:11,439 --> 01:17:16,000
10 to 14 days before you got to feed

1680
01:17:13,399 --> 01:17:19,479
them so the plant stays alive while the

1681
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:22,119
cleon's actually providing food to the

1682
01:17:19,479 --> 01:17:25,359
plant and as soon as the codons run out

1683
01:17:22,119 --> 01:17:29,000
of food plant's dead so something we

1684
01:17:25,359 --> 01:17:33,238
were talking about was grafting and I

1685
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:35,399
know we're in like Fantasy Land you know

1686
01:17:33,238 --> 01:17:38,599
now for a moment but I was thinking

1687
01:17:35,399 --> 01:17:39,679
about it after we spoke so I grow San

1688
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:42,800
Pedro

1689
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:45,359
cactus and there's been a you know many

1690
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:46,360
occurrence of variegated plants and um

1691
01:17:45,359 --> 01:17:50,880
some

1692
01:17:46,359 --> 01:17:55,000
albinos and when they're found the only

1693
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:57,719
way to grow them is to graft them to

1694
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,760
graft them to something that does have

1695
01:17:57,719 --> 01:18:03,279
chlorophyll and so you know we were

1696
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:05,400
talking about like could you graft them

1697
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:08,759
um these albinos you know to you there

1698
01:18:05,399 --> 01:18:11,079
was no benefit to me you know although

1699
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:13,600
I'm not I don't I'm not saying I'm ready

1700
01:18:11,079 --> 01:18:16,840
to do the work either there's there's

1701
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:18,960
curiosity and so what I wonder about is

1702
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:22,079
a couple of things number one could you

1703
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:25,800
actually graft something so small and

1704
01:18:22,079 --> 01:18:27,760
delicate um you know cuz C this you know

1705
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:31,480
they're they're much bigger even as

1706
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:34,480
seedlings you know they have a more of a

1707
01:18:31,479 --> 01:18:37,158
structure to to graft to and a Seedling

1708
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:39,519
the stem is so thin and soft I don't

1709
01:18:37,158 --> 01:18:42,960
know how you would um how you would do

1710
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:47,320
it but what I was fantasizing about was

1711
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:49,119
if you could get a albino like this to

1712
01:18:47,319 --> 01:18:52,039
flower and

1713
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:54,840
finish the tur profile on that would

1714
01:18:52,039 --> 01:18:56,399
have to be super unique

1715
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:58,360
because it has no

1716
01:18:56,399 --> 01:19:00,359
chlorophyll you know

1717
01:18:58,359 --> 01:19:03,920
so you know

1718
01:19:00,359 --> 01:19:07,639
because the chlorophyll has a strong

1719
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:10,359
impact on the way the flower tastes and

1720
01:19:07,639 --> 01:19:12,079
so to smoke a plant or consume a plant

1721
01:19:10,359 --> 01:19:15,279
that had no

1722
01:19:12,079 --> 01:19:17,559
chlorophyll I just found it as

1723
01:19:15,279 --> 01:19:19,920
intriguing yeah and you know my thoughts

1724
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:23,080
right I I don't think it can happen you

1725
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:25,560
don't think you can graft it no I I mean

1726
01:19:23,079 --> 01:19:28,039
maybe in a lab with somebody who is

1727
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:30,039
really really good at it maybe there's a

1728
01:19:28,039 --> 01:19:32,079
chance I I'm going to send you 20 seeds

1729
01:19:30,039 --> 01:19:33,920
you can do whatever you want you you

1730
01:19:32,079 --> 01:19:35,880
graft it I'd love to

1731
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:38,520
see but for

1732
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:40,480
me you know it's it's um you know

1733
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:43,000
Chinese proverb good luck bad luck who

1734
01:19:40,479 --> 01:19:44,678
can tell right for me it's better

1735
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,000
because I'm looking for something

1736
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:48,760
special and I think you don't get

1737
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,119
something really good without something

1738
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:52,920
bad and if there's something bad there's

1739
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:54,760
likely something good right it's kind of

1740
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:57,399
you know the kind of the karma thing in

1741
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:59,159
nature so the plant's automatically

1742
01:19:57,399 --> 01:20:02,439
calling

1743
01:19:59,158 --> 01:20:04,759
25% so now I've got kind of the middle

1744
01:20:02,439 --> 01:20:06,678
phenos and and the fenos that lean

1745
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:08,960
towards the fish piss so my feno

1746
01:20:06,679 --> 01:20:11,440
variation in these is

1747
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:14,000
smaller right I mean they're they're

1748
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:18,079
relatively consistent with there is some

1749
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:21,319
pheno variation but in this particular

1750
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:22,238
strain I have I found one plant uh the

1751
01:20:21,319 --> 01:20:27,599
number

1752
01:20:22,238 --> 01:20:30,039
11 where the other plants are mine and

1753
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:35,199
caropine which is you know kind of a

1754
01:20:30,039 --> 01:20:37,119
standard profile it's it's and and the

1755
01:20:35,198 --> 01:20:40,678
weed's kind it honestly the wheat's kind

1756
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:43,079
of special but this number 11 and the

1757
01:20:40,679 --> 01:20:45,158
other the the the ones that I tested the

1758
01:20:43,079 --> 01:20:48,760
the T pinoline was

1759
01:20:45,158 --> 01:20:52,198
minuscule this number 11 that the uh

1760
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:55,400
terpinolene is twice the turpine rate of

1761
01:20:52,198 --> 01:20:57,198
anything else in the plant

1762
01:20:55,399 --> 01:20:58,960
and and I like I could tell when it was

1763
01:20:57,198 --> 01:21:02,198
growing I could tell halfway through in

1764
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:04,439
flower it smells like sweet turpentine

1765
01:21:02,198 --> 01:21:07,519
like it's a really really nice plant and

1766
01:21:04,439 --> 01:21:09,678
I honestly I think that's the recessive

1767
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:13,000
traits from that same line coming

1768
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:15,399
forward and I think it's coming from the

1769
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:18,238
star fighter and the Colombian and I

1770
01:21:15,399 --> 01:21:21,079
think the star fighter created the um

1771
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:22,279
the albino piece and I think that that

1772
01:21:21,079 --> 01:21:25,359
really high

1773
01:21:22,279 --> 01:21:27,439
terpinolene that that that the the tur

1774
01:21:25,359 --> 01:21:29,519
profile that's coming out of that plant

1775
01:21:27,439 --> 01:21:30,960
I think is coming from the Colombia so

1776
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:35,840
if you look back it's like five

1777
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:37,520
generations back so I got a chance I

1778
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:40,039
still have to grow it inside because I

1779
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:42,719
grew them all outside last year or this

1780
01:21:40,039 --> 01:21:45,399
year I I got to grow it inside and see

1781
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:48,119
what the real timing is right like

1782
01:21:45,399 --> 01:21:50,359
exactly when I go to 1212 find out how

1783
01:21:48,119 --> 01:21:53,000
long it takes to flower but I think I

1784
01:21:50,359 --> 01:21:56,079
can get that kind of soaring Colombian

1785
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:58,399
high in a structure that I can grow

1786
01:21:56,079 --> 01:22:02,679
inside with a shorter flowering

1787
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:06,238
period and and honestly in this one

1788
01:22:02,679 --> 01:22:09,560
um one of the guys that that the guy who

1789
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:12,079
first grew these is out in LA and he's a

1790
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:15,039
ganji he he went through the ganier

1791
01:22:12,079 --> 01:22:19,119
program and he sent me a note that it's

1792
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:22,760
the most thought-provoking weed um and

1793
01:22:19,119 --> 01:22:24,198
and that's what I got I um you know we

1794
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:27,199
we talked about how long I've been

1795
01:22:24,198 --> 01:22:29,158
around for in the beginning it's

1796
01:22:27,198 --> 01:22:32,359
honestly the most thought-provoking weed

1797
01:22:29,158 --> 01:22:34,439
I've ever smoked I I actually when I and

1798
01:22:32,359 --> 01:22:36,359
it's happened to me twice in a week so

1799
01:22:34,439 --> 01:22:38,678
it wasn't just a One-Shot deal I gave it

1800
01:22:36,359 --> 01:22:41,719
some space and I tried it again but I

1801
01:22:38,679 --> 01:22:44,319
was I was thinking about a process and

1802
01:22:41,719 --> 01:22:47,319
then I started thinking about why I was

1803
01:22:44,319 --> 01:22:50,079
thinking that way about thinking about

1804
01:22:47,319 --> 01:22:52,559
the process it brought it brought me to

1805
01:22:50,079 --> 01:22:54,559
this like metal level of thinking and

1806
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:57,199
it's like I've never had a buzz like

1807
01:22:54,560 --> 01:23:00,719
that maybe you know maybe on

1808
01:22:57,198 --> 01:23:03,079
that excuse me may maybe on that c or in

1809
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:08,399
the 70s but like I've never had anything

1810
01:23:03,079 --> 01:23:12,600
like this so I I'm 100% working this PL

1811
01:23:08,399 --> 01:23:15,960
and it's because of the recessive traits

1812
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:19,760
so and like the OC just to finish up on

1813
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:21,760
this the OCD M15 was a larger stretchier

1814
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:24,280
plant and everybody knows what the Mac

1815
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:26,840
one's like right little Stout little Lea

1816
01:23:24,279 --> 01:23:28,639
ear leaves a little more shiny like so

1817
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:30,800
these plants were different even though

1818
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:32,840
they were kind of related so when I

1819
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:35,840
brought them in with the same male I

1820
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:38,199
think I've done this process gives me

1821
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:40,600
the recessive

1822
01:23:38,198 --> 01:23:42,238
traits um and I want to talk a little

1823
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:44,079
bit about something similar you have any

1824
01:23:42,238 --> 01:23:47,198
questions on that at all or you good

1825
01:23:44,079 --> 01:23:48,920
well the one thing I wanted to say is

1826
01:23:47,198 --> 01:23:51,519
first of all this is a

1827
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:53,719
uh it's a learning experience for me and

1828
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:55,639
I'm appreciating it something that you

1829
01:23:53,719 --> 01:23:58,239
mentioned earlier earlier was how

1830
01:23:55,639 --> 01:23:59,960
there's two different types of seeds the

1831
01:23:58,238 --> 01:24:03,599
seeds that give you what you know you're

1832
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:05,760
going to get and the seeds that give you

1833
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,719
the hunt yeah the hunt right the ability

1834
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:12,280
to hunt

1835
01:24:07,719 --> 01:24:16,239
and that is super true you know

1836
01:24:12,279 --> 01:24:20,639
that's you know that's exactly correct

1837
01:24:16,238 --> 01:24:23,198
and I think that knowing whether you're

1838
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:25,760
what you're looking for in that sense

1839
01:24:23,198 --> 01:24:27,879
and having you know know the the ability

1840
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:29,520
to maybe get something like

1841
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:32,840
that

1842
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:36,639
um that's that's what people want and I

1843
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:39,760
think that often that's not what is

1844
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:41,800
delivered you know like when you buy a

1845
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:46,320
pack of seeds

1846
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:49,400
from um most seed vendors it's kind of

1847
01:24:46,319 --> 01:24:52,719
like you don't know if it's going to be

1848
01:24:49,399 --> 01:24:56,839
consistent or if it's going to be you

1849
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:59,639
know the hunt and and for instance like

1850
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:02,360
let's say seeds are sold at a dispensary

1851
01:24:59,639 --> 01:25:05,400
to a you know a closet grower and he

1852
01:25:02,359 --> 01:25:08,960
sees the picture on on the pack or on

1853
01:25:05,399 --> 01:25:12,158
the flyer of it you know they wonder is

1854
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:13,158
is that what they're going to get and it

1855
01:25:12,158 --> 01:25:15,359
made me

1856
01:25:13,158 --> 01:25:17,319
remember you know something I always go

1857
01:25:15,359 --> 01:25:21,000
back and think about was when we

1858
01:25:17,319 --> 01:25:23,158
purchased the super skunk from

1859
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,158
Sensei you know I think we had a couple

1860
01:25:23,158 --> 01:25:27,599
of packs and we started them

1861
01:25:25,158 --> 01:25:30,158
and the uniformity was

1862
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:32,079
incredible you know to the point where

1863
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:34,319
we were able to just make a selection

1864
01:25:32,079 --> 01:25:37,679
and get rid of the rest of them

1865
01:25:34,319 --> 01:25:41,719
because they were all the same yeah cuz

1866
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:44,800
you work the line yeah and I would I

1867
01:25:41,719 --> 01:25:46,920
would hold the catalog it was a paper

1868
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:51,440
catalog from Sensei and I would hold it

1869
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:55,480
up against my bud every single crop that

1870
01:25:51,439 --> 01:25:58,960
I grew it just to be like holy [ __ ]

1871
01:25:55,479 --> 01:26:02,039
that's what it is you know and that's a

1872
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:04,198
pretty amazing an amazing feeling that

1873
01:26:02,039 --> 01:26:05,600
you're like I actually got it because

1874
01:26:04,198 --> 01:26:07,719
when we bought the seeds in Holland

1875
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:10,560
we're like are we getting ripped off are

1876
01:26:07,719 --> 01:26:12,920
we going to get what we want out of this

1877
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:16,360
and particularly with the super skunk it

1878
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:20,279
was exactly it and

1879
01:26:16,359 --> 01:26:22,479
then you know that was when we were more

1880
01:26:20,279 --> 01:26:25,439
beginners that growing and when we were

1881
01:26:22,479 --> 01:26:28,759
looking for something specific now the

1882
01:26:25,439 --> 01:26:30,158
idea of a hunt and being able to find

1883
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:33,520
something

1884
01:26:30,158 --> 01:26:35,920
special that is probably the most

1885
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:38,480
rewarding thing because you're not

1886
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:40,480
pulling out it's

1887
01:26:38,479 --> 01:26:42,678
unexpected you know so when you find

1888
01:26:40,479 --> 01:26:43,638
that something special you know through

1889
01:26:42,679 --> 01:26:46,760
the

1890
01:26:43,639 --> 01:26:48,520
hunt that's you know but actually think

1891
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:51,840
about what you just said right so

1892
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:54,560
sensy that consistent assume just make a

1893
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:57,360
general assumption the F the F4 or or

1894
01:26:54,560 --> 01:27:00,760
higher right so so they've got some

1895
01:26:57,359 --> 01:27:02,759
consistency but in the in the older days

1896
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:05,800
especially in the the straight black

1897
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:08,639
market days you wanted to know what you

1898
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:11,960
got yeah so so when you bought seeds

1899
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:13,279
they were generally worked lines because

1900
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:14,880
you know if especially if you were

1901
01:27:13,279 --> 01:27:17,599
humping up in the woods and you had to

1902
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:19,639
do stuff right you don't you don't want

1903
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:23,199
all sorts of surprises you want a nice

1904
01:27:19,639 --> 01:27:25,920
row you want a nice Gathering of similar

1905
01:27:23,198 --> 01:27:29,000
plants and then what's happened is as

1906
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:32,480
the as the the home Growers have come in

1907
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:36,158
and everybody sells seeds you get all

1908
01:27:32,479 --> 01:27:38,519
these different f1s so to get that stuff

1909
01:27:36,158 --> 01:27:41,079
you got to go to somebody who's worked

1910
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:42,239
the lines and how many people really

1911
01:27:41,079 --> 01:27:45,039
work the

1912
01:27:42,238 --> 01:27:47,799
lines and it does exist like I I'm doing

1913
01:27:45,039 --> 01:27:49,920
a little bit but it takes a long time

1914
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:52,480
right you got to know the plants I mean

1915
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:54,840
you got to believe that said you know

1916
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:57,479
there were years making those seeds that

1917
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:59,679
group right and and they get and they

1918
01:27:57,479 --> 01:28:03,198
getting to where they want so in this

1919
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:07,840
market you you got more of the

1920
01:28:03,198 --> 01:28:11,479
findoms and and I think if you do these

1921
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:13,440
um these hybrids yeah the poly hybrids I

1922
01:28:11,479 --> 01:28:15,638
don't think you find much right so I

1923
01:28:13,439 --> 01:28:18,960
mean and it's just my opinion I there

1924
01:28:15,639 --> 01:28:22,118
might be great weed but I I I think you

1925
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:24,639
got to bring out recessive traits from

1926
01:28:22,118 --> 01:28:28,158
from plants so

1927
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:30,840
I'm not inventing something I'm not

1928
01:28:28,158 --> 01:28:32,679
making something I'm trying to create a

1929
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:34,960
condition in the genetics where I'm

1930
01:28:32,679 --> 01:28:37,480
bring something that was already there

1931
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:40,399
just hasn't been seen yet so that's kind

1932
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:42,158
of fun to me like I like that a lot but

1933
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:45,519
I wonder sometimes when people are

1934
01:28:42,158 --> 01:28:48,158
buying like it it like take the catfish

1935
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:51,880
with the albinos somebody buys a pack of

1936
01:28:48,158 --> 01:28:53,920
10 seeds and they only plant two right

1937
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:56,159
cuz how many people actually go all 10

1938
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:58,000
like for me I'm doing I do 30 or 40

1939
01:28:56,158 --> 01:29:00,638
right but there's a ton of people that

1940
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:03,198
grow one or two seeds so if you bought

1941
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:05,199
those catfish seeds and you grew two of

1942
01:29:03,198 --> 01:29:08,198
them and they both turned white and died

1943
01:29:05,198 --> 01:29:10,879
in two weeks you're not a happy camper

1944
01:29:08,198 --> 01:29:13,158
right well if you if you know in advance

1945
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:15,800
you know it's got to come with something

1946
01:29:13,158 --> 01:29:18,879
on the stickers saying hey 20% of these

1947
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:22,360
seeds are going to be albino and will

1948
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:25,319
die within you know 15 to 20 days of

1949
01:29:22,359 --> 01:29:30,559
them being planted so you know the good

1950
01:29:25,319 --> 01:29:33,519
news is if they plant two out of um 10

1951
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:36,800
seeds and they're albinos probably you

1952
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:40,560
know the other eight ones will will not

1953
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:44,440
be you know so we we had one guy who got

1954
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:46,159
eight out of 10 ELP yeah it's just you

1955
01:29:44,439 --> 01:29:48,719
know and so that guy you know

1956
01:29:46,158 --> 01:29:50,839
considering who you are you just send

1957
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:52,000
them another pack of seeds and you know

1958
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:54,480
or tell them hey if you want to grow

1959
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:57,399
something else but this is how you find

1960
01:29:54,479 --> 01:30:00,599
something special you know this is this

1961
01:29:57,399 --> 01:30:05,118
is why it's this is why it's work and

1962
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:08,199
not just come easy right and if it was

1963
01:30:05,118 --> 01:30:10,719
easy everyone would be doing it you know

1964
01:30:08,198 --> 01:30:14,319
but it but it's not and you know hard

1965
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:16,279
work pays off so let me because I it's a

1966
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:19,118
it's a nice followup I think to this one

1967
01:30:16,279 --> 01:30:21,519
can you put up the um the pedigree chart

1968
01:30:19,118 --> 01:30:22,960
for number four doing that too I wanted

1969
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:24,360
to kind of bring up a point about what

1970
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:27,520
you guys were talking about as far as

1971
01:30:24,359 --> 01:30:29,399
like consistency with seeds too and you

1972
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:31,360
know a lot of the seed companies uh

1973
01:30:29,399 --> 01:30:33,960
these days their catalog is constantly

1974
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:35,559
changing you know they always have new

1975
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:37,880
strains every year you know there's

1976
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:39,440
always like a new line coming out but

1977
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:41,000
some of these other companies especially

1978
01:30:39,439 --> 01:30:43,519
the old school companies you know they

1979
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:45,719
have the same strains year after year

1980
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:48,159
and I think that is a kind of a good way

1981
01:30:45,719 --> 01:30:50,039
to um to show that you've been

1982
01:30:48,158 --> 01:30:52,118
consistently working with those strains

1983
01:30:50,039 --> 01:30:56,600
versus oh I just want something new to

1984
01:30:52,118 --> 01:30:58,519
sell you know and next different yeah do

1985
01:30:56,600 --> 01:31:01,280
you hear me Cosmic either that or it's

1986
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:02,920
[ __ ] yeah of course because like

1987
01:31:01,279 --> 01:31:04,920
sometimes what these seed companies are

1988
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:08,639
doing is they're just putting any seeds

1989
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:12,480
in the pack and so for instance if you

1990
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:14,760
order clone G for instance so that I'm

1991
01:31:12,479 --> 01:31:17,479
not you know putting anyone on blast but

1992
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:20,880
so if you or excuse me seeds the seed

1993
01:31:17,479 --> 01:31:22,919
genetic G right and they've run out of

1994
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:24,639
those they'll just put whatever they

1995
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:27,239
want in the pack

1996
01:31:24,639 --> 01:31:32,079
you know and that's why it's important

1997
01:31:27,238 --> 01:31:33,559
to buy um genetics from reputable people

1998
01:31:32,079 --> 01:31:36,158
that actually care about what they're

1999
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:39,080
doing you know and care about their

2000
01:31:36,158 --> 01:31:43,079
reputation more than they care about

2001
01:31:39,079 --> 01:31:47,158
just making one more cell yeah so but I

2002
01:31:43,079 --> 01:31:49,639
mean I know for a fact that um that's

2003
01:31:47,158 --> 01:31:53,000
common practice you know with with many

2004
01:31:49,639 --> 01:31:54,960
of these seed companies you know like to

2005
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:58,760
give you an example you know people make

2006
01:31:54,960 --> 01:32:00,960
a trip to Holland and you know buy some

2007
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:05,360
seeds most of these people are never

2008
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:08,039
coming back anyway you know so you know

2009
01:32:05,359 --> 01:32:11,799
and they want to have the full catalog

2010
01:32:08,039 --> 01:32:15,158
of seeds always so I think there's a lot

2011
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:17,760
of people that don't have proper ethics

2012
01:32:15,158 --> 01:32:18,960
in the game you know and so it's it's

2013
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:22,639
important to

2014
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:24,560
know who you're working with mhm

2015
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:29,279
absolutely I'm sure Bob agrees with that

2016
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:32,039
too I do I I stay pretty

2017
01:32:29,279 --> 01:32:33,519
tight um let's look I got that I got

2018
01:32:32,039 --> 01:32:38,000
that chart too number four yeah we got

2019
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:41,400
the number four up so um Frosty

2020
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:43,479
mcfish and frosty fish is the dad and

2021
01:32:41,399 --> 01:32:48,238
the macf fish six is the mom so it's the

2022
01:32:43,479 --> 01:32:51,559
same mom as catfish right okay okay but

2023
01:32:48,238 --> 01:32:54,599
now this is a complimentary

2024
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:59,239
breeding so

2025
01:32:54,600 --> 01:33:02,119
the two go back to father grandfather

2026
01:32:59,238 --> 01:33:04,599
you got the two fish pisses right in the

2027
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:08,319
third column and then underneath it is

2028
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:10,440
boss Frost which I got from uh Patrick

2029
01:33:08,319 --> 01:33:13,519
at pico Brands he's out in he's a

2030
01:33:10,439 --> 01:33:17,039
California guy he was very nice and gave

2031
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:20,199
me some S3s from this boss Frost which

2032
01:33:17,039 --> 01:33:22,359
is just an absolute monster so I grew a

2033
01:33:20,198 --> 01:33:25,238
whole bunch of those and bred this one

2034
01:33:22,359 --> 01:33:27,118
and then you can see on the bottom of of

2035
01:33:25,238 --> 01:33:29,559
the same grandparents it's fish piss

2036
01:33:27,118 --> 01:33:33,000
with Mac one right so

2037
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:34,480
now phosphoros and Mac one they have

2038
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:37,359
nothing in

2039
01:33:34,479 --> 01:33:40,559
common so I'm not going to get the same

2040
01:33:37,359 --> 01:33:43,399
kind of a le battle on the jeans because

2041
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:46,080
they're separate so fish pisses one over

2042
01:33:43,399 --> 01:33:48,399
boss Frost for a Leal position and the

2043
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:49,960
same thing with Mac one so when I when I

2044
01:33:48,399 --> 01:33:52,039
did this

2045
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:54,319
breeding I assume this is a

2046
01:33:52,039 --> 01:33:56,238
complimentary breeding and I'm going to

2047
01:33:54,319 --> 01:33:57,759
get much more

2048
01:33:56,238 --> 01:34:01,000
consistent

2049
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:04,159
phenotypes and it's exactly what I got

2050
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:07,439
the all the plants basically look very

2051
01:34:04,158 --> 01:34:11,079
very similar and the pheno variation is

2052
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:13,759
basically in stretch so 20 or 25% will

2053
01:34:11,079 --> 01:34:14,559
be a little taller and 20 or 25% will be

2054
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,840
a little

2055
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:20,280
shorter but if you looked at them from

2056
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:22,920
above and looked at the just the the the

2057
01:34:20,279 --> 01:34:25,079
leaf morphology and and and not

2058
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:29,840
necessarily the not they all look the

2059
01:34:25,079 --> 01:34:31,600
same so this was done to try to add even

2060
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:33,800
more cuz the fish piss added a lot of

2061
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:37,159
potency to Everything I did and none of

2062
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:40,719
the fish piss Prodigy came out less than

2063
01:34:37,158 --> 01:34:42,158
probably 24% they're all 24 to 30% all

2064
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:44,800
the different prodigies I've had with

2065
01:34:42,158 --> 01:34:46,960
fish piss like this Frosty fish this is

2066
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:49,400
still in dispensaries and and this is a

2067
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:53,198
couple years old but that's that's still

2068
01:34:49,399 --> 01:34:55,238
in dispensaries um um so you know kind

2069
01:34:53,198 --> 01:34:57,599
of valid Ates the potency so I did this

2070
01:34:55,238 --> 01:34:59,718
as a compliment cross and I wanted to

2071
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:02,440
show it so that if you looked at the

2072
01:34:59,719 --> 01:35:04,480
other en cfish and you look at this one

2073
01:35:02,439 --> 01:35:06,799
they kind of look similar but what are

2074
01:35:04,479 --> 01:35:09,678
the differences the difference is on the

2075
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:11,520
on the on the way back on the mom's side

2076
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:13,760
I've got relations that I think are

2077
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:15,880
going to conflict when they finally come

2078
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:18,880
together and give me those recessive

2079
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:22,199
traits and in this one I don't have that

2080
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:25,960
and if you look on the very bottom left

2081
01:35:22,198 --> 01:35:28,198
this is a note from uh year and a half

2082
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:31,198
ago I think this would go really good

2083
01:35:28,198 --> 01:35:35,279
with Miracle glue and Miracle

2084
01:35:31,198 --> 01:35:37,039
glue is from cap capulator and it's

2085
01:35:35,279 --> 01:35:39,319
where's this note at it's it's right

2086
01:35:37,039 --> 01:35:43,359
under the four it's it's one of my notes

2087
01:35:39,319 --> 01:35:45,198
from 2023 oh it says medical glue right

2088
01:35:43,359 --> 01:35:47,359
so what I'm doing is I'm always looking

2089
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:50,118
at the pedigree to find out is it

2090
01:35:47,359 --> 01:35:52,238
complimentary is it contrasting am I

2091
01:35:50,118 --> 01:35:54,639
going to am I going to increase pheno

2092
01:35:52,238 --> 01:35:57,000
variation am I going to DEC increase F

2093
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:59,800
variation so that's why when we started

2094
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:02,198
talking about the males that also plays

2095
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:04,239
into what I'm looking for am I looking

2096
01:36:02,198 --> 01:36:06,599
to create conflict or am I or am I

2097
01:36:04,238 --> 01:36:08,879
looking to complement the line so if you

2098
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:11,360
look at this breeding with the frosty

2099
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:15,679
mcfish you got boss Frost which is

2100
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:19,439
Gorilla Glue and Mac one well Miracle

2101
01:36:15,679 --> 01:36:24,079
glue is basically the miracle 15 which

2102
01:36:19,439 --> 01:36:27,359
is the um the dad of of Mac Ju

2103
01:36:24,079 --> 01:36:28,880
and Gorilla Glue so both grandmothers on

2104
01:36:27,359 --> 01:36:30,559
this are going to match the plant I'm

2105
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,679
going and it's actually a project I'm

2106
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:36,239
doing right now I've already selected

2107
01:36:32,679 --> 01:36:40,239
the miracle glue um

2108
01:36:36,238 --> 01:36:44,879
female was done in a bench with

2109
01:36:40,238 --> 01:36:49,079
40 and it was in an R&amp;D room and all the

2110
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:52,319
plants got PM except for this one

2111
01:36:49,079 --> 01:36:54,039
plant and it there's a picture on my

2112
01:36:52,319 --> 01:36:56,198
Instagram I didn't send it to

2113
01:36:54,039 --> 01:36:58,519
that the the fan leaves are covered in

2114
01:36:56,198 --> 01:37:00,319
trikes like I've never seen oh I

2115
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:02,719
actually saw that page that picture on

2116
01:37:00,319 --> 01:37:04,439
your Instagram yeah so that's that

2117
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:06,760
that's this miracle now the plant's

2118
01:37:04,439 --> 01:37:08,479
smaller right it's probably not going to

2119
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:09,560
work for the guys in the dispensary

2120
01:37:08,479 --> 01:37:12,039
because they're not going to get the

2121
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:14,480
yield yield from from the lights because

2122
01:37:12,039 --> 01:37:17,840
it's a small plant but instead of

2123
01:37:14,479 --> 01:37:21,279
picking the plant that was more robust I

2124
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:24,239
want specifically to G to breed Miracle

2125
01:37:21,279 --> 01:37:27,439
glue number four which is very PM

2126
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:29,479
resistant and was just absolutely loaded

2127
01:37:27,439 --> 01:37:32,198
with trikes so

2128
01:37:29,479 --> 01:37:34,718
now this Frosty MC fish that I want to

2129
01:37:32,198 --> 01:37:37,000
breed into it I literally am doing it as

2130
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:38,719
we speak I watered them this morning I

2131
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:41,800
got 13

2132
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:44,880
males and as I mentioned before I I'm

2133
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:47,480
really a big fan of root growth I'm I I

2134
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:50,118
I still take my notes once a week on on

2135
01:37:47,479 --> 01:37:52,919
what I think root growth is but the uh

2136
01:37:50,118 --> 01:37:57,198
the primary driver for a male selection

2137
01:37:52,920 --> 01:38:00,399
to breathe to this miracle glue is PM

2138
01:37:57,198 --> 01:38:03,479
resistance so if you look at my tent

2139
01:38:00,399 --> 01:38:06,799
right now I got 13 plants about eight

2140
01:38:03,479 --> 01:38:09,319
nodes High and the and all the leaves

2141
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:11,880
are touching every other leaves there's

2142
01:38:09,319 --> 01:38:15,759
no space between the plants right I got

2143
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:19,319
13 decent sized plants filling up a a

2144
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:20,360
4x4 I turn the air down and I shut off

2145
01:38:19,319 --> 01:38:23,039
all the

2146
01:38:20,359 --> 01:38:25,279
fans and and and I'm in a I'm in a

2147
01:38:23,039 --> 01:38:28,399
basement of a 30-year-old house I don't

2148
01:38:25,279 --> 01:38:32,118
have a problem getting PM all right I

2149
01:38:28,399 --> 01:38:34,519
can get PM anytime I want to get it so

2150
01:38:32,118 --> 01:38:38,479
uh so far I found three plants that had

2151
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:41,480
pm and then I clean them I put them back

2152
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:43,319
in and I rotate them so that they all

2153
01:38:41,479 --> 01:38:45,879
eventually over the next month will all

2154
01:38:43,319 --> 01:38:48,319
end up in a different spot so if there's

2155
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:50,679
a real dead spot in the tent that that

2156
01:38:48,319 --> 01:38:52,399
one corner is always getting it or some

2157
01:38:50,679 --> 01:38:54,399
plant in The Middle's covered by leaves

2158
01:38:52,399 --> 01:38:56,759
they're always getting it I literally am

2159
01:38:54,399 --> 01:38:58,399
rotating the plants around now and I'm

2160
01:38:56,760 --> 01:39:00,880
telling you I'm doing as we speak so am

2161
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:04,359
I going to be successful I have no idea

2162
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:06,960
but my goal is if I'm really going to to

2163
01:39:04,359 --> 01:39:09,399
go after this miracle glue this is a

2164
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:12,239
complimentary breeding because it's

2165
01:39:09,399 --> 01:39:14,759
generally the same I get to add in the F

2166
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:19,079
the the the the the proven plants from

2167
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:21,199
the Frosty mcfish and if I'm lucky out

2168
01:39:19,079 --> 01:39:23,960
of these 13 plants and it's not a huge

2169
01:39:21,198 --> 01:39:26,279
sample but out of these 13 plants if I

2170
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:28,439
can find a couple that don't get PM

2171
01:39:26,279 --> 01:39:30,960
while the rest of them are getting PM

2172
01:39:28,439 --> 01:39:34,519
that's the primary motivator for me

2173
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:36,599
selecting a mail so like you said grow

2174
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:37,800
them out check the progyny do that stuff

2175
01:39:36,599 --> 01:39:40,920
like we were talking about in the

2176
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:43,679
beginning I think that's fine doing root

2177
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:46,158
selection and and morphology to match

2178
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:49,399
something that's fine in this particular

2179
01:39:46,158 --> 01:39:52,079
case I already know the weed's good I

2180
01:39:49,399 --> 01:39:54,519
know the plants are good can I can I get

2181
01:39:52,079 --> 01:39:57,039
lucky and find something that's PM

2182
01:39:54,520 --> 01:40:00,560
resistant and breed it to another like

2183
01:39:57,039 --> 01:40:03,599
plant that's PM resistant that should

2184
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:06,719
increase my odds of getting a really

2185
01:40:03,599 --> 01:40:08,960
nice plant that is less susceptible to

2186
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:12,439
PM so that's what I'm trying to

2187
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:16,000
do it's funny because it reminds me of

2188
01:40:12,439 --> 01:40:18,118
another strain in the sensey Seed

2189
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Catalog trying to remember I think it

2190
01:40:18,118 --> 01:40:24,559
was the Oasis but I'm not 100% sure but

2191
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:27,000
it said that it was spider it

2192
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:30,920
resistant and we wanted to buy that

2193
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:35,399
strain for breeding because you know

2194
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:37,599
this was in the '90s we really didn't

2195
01:40:35,399 --> 01:40:41,238
have a clue about how to deal with

2196
01:40:37,599 --> 01:40:43,560
pests and you know getting a strain that

2197
01:40:41,238 --> 01:40:47,158
spider might resistant that's like okay

2198
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:49,880
got to have that you know so powdery

2199
01:40:47,158 --> 01:40:54,439
Milo resistant is

2200
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:56,520
uh definitely a good quality but I mean

2201
01:40:54,439 --> 01:40:58,238
generally you know any of the plants

2202
01:40:56,520 --> 01:41:00,560
that are more vigorous and healthy are

2203
01:40:58,238 --> 01:41:02,118
going to be more resistant right yeah

2204
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:03,679
but these are all you don't even have to

2205
01:41:02,118 --> 01:41:05,839
you don't even have to create a powdery

2206
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:07,960
mildew Factory like you're trying to do

2207
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:10,159
over there to to find the ones that get

2208
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:11,920
it first you know you could pretty much

2209
01:41:10,158 --> 01:41:13,679
look at the plants that are strongest

2210
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:14,800
and healthiest will generally be the

2211
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:16,760
most

2212
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:18,960
resilient that type stuff if you go if

2213
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:22,239
you go look at the page they're all

2214
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:24,560
solid I mean it's I mean because I I

2215
01:41:22,238 --> 01:41:26,598
I've you know my my intent is to breed

2216
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:30,080
that way for root growth and solid

2217
01:41:26,599 --> 01:41:32,719
structure so out of the 13 I I actually

2218
01:41:30,079 --> 01:41:35,118
killed one this morning and and it's

2219
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:38,118
because in the two times I tested it got

2220
01:41:35,118 --> 01:41:40,639
PM each time and it was one of the

2221
01:41:38,118 --> 01:41:42,399
weaker root plants so I no matter what

2222
01:41:40,639 --> 01:41:45,118
happens to that plant I would never use

2223
01:41:42,399 --> 01:41:48,079
it so I as of this morning I'm down to

2224
01:41:45,118 --> 01:41:50,198
12 but to go through that

2225
01:41:48,079 --> 01:41:52,279
process I mean you can find them I've

2226
01:41:50,198 --> 01:41:54,118
seen them you see them on a bench you

2227
01:41:52,279 --> 01:41:57,319
know plant the I I've got another one

2228
01:41:54,118 --> 01:42:02,238
that's it's a ghost dog it doesn't get

2229
01:41:57,319 --> 01:42:03,920
pm and and so I found a couple other so

2230
01:42:02,238 --> 01:42:06,000
in in addition to doing the stuff I like

2231
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:07,760
with the long flowering I really want to

2232
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:09,960
get this done because I I know it's good

2233
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:12,599
weed and if I can create that other

2234
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:15,000
input where these these jeans hook up

2235
01:42:12,599 --> 01:42:17,639
together and and give me some PM

2236
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:20,479
resistance that's a big especially in

2237
01:42:17,639 --> 01:42:21,520
New England in the fall it it's a it's a

2238
01:42:20,479 --> 01:42:23,959
huge

2239
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:28,280
plus you guys might one thing I wanted

2240
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:32,880
to do at this time I wanted to direct

2241
01:42:28,279 --> 01:42:37,519
people to your Instagram which is Boston

everybody go uh give them a follow only

2245
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:49,119
if you're not trolls trolls stay away

2246
01:42:46,039 --> 01:42:51,118
trolls stay away so so so before before

2247
01:42:49,118 --> 01:42:53,598
you go let me let me finish up with one

2248
01:42:51,118 --> 01:42:55,279
thing can you throw up the number two

2249
01:42:53,599 --> 01:42:57,119
the picture of the plant

2250
01:42:55,279 --> 01:43:01,158
outside sure um are you growing

2251
01:42:57,118 --> 01:43:03,079
hydroponically or um with soil soil only

2252
01:43:01,158 --> 01:43:04,759
um how are you uh keeping track of the

2253
01:43:03,079 --> 01:43:06,439
root growth are you just popping it out

2254
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:08,800
of the the container there and taking a

2255
01:43:06,439 --> 01:43:10,919
peek I that's why I don't I don't use

2256
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:13,679
fabric right because you can't pull them

2257
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:17,679
MH or or maybe you can but I can't I use

2258
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:19,840
plastic pots I I and um I flip them all

2259
01:43:17,679 --> 01:43:21,840
the time when I when I start when I

2260
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:25,000
start my seedlings I actually start my

2261
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:26,719
seedlings in a 7 oz cup so I'm actually

2262
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:30,520
looking at the root growth in the first

2263
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:33,439
two weeks okay so I track that then they

2264
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:36,320
go to a Solo Cup maybe sometimes they'll

2265
01:43:33,439 --> 01:43:39,359
go to one gallon I try to I try to upart

2266
01:43:36,319 --> 01:43:43,719
a minimum of three times four times if I

2267
01:43:39,359 --> 01:43:45,679
can so each time you know I'm I'm I'm

2268
01:43:43,719 --> 01:43:48,198
not using micro High I generally use

2269
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:52,440
recharge I like recharge when I when I

2270
01:43:48,198 --> 01:43:54,719
dust my holes um and I I I just I

2271
01:43:52,439 --> 01:43:57,079
constantly check and I I try not you

2272
01:43:54,719 --> 01:44:00,359
know I I'll if I make a decision early

2273
01:43:57,079 --> 01:44:02,359
it's it's amazing actually over time and

2274
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:05,399
it's not always true so I want to say

2275
01:44:02,359 --> 01:44:07,559
that it's absolutely not always true but

2276
01:44:05,399 --> 01:44:09,920
if you track root growth from a 7 ounce

2277
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:12,360
to one gallon to a two gallon to a three

2278
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:14,039
gallon you'll find out that the ones

2279
01:44:12,359 --> 01:44:15,598
that had the strongest root growth in

2280
01:44:14,039 --> 01:44:18,079
the first couple

2281
01:44:15,599 --> 01:44:19,840
weeks they they're the strongest plants

2282
01:44:18,079 --> 01:44:24,158
like throughout the whole cycle of the

2283
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:26,679
plant now my guess is that's 80 to 90%

2284
01:44:24,158 --> 01:44:28,879
cuz there's always some that come on

2285
01:44:26,679 --> 01:44:31,079
late and they're really great plants so

2286
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:35,440
it it's not a determining factor for me

2287
01:44:31,079 --> 01:44:35,439
but it's a piece of data to him now I

2288
01:44:39,719 --> 01:44:45,599
forgot so this th this

2289
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:48,880
plant and the reason I'm showing is just

2290
01:44:45,599 --> 01:44:51,319
because we've talked about cfish mafish

2291
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:53,880
number six was the mom we talked about

2292
01:44:51,319 --> 01:44:55,359
Frosty mcfish which is a complimentary

2293
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:59,000
breeding that I'm going to use to

2294
01:44:55,359 --> 01:45:01,679
Miracle grou this is the mom so this is

2295
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,679
from the

2296
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:07,679
2022 23 24 I think this is this is a

2297
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:11,119
2022 season I

2298
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:13,000
think uh and that plant's 12 feet tall

2299
01:45:11,118 --> 01:45:15,359
and every one of those colas is bigger

2300
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:18,719
than your arm he those are impressive

2301
01:45:15,359 --> 01:45:21,198
colas yeah be seated or not seated nope

2302
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:26,279
we just growing the

2303
01:45:21,198 --> 01:45:27,960
plant um but so I use coasta main soil I

2304
01:45:26,279 --> 01:45:30,960
I don't use any

2305
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:33,039
folur I keep the process really simple

2306
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:35,599
and it gets rain or it gets watered and

2307
01:45:33,039 --> 01:45:38,079
that's about it I do some I do I do do

2308
01:45:35,599 --> 01:45:40,639
some IPM but I'm not I'm not doing

2309
01:45:38,079 --> 01:45:41,880
anything to accelerate the growth but

2310
01:45:40,639 --> 01:45:45,000
this

2311
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:46,520
plant and just like the Mac right I mean

2312
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:49,079
you know you don't get a ton of seeds

2313
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:50,679
you get some different variations I was

2314
01:45:49,079 --> 01:45:53,800
joking around the stuff that comes from

2315
01:45:50,679 --> 01:45:56,319
Mac 1 is gems and junk which I like cuz

2316
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:58,719
you can you can can the junk early and

2317
01:45:56,319 --> 01:46:01,319
there and there and there's some gems in

2318
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:04,599
there so

2319
01:46:01,319 --> 01:46:07,399
um but when I talk about the breedings

2320
01:46:04,599 --> 01:46:09,639
and the intent and the males to be used

2321
01:46:07,399 --> 01:46:12,279
this is the girl I got in

2322
01:46:09,639 --> 01:46:14,400
22 and it takes years right you got to

2323
01:46:12,279 --> 01:46:17,319
grow out a couple to find the right one

2324
01:46:14,399 --> 01:46:19,279
then I find the right one it's like okay

2325
01:46:17,319 --> 01:46:21,559
what's going to be complimentary what's

2326
01:46:19,279 --> 01:46:23,198
what's going to go into this like I I

2327
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:25,719
know that all the fish piss going to

2328
01:46:23,198 --> 01:46:27,919
have merine and carop philene in them

2329
01:46:25,719 --> 01:46:29,439
right so if I want a complimentary I'm

2330
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:32,039
going to do something that's similar to

2331
01:46:29,439 --> 01:46:34,559
that I'm not necessarily going to hit it

2332
01:46:32,039 --> 01:46:35,359
with a with a you know a plant that's

2333
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:37,520
all

2334
01:46:35,359 --> 01:46:39,399
piny right because I'm not sure what

2335
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:41,880
that intend what that's going to produce

2336
01:46:39,399 --> 01:46:45,000
I know that if I take a a mercine and

2337
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:46,679
caropine plant or or genetics that are

2338
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:48,880
heavy in that then I'm going to get a

2339
01:46:46,679 --> 01:46:51,880
complimentary and I I may be able to

2340
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:53,960
find something even a little better so

2341
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:56,760
I'm always looking at the plants and

2342
01:46:53,960 --> 01:46:58,920
figuring how they can go together and

2343
01:46:56,760 --> 01:47:00,639
and with this one plant I did a

2344
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:03,599
complimentary which we just showed the

2345
01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:05,760
frosty MC fish with a very uniform it's

2346
01:47:03,599 --> 01:47:10,079
really good weed and then I showed the

2347
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:13,400
cfish which has got this bizarre

2348
01:47:10,079 --> 01:47:17,158
thinking man's weed in the

2349
01:47:13,399 --> 01:47:18,679
um um in the albinos so they both came

2350
01:47:17,158 --> 01:47:22,920
from the same

2351
01:47:18,679 --> 01:47:25,719
mom right I mean or or the this mom was

2352
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:27,920
a key in both of those breedings and the

2353
01:47:25,719 --> 01:47:31,439
plants are going to be completely

2354
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:34,599
different so you really can direct the

2355
01:47:31,439 --> 01:47:36,238
plant the way you want it to go well I

2356
01:47:34,599 --> 01:47:39,000
you can try like I said you're going to

2357
01:47:36,238 --> 01:47:40,759
have some fails but that's the fun far

2358
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:43,279
for me I just wanted to show this CU we

2359
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:45,760
were talking about all the the the moms

2360
01:47:43,279 --> 01:47:48,238
in the other breedings I know we haven't

2361
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:50,320
scratched the surface with you so I hope

2362
01:47:48,238 --> 01:47:53,479
we can make some time you know like this

2363
01:47:50,319 --> 01:47:55,880
is ultra long form

2364
01:47:53,479 --> 01:47:57,118
over here we're not looking for you know

2365
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:59,000
like before you said oh I'm just going

2366
01:47:57,118 --> 01:48:01,559
to tell you this quickly we don't want

2367
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:05,560
you to tell us stuff quickly um we want

2368
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:07,320
the the long form story but you know

2369
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:12,560
that just might mean that we have to

2370
01:48:07,319 --> 01:48:15,840
schedule part two also I want to ask you

2371
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:18,199
if you would want to do our other show

2372
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:21,000
with Nick which is called The Way We

2373
01:48:18,198 --> 01:48:23,519
Grow I know he would love to have you on

2374
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:26,760
because that one more focuses on

2375
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:31,440
the way you grow you know and we can get

2376
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:33,159
into depth on um on that but you know we

2377
01:48:31,439 --> 01:48:36,678
still have a little time and I hope

2378
01:48:33,158 --> 01:48:39,399
you'll accept my invitation to come back

2379
01:48:36,679 --> 01:48:43,279
you know as many times as it takes till

2380
01:48:39,399 --> 01:48:45,559
we get your story out there you are uh

2381
01:48:43,279 --> 01:48:48,039
the answer is yes and thank you and and

2382
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:49,520
I'm the same as you he you start you

2383
01:48:48,039 --> 01:48:51,479
start talking about weed you could talk

2384
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:53,560
about it forever well we probably don't

2385
01:48:51,479 --> 01:48:55,158
have time to even get into it but um I

2386
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:57,599
still wanted to ask it just so you can

2387
01:48:55,158 --> 01:49:01,118
start thinking about it Bob um for the

2388
01:48:57,599 --> 01:49:02,880
Mac one I I've heard um and I don't know

2389
01:49:01,118 --> 01:49:04,719
if I'm pronouncing this correctly uh you

2390
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:06,520
know it's that's what happens when you

2391
01:49:04,719 --> 01:49:10,079
read things you don't really speak about

2392
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:11,520
it but I've heard that it's a triploid

2393
01:49:10,079 --> 01:49:13,399
uh which means that it has like a third

2394
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:16,480
chromosone and it's one of the unique

2395
01:49:13,399 --> 01:49:18,118
traits of the Mac one but uh another

2396
01:49:16,479 --> 01:49:21,158
thing about that is it makes it really

2397
01:49:18,118 --> 01:49:23,000
hard to breed with um for some reason it

2398
01:49:21,158 --> 01:49:24,039
leaves you with a lot of immature seeds

2399
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,880
and again this is just something I've

2400
01:49:24,039 --> 01:49:27,880
read about so the fact that you've

2401
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:29,480
actually worked with this plant um it's

2402
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:32,359
very interesting to me to hear you know

2403
01:49:29,479 --> 01:49:34,000
from your experience first hand um about

2404
01:49:32,359 --> 01:49:36,639
how that plant reacts to you know

2405
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:39,238
breeding projects so Mac

2406
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:42,520
one I I've seen the triploid back and

2407
01:49:39,238 --> 01:49:45,598
forth I I don't pay a ton of attention

2408
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:47,880
to it because I know what the plant does

2409
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:51,279
and I know what it can do right

2410
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:55,000
so to me the plant itself is important

2411
01:49:51,279 --> 01:49:56,800
but not off track I I don't know that

2412
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,960
I've ever got more

2413
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:03,159
than 70

2414
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:06,880
seeds off of a Mac one and and it it's

2415
01:50:03,158 --> 01:50:08,679
generally in the 25 to 50 range um and

2416
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:11,359
they give you an EXA and it's kind of

2417
01:50:08,679 --> 01:50:12,920
strange we we we just finished talking

2418
01:50:11,359 --> 01:50:15,039
about that Frosty

2419
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:17,599
mcfish

2420
01:50:15,039 --> 01:50:19,238
so no nobody really tells you what they

2421
01:50:17,599 --> 01:50:20,840
get for seeds because everybody wants to

2422
01:50:19,238 --> 01:50:22,919
buy seeds that they can't that nobody

2423
01:50:20,840 --> 01:50:25,360
else can get right so they don't talk

2424
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:30,840
about the different numbers that Frosty

2425
01:50:25,359 --> 01:50:31,719
mcfish in a 4x4 tent at a 4ot plant gave

2426
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:33,880
me

2427
01:50:31,719 --> 01:50:35,439
9,000

2428
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:37,760
seats

2429
01:50:35,439 --> 01:50:39,399
and I'm growing them right now they're

2430
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:42,880
all growing they're all German they're

2431
01:50:39,399 --> 01:50:45,279
all solid 9,000 seeds that that same

2432
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:46,480
size plant if it was a Mac one would be

2433
01:50:45,279 --> 01:50:48,840
50

2434
01:50:46,479 --> 01:50:51,879
seeds and it's one of the reasons why

2435
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:55,279
you don't see a lot of breeding in with

2436
01:50:51,880 --> 01:50:58,078
the Mac 1 cuz it's more work and you're

2437
01:50:55,279 --> 01:51:00,039
not going to get a ton of stuff like

2438
01:50:58,078 --> 01:51:03,319
that Mac fish 6 I don't think there's

2439
01:51:00,039 --> 01:51:06,238
any more seats I mean most of the ones I

2440
01:51:03,319 --> 01:51:07,679
have I have mac I did a Mac red which is

2441
01:51:06,238 --> 01:51:10,198
around I've

2442
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:13,599
never I never released

2443
01:51:10,198 --> 01:51:16,279
it um it's around here but it's the same

2444
01:51:13,599 --> 01:51:19,239
thing I think I've got you know enough

2445
01:51:16,279 --> 01:51:22,599
seeds to maybe go and find one more

2446
01:51:19,238 --> 01:51:24,479
plant but we grew them over three years

2447
01:51:22,599 --> 01:51:26,719
and you end up basically with the max

2448
01:51:24,479 --> 01:51:28,198
you end up with one plant cuz you just

2449
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:31,319
you don't have that many to search

2450
01:51:28,198 --> 01:51:34,000
through but yeah 100% it's it's a very

2451
01:51:31,319 --> 01:51:35,679
tough plant to get seeds out of I I

2452
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,760
didn't even get dead seeds you just

2453
01:51:35,679 --> 01:51:39,520
don't get

2454
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:41,719
them okay and is that a trait that

2455
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:44,480
you've noticed it's passed along to The

2456
01:51:41,719 --> 01:51:47,319
Offspring that it's produced no cuz I

2457
01:51:44,479 --> 01:51:50,000
used the the Mac

2458
01:51:47,319 --> 01:51:52,799
fish um gave me a ton of seeds and then

2459
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:55,359
the frosty Mac fish gives the plant they

2460
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:58,239
gave me 9,000

2461
01:51:55,359 --> 01:52:00,839
seeds but you know the the mac's a nice

2462
01:51:58,238 --> 01:52:01,879
strong plant and and and it adds a whole

2463
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:04,239
bunch of

2464
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:06,760
frost and and the thing is you if you

2465
01:52:04,238 --> 01:52:10,319
bring flavor into it and I I tried to

2466
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:14,400
bring the spice into it and the the fish

2467
01:52:10,319 --> 01:52:17,399
piss brings this kind of umami flavor in

2468
01:52:14,399 --> 01:52:20,439
um you bring flavor in

2469
01:52:17,399 --> 01:52:22,279
like talking to Gabby before about uh

2470
01:52:20,439 --> 01:52:23,598
you know the mail bringing structure and

2471
01:52:22,279 --> 01:52:25,719
stuff stuff like that without bringing

2472
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:27,880
something to the party would not be a

2473
01:52:25,719 --> 01:52:29,639
great idea for me if it was the Mac one

2474
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:32,118
I think you bring something into the Mac

2475
01:52:29,639 --> 01:52:34,599
one and you get something better

2476
01:52:32,118 --> 01:52:36,279
out but when you get see honestly when

2477
01:52:34,599 --> 01:52:39,078
you get stuff you're going to get some

2478
01:52:36,279 --> 01:52:40,880
junk like they're going to be squirly

2479
01:52:39,078 --> 01:52:42,439
and everybody wants to try to save that

2480
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:46,599
squirrly plant because it could be the

2481
01:52:42,439 --> 01:52:48,519
next chem dog right I I I've never found

2482
01:52:46,599 --> 01:52:50,560
any success dealing with the squirely

2483
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:54,000
plants coming out of the Mac I've tried

2484
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:56,199
a couple and and from you know now it's

2485
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,599
I I I know which ones are going to well

2486
01:52:56,198 --> 01:53:00,638
I think I know which ones are going to

2487
01:52:57,599 --> 01:53:02,159
turn out better so I'll focus on them

2488
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:05,560
but yeah it's a it's an interesting

2489
01:53:02,158 --> 01:53:07,960
breeding plant I gave it up I mean

2490
01:53:05,560 --> 01:53:11,320
saying I would

2491
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:13,239
never filial generation it so I did my

2492
01:53:11,319 --> 01:53:15,759
breedings with it and I passed it on to

2493
01:53:13,238 --> 01:53:17,638
a couple people as it was passed to me

2494
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:19,960
so I have I haven't had the Mac one in a

2495
01:53:17,639 --> 01:53:19,960
couple

2496
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:27,679
years yeah so we only have a couple

2497
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:29,239
minutes left so before we go I wanted to

2498
01:53:27,679 --> 01:53:31,440
see if there was anything you wanted to

2499
01:53:29,238 --> 01:53:34,078
add we've already discussed that you'll

2500
01:53:31,439 --> 01:53:36,759
be back soon for part two and hopefully

2501
01:53:34,078 --> 01:53:38,198
be doing the way we grow podcasts but is

2502
01:53:36,760 --> 01:53:40,760
there anything you want to say before we

2503
01:53:38,198 --> 01:53:43,879
go today no I think you're doing a great

2504
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:45,840
job I I um that's why I sent you the

2505
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:47,880
text I I've watched a couple of them I

2506
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:51,599
watched with Marcus I watch with you

2507
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:54,480
know JRE I it's it's it's kind of fun

2508
01:53:51,599 --> 01:53:58,599
and and honestly if you look at your

2509
01:53:54,479 --> 01:54:01,359
subscribers relative to your um I don't

2510
01:53:58,599 --> 01:54:03,800
know what you call them yeah reviews

2511
01:54:01,359 --> 01:54:05,960
people are watching nice high percentage

2512
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:08,800
so that you've got a good group of

2513
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:11,039
people who are interested in the plant

2514
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:13,440
and that's always a good place to be

2515
01:54:11,039 --> 01:54:15,479
right I mean we we can only watch the

2516
01:54:13,439 --> 01:54:18,158
the Australian podcast and we can only

2517
01:54:15,479 --> 01:54:19,479
watch FCP and we can only watch a couple

2518
01:54:18,158 --> 01:54:21,799
of these so much and you're out of

2519

materials so you you know you have the

2520
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:26,880
ability and potential to bring new

organic

2538
01:55:11,639 --> 01:55:19,078
um you know we don't we don't promote it

2539

any you know at all um we've just had

2540
01:55:19,078 --> 01:55:22,840
we've been lucky to have really

2541
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:25,400
interesting

2542
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:29,719
guests join us right away we've been

2543
01:55:25,399 --> 01:55:32,839
lucky that somehow I mean can I ask how

2544
01:55:29,719 --> 01:55:35,800
did you find our

2545
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:37,679
podcast honestly I'm not sure yeah

2546
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:41,039
because like when I look you actually

2547
01:55:37,679 --> 01:55:43,319
you know what uh Mark Mark yellow oh

2548
01:55:41,039 --> 01:55:45,880
right okay because we we interviewed

2549
01:55:43,319 --> 01:55:49,198
Mark right I think Mark posted that he

2550
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:50,840
was coming on and then I'm like oh and

2551
01:55:49,198 --> 01:55:52,678
then I'm like oh I mean so you know

2552
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:56,400
there's couple thousand people follow

2553
01:55:52,679 --> 01:55:57,800
him so that's you know and and okay so

2554
01:55:56,399 --> 01:55:58,519
that's probably a good chunk right there

2555
01:55:57,800 --> 01:56:01,719
you

2556
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:04,040
know yeah and I mean we did the video

2557
01:56:01,719 --> 01:56:05,800
with Kevin JRE and he's just like um

2558
01:56:04,039 --> 01:56:07,599
well I mean somebody's probably doing a

2559
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:08,679
search for his name and Kevin's got a

2560
01:56:07,599 --> 01:56:12,880
pretty big

2561
01:56:08,679 --> 01:56:14,679
fallowing yeah I mean like I said we

2562
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:18,400
we've been lucky to have good

2563
01:56:14,679 --> 01:56:21,599
guests and you're definitely included in

2564
01:56:18,399 --> 01:56:25,158
that like I said uh and and I think the

2565
01:56:21,599 --> 01:56:27,679
proof is in our text message I agreed to

2566
01:56:25,158 --> 01:56:29,719
have you on the podcast before I knew

2567
01:56:27,679 --> 01:56:32,440
anything about you and then I started

2568
01:56:29,719 --> 01:56:34,480
talking to you and I was like holy [ __ ]

2569
01:56:32,439 --> 01:56:36,919
this guy's pretty

2570
01:56:34,479 --> 01:56:38,678
ridiculous you know and with a great

2571
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:42,480
story

2572
01:56:38,679 --> 01:56:45,920
so yeah I mean and you know what at the

2573
01:56:42,479 --> 01:56:49,718
same time what I like if if I'm giving

2574
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:52,239
away plants and somebody gets better at

2575
01:56:49,719 --> 01:56:54,239
breeding then someday I may use that

2576
01:56:52,238 --> 01:56:56,399
plant to cross something else cuz I want

2577
01:56:54,238 --> 01:56:59,118
it with the same parent so the more

2578
01:56:56,399 --> 01:57:01,158
people I can help the better the

2579
01:56:59,118 --> 01:57:04,000
genetics are going to be and that's

2580
01:57:01,158 --> 01:57:06,078
that's a benefit for everybody so I I I

2581
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:09,279
truly enjoy it I really

2582
01:57:06,078 --> 01:57:11,679
do you know earlier in the podcast you

2583
01:57:09,279 --> 01:57:15,840
said you're doing this because of you

2584
01:57:11,679 --> 01:57:18,599
know your ego but I don't really think

2585
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:21,199
that that's true it is kind of true I

2586
01:57:18,599 --> 01:57:23,319
mean I think that a bigger part of it is

2587
01:57:21,198 --> 01:57:24,919
how much you love the planet

2588
01:57:23,319 --> 01:57:29,039
you know it's cool that it feeds your

2589
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:31,078
ego too like like I said when people um

2590
01:57:29,039 --> 01:57:33,359
thank me for doing the podcast and tell

2591
01:57:31,078 --> 01:57:36,319
me how much they love me it's feeding my

2592
01:57:33,359 --> 01:57:38,960
ego a little bit but I am still doing it

2593
01:57:36,319 --> 01:57:41,639
because in the end I love it and I love

2594
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:44,800
having these conversations so it can be

2595
01:57:41,639 --> 01:57:47,480
both you can feed your ego and you can

2596
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:51,039
love the plant and it's clear that you

2597
01:57:47,479 --> 01:57:53,678
love the plant we even spoke um about

2598
01:57:51,039 --> 01:57:56,359
yesterday how if you to choose to stop

2599
01:57:53,679 --> 01:57:59,239
smoking or stop growing you would choose

2600
01:57:56,359 --> 01:58:01,799
to stop smoking because you just you

2601
01:57:59,238 --> 01:58:05,879
just love growing and breeding the plant

2602
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:09,360
and well it's honestly it's it's OCD

2603
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:11,639
what happens is is OCD kicks in and it

2604
01:58:09,359 --> 01:58:13,679
just happened that when it kicked in on

2605
01:58:11,639 --> 01:58:16,199
weed 10 years ago it kind of never went

2606
01:58:13,679 --> 01:58:19,039
away and it's become

2607
01:58:16,198 --> 01:58:22,479
primary I did Greyhounds for a bunch of

2608
01:58:19,039 --> 01:58:23,920
years I ra I drag race motorcycles like

2609
01:58:22,479 --> 01:58:27,279
if I get into did Greyhounds did you

2610
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:30,319
breed them yeah it's like becoming a

2611
01:58:27,279 --> 01:58:32,519
very common thread that all of the great

2612
01:58:30,319 --> 01:58:35,238
breeders that I'm that I'm meeting that

2613
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:37,599
they bred dogs as well I mean I get all

2614
01:58:35,238 --> 01:58:39,919
the stud books I used to study horse

2615
01:58:37,599 --> 01:58:42,239
breeding I mean half of the thorough

2616
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:45,920
Breads in the world come from like five

2617

2618
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:53,039
