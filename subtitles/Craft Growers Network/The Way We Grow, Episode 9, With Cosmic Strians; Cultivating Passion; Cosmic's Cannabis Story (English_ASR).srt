00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:41,519
projects uh Cosmic welcome to the show

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,840

all those listeners out there we just

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,960
recorded another episode together this

16
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:49,398
morning that you'll probably have heard

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,878
by now uh so um you know we we we seem

18
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,960
to have a little bit of a theme in the

19
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:58,920
craft Growers network podcast of

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:01,359
promoting tissue culture um which I'm

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,439
not opposed to think it's a a huge thing

22
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,560
that's going to be necessary in the

23
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:09,039
Cannabis industry to to keep it viable

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,600
for the next 10 to 20 years at least if

25
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,080
not longer but um Cosmic what's what's

26
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:17,000
new with you what's new in your garden

27
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,879
oh not too much um you know actually uh

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,078
I've taken a break from acquiring any

29
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,640
new strains I have quite the number of

30
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:25,879
strains now um but I have been waiting

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,359
on an order and um it's supposed to

32
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:30,359
arrive here within the next couple days

33
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:33,719
so I should be getting Kim 91 uh starg

34
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:36,239
guava um pink runs uh what was it

35
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,478
Dante's Inferno oh and uh Granddaddy

36
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,359
Purple um very cool I think it's the San

37
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,359
Fran cut I'll have to check my notes and

38
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:44,078
everything but super excited to get some

39
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,239
of those old school strains going

40
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:50,158
on what what is your current uh Library

41
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:53,599
count at um you know honestly I'd have

42
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,240
to go and take inventory because um a

43
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:59,679
lot of my library actually is only

44
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:02,158
existing in my tissue culture Library so

45
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,960
um I do have a lot of my strains still

46
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,719
um going um I have a you know the

47
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:11,479
tendency to take on a lot more um than I

48
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:14,840
probably should at one time um so I've

49
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:16,679
been uh juggling um all these new

50
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,000
strains that I've been able to acquire

51
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,800
with the library of seeds that I grew

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,759
out um and as well as learning U tissue

53
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,680
culture so we'll talk a little bit more

54
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:28,318
about kind of what got me into tissue

55
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,680
culture and where I'm at with that a

56
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,639
little bit later on um but I thought

57
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,800
we'd kind of Kick this off with uh a

58
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:38,039
little story about my first time

59
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,480
growing yeah so like you know I like to

60
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:43,280
find out if you did if if your first

61
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:45,598
experiences with growing in general were

62
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,360
with cannabis or if you perhaps maybe

63
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:51,000
grew some vegetables or flowers or other

64
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,760
plants with your parents or relatives or

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,519
maybe somebody at at a younger

66
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:59,318
age yeah I mean so I would help my dad

67
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,519
out in the garden you know um probably

68
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:03,079
running off not helping out as much as I

69
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,719
should have you know he probably spent a

70
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,599
lot more time looking for me to give me

71
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,919
the help but I do remember picking up

72
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:12,119
some things uh from them but um really

73
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:15,119
my first Venture into growing anything

74
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:19,439
by myself was with cannabis and you know

75
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:23,319
I was 16 at the time um my high school

76
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:25,199
girlfriend's stepdad gave me uh this set

77
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:28,438
of speakers and I already had you know a

78
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,839
pretty decent home stereo system um and

79
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:34,560
these speakers were Giant I'm talking

80
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,319
probably 3 and 1/2t 4 foot tall and so

81
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,598
my teenage brain was like well um I have

82
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:42,280
this bag seed that you know I found in

83
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:44,919
one of the the gram bags you know that I

84
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,759
bought you know um let's try to do

85
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:50,518
something with it now keep in mind my uh

86
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:53,000
parents were extremely strict um

87
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,200
definitely not you know um going to let

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,318
me smoke let alone grow anything so I

89
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:00,560
was you know just being a teenager just

90
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:03,359
putting caution in the wind and I gutted

91
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,319
one of those speakers um I took a towel

92
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,439
and I put it against the mesh screen on

93
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:09,280
the front you know kind of taped it up I

94
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,840
installed a little computer fan and I

95
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,158
twisted it up to um an outlet you know

96
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,759
like a plug that I can plug in and get

97
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:19,199
it to work and then I had a desktop lamp

98
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:22,120
that I somehow fastened to the top of

99
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,478
the speaker so it's it's pointing down

100
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,680
and I had a you know cuz I I read that

101
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:27,199
Flor and bulbs are okay for plants and I

102
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,160
didn't know anything about t5s or

103
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,199
anything like that at the time so

104
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,320
whatever Flor and bulb I could find and

105
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:36,639
yeah you know once you know it I got um

106
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,439
probably up to I want to say about five

107
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,960
sets of leaves you know it was doing

108
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:42,959
pretty decent and then my mom found it

109
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,560
so so so fin to say I wasn't able to sex

110
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,240
it let alone get any you know results

111
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,360
from it uh besides you know getting

112
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,199
grounded so but how old for you when you

113
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,560
did that probably like 16 uh I was up in

114
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,080
high school um I started smoking around

115
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,680
16 so I mean I could have been as early

116
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:09,879
as 17 but in that range right there very

117
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,000
cool that's that's super funny just

118
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:13,399
gutting a giant speaker I mean it makes

119
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,519
me what was it like one of those Tower

120
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:18,318
speakers that had like three or or four

121
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:20,198
different speaker ports out the front

122
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,080
for the uh the tweeters and the bass and

123
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,879
all that stuff and yeah so you just pop

124
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:27,439
off the screen and then you can get into

125
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,918
my little grow so I think I even like

126
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:32,560
took tin foil and lined the whole sides

127
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:35,758
of it with tin foil and it was super

128
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,639
just you know um super Jerry rigged you

129
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,038
know like I just I threw it together and

130
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,439
I mean it would have been interesting to

131
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,560
see what would have happened if I

132
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:46,759
managed to get it to flower um if it was

133
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,839
a female and you know if I was able to

134
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:50,759
successfully get anything out of it but

135
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:53,079
you know we we'll never

136
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,000
know that's still it's still fun though

137
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:56,758
I mean it it shows the incentive at a

138
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,399
young age to want to see what this plant

139
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:02,400
did um had had you already been smoking

140
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:04,079
at this this point or oh yeah oh yeah it

141
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,318
must have been a seed that I found in

142
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:09,079
bag seed you know and this was still

143
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,199
when you could find um like schwag you

144
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:14,159
know like brick weed so it could have

145
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,199
been just uh like a swag seed you know

146
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,560
so and now all my growing's done intense

147
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,639
you know so um it's funny that I

148
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,360
initially um sought out some form of

149
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,560
growing where um I mean for me it wasn't

150
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,840
really about controlling the environment

151
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,918
but it was more the security of having a

152
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,758
hidden grow sure you know so it's funny

153
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:38,000
that I've evolved in a tense right I

154
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,560
mean it's it's almost like uh yeah it's

155
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,639
kind of the same thing but just a little

156
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,240
bit different but it's that's really

157
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,759
cool um well you know sometimes I'll

158
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,000
save this for the end but since we're

159
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,240
here why don't you tell me about some uh

160
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,879
like your your first most memorable time

161
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,879
smoking um that would have come before

162
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:58,279
you started growing so I I was 16 the

163
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:01,560
first time I smoked and I made friends

164
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:02,878
with um this older kid at school who was

165
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,680
kind of a

166
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,240
burnout um you know we know the type

167
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,918
yeah he was probably like a grade of H

168
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:14,680
ofy or something and um we decided uh

169
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,120
that we were going to smoke you know

170
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,280
smoke you know he's going to get me high

171
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,680
for the first time and everything like

172
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:24,079
that so um and for me I felt like I had

173
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,519
a little bit of redeeming to do um my

174
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,639
best friend in middle school was next

175
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:31,959
door neighbors uh with Mark Hollman of

176
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,680
Suicide Silence uh a death metal band

177
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:36,399
and I remember being in eth grade and We

178
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,160
snuck out and my friend you know they

179
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:41,719
smoked together a bunch you know um and

180
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,639
so he was you know knowing me in my my

181
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,720
shelter life trying to uh help me

182
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:48,560
experience smoking and I got so close to

183
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,960
smoking with him for the very first time

184
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,439
you know in eth grade and I just I

185
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:53,198
chinking out for I was like my mom's

186
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,240
going to know like I don't know how

187
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,478
she's going to know but she's going to

188
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,720
know and like she's know un unrealistic

189
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:03,719
you know like paranoia and uh you know

190
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,520
so fast forward here I am about 16 uh

191
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,000
hanging out with this older kid and um I

192
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:10,000
think yeah he spent the night at my

193
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,079
house uh cuz I lived very close to a

194
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,279
golf course and we ended up sneaking out

195
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,519
at night and going to this golf course

196
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:20,799
and making a pipe out of a you know a

197
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,439
tin can or you know aluminum can and um

198
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,478
poking the holes in it

199
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:27,360
and um I don't I'm not even sure if it

200
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:29,158
was just the excitement or if I actually

201
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,879
did get high but I do remember at one

202
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:32,120
point trying to put the you know to

203
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,479
smoke out of the can and I had it

204
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,399
backwards and I was like why isn't it

205
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,038
lighting like so I don't know if I was

206
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,080
just being a goofy young kid or I

207
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,319
actually did get high but you know that

208
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,200
was my first uh first time you know

209
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,519
smoking and um I definitely hung out I

210
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,959
think that guy's name was Mike I

211
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,200
definitely hung out with Mike a lot more

212
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,119
after that and sure we definitely got

213
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,480
high afterwards but my first time I

214
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,519
can't tell you if it was the excitement

215
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,519
or if it actually worked you know yeah

216
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,679
definitely I I feel like sometimes it's

217
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:02,240
just like you don't even know know what

218
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:05,278
to expect and so you might be be high

219
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,919
you might be you know just a kid just

220
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,439
thinking that you're high get around

221
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:11,199
with your friend goofing off like that's

222
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,440
it's almost like its own form of getting

223
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,480
high you know like just giddiness that

224
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,160
goofiness that you get when you're just

225
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,839
laughing at the stupidest [ __ ] you know

226
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:21,278
so for sure see how sometimes I I feel

227
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,000
like that is almost like the same thing

228
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:25,360
as just getting like super [ __ ]

229
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,958
stoned it's just got that same sort of

230
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,399
euphoric feeling um yeah that's a good

231
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:34,559
point

232
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,879
yeah so once you uh did this first grow

233
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,518
and you got grounded for

234
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:43,000
it when did you then take your next step

235
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,799
back into cultivation so great question

236
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,399
um same house um that I was in when I

237
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:50,479
got caught um across the street my best

238
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,839
friend lived you know and you know we we

239
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,600
met each other CU we lived across the

240
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,160
street and at the time I was in fifth

241
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,959
grade and I think he was in seventh or

242
00:09:55,159 --> 00:10:00,799
something you know about two years older

243
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:02,159
than me um so anyway fast forward uh I'm

244
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,838
about

245
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:10,399
21 I think is when we took the next step

246
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,480
and um he's another influence on people

247
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,399
that you know I used to hang out with

248
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,639
that got into smoking before I did so I

249
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:17,159
remember him and our other friends you

250
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:18,799
know sneaking off and getting high and

251
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,078
me being like a young kid like oh my God

252
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:23,359
I can't believe you guys are doing that

253
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,759
and all that stuff and so uh anyway you

254
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,560
know his his parents were a lot more

255
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:29,879
lenient than mine were and um they were

256
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:31,559
a little bit more

257
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,039
I wouldn't say like a fullon hippie but

258
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:36,958
they were a little bit more hippie-ish

259
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:40,000
you know um and his mom was open to the

260
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:42,599
idea of starting a cannabis um a

261
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,278
cannabis club so a medical club and this

262
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:50,159
is probably I want to say like 2011 2012

263
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:51,639
somewhere around there um so they go

264
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,600
ahead and they get all the paperwork

265
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:55,680
done they did all the legal stuff um of

266
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,240
course you know this is stuff that I

267
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:59,439
heard about I wasn't there for any of

268
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,159
the proceedings but as far as I know

269
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,000
they had all their ducks in a row and um

270
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,838
they didn't have uh like a commercial

271
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,879
location to do anything like this they

272
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:12,160
were just kind of starting from the

273
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:15,559
ground up and so um my buddy we we'll

274
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:17,600
call him Mr chfa so Mr chfa and I uh

275
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:21,199
went ahead and we started growing and

276
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,839
everything like that and um like with

277
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,440
the full blessing of his parents cuz his

278
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:26,639
parents basically needed to have a

279
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,079
grower at some point so yeah just to

280
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,919
paint the picture his house was kind of

281
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:32,159
like the party house right you know

282
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,278
across the street it was his family

283
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,838
house his parents moved out you know his

284
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:39,480
siblings moved out it was just him and

285
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:43,040
his uh his girlfriend which you know

286
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:46,079
it's his wife now and

287
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:48,480
um he had roommates a bunch of roommates

288
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:51,199
and so what we ended up doing is between

289
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,680
him and I we rented out one of the rooms

290
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,360
uh so I'd pay half you know I think it

291
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:57,078
was like 250 every month and he'd pay

292
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,560
the other 250 and so we were a tenant in

293
00:11:57,078 --> 00:12:01,638
that room and we um you know he had some

294
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:04,559
other friends who who did construction

295
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,680
and they put up you know a a uh a wall

296
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,518
to go ahead and divide the room so we

297
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:11,359
had a flower room and then we had the

298
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,600
main room which had the closet you know

299
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,800
part of it where we took the doors off

300
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,800
and that was like our little veg area

301
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:20,240
okay so you know uh again he we're we're

302
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:21,799
doing everything legally you know I at

303
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,120
the point had my medical marijuana

304
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:26,439
license and um speaking of which I I

305
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,560
currently have my medical marijuana

306
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,519
license so for all you listeners if you

307
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,319
hear me talking having you know numerous

308
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:34,799
plants I can legally here in California

309
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,639
have up to 99 plants so that's pretty

310
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,719
awesome um and it's really nice too cuz

311
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:42,360
there's not really any um space

312
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,920
restrictions it's just in your in your

313
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,039
um your house you can have up to 99 so

314
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:48,519
some commercial

315
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:50,439
licenses um it's more about square

316
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:53,600
footage of grow Space versus the amount

317
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,160
of plants so I could potentially have

318
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,240
depending on how big my house was you

319
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:59,679
know uh a lot bigger growth space with

320
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,240
just the medical license but

321
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,039
uh so yeah getting back to the story we

322
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,600
were um growing at the house and we got

323
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:09,078
some clones from some local cannabis

324
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,879
clubs um think we had and who knows the

325
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:13,958
legitimacy of any of these genetics you

326
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:16,519
know uh supposedly we had Strawberry

327
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:20,719
Cough um Platinum

328
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:22,919
Kush um sfog which that was my first

329
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,199
experience with San Fernando Valley OG

330
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:28,120
Kush and it's been cemented in in my

331
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:30,078
heart as one of my favorite strings you

332
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,399
know it's so good it's such a good

333
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:34,958
strain and those golf ball nugs make it

334
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,159
so easy to trim you know especially from

335
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,239
a Grower's perspective something that's

336
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:41,519
you don't have to handle too much after

337
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,440
you know all the the labor of growing it

338
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,519
out and you know that's that's

339
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,160
preferable you know um nobody wants to

340
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,759
be there trimming for hours and hours no

341
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:53,759
when I was in California I would either

342
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:55,838
go for sfv OG or um Tahoe OG that those

343
00:13:53,759 --> 00:14:00,360
were the two that you could find pretty

344
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:03,839
readily in the market in like 092 10 y

345
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:06,360
um and they were just always so good

346
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,199
yeah so we um I actually just recently

347
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,959
grew out um Tahoe OG and it's so similar

348
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:15,838
to sfog you know very earthy um TPS to

349
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:18,239
it just um and you know honestly for an

350
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,759
OG it's not too heavy of a smoke for me

351
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,919
it doesn't like immediately knock me out

352
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,600
it's it's still more of a you know you

353
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:25,599
can smoke it and function so I really

354
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,639
appreciate

355
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,639
that sorry to distract you from the

356
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:32,560
story but back to this first

357
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:36,600
rented room grow set we had like white

358
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:39,198
widow too um and maybe a couple other

359
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,278
ones they'll probably come back to me as

360
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:43,159
no BL

361
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:45,759
dream I don't think so but we're we're

362
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:47,480
talking like 15 years ago here so no

363
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,720
[ __ ] dude I'm older now it's more like

364
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:54,560
17 almost 18 years now so um yeah damn

365
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:58,879
time flies yeah it does so yeah I mean

366
00:14:54,559 --> 00:15:00,638
we were rolling and um just to kind of

367
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:02,360
um add a little to the story one of his

368
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,159
roommates and this is the time where

369
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,399
mobile dispensaries was uh in its

370
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:08,879
infancy it was still really new we like

371
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:10,679
oh [ __ ] dude like what do you mean you

372
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,639
can call this number up or text this

373
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:14,479
person and they'll send out someone with

374
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,720
a bunch of weed and you can you have it

375
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,000
at your house like that you don't have

376
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,879
to go to some sketchy building and you

377
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,679
know like you know go through the

378
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:23,439
security guard and stuff to get into you

379
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:26,239
know the old school like medical clubs

380
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,560
and stuff so um his roommate was doing

381
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,440
that and um I guess at this time too he

382
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:34,198
also kind of got into you know like

383
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,120
cocaine and stuff you know and um for me

384
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:38,519
I'm really lucky like I never got into

385
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,240
any of that stuff I was always really I

386
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,318
had like a strict policy with myself

387
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,959
like as long as it can be grown in the

388
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:46,360
ground like that's the only thing I'd

389
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:48,239
mess with so you know like cannabis and

390
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,240
a little bit of fungus here and there

391
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,039
but that was really it you know so um

392
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,440
but unfortunately his roommate you know

393
00:15:53,039 --> 00:16:00,399
got into you know Coke and stuff and I

394
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,959
guess he started selling it and so um we

395
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,000
didn't really know that was going on at

396
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:06,518
the time but um that's a very important

397
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,198
piece of the puzzle here with what

398
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:14,560
happens next um so Mr chfa gets a call

399
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:15,919
from his roommate and um his roommate he

400
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:17,919
says hey one of my clients that I

401
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:21,719
normally you know mobile dispensary I

402
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:24,278
normally deliver to um wants an eth and

403
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,000
I don't you know have the time to you

404
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:28,480
know meet up with her can you go ahead

405
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,839
and on behalf of me give her an eth and

406
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,560
then I'll just reimburse you when I get

407
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,199
home you know and so as far as that

408
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:36,078
sounds like a setup as far as he knew

409
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:38,039
well I mean the roommate wasn't doing

410
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,120
anything nefarious like anything

411
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,439
malicious or anything like that he just

412
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,318
as far as he knew that was just someone

413
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,160
he's always like you know delivered to

414
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:46,559
and stuff and I guess it was like the

415
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:49,639
girlfriend of the guy that he normally

416
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:53,399
delivers to and whatnot so anyway that

417
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:56,560
that goes down and um maybe a week or

418
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:59,639
two later Mr Chief's house gets

419
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:01,479
raided and it turned out that this um

420
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,879
this woman she was actually pregnant by

421
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:06,558
the way a little tidbit there um had

422
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:07,919
gotten busted uh picking up some cocaine

423
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:11,318
on behalf of her

424
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:13,959
boyfriend and you know as a lot of

425
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:15,038
people would probably tend to do said oh

426
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:16,600
you know I will give you whatever

427
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:19,199
information you want here's where I got

428
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:23,798
it from and they probably got it from Mr

429
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:25,679
Chief's roommate and so um lo and behold

430
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:27,759
you know that was kind of a sting

431
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,600
operation and you know a couple weeks

432
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:33,400
after that happened his house got raided

433
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:35,319
and kind of a a funny side note I am so

434
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,200
lucky at the time I was delivering for

435
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:39,519
Domino's Pizza and I remember I was

436
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,440
playing cuz we had the the PC hooked up

437
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,279
to his computer uh I'm sorry uh hooked

438
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,038
up to his TV in the living room and I

439
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:47,798
was playing Diablo I uh in the living

440
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:50,919
room you know smoking and just you know

441
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:52,480
hanging out and um not really too many

442
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:54,120
bills to worry about you know still

443
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,720
living at home across the street you

444
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:58,079
know and so I even considered calling

445
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,120
out you know just so I can continue to

446
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:03,079
smoke and you know play some Diablo and

447
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,719
uh you know I was like ah you know it's

448
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:07,918
just a small shift whatever you know and

449
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,759
so I I take off and as I'm leaving we

450
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,919
lived in a culdesac by the way as I'm

451
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:14,440
leaving the culdesac to turn left out

452
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:15,559
and get out of our neighborhood I you

453
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,480
know kind of take a peek to the right

454
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:21,519
you know looking for traffic and I see a

455
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,679
whole [ __ ] ton of cops gathered at the

456
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:26,519
bottom of the culdesac to the right of

457
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,240
us and so I get all you know like

458
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:31,400
paranoid like oh what the [ __ ] that's

459
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,319
not that's not normal yeah so I called

460
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,798
Mr chiefo I'm like hey dude like this is

461
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:37,119

462
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:39,639

I'm going on with my shift delivering

468
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:51,918
pizzas and 10 minutes go by 15 minutes

469

go by so I call him and I call a couple

470
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,120
times and he's not

471
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,558
answering and so I'm like that's so

472
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:00,439

this and then one of his other roommates

474
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,919

solely for his roommate who was selling

486
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:32,038
cocaine

487
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:33,079
and um when they tore his room apart

488
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:35,558
they the only thing they were able to

489
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:38,480
find was a scale with a little bit of

490
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:39,839
res residual cocaine on it or something

491
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,440
you could probably tell I'm not really

492
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:44,279
into that World by the fact I keep

493
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,600
saying cocaine I feel like such a square

494
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:49,519
but anyway so um when the cops realized

495
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:51,558
that this big bus that they put together

496
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,558
was going to come with anything that's

497
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:56,279
when they turned their focus on Mr chfa

498
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:58,279
and the room upstairs um this would

499
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,879
happened a couple days after we Harvest

500
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:03,279
um I think think we were ready to start

501
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:06,360
trimming up um I remember on the table

502
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:07,918
we had um a bunch of uh nugs um on

503
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:11,119
branches that were ready to be trimmed

504
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,159
and I think a couple jars and upstairs

505
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:15,359
you know I thought I was again I was in

506
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:16,960
my young younger 20s I was a dumb

507
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,000
[ __ ] but I thought it was so

508
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,919
funny on the envelope that we were you

509
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,558

510
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:24,240

511
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,599
front you know cuz I just a young

512
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,798
20-year-old right of course yeah like

513
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:30,599
just oh it's so funny ha look at this

514
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,599
you know like so of course the cops

515
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:34,359
found that you know [ __ ] envelope

516
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:36,759
that's literally labeled Drug Money

517
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:39,479
during their raids so you know sorry

518
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:41,240
sorry Mr chfa it it would either be drug

519
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,679
money we'd write on envelopes or we'd

520
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,599
write citizens test like from The

521
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,240
Departed but we'd cross out the Z and

522
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:51,000
put a c below it

523
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,558
nice I I recently read on uh Reddit

524
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,359
there was um some girl who got busted

525
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:56,960
with a bag full of drugs that on the

526
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:59,199
front of it said definitely not a bag of

527
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,640
drugs so

528
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:06,038
I I laughed because I you know I the

529
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,360
irony so anyways back to the story yeah

530
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:10,000
um he he got raided um you know they

531
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:11,240
couldn't find anything you know in the

532
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,278
roommates room they turned their

533
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,679
attention and he even told me too like

534
00:21:13,278 --> 00:21:16,000
they they picked up the the nugs and

535
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:19,000
they smelled on they're like oh good job

536
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,679
you know like before they turn their you

537
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,359
know so it's

538
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:25,200
like um yeah so they raided everything

539
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,479
they emptied out you know the room

540
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,759
obviously they went through every

541
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,599
roommate's room at that point um took

542
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:32,679
all the drawers out you know dumped all

543
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:36,240
the contents of the drawers on the floor

544
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:39,080
like the house was trashed you know and

545
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,798
um I actually went to dinner with him uh

546
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:43,558
I want to say like three four months ago

547
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:45,960
and it' been so long since we talked

548
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:48,759
about it and so you know he was able to

549
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,159
kind of give me a recount of it and I

550
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:52,720
I've invited on the show too um he's a

551
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:54,720
professional these days so I'm not sure

552
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,960
if he's going to want to jump on but it

553
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,640
cool to hear his story even though we'

554
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,880
kind of heard you know my telling of it

555
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,080
it would be really cool to hear his

556
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,080
aspect cuz he um is the only one that

557
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:06,639
actually got in trouble for it you know

558
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:08,199
um I'm real again I'm super lucky like I

559
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:14,559
love what what did they what did they

560
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:16,278
tag him for um so felonies um there uh

561
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,200
there were some mushrooms that they

562
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:20,319
found to at the house that you know from

563
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,080
some of the other you know people there

564
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:25,839
um it wasn't even his but they found

565
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:28,839
that so they tack that on um and then

566
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:30,798
they he here's a tip for everyone you

567
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:34,199
know if something ever like this happens

568
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:36,798
just don't ever talk you know like you

569
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,240
can't talk your way out of anything

570
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:41,960
nothing will nothing you say will ever

571
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,319
help you except let me talk to my lawyer

572
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,759
that is literally the only thing that

573
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:47,678
you can say anything else will just give

574
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:49,759
them an opportunity to incriminate you

575
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,798
and that's exactly what happened so they

576
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:55,759
cornered him um and there was I guess

577
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:58,200
like a deputy behind him and the Junior

578
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:00,960
Sheriff or I don't know one of the it

579
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:03,159
wasn't the top guy but you know he was

580
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,919
the one who orchestrated this so um I

581
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:07,320
guess he felt like he had a lot on the

582
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:09,559
line you know and they initial raid came

583
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:12,240
up as a bus so they're Switching gears

584
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:14,639
to go after this you know cannabis club

585
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,839
basically and so he kept asking them

586
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,960
over and over you know like oh yeah so

587
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:20,038
like your friends would come over right

588
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,798
oh yeah my friends would come over and

589
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:23,558
hang out okay so like they'd come over

590
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:25,599
and like they'd smoke right oh yeah like

591
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:27,480
you know yeah they smoke okay so you're

592
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,399
like you're giving them we no no no no I

593
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,200
no it wasn't I wouldn't give

594
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,440
anything like just so I can get the

595
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,798
straight your friends would come over

596
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,720
right your friends they're the ones

597
00:23:33,798 --> 00:23:38,639
who'd come over yeah yeah my friends

598
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,000
would come over okay so but and then

599
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,480
when they come over and they would smoke

600
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,480
it would be your weed right and no no no

601
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,880
no so they went in circles like this

602
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,480
time and time again and eventually um

603
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,039
they they had him slip up and he said

604
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,679
that he like you know sold weed to one

605
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:54,119
of his friends or something and at that

606
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:56,120
point that's that's when they put the

607
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:58,558
handcuffs on him and they took him

608
00:23:56,119 --> 00:24:00,239
straight to jail you know so again

609
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:03,278
everybody you can't talk your way out of

610
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,839
any of this like they're just waiting

611
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:07,400
for you to say one wrong thing and then

612
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:09,319
they're going to swoop in yeah that's

613
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,200
that's pretty [ __ ] up just like

614
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:15,639
tripping them up enough to make them

615
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:18,240
admit their own guilt yeah it's uh yeah

616
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:21,120

626
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,918

630
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:52,200
pretty young you know like 21 years old

631
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,640
getting raided by uh Federal narcotics

632
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,880
officers is uh well I don't think it was

633
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,000
Federal um I think well narcotics

634
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,679
officers are still no joke right yeah

635
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,359
yeah I mean it was a bunch of local cops

636
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,759
and stuff like that and I don't even

637
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:07,319
like I think my mom just said it was DEA

638
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,158
you know but it really wasn't like she

639
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:11,398
just saw people in jackets and the

640
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:15,799
police she just assumed there were drugs

641
00:25:11,398 --> 00:25:17,879
involved yeah I mean they weren't wrong

642
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:19,960
they weren't wrong NOP that's pretty

643
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:24,039
funny we had some good nugs but so I

644
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:27,159
mean did how did that uh shape your your

645
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:30,480
cultivation Journey um once that

646
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:32,960
occurred well shoot I mean uh after that

647
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,919
I took a huge break from from growing

648
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,798
again I

649
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:40,000
mean I never really was um there was a

650
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:43,480
couple times where I lived as a roommate

651
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,119
at someone's house you know and um one

652
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,679
time you know for a couple months I

653
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:51,398
lived with my my ex and then she you

654
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:54,038
know she left and you know I wasn't in a

655
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:56,038
position to ever have my own place where

656
00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:58,759
I can grow and I can do all this stuff

657
00:25:56,038 --> 00:26:01,000
you know so um

658
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:02,839
really I didn't start growing again I I

659
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,679
was just a huge Stoner and you know as

660
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:08,480
you can probably tell from behind me um

661
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,120
you know I play music and um for a long

662
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,599
time I was pursuing you know being a

663
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:14,759
professional musician um I guess you can

664
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:17,199
argue I was you know I was solely pay my

665
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:20,398
bills from teaching music and from uh

666

back and forth so cool but uh yeah let's

686
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:08,840
pick it back up when I started growing

687
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:09,918
again um so I now live with my fiance um

688
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:11,558
we're going to get married at the end of

689
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,399
this year you know super excited about

690
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:17,798
it um we live in a house that she owns

691
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:19,199
with her mom and we're extremely lucky

692
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:22,079
uh we're you know we're essentially

693
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,080
professionals we don't have any kids um

694
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:26,480
and we both have decent paining jobs so

695
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:28,558
we're able to you know basically rent

696
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,440
the house from her mom without any

697
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:33,359
roommates so um this room right here is

698
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,679
actually supposed to be my studio uh

699
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:38,558
this is supposed to be my my band room

700
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,720
um I have you know my my drum set over

701
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:42,200
here um you can probably see my little

702
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,960
microphone but I actually I have a

703
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,880
full-on recording studio in here and

704
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,679
it's kind of got pushed to the side to

705
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:52,278
become my second grow room uh so things

706
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:54,679
have definitely kind of um exploded so I

707
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:57,240
started growing again and again I I

708
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:58,480
never stopped smoking I mean I probably

709
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,159
I don't think I've really stopped

710
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,960
smoking since I was 16 you know like

711
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:06,760
maybe a month or two of not smoking but

712
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,399
consistently I've just it's always

713
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:12,278
um just always been something that I

714
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:14,719
really appreciate and I really enjoy so

715
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:16,319
um I don't drink anymore I don't do any

716
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,240
I don't party I don't stay up late you

717
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:22,200
know but I do I do love

718
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:27,079
smoking um so you know the pandemic hit

719
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:29,679
um and myself at the time um oh you know

720
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:31,480
by by the way a little background uh I

721
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,240
now actually have a career so a lot of

722
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,000
times if you ever see me jump off the

723
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,079
podcast or I'm not able to make it to an

724
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,440
episode um it's because I'm you know

725
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:43,480
working on my actual job I'm very lucky

726
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,798
you know to have a remote job so um you

727
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:48,038
know as long as you're in this kind of

728
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:49,798
work as long as you're um at your

729
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:51,640
meetings and you're responding to your

730
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:54,278
messages and you're completing your your

731
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:57,880
work or your tickets uh you know I'm a

732
00:28:54,278 --> 00:29:00,558
software engineer um it's not that big

733
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,760
of a deal if you're not online all day

734
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:03,119
every day you know as long as you're

735
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:05,879
doing your eight hours you can really

736
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:09,239
break it up so um I take full advantage

737
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,760
of that you know and um I love my job I

738
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,200
love working and and doing you doing the

739
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:16,240
work that I do the team that I work with

740
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,919
is just incredible and I'm extremely

741
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,919
fortunate to be in the position I'm at

742
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:23,440
you know so um but I've only been a

743
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:25,000
software engineer for about 3 years you

744
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,679
know and I like to bring this up too

745
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,599
because um you know my story is not very

746
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:32,720
unique there a lot of people out there

747
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:34,798
are working jobs that they hate you know

748
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,640
and I want to say from firsthand

749
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,960
experience from all the stuff that I've

750
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,399
done you know I was a musician for many

751
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:45,480
many years um I you know worked a ton of

752
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:47,719
odd jobs you know um the thing that

753
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,759
stopped me from drinking um almost seven

754
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,200
years it's actually in a week it'll be

755
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:53,720
my seven year anniversary of stopping

756
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,000
drinking I actually got a DUI you know

757
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,399
on the way home from playing the show

758
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,720
you know I was playing in a cover band

759
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:04,119
um and that put an end to my job at the

760
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,159
time as an Amazon delivery driver so um

761
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:09,319
I've worked a ton of different jobs you

762
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:11,320
know and um I want to let you guys know

763
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:13,678
that it's absolutely possible to become

764
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:16,359
a software engineer or I mean there's a

765
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,960
ton of different um specializations that

766
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:20,918
you can look into as well but um you can

767
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,759
absolutely learn this on your own from

768
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:26,038
the computer um utilizing YouTube and

769
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:31,480
then I also use this um website called

770
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:34,079
udem me um udm y uh they have courses

771
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,319
that you can buy from you know a lot of

772
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:37,678
people just put their own courses on

773
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:40,119
there but there are a ton of courses um

774
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,919
that have legitimate legitimately great

775
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:44,439
information that you can get some

776
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:47,000
hands-on experience with but my my

777
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,080
long-winded Point here is um it's

778
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,319
absolutely possible to become a software

779
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:51,798
engineer on your own you don't need

780
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:53,960
school for that you don't need any of

781
00:30:51,798 --> 00:30:56,440
that kind of stuff so and for me it's

782
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,278
absolutely changed my life so I feel

783
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,120
like even the greater point there is

784
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:03,519
that you don't have to feel pigeonholed

785
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:05,239
into a single career path you can easily

786
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,359
pivot if you

787
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:10,839
find the the skills and the knowledge

788
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:14,479
necessary to do so like I I went from

789
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:16,480
being a chef for 10 years to now I work

790
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,278
full-time as a cannabis cultivator and

791
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,519
and

792
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:22,599
managing a cannabis cultivation facility

793
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:25,440
and um that was all due as well to the

794
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:28,119
pandemic and and not having the ability

795
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,038
to continue to down One path but having

796
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:33,359
another path kind of open up that still

797
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:35,519
used a lot of the same skill sets that I

798
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:36,759
had developed through through kitchens

799
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,679
and and hospital and you had an

800
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:42,679
instructor for that

801
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:46,720
right for um for cooking no

802
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:48,440
cannabis uh no I I learned it all myself

803
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,278
yeah so that's the other thing like I I

804
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:53,200
knew that was gonna be the answer yeah

805
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:56,038
it was it was all through Reading and uh

806
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:59,080
watching videos purs it you know you

807
00:31:56,038 --> 00:32:00,919
know Mr Wolf here is a prime example of

808
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:02,278
if you want to be a grower pursue it you

809
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,919
know don't let anything stop you you

810
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:07,480
don't need education um besides what you

811
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:10,120
can you know uh you can reach for you

812
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:12,480
know and um there's a ton of people

813
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:15,239
who've not only put um amazing resources

814
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:19,159
online but are available through forums

815
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:20,839
that you can talk with and you know um

816
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:24,039
we probably haven't talked too much

817
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:25,158
about how how you and I know each other

818
00:32:24,038 --> 00:32:27,240

819
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:30,760
Reddit you know and we're both

Reddit the the rcraft marijuana

832

00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:04,360
most positive and and helpful place um

834
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,720
when it comes to to sharing awesome

00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:27,398
internet and the people on the internet

845
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:28,959

847
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,240
Pricks but um there's also a lot of

848
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:35,439
really nice people who are um more than

849
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,359
happy to share their experience and and

850
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,240
their knowledge with you especially if

851
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:42,240
you present yourself in a humble manner

852
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,880
that says you know um you know I I want

853
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,919
to learn I'm not you know no attitude

854
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,880
you know just I'm I'm here with with an

855
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:52,360
open hand you know help me fill it with

856
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,440
knowledge right absolutely so once you

857
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:56,879
did get back into growing uh you know

858
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,919
once you moved in with your fiance and

859
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,000
um set up set up your your grow and and

860
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,519
uh stuff like what what led you down the

861
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,398
path that got you to where you are now

862
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:10,320
so um I I I I don't like this subred at

863
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:13,358
all but uh micro

864
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,200
growery is kind of what inspired me to

865
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:17,679
look back into growing cuz you know at

866
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:19,638
that point it occurred to me oh [ __ ] we

867
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,760
got a house to ourselves we have these

868
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:24,599
extra rooms like the room downstairs

869
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,760
were um you know my my actual grow room

870
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:29,280
it's right next to the kitchen and it

871
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:32,359
was empty for as long as we were there

872
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,480
like um my fiance's sister uh used to

873
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:36,279
use it as like a yoga room or you know

874
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,440
she had you know her yoga mat and maybe

875
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,879
a couple weights and stuff but she

876
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,358
didn't live there anymore

877
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:43,960
so that room wasn't being used at all so

878
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:45,918
I spoke with you know my my future

879
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,599
mother-in-law and I got her blessing of

880
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,519
course and I was just like hey you know

881
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,480
like I think it would be really cool if

882
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:53,960
I can you know kind of grow a couple

883
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,918
plants you know um here's the California

884
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:58,639
state law we can have you know uh was it

885
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,279
like six plants or 12 plants it's been

886
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:01,480
so long since I've I've been a medical

887
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,880
patient now I don't even know what the

888
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:06,480
regular law is you know I just know my

889
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,680
99 plants yeah I think it's typically

890
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:12,440
but yeah 99 way

891
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:15,319
better the range and um I found out

892
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:18,240
about Herbies um seed bank which is a

893
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:22,440
seed bank I believe it's based in Spain

894
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:24,399
um off of people on micro growery and um

895
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,800
[ __ ] so yeah this is like 2020 you know

896
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,000
cuz it's during the pandemic so at the

897
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,400
time a lot of people were growing um

898
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,480
from Herbies there was oh no I'm sorry

899
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,760
it was from original Sensible Seeds

900
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,119
there was a Bruce Banner knockoff um

901
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,040
where it was uh I want say strawberry

902
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:43,800
diesel times um it wasn't just an OG

903
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:46,000
Kush I think it was um Colorado ghost OG

904
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,000
so they had like a different OG that

905
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,920
they mixed it with to create their

906
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,239
version of Bruce Banner and then they

907
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,039
also had like Dosey Do OG which they

908
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:56,639
used that same OG the Colorado ghost OG

909
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:59,679
and mixed it with Dosey Do so I actually

910
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:01,440
had those two strains um starting out um

911
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:03,399
I also had their knockoff of Gorilla

912
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,760
Glue but I didn't have any good luck

913
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:09,000
with that um but the Dosey Doo G was a

914
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:13,160
phenomenal plant you know um really

915
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,760
really good uh producer um the the turps

916
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:17,799
were um almost a little fruity a little

917
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:22,000
sweet to it but it still had that kind

918
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:24,400
of OG gas to it too um again super

919
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,039
amazing producer uh the Bruce Banner was

920
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,119
almost as good of a producer um the the

921
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:33,639
gland heads for the the

922
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:35,079
THC they were so big and fat it was very

923
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:38,719
different from a lot of the other um

924
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:40,480
strains that I've grown um out and um

925
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:42,279
that one definitely the feno that I

926
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,639
picked for the Bruce Banner knockoff it

927
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,200
definitely leaned a lot more towards the

928
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:48,239
OG side of things and you can tell that

929
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:49,639
from like the golf ball nugs and you

930
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,838
know the structure of the plants so it

931
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:54,719
was just um something I really

932
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:56,920
appreciated and at the time you know uh

933
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:59,519
my knowledge on strains was very limited

934
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:01,039
it was like what I heard from school you

935
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,599
know oh yeah back in the day we had some

936
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:05,239
blueberry and we had some train wreck

937
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:07,119
and you know I know about AK-47 and you

938
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:09,000
know like all those you know classic

939
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,400
strains that you you read about in High

940
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,838
Times or like me in high school um I got

941
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,720
access to the computer lab and I

942
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:19,078
remember looking up um some different

943
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:21,078
you know Holland seed companies um

944
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:23,200
probably like Dutch Passion and a couple

945
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:25,440
other ones and just looking at those old

946
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:27,199
school um you know bud pictures and just

947
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,760
dreaming like oh yeah I would totally

948
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:31,719
get that strain and and actually that's

949
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,240
when I when I started researching I got

950
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:36,279
laughed uh at on Reddit about this but

951
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:37,598
back in high school and I was

952
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,400
researching about oh what's the most

953
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,160
psychedelic strain you know like which

954
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,800
is it's kind of funny now that we know a

955
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:47,960
little bit more about you know how um

956
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,280
people's unique brain chemistry really

957
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,119
um dictates how they're going to feel

958
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:55,119
from certain strains and stuff but um I

959
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:58,000
remember reading Cinderella 99 was the

960
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,680
most psychedelic hallucinogenic

961
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,880
strain you know and I kept that little

962
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:05,759
nugget in my brain for like 20 years and

963
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,358
I remember writing on you know on Reddit

964
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,800
and people were just like laughing at me

965
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:13,318
and you know at the time I didn't really

966
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:15,480
know too much so um so yeah I mean I I

967
00:38:13,318 --> 00:38:17,719
kept growing and at the time I was

968
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:21,199
working as a receptionist at an

969
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:22,838
optometry so um not really making a lot

970
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:26,879
of money you know working really shitty

971
00:38:22,838 --> 00:38:28,199
hours and just doing what I can um

972
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,720
eventually

973
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:33,159
I um let's see so yeah um I already

974
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:35,838
mentioned that I was a musician I was in

975
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:37,759
a lot of bands um at the time um I guess

976
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:39,719
technically I'm still in the band uh

977
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,319
we're uh co-workers now we don't really

978
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:45,358
do too much music but um at the time my

979
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:48,679
bandmate um he started encouraging me to

980
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:51,519
you know um to learn how to program you

981
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:53,799
know and maybe it was just the way that

982
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:56,119
you know I put together songs and I

983
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,119
structured things and I thought of how

984
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:00,559
to add you know

985
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:02,920
Melodies ter riffs or whatever like he

986
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,279
just he saw something in me that where

987
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,079
he felt like it would be something that

988
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,920
would really click for me and he was

989
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:12,000
right you know um I started you know um

990
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,639
I did have like a programming class in

991
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,639
in high school but me and my friend me

992
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,318
and my Stoner friend at the time uh we

993
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:20,000
were more interested in goofing off so

994
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:22,400
we figured out how to put emulators on

995
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,239
the school computer and we were playing

996
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,920
you know like old Super Nintendo games

997
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:28,598
against each other during mon but you

998
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,079
know little did I know that that

999
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:31,440
knowledge probably would have been

1000
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,280
important for me to pick up instead of

1001
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,838
playing you know emulators and stuff

1002
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:38,000
because you know here I am a software

1003
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:40,318
engineer uh so I mean I had a little bit

1004
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,519
of experience with that but um but my

1005
00:39:40,318 --> 00:39:45,318
bandmate was right you know it was

1006
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:47,679
really really awesome and so um I leaned

1007
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:48,920
into that and um especially with his

1008
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:51,358
encouragement you know CU there's times

1009
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,039
working customer service that I did not

1010
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:54,838
want to do anything at all and again uh

1011
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:57,440
this

1012
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:59,920
is to paint the picture when I got into

1013
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,519
this is is a little bit after the

1014
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,920
pandemic

1015
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:07,119
actually now that I'm I'm putting the

1016
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,800
timeline together in my mind November

1017
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,200
2019 is when I started programming and

1018
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,160
that was a couple months before the

1019
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:17,838
pandemic so and how long had you been

1020
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:19,318
growing up again so no I mean I started

1021
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:21,880
programming before I started growing

1022
00:40:19,318 --> 00:40:24,318
again wow okay cool and but I wasn't

1023
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:26,119
doing it professional um it was just

1024
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:28,000
learning what I could on the computer

1025
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:31,519
following along with projects and then

1026
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,039
making my own stuff up um I one of the

1027
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:34,719
projects that I I followed along with it

1028
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:36,880
was on a PDF so it wasn't a video you

1029
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:39,838
know I had a really focused you know the

1030
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,559
whole time um but I made my version of

1031
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:43,400
Frogger so I don't know if you guys

1032
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:45,400
remember that old school arcade game but

1033
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,200
you know it's a busy street and it's got

1034
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,760
cars going you know across the screen

1035
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:50,598
left and right and you have a little

1036
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,839
frog guy at the bottom and you your job

1037
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:53,920
is to get him across the street to the

1038
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:56,679
pond you know the lily pad on on the

1039
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,440
other side so um I was able to you know

1040
00:40:56,679 --> 00:41:00,960
using Java script program that um I I

1041
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,880
utilize canvas too I don't know if we

1042
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,280
have any any other programmers listening

1043
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,838
but um I made a little you know fun

1044
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,560
little game and it helped me understand

1045
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:11,159
variables a little bit better and

1046
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:12,599
functions and how to utilize logic and a

1047
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:15,318
lot of stuff like that and I just kept

1048
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:17,440
building off of that well anyway um I

1049
00:41:15,318 --> 00:41:19,920
would say

1050
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:25,159
probably about a year maybe year and a

1051
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:26,680
half after working on it and um again I

1052
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:28,639
I'd like to reiterate you know like I

1053
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:31,279
was working customer service right after

1054
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:33,000
the pandemic in a medical office where I

1055
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,800
had to every single day wrestle with

1056
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,838
grown ass adults who didn't want to put

1057
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,920
on a [ __ ] mask and it was just like

1058
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:42,799
chin diaper so much attitude like I

1059
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:45,480
always tell the story too my first day

1060
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,318
of coming back from uh pandemic I was

1061
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,639
off for two months which was amazing I

1062
00:41:47,318 --> 00:41:53,880
got um you know the pandemic pay which

1063
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:56,318
was about almost double what I made you

1064
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,599
know so for the first time I felt like I

1065
00:41:56,318 --> 00:41:59,318
actually had room toing breathe a little

1066
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,318
bit for my bills and then I utilize some

1067
00:41:59,318 --> 00:42:03,880
of that money to start getting my tents

1068
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:05,679
and stuff but nice so um the very first

1069
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,119
day I got back of the pandemic and

1070
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:09,000
everyone's on high alert you know we

1071
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,880
just spent two months locked down in our

1072
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,599
house you know like right we're fully

1073
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,240
masking up we're putting on gloves you

1074
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:16,599
know like I don't know if we did the

1075
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:18,559
gloves but we you know hand sanitizer

1076
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:20,640
we're basically bathing in it you know

1077
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:22,920
like keeping our distance from everyone

1078
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:24,239
like if people got too close I'd be like

1079
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,000
you need to back the [ __ ] up you know

1080
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:27,439
like give me some space please it makes

1081
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,039
me think of the South Park up episode

1082
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,639
where Cartman just has a a six stick or

1083
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:33,759
a three foot stick and pushes people

1084
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:37,639
away from him that would have been me

1085
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:39,680
you know um so anyway uh the very first

1086
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:41,838
day I'm back I'm not happy that I'm in

1087
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:43,598
this office you know dealing with people

1088
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:46,239
after being you know a Hermit

1089
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,880
essentially and I thrived by the way

1090
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:52,719
I

1091
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:54,280
en so um I'll never forget and again

1092
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:56,159
working at a medical office I had this

1093
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:59,200
gentleman's file in front of me so I

1094
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:02,679
knew he was 61 years old this [ __ ]

1095
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:05,358
61y old man was in our waiting room

1096
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:09,000
clipping his nails

1097
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:11,920
indoors [ __ ] [ __ ] just letting them fly

1098
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,719
all over the waiting room and no attempt

1099
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,880
to pick it up nothing just like not a

1100
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:17,279
care in the world and I remember I was

1101
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,000
on the phone like trying to help out

1102
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:23,920
another patient and I was so disgusted

1103
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,280
in like just taking back I I wanted to

1104
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,200
put the phone down and start yelling at

1105
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,480
him but I was just like I dude I was

1106
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:32,639
like in shock that's that sums up my

1107
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,960
experience working customer service like

1108
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:37,078
bro we were just locked down and you're

1109
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:40,679
leaving parts of your body behind what

1110
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:43,119
the [ __ ] man so um yeah I mean there's a

1111
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:44,960
lot of periods when I was working there

1112
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:47,720
that I just I didn't have it in me to go

1113
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,960
and and after getting yielded at you

1114
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:50,799
know by people who don't want to put on

1115
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,440
a mask you know

1116
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:57,079
and all sorts of stuff dealing with all

1117
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,800
those you know just childish adults you

1118
00:43:57,079 --> 00:44:00,800
you know uh coming home and then working

1119
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,599
on your computer you know sometimes you

1120
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,200
just want to go home and relax so

1121
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:05,880
there's a lot of periods where um I just

1122
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:08,598
wouldn't work on you know my programming

1123
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:10,800
so I'm so fortunate that that my friend

1124
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:12,400
was able to you know continuously uh

1125
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,599
encourage me you

1126
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,280
know you know how how's the programming

1127
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:18,280
going oh haven't been doing too much

1128
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,440
well let let's just take a second let me

1129
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,559
tell you about this one thing and then

1130
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,400
he would like tell about like the you

1131
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:26,240
know some sort of technology that would

1132
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,680
get me all pumped up and inspired again

1133
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:31,558
and then I'm like [ __ ] I want to go

1134
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:32,960
learn yeah that's cool um eventually uh

1135
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:35,119
you know he'd been working at this

1136
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:39,280
company for a couple years at that point

1137
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:41,800
and he was extremely happy and um at

1138
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,519
that point uh he let me know that um

1139
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,680
this other company he interviewed with

1140
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:48,079
you know was looking for you know a a

1141
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:50,440
programmer their a 10-year startup which

1142
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:53,280
is really bad to be a startup for that

1143
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:55,519
long and um he known from other

1144
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,559
programmers that they uh had cash flow

1145
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:58,960
problems and there's been a couple times

1146
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:03,040
where they had employees hold on to the

1147
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:06,079
paycheck and blah blah blah but um the

1148
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:07,679
one thing about programming is most

1149
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,079
companies don't care if you have the

1150
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:12,279
education for it they only care if you

1151
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,880
have the ability to program so one of

1152
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,480
the most important things besides

1153
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,920
putting together a portfolio where you

1154
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,639
can show off some of the projects you've

1155
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,800
worked on and I I mean some not all

1156
00:45:19,639 --> 00:45:23,000
because nobody wants to click through a

1157
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,200
thousand different iterations of these

1158
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,159
calculators you made or whatever it is

1159
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:30,318
sure um but of the biggest things that

1160
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:34,159
can help you get a career in programming

1161
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:35,880
is experience and so I knew that yeah

1162
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:39,440
I'm probably not going to be paid what I

1163
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:42,000
should be paid as a junior developer um

1164
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,960
there's known cash flow problems you

1165
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,159
know

1166
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,280
like it is what it is you know so um I

1167
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:49,159
basically but it was it was an

1168
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,000
entry-level position something to get

1169
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:53,598
your foot in the door I mean it's it

1170
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,760
could be seen as an entry level position

1171
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:58,160
but I was the full-time

1172
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,760
programmer so I was what's known as full

1173
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:02,598
stack which so um there's front end and

1174
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,559
back end uh front end when you go to a

1175
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:05,800
website is what you're seeing it's the

1176
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:08,160
version of that website that's being

1177
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:11,119
downloaded on your phone and then the

1178
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:12,759
back end is on a separate computer that

1179
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:15,559
your computer can reach out and make

1180
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:17,839
requests to and get responses of data

1181
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:19,160
back and forth so that's the backend and

1182
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:21,239
they're usually you know like two

1183
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:23,118
different Technologies and a FSE act

1184
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:26,078
developer can work on both aspects the

1185
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,960
front end and the back end oh okay and I

1186
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,760
didn't know that that's cool mhm I've

1187
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,280
heard fullstack I didn't know that that

1188
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,359
that's what it fullstack developers can

1189
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:37,559
do front end which is the UI the user uh

1190
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:40,598
interface uh which also encompasses ux

1191
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:42,280
which is user experience you know so you

1192
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:45,119
develop things that people can click on

1193
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:49,119
they can interact with they can utilize

1194
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:51,599
that interface to um get data from you

1195
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,480
know their backhand and just a side note

1196
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,640
I know we're supposed to be talking

1197
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,599
about weed and stuff but I love

1198
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:57,318
technology too it's it's a lot of fun

1199
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,480
and we'll Loop this back to too by the

1200
00:46:57,318 --> 00:47:02,239
way with Cosmic strains cuz for sure I

1201
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,000
you built your own website I I built my

1202
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:05,879
own website so we'll talk about a little

1203
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,679
bit too let's let's let's reel it back

1204
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,720
in then a little bit to the Cannabis

1205
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:11,799
stuff um because I think that that is a

1206
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:13,558
great story and I feel like that Journey

1207
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,839
alone does show people that they can not

1208
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:17,839
only purs pursue something that they're

1209
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:20,078
passionate about that they've spent

1210
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:23,519
their entire life enjoying

1211
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:26,559
cannabis as well as pursue something

1212
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:30,838
that allows them to enjoy those things

1213
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:33,480
and life uh without the limitations

1214
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:35,960
of you know being burnt out at the end

1215
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,358
of a day of a customer service job that

1216
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,960
pays shitty and that you're just

1217
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:43,199
emotionally and

1218
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:44,639
mentally you know done by the end of the

1219
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:46,639
day you don't want it you don't want to

1220
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:49,759
go home and start working on some

1221
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:52,960
passion project because you're spent um

1222
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:55,240
so it's really cool to to show that like

1223
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,559
following something that you do have

1224
00:47:55,239 --> 00:48:01,838
this desire to do

1225
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:04,920
as um it it helps when you have a job

1226
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:07,400
that can support that as well um it's

1227
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:11,280
it's hard to find though and uh we we

1228
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:16,400
just had a recent guest where

1229
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:22,280
um it's going to come to me uh but he oh

1230
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:26,480
Russ um Spartan grown he was able to uh

1231
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:28,839
translate his experience from one job of

1232
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,000
uh working shipping and receiving as

1233
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:33,440
well as his passion with cannabis and

1234
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:38,318
now he works for and helps with

1235
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:40,480
distribution for grandm LEDs so it's a

1236
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:42,599
it is really awesome to see when people

1237
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:45,920
can kind of combine those two things

1238
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:48,519
together and help like not only their

1239
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,880
their personal what they want in life

1240
00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:54,159
but also you know the necessities of

1241
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:56,280
living in a capitalistic market so

1242
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:58,558
that's really cool bills to pay bills to

1243
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,480
pay AB

1244
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,680
absolutely so yeah I mean I got a little

1245
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:06,119
sidetracked there but um my my main

1246
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:09,199
point of talking about you know my um my

1247
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:10,760
jump into software developing um was the

1248
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:13,199
Financial Freedom At first that came

1249
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:15,280
with that you know so I was able to

1250
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:19,798
continue to buy more packs of seeds you

1251
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,798
know at the point and

1252
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:29,119
um so I would say October yeah like

1253
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:31,920
October of 2021 ones when I got my job

1254
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:35,119
as a software engineer for the first

1255
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:38,119
time and at that time i' had been just

1256
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:43,358
scraping by you know barely making it um

1257
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:45,680
I think I had maybe two t0 you know and

1258
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:47,679
maybe couple different strains you know

1259
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:50,159
nothing nothing too it was a big deal

1260
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:51,759
when I got a new pack of seeds you know

1261
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:54,078
and then eventually I got that job as a

1262
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:57,359
software engineer and uh I remember

1263
00:49:54,079 --> 00:50:00,559
being able to really splurge on you know

1264
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:04,078
some of the seed packs I had my eye on

1265
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:07,599
and um I kept you know amassing this

1266
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:09,519
collection of seeds and uh at a certain

1267
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:11,240
point you know and I'd already gotten my

1268
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:12,880
medical license at a certain point I

1269
00:50:11,239 --> 00:50:16,279
started you know dabbling with uh

1270
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,318
breeding you know cuz at that point um I

1271
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,839
found

1272
00:50:17,318 --> 00:50:23,279
some some fenos that I felt were really

1273
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:25,880
special so I really was highly focused

1274
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,839
on preserving those genetics in one way

1275
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,798
or another you you know and um my

1276
00:50:28,838 --> 00:50:33,119
understanding of breeding was very

1277
00:50:30,798 --> 00:50:34,119
limited you know at the time it was more

1278
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,318
of what we learned about in middle

1279
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:39,079
school with Mendel and you know dominant

1280
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:41,759
recessive genes and things like that but

1281
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:43,400
I knew that the majority of the weed I

1282
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,559
mean I would say all the weed that I was

1283
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:50,240
growing was very high potency so even if

1284
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:52,640
it didn't display um a lot of the um

1285
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:55,199
characteristics that I you know found uh

1286
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:57,400
appealing in those particular phenos

1287
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:59,279
that it would have some some form of

1288
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:02,039
that you know plant inside those seeds

1289
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,680
that came from it so to me before we get

1290
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:05,239
into some of your breeding practices

1291
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:08,318
actually I want to rewind it just a

1292
00:51:05,239 --> 00:51:09,879
little bit yeah um because I feel like

1293
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:11,558
before you get into breeding you got to

1294
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:15,400
make sure that you can grow a plant

1295
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:17,798
right and so when you were growing at

1296
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:21,358
the the house back in the day that had

1297
00:51:17,798 --> 00:51:23,679
gotten raided um what style of growing

1298
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:26,679
were you using and what practices did

1299
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:29,000
you take from that into your new growing

1300
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:32,279
Venture once you got situated in this

1301
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:35,358
new housing um space with your fiance

1302
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:39,960
and uh decided to start growing

1303
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:41,759
intense yeah so um I have been a little

1304
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:45,960
unfortunate where I haven't had really

1305
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:50,200
any in real life grommies you know I it

1306
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:53,000
it's kind of changed here um you know um

1307
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:55,558
the last couple years and stuff but you

1308
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,760
know when Mr Chief and I started uh

1309
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:59,839
growing back in the day we knew very

1310
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,559
little you know and I don't even

1311
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:04,679
remember where we learned about it but

1312
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:07,720
we learned about the Fox Farms Trio and

1313
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:09,719
so um at the time you know I was just

1314
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:12,838
doing the best I

1315
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:14,838
could I uh we we utilized distilled

1316
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:16,519
water we didn't know about pH or

1317
00:52:14,838 --> 00:52:20,279
anything like that and we followed the

1318
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:23,239
chart and you know we were not growing

1319
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,720
at uh you know anything near what we

1320
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:26,118
probably could have done if we knew what

1321
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:28,519
we were doing but we are you know

1322
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:30,400
determined to figure it out uh we had

1323
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:32,679
some High Press sodium lights that we

1324
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:35,079
got from the local grow shop you know um

1325
00:52:32,679 --> 00:52:38,679
so this was a little bit I mean I I feel

1326
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:40,760
like LEDs were were available at the

1327
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:43,440
time but they were still in its infancy

1328
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:46,119
where um the technology wasn't really

1329
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,679
Define well it was very expensive and I

1330
00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:50,039
remember hearing at the time that they

1331
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:52,399
were just they were not worth their salt

1332
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:54,279
when uh in comparison to the other you

1333
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,838
know types of lights that you could get

1334
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:59,640
so we went with HPS um and yeah it was

1335
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:03,159
just the fox FMS Trio you know using

1336
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:05,318
Happy Frog soil and uh was it Grow Big

1337
00:53:03,159 --> 00:53:10,798
Big Bloom and tiger bloom you know those

1338
00:53:05,318 --> 00:53:13,798
three and here here I am um we're we're

1339
00:53:10,798 --> 00:53:16,318
at almost five years I mean um starting

1340
00:53:13,798 --> 00:53:17,599
back of growing again you know cuz uh

1341
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,318
about March is when it's going to be the

1342
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:23,119
fiveyear mark and I'm still you know on

1343
00:53:19,318 --> 00:53:25,960
the Fox Farms Trio and that being said

1344
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:28,079
um I'm not I'm not here to say that

1345
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:31,519
that's the best way to grow not at all

1346
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:33,200
you know it's more of just uh if it's

1347
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:35,039
not even if it's don't broke don't fix

1348
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:37,000
it it's more of if it's working then

1349
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:38,480
it's fine you know you can you can look

1350
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
through my Reddit account or my

1351
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,920
Instagram you can see some of the nugs

1352
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,679
that I've grown and I mean they look

1353
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:47,760
great and I'll tell you from firstand

1354
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:49,838
you know they they smoke great too um so

1355
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,920
I mean nothing against the fox FMS Trio

1356
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:54,358
but me personally and after you know

1357
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,480
meeting Gabby and I've had a lot of

1358
00:53:54,358 --> 00:53:59,358
conversations with Gabby about

1359
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:01,798
Hydroponics um I'm gearing up to

1360
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:03,558
slowly transfer you know or you know

1361
00:54:01,798 --> 00:54:06,400
move my room over to Hydroponics you

1362
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:07,920
know so one of the things that you know

1363
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,318
one of my current struggles right now is

1364
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,838
figuring out how to do the frame for a

1365
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:14,838
uh flow tray that will not take off too

1366
00:54:12,838 --> 00:54:15,920
much of the height um it's you know cuz

1367
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:18,400
when you're growing in a tent you have a

1368
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,798
limited amount of height so I don't want

1369
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:23,838
you know a third of the tent to be you

1370
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:27,000
know flow table so for sure you use a uh

1371
00:54:23,838 --> 00:54:29,798
a condensate pump um so that you use a

1372
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,639
very small catch Reservoir um with a

1373
00:54:29,798 --> 00:54:33,318
float valve on the condensate pump and

1374
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:35,440
then you just pump it out of the tent

1375
00:54:33,318 --> 00:54:38,920
into a a larger reservoir for your

1376
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:41,880
catchment um yeah but so I mean I have

1377
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:43,559
the only I've seen is is my table frame

1378
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,599
and then the the flow trays everything

1379
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:48,559
else I have pumps I have I have the um

1380
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:50,119
the sump pump you know with the the

1381
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:52,280
valve where you know it will

1382
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:56,680
automatically kick on if the valve gets

1383
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:58,640
to a certain level and you know um again

1384
00:54:56,679 --> 00:55:01,598
my my my room is right next to our

1385
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:03,519
kitchen so uh once my fiance and I get

1386
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,880
married at the end of the year um we're

1387
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:06,519
going to be looking to buy her mom out

1388
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,640
of this house so it'll be her in my

1389
00:55:06,519 --> 00:55:10,559
house and then at that time I can you

1390
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:12,480
know consider of course with my fiance's

1391
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,760
blessing you know never never do stuff

1392
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:19,079
without you know talking to the misses

1393
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:21,920
um happy spouse Happy House exactly um

1394
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:24,280
but yeah uh there's the potential of you

1395
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,119
know setting up some sort of drainage

1396
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,798
system in that room that drains into the

1397
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:30,440
kchen kitchen sink or the plumbing below

1398
00:55:27,798 --> 00:55:33,880
the kitchen sink so that would be ideal

1399
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:36,039
where I can um you know kind of do a was

1400
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:37,720
it flow to waste system where

1401
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:40,359
essentially drain to waste yeah drain to

1402
00:55:37,719 --> 00:55:41,838
waste exactly so yeah like um all the

1403
00:55:40,358 --> 00:55:43,838
nutrients that you feed on your plants

1404
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:45,558
they all drain to a reservoir none

1405
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:48,000
nothing that you're feeding your plants

1406
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:50,440
touches the other plants and it's it's a

1407
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,519
one and done you know um so I've

1408
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:56,880
actually read that it utilizes a lot

1409
00:55:52,519 --> 00:56:00,719
less um of your uh your hydrop mixture

1410
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:03,200
in the water than a normal kind of um uh

1411
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:05,038
recycling Reservoir would do so that's

1412
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:07,279
kind of interesting but you have like

1413
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:10,280
less less maintenance required because

1414
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,920
with the recirculating reservoirs

1415
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:15,240
um where it's like you either top

1416
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:17,519
feeding and then capturing it or E and

1417
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:20,798
flow systems where you're saturating

1418
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:23,400
from the bottom up uh of the media you

1419
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:25,358
do have to adjust and monitor the ph and

1420
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,798
and usually top it off with fresh water

1421
00:56:25,358 --> 00:56:29,119
pretty regularly

1422
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:31,559
whereas you can set a a nice Reservoir

1423
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:33,358
and as long as you're using uh clean

1424
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:35,599
Source water and then you're buffering

1425
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:38,440
that water accurately so that it doesn't

1426
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:40,559
uh swing the pH too much over time you

1427
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:42,599
can usually let those sit depending on

1428
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:45,640
the temperature of course for anywhere

1429
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:47,480
from three to 5 days and be able to

1430
00:56:45,639 --> 00:56:49,480
continuously feed your plants off of

1431
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:53,679
that so you can really go long periods

1432
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:56,880
of time without having to

1433
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:59,798
um physically need to be there um

1434
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,640
especially if you set up either timers

1435
00:56:59,798 --> 00:57:04,880
or Wi-Fi plugs or anything that will

1436
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:06,920
allow you to then control the uh

1437
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,160
irrigation equipment or

1438
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:11,519
otherwise yeah oh

1439
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:14,038
absolutely that's that's great stuff I

1440
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:18,559
mean I I I love Hydroponics personally

1441
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:20,000
but I also love living soil grows and um

1442
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:21,519
what some of the first plants that I

1443
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,159
remember growing where I was like I'm

1444
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:25,239
going to try and grow the biggest plants

1445
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:27,399
possible it was like tomatoes and stuff

1446
00:57:25,239 --> 00:57:30,118
and and then cannabis at at one point as

1447
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:33,240
well but it was all either

1448
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:35,440
um the the fox farm ocean Force soil or

1449
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:38,479
the Happy Frog soil with the the

1450
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:41,039
three-part um tiger bloom big big Bloom

1451
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:43,199
and uh big bud or whatever those three

1452
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:45,400
are The Grow Big Grow Big yep there you

1453
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:47,000
go yeah those and those always worked

1454
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:50,160
great especially for tomatoes and stuff

1455
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:54,599
like you could grow huge tomatoes with

1456
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:57,598
that mhm yeah um but again like like I

1457
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:59,960
said before you know it works it's um a

1458
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:02,240
relatively Easy System to be able to

1459
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:03,920
understand and to be able to pull off um

1460
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:06,279
but it's not the best you know so I'm

1461
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,440
looking to expand um one thing I did

1462
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:10,119
want to talk about too uh cuz I did make

1463
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:13,079
a post on this back when I was first

1464
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:16,358
growing and again I got laughed on uh

1465
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:19,680
micro grow so all the homies hate micro

1466
00:58:16,358 --> 00:58:20,759
growery um micro clownery for real dude

1467
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:24,239
[ __ ] those

1468
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:27,400
guys anyway um I was concerned about

1469
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:29,959
like sourcing water you know cuz

1470
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:32,079
again um pulling on my knowledge from

1471
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:33,639
back when we we tried to start that

1472
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:35,960
medical you know dispensary back in the

1473
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:37,440
day we were using distilled water and at

1474
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,159
the time I was like okay well that's

1475
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:42,599
what we used you know and so I started

1476
00:58:39,159 --> 00:58:44,199
doing that which is very not only timec

1477
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:46,160
consuming to try to gather a ton of

1478
00:58:44,199 --> 00:58:48,399
gallons of waters and you know store it

1479
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:51,920
and stuff but you know it can kind of

1480
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:53,200
add up after time you know um So

1481
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,920
eventually I started looking a little

1482
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:57,719
bit more into sourcing water and

1483
00:58:54,920 --> 00:59:00,440
figuring out and you know I learned

1484
00:58:57,719 --> 00:59:02,759
about um depending on your community you

1485
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:05,720
should be able to look up your Water

1486
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:07,000
District's um water report and so I did

1487
00:59:05,719 --> 00:59:10,679
that I did you know the one that was

1488
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,679
very close to my house and you'd be uh

1489
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:15,279
surprised that all the chemicals that

1490
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:16,759
have to go in to sanitize our water and

1491
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,200
to disinfect and to make it into

1492
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:20,760
something that we can consume without

1493
00:59:18,199 --> 00:59:22,439
getting sick absolutely you know a lot

1494
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:25,520
of people know about chlorine you know

1495
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:27,280
which you can very easily um not really

1496
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:29,318
burn off but you can kind of bubble off

1497
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:32,960
with your air stone overnight and stuff

1498
00:59:29,318 --> 00:59:34,279
like that but um my concern was like all

1499
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,599
that other stuff that they're putting in

1500
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,599
you know and it's it's probably fine I

1501
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:39,720
mean we're drinking it but you know if

1502
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:42,079
we're trying to to grow as cleanly as

1503
00:59:39,719 --> 00:59:45,439
possible and we're trying to you know

1504
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:48,280
feed our our plants you know um using

1505
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:50,559
water that uh that's not going to harm

1506
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:53,960
them you know um I wanted to know like

1507
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:56,079
what can I really do to you know um

1508
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:58,519
source that water at home and make it uh

1509
00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:00,480
an easier chore for me so I ended up

1510
00:59:58,519 --> 01:00:03,599
getting some carbon filters that you can

1511
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:04,880
buy on Amazon or something or um ideally

1512
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:06,160
you going to want to look at whatever

1513
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,280
website they come from because you know

1514
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:10,920
[ __ ] Amazon and [ __ ] all those

1515
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:13,400
billionaires um so I I got that carbon

1516
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:15,880
filter and I was using that to basically

1517
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:17,680
do like a pre- filation uh to my water

1518
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:20,240
and then bubbling off the chlorine you

1519
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:22,199
know um basically like a br filter or

1520
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:24,358
something along those lines kind of like

1521
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:26,318
that yeah cool so I mean it has all the

1522
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:28,440
the different you know forms of set in

1523
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:31,440
in inside that you know like you can

1524
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:32,639
look on YouTube and uh find videos of

1525
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:35,200
you know people in the wilderness who

1526
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:37,798
make their own you know like um filters

1527
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:39,318
you know just to show like how how much

1528
01:00:37,798 --> 01:00:41,358
cleaner the water looks after running

1529
01:00:39,318 --> 01:00:43,279
through it so it's it's something like

1530
01:00:41,358 --> 01:00:47,318
that but again it uses like carbon in it

1531
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:50,079
and and all that stuff but yeah so um

1532
01:00:47,318 --> 01:00:51,759
one other thing about that method is uh

1533
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:54,039
not only does it stripple you know the

1534
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,599
majority of whatever the water district

1535
01:00:54,039 --> 01:00:58,920
adds to it but it also takes out some

1536
01:00:55,599 --> 01:01:01,318
coun and our plants need that so I um

1537
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:04,880
add the calcium back in by doing the

1538
01:01:01,318 --> 01:01:07,719
calmag plus zinc I think it is and

1539
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:10,559
that's from plus iron you know what I

1540
01:01:07,719 --> 01:01:12,838
have my

1541
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:15,079
um my notes Here is it like the

1542
01:01:12,838 --> 01:01:19,400
Botanicare Cal Mag Botanicare there it

1543
01:01:15,079 --> 01:01:22,359
is yeah it's a calcium nitrate

1544
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:24,639
magnesium uh and uh

1545
01:01:22,358 --> 01:01:26,318
iron is it iron yeah you're right it's

1546
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:28,960
iron it's not zinc I always say zinc but

1547
01:01:26,318 --> 01:01:30,920
I'm wrong is iron um so yeah I I add

1548
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:33,000
that back in So basically I have four

1549
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:35,559
things that I add um you know to my

1550
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:38,079
water and I just follow the fox Farm's

1551
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:40,519
you know soil guide

1552
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:43,599
um by the way you know I've learned a

1553
01:01:40,519 --> 01:01:46,920
lot as I've done this you know I'm uh

1554
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:48,359
I've learned a lot by doing as well so

1555
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:50,720
um just about any mistake that you can

1556
01:01:48,358 --> 01:01:51,838
make I probably made it you know so the

1557
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:54,199
main thing about making mistakes is

1558
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:56,440
learning from it so I'll say this be

1559
01:01:54,199 --> 01:01:58,598
very careful about the um the feeding

1560
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:01,960
schedule that you grab because there was

1561
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:03,400
one point when I was like okay uh so

1562
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,960
just because we we've talked a lot about

1563
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:08,200
my history you know when I first started

1564
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:10,559
growing I was scraping by so a lot of

1565
01:02:08,199 --> 01:02:13,078
times I would do half feeding you know

1566
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:14,278
and I I would almost never feed fully

1567
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:16,160
you know because I was trying to make

1568
01:02:14,278 --> 01:02:17,798
you know make my nutrients last as long

1569
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:20,639
as possible before I had to buy you know

1570
01:02:17,798 --> 01:02:22,400
another another batch and so there's a

1571
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:24,078
period where after years of doing that I

1572
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,920
was like oh [ __ ] like I'm a software

1573
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:28,559
engineer now I can you know afford or to

1574
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:31,680
to feed my plants the way that they need

1575
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:34,720
to be fed and you know so I was probably

1576
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:38,480
Stony looked up the feeding schedule I

1577
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:41,558
didn't [ __ ] realize that it was for

1578
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:43,440
Hydroponics and so for a whole feeding

1579
01:02:41,559 --> 01:02:46,680
or actually a whole run I was

1580
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:48,559
overfeeding my plants like crazy um it

1581
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:49,919
ended up like my veg plants were kind of

1582
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:52,480
around the same of what it should have

1583
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:55,480
been so they they look fine but my my

1584
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:57,240
flowers were just like awful dude like

1585
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,798
so so many dead leaves and I was like

1586
01:02:57,239 --> 01:03:01,278
what the hell is going on I couldn't

1587
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:02,358
figure it out and I finally was right I

1588
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:06,519
forgot they have the two different

1589
01:03:02,358 --> 01:03:08,358
charts for the soil and yeah [ __ ] man

1590
01:03:06,519 --> 01:03:10,400
that's so funny CU yeah when I first

1591
01:03:08,358 --> 01:03:13,239
started growing I

1592
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:15,960
um I wanted to do Hydroponics because I

1593
01:03:13,239 --> 01:03:18,719
was like this seems because initially

1594
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:20,519
like I I had grown you know plants here

1595
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:23,358
and there throughout the years but I

1596
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:26,719
didn't really go hard into it until I

1597
01:03:23,358 --> 01:03:29,000
needed to Pivot my my career so I knew

1598
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:34,199
that Hydroponics would be probably the

1599
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:36,440
the most uh widely used um source of

1600
01:03:34,199 --> 01:03:38,639
nutrients when growing in a commercial

1601
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:40,200
scale uh based on all the research that

1602
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:43,639
I had been doing at that point just by

1603
01:03:40,199 --> 01:03:45,679
looking online at forms and stuff and um

1604
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:48,159
I saw that uh three-part nutrients were

1605
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:52,558
really popular where you have your um

1606
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:53,920
your Bloom your veg and then your micro

1607
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:56,319
nutrients or whatever and usually like

1608
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:58,680
the micronutrients has your n nen and

1609
01:03:56,318 --> 01:04:01,558
stuff in it too so I used like the um

1610
01:03:58,679 --> 01:04:03,519
cultivation Nation three parts from Fox

1611
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:06,599
Farm still because I had already had so

1612
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:09,480
much success with the fox farm original

1613
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:11,079
Trio uh when growing all the other

1614
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:14,159
vegetables and stuff that I had grown

1615
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:17,000
throughout the years and so yeah I when

1616
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:18,558
I looked at that I it it was only Built

1617
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,358
for Hydroponics and then I remember

1618
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:22,640
looking back at the other Trio and

1619
01:04:20,358 --> 01:04:25,798
seeing that they had the hydroponic

1620
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:28,239
feeding and the soil based feeding and

1621
01:04:25,798 --> 01:04:29,719
they were vastly different yeah so I

1622
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:33,479
learned the hard

1623
01:04:29,719 --> 01:04:36,038
way um but luck we all burn plants what

1624
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:36,920
was that we all burn plants they were

1625
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:39,520
sure

1626
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:40,680
burned um but yeah I figured it out and

1627
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:43,318
you know there was another time where I

1628
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:45,558
had issues with my pH you know um it

1629
01:04:43,318 --> 01:04:48,159
took me a while to figure out that uh

1630
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:49,559
you know at first when I first started

1631
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:51,278
you know moving away from distilled

1632
01:04:49,559 --> 01:04:53,359
water I was peaching my water and then

1633
01:04:51,278 --> 01:04:56,599
adding nutrients in and not realizing

1634
01:04:53,358 --> 01:04:58,759
like how acidic it would go order

1635
01:04:56,599 --> 01:05:00,440
matters you know because the nutrients

1636
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:02,079
that you add in will absolutely affect

1637
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:04,559
your pH um another thing I had to

1638
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:07,079
learned the hard way is your pH will

1639
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:09,200
drift after a while so you want to mix

1640
01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:11,278
your nutrients at least um they say like

1641
01:05:09,199 --> 01:05:14,719
20 minutes you know 15 minutes and

1642
01:05:11,278 --> 01:05:16,960
that's probably for like when you add pH

1643
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:19,038
for it to fully affect it but honestly I

1644
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:22,240
would wait like an hour or two you know

1645
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:24,960
and I'd let it bubble and cuz I mean

1646
01:05:22,239 --> 01:05:26,959
even after that 20 minutes if you take

1647
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,079
another you know 40 minutes or so and

1648
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,798
and measure your Peach again you're

1649
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:33,559
going to notice that it's it's still

1650
01:05:29,798 --> 01:05:36,759
going up you know so um there's going to

1651
01:05:33,559 --> 01:05:38,720
be a certain point where um your pH is

1652
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:42,200
going to be relatively steady it's not

1653
01:05:38,719 --> 01:05:43,439
going to be changing as quickly and so

1654
01:05:42,199 --> 01:05:46,960
you know that that's just another thing

1655
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:50,039
I kind of figured out over time you know

1656
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:53,119
um so let's kind of uh Circle back to

1657
01:05:50,039 --> 01:05:56,440
the gross story um so we were talking

1658
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:58,720
about me just getting into breeding and

1659
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:01,119
for me it was a form of just saving the

1660
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:04,480
genetics that I used all my hard earn

1661
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:07,440
receptionist dollars on you know and um

1662
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:09,480
the the plants that I just I really

1663
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,960
worked on making sure that I kept alive

1664
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:13,318
for all that time you know and I had

1665
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,880
knowledge on cloning of course from back

1666
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:19,358
when we tried to do the the medical

1667
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:21,160
cannabis club um you know but I I still

1668
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:24,038
just because I felt like everything was

1669
01:06:21,159 --> 01:06:27,838
really special I felt the need to try to

1670
01:06:24,039 --> 01:06:30,319
preserve it in you know the of seeds so

1671
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:33,440
um the very

1672
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:36,278
first time that I went into breeding I

1673
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:39,720
um grew out a regular pack of it's it

1674
01:06:36,278 --> 01:06:41,119
from exotic genetics and that is gelato

1675
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:43,199
U not sure what cut of gelato it just

1676
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:46,480
says gelato gelato times mint chocolate

1677
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:47,480
chip which is another one of um Exotics

1678
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,480
signature

1679
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:51,838
strains um you know so I thought that

1680
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:54,240
was like a very decent one to kind of

1681
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:56,239
get into I mean I don't think I had

1682
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:59,199
Gelato at that time I just knew like the

1683
01:06:56,239 --> 01:07:00,919
reputation of that and I knew that from

1684
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:03,558
everything I saw on Reddit that exotic

1685
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:05,278
genetics was a pretty solid company so I

1686
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:06,798
figured it was a pretty safe bet to

1687
01:07:05,278 --> 01:07:08,960
choose that strain even though I didn't

1688
01:07:06,798 --> 01:07:12,000
know too much about it and let's let's

1689
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:15,599
jump into breeding so um I grew that one

1690
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:19,159
out and you know the nugs were

1691
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:21,760
um I I would say they weren't like

1692
01:07:19,159 --> 01:07:24,159
anything like extraordinary where it was

1693
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:25,880
just out of like just super unique it

1694
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:28,318
was it was more of just like standing

1695
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:31,358
like yeah it's super potent it it

1696
01:07:28,318 --> 01:07:33,199
produces really well you know it's um

1697
01:07:31,358 --> 01:07:35,639
relatively like a medium plant so it's

1698
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:38,278
great for you know uh tent growing but

1699
01:07:35,639 --> 01:07:40,199
it's I don't want to say Bland but it it

1700
01:07:38,278 --> 01:07:41,719
seems more of just kind of like yeah

1701
01:07:40,199 --> 01:07:44,159
it's just like kind of like all the

1702
01:07:41,719 --> 01:07:45,558
other weed around so with that being

1703
01:07:44,159 --> 01:07:47,558
said I felt like it would make like a

1704
01:07:45,559 --> 01:07:49,278
really good vehicle to you know maybe

1705
01:07:47,559 --> 01:07:51,119
put pass on some of the more unique

1706
01:07:49,278 --> 01:07:52,639
traits from the other plants and again I

1707
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:54,240
didn't I didn't know too much about

1708
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:56,759
recessive D dominant jeans it was more

1709
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:58,199
like hey let's just let's just jump in

1710
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:00,160
you know like sometimes you got to throw

1711
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:02,519
it all at a wall and see what sticks for

1712
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:05,000
real dude and a lot of the stuff that I

1713
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:06,639
do is is kind of like let's just the

1714
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,079
only way you can start learning is by

1715
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:11,920
getting in and doing it you know so

1716
01:08:09,079 --> 01:08:13,519
that's what I did is I jumped in and um

1717
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,639
I ended up growing out a bunch of

1718
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:17,479
different other strains that are

1719
01:08:14,639 --> 01:08:20,599
regulars and selecting males you know I

1720
01:08:17,479 --> 01:08:23,759
I typically like to find the males that

1721
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:25,719
um show their sex pretty early um and

1722
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:28,719
then when you flower them out that they

1723
01:08:25,719 --> 01:08:30,880
drop pollen relatively early um for me

1724
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:33,480
that's a good indication that you know

1725
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:35,440
the genetics from that are going to be a

1726
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:38,678
little more faster finishing for flower

1727
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:41,838
times that's so funny that you choose

1728
01:08:38,679 --> 01:08:44,000
for early early flowering males as well

1729
01:08:41,838 --> 01:08:47,439
that's that's how I choose for males I

1730
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,039
um but like I'll hear from so many other

1731
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:51,119
breeders that have been doing it for a

1732
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:52,759
long time that they always say like you

1733
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:54,640
don't want to choose the male that shows

1734
01:08:52,759 --> 01:08:57,359
last but you definitely don't want to

1735
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:59,239
choose the first first five that show

1736
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:02,039
and they say that that's due to

1737
01:08:59,238 --> 01:09:05,158
potential instability but for me I'm

1738
01:09:02,039 --> 01:09:08,000
just like it if you can keep it in a

1739
01:09:05,158 --> 01:09:12,879
vegetative cycle where it's not showing

1740
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:16,039
a lot of its uh sexual parts um I'm not

1741
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:17,440
I'm not too worried about it um but

1742
01:09:16,039 --> 01:09:19,198
that's fascinating that you also choose

1743
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:21,079
the early flowers because that's what I

1744
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:23,479
I always wanted faster flowers like I

1745
01:09:21,079 --> 01:09:24,798
wanted it to show its flower early and

1746
01:09:23,479 --> 01:09:26,519
um because usually that means that

1747
01:09:24,798 --> 01:09:29,920
you'll find something within there if if

1748
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:31,520
it's a 65 days strain right uh but it

1749
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,880
doesn't start showing till day 21 well

1750
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:36,359
if you can get it to start showing at

1751
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:41,039
day 10 or 14 then maybe you now have a

1752
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:43,279
59 days strain and I was always aiming

1753
01:09:41,039 --> 01:09:45,238
for my when my efforts whenever I've

1754
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,719
done like a small breeding project was

1755
01:09:45,238 --> 01:09:50,158
how can I make something out of this

1756
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:51,759
commercially viable so that it can be or

1757
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:54,238
even for hom Growers you know no one

1758
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:56,000
wants to grow a strain that takes way

1759
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:59,399
too long it it's that much longer

1760
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:02,359
there's that much more risk for error MH

1761
01:09:59,399 --> 01:10:04,559
absolutely yeah I mean the way that my

1762
01:10:02,359 --> 01:10:06,439
room downstairs is set up is three tents

1763
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:09,360
um technically four cuz I have a little

1764
01:10:06,439 --> 01:10:11,479
2x 2x3 foot like that's my little clone

1765
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:13,679
tent which is awesome I love having a

1766
01:10:11,479 --> 01:10:17,839
little clone tent you know tent just for

1767
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:20,119
my little my little domes um but ideally

1768
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:22,800
um I have a 4x4 tent I have a 3X3 tent

1769
01:10:20,119 --> 01:10:25,319
and a 2x4 tent and the 2x4 tent would

1770
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:27,239
act as my veg tent and then the other t

1771
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:29,920
tents would be offset by a month but

1772
01:10:27,238 --> 01:10:31,919
they're my flower tents so ideally if

1773
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:34,440
you have a strain that finishes in 8

1774
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:37,000
weeks then um with that setup you're

1775
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:41,039
harvesting once a month right you know

1776
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:44,079
so that's what I was shooting for um and

1777
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:46,279
I I do want to point out too um that the

1778
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:47,719
way that I you know I've done things in

1779
01:10:46,279 --> 01:10:49,079
the past isn't necessarily the way that

1780
01:10:47,719 --> 01:10:51,239
I'm going to continue to do things you

1781
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:54,279
know this is has been an evolution of

1782
01:10:51,238 --> 01:10:55,599
who I am as a grower and you know um and

1783
01:10:54,279 --> 01:10:59,039
the things that I've learned and the

1784
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:01,560
things that I'm doing um so yeah I mean

1785
01:10:59,039 --> 01:11:03,600
I I I did that first run with it it um I

1786
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:05,920
grew out some of those those strains and

1787
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:08,159
you know I had some really really really

1788
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:10,199
nice um plants that I got out of that uh

1789
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:13,158
overd doy was one of them uh you might

1790
01:11:10,198 --> 01:11:15,039
see that on my site um I I don't have

1791
01:11:13,158 --> 01:11:17,479
overd doy itself available but I have a

1792
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:20,519
lot of mixtures with that um plant um so

1793
01:11:17,479 --> 01:11:21,678
like overdose OG and I I forget all the

1794
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:23,239
I mean I came up with so many [ __ ]

1795
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:25,399
names you know I foret all the [ __ ] that

1796
01:11:23,238 --> 01:11:27,119
I wrote down that's the fun part it is

1797
01:11:25,399 --> 01:11:28,920
you know uh you could tell some some of

1798
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:30,439
them I got a little lazy for but some of

1799
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:33,000
the names that I came up with I'm

1800
01:11:30,439 --> 01:11:34,719
extremely proud of like uh ectoplasm

1801
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,198
that's one of the strains that I'm

1802
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:40,439
probably going to end up um taking past

1803
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:42,079
uh F1 um so yeah that that being said

1804
01:11:40,439 --> 01:11:46,519
all the strains available on my site are

1805
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:48,198
f1s um you know I do want to move on to

1806
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:50,560
making stable lines and everything like

1807
01:11:48,198 --> 01:11:52,799
that but I'm still in in the beginning

1808
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:55,280
of of what I I hope to accomplish you

1809
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,480
know and everything just takes time um

1810
01:11:55,279 --> 01:11:59,519
so we'll talk a little bit more about

1811
01:11:56,479 --> 01:12:03,839
that in a second but

1812
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:05,639
um yeah kind of kind of going back uh I

1813
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:08,679
did the itet and then I had a couple

1814
01:12:05,639 --> 01:12:11,039
other seed runs that I did where I was

1815
01:12:08,679 --> 01:12:13,199
practicing other pollination techniques

1816
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:15,760
so there's one technique that you can uh

1817
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:17,559
if you collect the pollen ahead of time

1818
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,719
um you can actually utilize and I know

1819
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:20,920
we've talked about this before but a

1820
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:22,600
paintbrush and you can paint on the

1821
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:24,560
little buds very carefully cuz that

1822
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:26,079
pollen likes to fly and you got to make

1823
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:28,039
sure you don't move lot you know create

1824
01:12:26,079 --> 01:12:31,158
a lot of air flow and stuff but very

1825
01:12:28,039 --> 01:12:33,399
very gently do I have a pen

1826
01:12:31,158 --> 01:12:36,439
here very gently I can take my little

1827
01:12:33,399 --> 01:12:38,839
paintbrush here and just just barely

1828
01:12:36,439 --> 01:12:40,359
paint it on the bud you know and you'll

1829
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:42,920
know

1830
01:12:40,359 --> 01:12:45,559
um if your if your buds accepted the

1831
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:46,920
pollen because um after a day or so your

1832
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:50,360
pistol is going to shrink and it's going

1833
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:52,480
to turn almost like a brown instead of

1834
01:12:50,359 --> 01:12:54,719
like the orange it typically um shows

1835
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:56,559
but I would go ahead and I would paint

1836
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:59,560
um a couple buds on a single branch and

1837
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:01,199
then I would grab a paper lunch bag and

1838
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:03,159
I would put it over the bud and I would

1839
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:05,919
tape it and leave it like that for three

1840
01:13:03,158 --> 01:13:07,359
to 5 days and at that point you know the

1841
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,760
the pollen's not supposed to be viable

1842
01:13:07,359 --> 01:13:10,519
anymore it's not supposed to

1843
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:12,639
cross-pollinate in the other branches

1844
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:16,400
but you can utilize that technique very

1845
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:18,840
carefully and um on one plant have

1846
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:21,599
multiple different crosses you know on

1847
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:23,679
on each uh different branch so I tried

1848
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:25,480
that technique too and I did another you

1849
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:27,760
know seed run like that that where I

1850
01:13:25,479 --> 01:13:29,000
made a ton of different crosses and so I

1851
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:31,679
was having a blast you know I was

1852
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,800
feeling pretty good about myself and so

1853
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:34,960
um i' would go down the hydro store and

1854
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:37,880
I you know just kind of shoot the [ __ ]

1855
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:39,279
with the guys there and um eventually I

1856
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:40,840
kind of gave them some of the seeds that

1857
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:42,960
I made and like hey you know like this

1858
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:45,079
is I'm just doing for fun and they got

1859
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:47,560
super excited and um at that point they

1860
01:13:45,079 --> 01:13:52,319
were encouraging me to open up like a

1861
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:57,239
you know a seed company you know and

1862
01:13:52,319 --> 01:14:00,238
so very naively I said okay let's do it

1863
01:13:57,238 --> 01:14:02,439
and by let's I mean I'll do it so um you

1864
01:14:00,238 --> 01:14:04,479
know I noticed at all the dispensaries

1865
01:14:02,439 --> 01:14:06,799
around me none of them had seeds

1866
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:08,839
available for sale and I was like you

1867
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:11,159
know I feel like that's like a big hole

1868
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:12,840
in the market you know cuz it is like

1869
01:14:11,158 --> 01:14:15,920
for me you know I had an order at the

1870
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:17,920
time you know I ordered from Europe and

1871
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:20,880
I you have to wait like a month to get

1872
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:24,079
your seeds and um typically you want

1873
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:25,960
them hidden so um there was times where

1874
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:28,639
I got you know an order seeds and it was

1875
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:30,639
like a little children's like um cloth

1876
01:14:28,639 --> 01:14:32,679
book you know that they're they have all

1877
01:14:30,639 --> 01:14:35,199
these tactile Sensations on it and stuff

1878
01:14:32,679 --> 01:14:36,560
and um I had to rip it open and there

1879
01:14:35,198 --> 01:14:38,238
was another time it arrived it was a

1880
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:41,840
baby doll and I had to pull the leg off

1881
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:44,000
and reach in the body and stuff so um

1882
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:46,039
you know I was like you know that's kind

1883
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,439
of cool but that sucks like you have to

1884
01:14:46,039 --> 01:14:50,439
wait so long I can't just go to the

1885
01:14:48,439 --> 01:14:53,559
store and talk to someone real quick and

1886
01:14:50,439 --> 01:14:55,079
pick up a pack of seeds so you know um I

1887
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:58,719
felt like you know that was probably not

1888
01:14:55,079 --> 01:15:01,800
opportunity so I uh reached out to Mr

1889
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:04,239
chfa and again this is like 10 15 years

1890
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:06,440
yeah closer to 15 years after our whole

1891
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:07,839
raid incident and he's a professional at

1892
01:15:06,439 --> 01:15:11,279
this point he doesn't even smoke or

1893
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:13,600
anything like that anymore um you know

1894
01:15:11,279 --> 01:15:14,960
but uh his profession is an accountant

1895
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,639
you know I feel like it's okay to say

1896
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:18,560
that so you know he's got a lot of

1897
01:15:16,639 --> 01:15:20,480
knowledge when it comes to businesses

1898
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:23,199
and the books and how they run and

1899
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:25,399
everything like that so I was like cool

1900
01:15:23,198 --> 01:15:27,879
I am a software engineer I put together

1901
01:15:25,399 --> 01:15:30,679
this rudimentary website that can you

1902
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:33,719
know serve as a store for the company

1903
01:15:30,679 --> 01:15:35,319
I've done you know I've put thousands

1904
01:15:33,719 --> 01:15:38,279
tens of thousands of dollars of my own

1905
01:15:35,319 --> 01:15:40,880
money into this operation um you know I

1906
01:15:38,279 --> 01:15:43,559
have all this product you know uh coming

1907
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:45,119
up um you know or planned you know cuz

1908
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:48,960
at the time I didn't I didn't do my

1909
01:15:45,119 --> 01:15:51,039
first run my first uh commercial run yet

1910
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,520
and so the plan was to have him come do

1911
01:15:51,039 --> 01:15:55,639
the administration stuff and I'd take

1912
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:57,800
care of the growing and the website and

1913
01:15:55,639 --> 01:16:00,760
uh we really tried for months and months

1914
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:03,719
and eventually it was very apparent that

1915
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:05,159
he was just too busy you know and so um

1916
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:06,679
I just straight up you know sometimes

1917
01:16:05,158 --> 01:16:09,198
you got to do this too in this day and

1918
01:16:06,679 --> 01:16:11,679
age you have to just be like hey you got

1919
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:13,839
you got to let me know like no more

1920
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:15,560
[ __ ] footing around you know like tell

1921
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,560
me if if the answer is no you're not

1922
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:18,639
going to hurt my feelings but you're

1923
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:21,320
going to have to just let me know so I

1924
01:16:18,639 --> 01:16:23,119
can make my next move so yeah the answer

1925
01:16:21,319 --> 01:16:25,079
was you know he's not able to do it and

1926
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:26,719
I'd already built up all this momentum

1927
01:16:25,079 --> 01:16:28,479
in my mind you know plus all the

1928
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:30,960
thousands of dollars I bought on seeds

1929
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:32,599
plus if I'm going to be perfectly honest

1930
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:34,679
you know one of the appealing things

1931
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:37,000
about having a seed company is oh now I

1932
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:39,319
can justify all my purchases of seeds

1933
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,158
that I want to buy right because you're

1934
01:16:39,319 --> 01:16:42,799
trying to make more yeah exactly right

1935
01:16:41,158 --> 01:16:44,479
oh it's for the business you know of

1936
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,760
course I could buy you know these these

1937
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:49,399
packs of

1938
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:53,679
seeds so um yep yeah I mean I pushed on

1939
01:16:49,399 --> 01:16:55,839
forward and uh started researching and

1940
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:59,119
figuring out what it takes to created an

1941
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:01,199
LLC and I found a cannabis lawyer um

1942
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:03,719
nearby that specialized in cannabis

1943
01:17:01,198 --> 01:17:04,839
business law so I had a consultation

1944
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:07,880
with him to make sure I wasn't breaking

1945
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:10,159
any laws cuz you know as now that I I'm

1946
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:12,159
a software engineer you know my for me

1947
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:14,920
my career is is the most important thing

1948
01:17:12,158 --> 01:17:17,519
and I I love growing and I you know I

1949
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:19,639
love everything like that's come from

1950
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:25,760
from doing this but ultimately my main

1951
01:17:19,639 --> 01:17:25,760
responsibility you was my job so um

1952
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:30,560
yeah uh as a professional I kind of

1953
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:32,239
wanted to kind of stay more in the

1954
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:34,039
shadows too so I was trying to get you

1955
01:17:32,238 --> 01:17:36,198
know other people involved and it just

1956
01:17:34,039 --> 01:17:38,800
it wasn't working out so again I got the

1957
01:17:36,198 --> 01:17:40,279
L uh LLC I met with the the Cannabis

1958
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:41,520
business lawyer again to make sure I

1959
01:17:40,279 --> 01:17:43,198
wasn't breaking any laws make sure I

1960
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:45,880
wasn't getting in trouble with my job or

1961
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:48,399
anything like that and we're good to go

1962
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:50,199
so um I opened up my LLC in the summer

1963
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:51,559
and I'm still working on the website

1964
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:54,599
because it's not up to the point where I

1965
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:57,120
can take orders you know like I'm at at

1966
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:59,520
that point I was using it as an

1967
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:02,359
opportunity to learn react and I'm not

1968
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:03,440
sure a lot of uh if any um software

1969
01:18:02,359 --> 01:18:06,079
Engineers are out there they'll know

1970
01:18:03,439 --> 01:18:09,678
react is uh you

1971
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:11,920
know basically the framework that um uh

1972
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:14,079
Facebook made and you know I'm not not a

1973
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:16,000
big fan of meow or any of that stuff but

1974
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:18,000
I really do like react I love the way

1975
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,960
that you know it it almost works like

1976
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,279
Legos so anyone who who liked putting

1977
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:23,880
Legos together as a kid you know that's

1978
01:18:22,279 --> 01:18:26,198
it's the program programmatic version of

1979
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:29,400
Legos if you will or it came like that

1980
01:18:26,198 --> 01:18:31,799
but anyway so uh yeah I mean I opened up

1981
01:18:29,399 --> 01:18:34,198
the company and I did my first um you

1982
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:37,639
know I finished up my first run which I

1983
01:18:34,198 --> 01:18:41,359
utilized from archive uh Seedbank Casper

1984
01:18:37,639 --> 01:18:43,199
OG and uh that had ghost OG and uh face

1985
01:18:41,359 --> 01:18:44,799
off OG and I think it was like bat cross

1986
01:18:43,198 --> 01:18:47,359
3 or something like that I'll have to

1987
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:50,159
look at my notes too but you know in my

1988
01:18:47,359 --> 01:18:52,920
mind um I wanted to start with a a solid

1989
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:56,039
OG strain and OG's they just um are

1990
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:59,600
notorious for being very Hardy plans you

1991
01:18:56,039 --> 01:19:03,119
know like um you know this whole process

1992
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:04,440
I I would even say that I'm not like uh

1993
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:05,719
you know I definitely have a lot of

1994
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:07,399
knowledge when it comes to this stuff

1995
01:19:05,719 --> 01:19:09,279
but during the whole process I wasn't

1996
01:19:07,399 --> 01:19:11,279
like the greatest grower ever you know

1997
01:19:09,279 --> 01:19:12,759
like you know there there's a lot of

1998
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:16,319
strains out there that are known for

1999
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:17,760
being finicky and at that time if it was

2000
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:19,840
if I had one of those finicky strains

2001
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:22,280
who knows if I would have you know got

2002
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:25,119
her to the finish line so I mean that

2003
01:19:22,279 --> 01:19:27,759
doesn't sound great but really the way

2004
01:19:25,119 --> 01:19:31,000
that I look at it is all the strains

2005
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:33,079
that I worked with at at in the very

2006
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,359
first beginning of you know when I was

2007
01:19:33,079 --> 01:19:38,359
growing um and before like I decided to

2008
01:19:35,359 --> 01:19:40,079
do this company they were willing to

2009
01:19:38,359 --> 01:19:43,119
take a lot of abuse you know I put them

2010
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:45,800
through the ringer and I feel like um

2011
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:49,158
that is a really good um thing to have

2012
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:51,800
you know to have very Hardy plants where

2013
01:19:49,158 --> 01:19:53,599
you know um I I used to joke back back

2014
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,960
you know a couple years back that if I

2015
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:57,679
could grow these out then any one can

2016
01:19:54,960 --> 01:20:00,279
grow them out you know because um

2017
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:02,119
they're not finicky at all you know like

2018
01:20:00,279 --> 01:20:04,599
I was able to get them to the the Finish

2019
01:20:02,119 --> 01:20:06,679
Line despite how many problems I I you

2020
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:08,719
know I I battled and everything like

2021
01:20:06,679 --> 01:20:10,679
that so that was another thing that I

2022
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:12,600
really look for in my plants is just how

2023
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:16,520
hearty are they how much abuse can they

2024
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:17,880
you know can they take you know cuz um

2025
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:20,040
you know do you apply any sort of

2026
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:25,480
abiotic stressers to your plants

2027
01:20:20,039 --> 01:20:28,600
currently um where where you're uh

2028
01:20:25,479 --> 01:20:30,718
like physically trying to create extra

2029
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:33,280
stresses in order to like proof out

2030
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:36,520
genetics or anything like that so that

2031
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:38,599
is the plan going forward um so at at

2032
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:39,679
this time um I should probably do a

2033
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,480
little bit of a summary because I know

2034
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:42,920
we're we're kind of we're about an hour

2035
01:20:41,479 --> 01:20:46,039
close to an hour and a half here and I

2036
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:48,279
don't want to bore anybody but um my

2037
01:20:46,039 --> 01:20:50,920
game plan in the beginning was to make

2038
01:20:48,279 --> 01:20:53,359
several F1 lines and just do a bunch of

2039
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:54,800
that initial leg work you know just I

2040
01:20:53,359 --> 01:20:56,439
have all these plants that I GRE Grew

2041
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,760
From seeds all these different fenos

2042
01:20:56,439 --> 01:20:59,839
some of them are really interesting some

2043
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:02,239
of them are probably close to what they

2044
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:05,360
should be you know what you expect to to

2045
01:21:02,238 --> 01:21:07,359
get from those seeds and um I wanted to

2046
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:10,479
take that opportunity to try to get as

2047
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:11,719
many different Crossings as possible and

2048
01:21:10,479 --> 01:21:14,079
it's not that I saw that they were going

2049
01:21:11,719 --> 01:21:16,000
to be all viable like very perfect

2050
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:17,600
Crossings there were some crossings that

2051
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,560
I knew were going to work out very

2052
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:21,639
strongly and those ones I absolutely put

2053
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:23,080
on my site but there's a lot of um

2054
01:21:21,639 --> 01:21:24,960
crosses that I made that are not

2055
01:21:23,079 --> 01:21:28,039
available on the site at all you know

2056
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:30,079
and it's because either um I didn't get

2057
01:21:28,039 --> 01:21:31,920
enough seeds where I felt like they can

2058
01:21:30,079 --> 01:21:34,079
be something I can put in packs and have

2059
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,880
you know x amount of packs to offer to

2060
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:36,960
people or it's because I didn't think

2061
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,359
that they were going to actually you

2062
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:40,198
know produce something that was going to

2063
01:21:38,359 --> 01:21:42,000
be worthwhile to you know have someone

2064
01:21:40,198 --> 01:21:43,759
not just pay the hard earned money for

2065
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,719
but spend the time and resources to grow

2066
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:48,920
it out you know so you know the first

2067
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:50,439
phase that I I basically did is I just I

2068
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:52,960
want to create as many different f1s

2069
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:55,359
that I can I can do and then after that

2070
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:57,319
I can switch on uh switch over to

2071
01:21:55,359 --> 01:22:00,519
starting to work with those f1s and

2072
01:21:57,319 --> 01:22:02,639
bring them to f2s and Beyond and at that

2073
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:04,679
point you know my plan was to narrow my

2074
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:07,719
focus and you know kind of start

2075
01:22:04,679 --> 01:22:10,880
drilling down on on these strains that I

2076
01:22:07,719 --> 01:22:13,439
started um however something uh

2077
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:15,520
interesting happened last year um right

2078

2079
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:22,280
widower line which I used a um was it uh

2080

Black Widow uh that's from people Under

2082
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:28,520
the Stairs um I've had some really good

2083
01:22:27,279 --> 01:22:31,479
uh experience with their stuff too so

2084
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:34,880
shout out to The People Under the Stairs

2085
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:37,799
um so right as I finished up my my last

2086
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:39,920
line um one of the moderators the fellow

2087
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:41,920
moderators on Craft uh let me know about

2088
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:43,158
this website you know I'm not even going

2089
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:45,520
to say the name because they're a bunch

2090
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:46,759
of clowns but at the time you know we we

2091
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:50,159
thought to the best of our knowledge

2092
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:53,880
that they were legit and so I spent

2093
01:22:50,158 --> 01:22:55,679
um almost two grand uh at at the very

2094
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:56,960
end you know as I spent $1,200 for a

2095
01:22:55,679 --> 01:23:00,480
full order you know cuz when I do things

2096
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:02,840
I go all out you know um so I I ordered

2097
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:05,319
a bunch of plants and then that these

2098
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:07,520
are clones or seeds clones so I ordered

2099
01:23:05,319 --> 01:23:09,719
a bunch of clones and that's the time

2100
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:11,280
when I started learning about hlvd hop

2101
01:23:09,719 --> 01:23:14,119
latent vroid

2102
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:16,279
disease um also known as the dutting

2103
01:23:14,119 --> 01:23:19,039
disease and that's when I realized how

2104
01:23:16,279 --> 01:23:23,000
big of a problem that vroid is and how

2105
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:25,119
serious it is and luckily um I had the

2106
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:28,719
foresight to go ahead and quar those

2107
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:30,479
clones that I got but after some U

2108
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:34,079
encouragement from some people on Reddit

2109
01:23:30,479 --> 01:23:36,000
I went ahead and I paid the extra $400

2110
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:39,519
or so to get the tests and I tested

2111
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:41,760
those clones and uh I think out of the

2112
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:43,480
12 clones that I had the first test

2113
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,440
revealed four of them had hop lat and

2114
01:23:43,479 --> 01:23:46,919
viroid

2115
01:23:44,439 --> 01:23:48,519
disease and so I'm freaking out I throw

2116
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:51,199
those four away I'm like [ __ ] man that's

2117
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:54,120
$400 not to mention the cost of the test

2118
01:23:51,198 --> 01:23:55,599
in the trash and then you know of course

2119
01:23:54,119 --> 01:23:59,039
you you can't do just one round of

2120
01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:00,800
testing cuz even if a plant's healthy um

2121
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:03,600
it could still be infected and that

2122
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:05,520
virus the viroid load Is Not Great

2123
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,480
enough for it to be detected in the test

2124
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,520
so you just have to give it a little bit

2125
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:10,479
extra time so wa I waited another two

2126
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:13,199
weeks and I retested the eight remaining

2127
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:15,959
strains and another four tested positive

2128
01:24:13,198 --> 01:24:17,839
so at that point I was like that's it

2129
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:20,198
like I'm not going to pay for another

2130
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:23,679
round of testing I just threw them all

2131
01:24:20,198 --> 01:24:26,198
out and um you know that sucked you know

2132
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:28,359
that's 16 $0000 that I just threw in my

2133
01:24:26,198 --> 01:24:30,599
garbage not to mention all the time that

2134
01:24:28,359 --> 01:24:33,359
I took up in my my room and me stressing

2135
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:35,400
about it but one we don't we don't have

2136
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:37,759
to talk about where you Source these

2137
01:24:35,399 --> 01:24:39,839
from if you don't want to but can you

2138
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:41,400
describe the experience that you had

2139
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,159
when you reached back out to this

2140
01:24:41,399 --> 01:24:46,679
company to explain the situation that

2141
01:24:44,158 --> 01:24:48,879
you you went through third party testing

2142
01:24:46,679 --> 01:24:52,520
to make sure that it was clean stuff

2143
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:55,199
that was claimed to be clean to you

2144
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:56,679
initially um and since were quarantined

2145
01:24:55,198 --> 01:24:58,719
they didn't have other interactions

2146
01:24:56,679 --> 01:25:01,399
potentially with other contaminations

2147
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:04,560
other than what would have been occurred

2148
01:25:01,399 --> 01:25:06,559
at at the original Source Point um but

2149
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:08,400
yeah explain a little bit more about the

2150
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,760
interactions that you then had with

2151
01:25:08,399 --> 01:25:11,519
these people I feel like that's very

2152
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:14,760
important for the community to hear I

2153
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:17,639
reached out to the shop owner and um I

2154
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:20,639
let him know you know and

2155
01:25:17,639 --> 01:25:24,079
uh he was not very friendly at all you

2156
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:27,039
know um I I sent screenshots of proof

2157
01:25:24,079 --> 01:25:28,639
and and he was basically telling me

2158
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:30,920
there's nothing he's going to do for me

2159
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:33,199
and then um he found one of my Reddit

2160
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:35,560
posts and was like is this you is this

2161
01:25:33,198 --> 01:25:37,839
you and so he was at that point ignoring

2162
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:41,080
my questions and he was coming hostile

2163
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:42,960
with finding my posts and so I felt like

2164
01:25:41,079 --> 01:25:44,279
yeah this guy has all my information I'm

2165
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:46,679
not going to worry about this much

2166
01:25:44,279 --> 01:25:49,039
longer cuz it seems like he's getting

2167
01:25:46,679 --> 01:25:51,279
ready to dox me you know and you know

2168
01:25:49,039 --> 01:25:53,279
basically hey here's this guy's phone

2169
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:55,238
number his address like everything you

2170
01:25:53,279 --> 01:25:56,960
know so at that point I just had to walk

2171
01:25:55,238 --> 01:25:58,439
away and then I did my duty of letting

2172
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:00,560
the community know like hey don't ever

2173
01:25:58,439 --> 01:26:03,079
[ __ ] with this company ever you know

2174
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:06,280
here's my experience and you know

2175
01:26:03,079 --> 01:26:07,960
like um I think I I held off on telling

2176
01:26:06,279 --> 01:26:09,719
people about him like threatening me

2177
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:11,840
just to give it a little time so he

2178
01:26:09,719 --> 01:26:13,960
wouldn't you know doxs me but yeah that

2179
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:16,319
that definitely happened you know and um

2180
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:18,760
at that point too I I made my LinkedIn

2181
01:26:16,319 --> 01:26:20,719
uh private cuz again I was like uh you

2182
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:22,920
know if this guy's going to go out as a

2183
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:24,840
vendetta you know I don't want him to

2184
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:28,118
like try to contact the company work for

2185
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:29,440
or anything like that like you know like

2186
01:26:28,118 --> 01:26:30,799
at that point I just felt like it was

2187
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:33,319
better to let other people know and just

2188
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:35,560
walk away and take the hit myself but

2189
01:26:33,319 --> 01:26:37,599
did he accept responsibility at all for

2190
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:40,280
the hoplight and thyroid or did he

2191
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:43,000
basically try to say that your testing

2192
01:26:40,279 --> 01:26:44,880
was uh false or or something along those

2193
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,760
lines I say none of the above just not

2194
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:48,840
really acknowledgement on his end just

2195
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:53,039
like nothing you can do like oh oh well

2196
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:54,760
sorry you know like wow so um the one

2197
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:57,279
good thing that came out of that cuz uh

2198
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:59,000
there were a lot of I mean another thing

2199
01:26:57,279 --> 01:27:01,519
I'll say about these companies is you

2200
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:03,760
never know if what they're selling is

2201
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:04,920
the actual strain that they're selling

2202
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,239
they can just pick any plant and they

2203
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:08,639
can send it to you and even if you grow

2204
01:27:07,238 --> 01:27:11,678
it out unless you really know that

2205
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:13,039
strain very well or someone who does you

2206
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:14,359
never really know what you're getting

2207
01:27:13,039 --> 01:27:15,880
you know it could be bomb as hell it

2208
01:27:14,359 --> 01:27:18,519
could be pretty pretty close to the

2209
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:20,760
chirps that it's supposed to be but I

2210
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:23,199
mean I mean realistically unless you're

2211
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:25,039
doing genetic testing to compare the the

2212
01:27:23,198 --> 01:27:27,000
genes of the plants you know you really

2213
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:28,479
can't tell what you're getting you know

2214
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,279
like we were talking about earlier that

2215
01:27:28,479 --> 01:27:32,879
Tahoe OG if I didn't know that it was

2216
01:27:30,279 --> 01:27:34,198
Tahoe OG and I looked at those nugs and

2217
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:37,440
I spelled the turps I would think it was

2218
01:27:34,198 --> 01:27:39,039
sfog for sure so similar you know you

2219
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:40,799
just have that like slightly different

2220
01:27:39,039 --> 01:27:44,639
rounding to the top of the Buds versus

2221
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:47,199
the peaks of the sfog yeah and another

2222
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:49,199
thing too like um I've really been um

2223
01:27:47,198 --> 01:27:52,559
diving into the differences between

2224
01:27:49,198 --> 01:27:53,839
chemotypes phenotypes and genotypes

2225
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,560
there's some really interesting articles

2226
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:58,440
too

2227
01:27:55,560 --> 01:28:00,360
and really I feel like the way that we

2228
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:01,799
use the term phenotype it's it's

2229
01:28:00,359 --> 01:28:04,319
actually seems like it's incorrect

2230
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:06,400
compared to the definition because a

2231
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:09,439
phenotype is not

2232
01:28:06,399 --> 01:28:11,479
just the genetics presenting in the

2233
01:28:09,439 --> 01:28:14,559
plant but it's also the way the

2234
01:28:11,479 --> 01:28:17,319
environment impacts that plant so you

2235
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:18,920
can have U like a pheno is all the

2236
01:28:17,319 --> 01:28:20,840
different ranges that plant's able to

2237
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:22,359
produce depending on the environment

2238
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:24,159
yeah the phenotype does yeah the

2239
01:28:22,359 --> 01:28:27,118
phenotype for a single cultivar would

2240
01:28:24,158 --> 01:28:29,559
range and then the um the genotype is

2241
01:28:27,118 --> 01:28:31,759
what that individual Cult of our is and

2242
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:35,239
then the chemotype is the expression in

2243
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:37,719
a given environment exactly exactly yeah

2244
01:28:35,238 --> 01:28:40,359
so um I've been trying to learn a lot

2245
01:28:37,719 --> 01:28:42,439
more about you know um about breeding

2246
01:28:40,359 --> 01:28:44,479
and about you know the terminology so I

2247
01:28:42,439 --> 01:28:46,319
don't I don't sound like just someone

2248
01:28:44,479 --> 01:28:48,678
who who works out of his home

2249
01:28:46,319 --> 01:28:50,719
here it's you know it's one of those

2250
01:28:48,679 --> 01:28:53,199
things though that it like just with

2251
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:54,880
your um like programming and stuff you

2252
01:28:53,198 --> 01:28:56,399
can easily look into a lot of these

2253
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:57,800
different things and I feel like there

2254
01:28:56,399 --> 01:29:00,039
are a lot of people that want to get

2255
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:02,079
into breeding even if it's just to like

2256
01:29:00,039 --> 01:29:05,439
you know Chuck some pollen in a tent or

2257
01:29:02,079 --> 01:29:06,880
something just to see what happens uh I

2258
01:29:05,439 --> 01:29:08,799
feel like people think that it needs to

2259
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:11,840
be this Ultra

2260
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:14,520
precise scientific approach where as

2261
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:17,400
long as you can take notes and you can

2262
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:18,400
use your anecdotal evidence to guide you

2263
01:29:17,399 --> 01:29:21,638
there's a lot of people that have

2264
01:29:18,399 --> 01:29:24,759
created some phenomenal uh phenomenal

2265
01:29:21,639 --> 01:29:26,800
genotypes yeah you know and um my

2266
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:29,360
knowledge might be a little outdated too

2267
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:30,600
but um I don't know if there's and

2268
01:29:29,359 --> 01:29:32,639
correct me if I'm wrong but I don't know

2269
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:35,800
if there's a lot of literature out there

2270
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:37,760
on um proven dominant genes and

2271
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:39,520
recessive genes in cannabis there's

2272
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:40,639
probably some antidotal stuff out there

2273
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:42,320
but I don't know if there's anything

2274
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:44,000
like this is for sure a dominant gene

2275
01:29:42,319 --> 01:29:45,479
this is for sure a recessive gene

2276
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,600
there's there's some through like

2277
01:29:45,479 --> 01:29:51,559
companies like phos bioscience um but

2278
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:54,239
due to some controversies that the

2279
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:57,520
Cannabis Community faced when these

2280
01:29:54,238 --> 01:30:00,238
different uh genetics mapping um

2281
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:02,199
Laboratories opened up initially uh they

2282
01:30:00,238 --> 01:30:04,039
lost a lot of Faith with the community

2283
01:30:02,198 --> 01:30:07,118
because of

2284
01:30:04,039 --> 01:30:10,279
um certain practices that were claimed

2285
01:30:07,118 --> 01:30:14,079
to be and then what actual practices

2286
01:30:10,279 --> 01:30:16,279
then occurred and how because the

2287
01:30:14,079 --> 01:30:20,439
Cannabis Community was so tightly knit

2288
01:30:16,279 --> 01:30:22,800
and held so many of these Cult of ours

2289
01:30:20,439 --> 01:30:24,399
very closely guarded within tight-knit

2290
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,960
communities

2291
01:30:24,399 --> 01:30:28,359
when somebody then says we're going to

2292
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:30,399
make sure that we're just getting you

2293
01:30:28,359 --> 01:30:32,198
the information for this so that you can

2294
01:30:30,399 --> 01:30:34,279
use that information in your breeding

2295
01:30:32,198 --> 01:30:36,399
practices and then takes that

2296
01:30:34,279 --> 01:30:38,479
information to use it within their own

2297
01:30:36,399 --> 01:30:42,279
internal breeding practices as well as

2298
01:30:38,479 --> 01:30:44,919
genetic acquisition Maneuvers

2299
01:30:42,279 --> 01:30:46,880
it so there is information out there yes

2300
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:50,760
to answer your question there are

2301
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:54,760
certain uh specific traits uh whether it

2302
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:55,800
be like cannaboid profiles tpine profile

2303
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:57,639
flower

2304
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:59,480
morphologies

2305
01:30:57,639 --> 01:31:02,880
pigmentations

2306
01:30:59,479 --> 01:31:07,158
um recessive and dominant traits for

2307
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:08,760
height uh flower structure uh flowering

2308
01:31:07,158 --> 01:31:10,759
time all these different things they

2309
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:13,400
have been able to map them to specific

2310
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:16,440
loai but getting access to that

2311
01:31:13,399 --> 01:31:19,399
information now is also gate kept behind

2312
01:31:16,439 --> 01:31:21,559
typically massive pay

2313
01:31:19,399 --> 01:31:23,960
walls yeah I mean when I did a lot of

2314
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:26,639
this initial research um it's before it

2315
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:29,840
was even recreational recreationally

2316
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:32,199
legal in California so right here we are

2317
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:36,480
how many years uh 12 I think

2318
01:31:32,198 --> 01:31:40,118
2012 um if I remember I think that's

2319
01:31:36,479 --> 01:31:41,879
when 2012 2016 I think it would would

2320
01:31:40,118 --> 01:31:46,000
have been uh

2321
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:48,880
2016 or 17 that it went uh recre I think

2322
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:54,198
it it was voted on in 2016 and then it

2323
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:56,560
went uh into effect 2017 because my my

2324
01:31:54,198 --> 01:31:59,799
partner and I left California in 2016

2325
01:31:56,560 --> 01:32:02,880
and we both had our 215 cards still and

2326
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:04,719
then we came back and you could go to

2327
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:06,239
the dispensaries the same dispensaries

2328
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:08,079
that we could only go in with a medical

2329
01:32:06,238 --> 01:32:12,039
license before we could just walk in

2330
01:32:08,079 --> 01:32:13,760
with our ID and that was kind of it was

2331
01:32:12,039 --> 01:32:16,359
weird being away for a little bit coming

2332
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:18,800
back and it being totally different yeah

2333
01:32:16,359 --> 01:32:22,799
yeah so I mean we we've had legal weed

2334
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:25,920
for um what almost eight years now and

2335
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:29,920
uh you know I feel like with the

2336
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:31,600
legality coming it um it reduces a lot

2337
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:34,760
of the

2338
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:36,239
um the clandestin like like the fact

2339
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:37,520
that you have to remain hidden with what

2340
01:32:36,238 --> 01:32:40,000
you're doing there's a lot more homeg

2341
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:41,520
Growers growing there's a lot more um

2342
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,920
companies that are you know don't have

2343
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:45,400
to be so secretive about what they're

2344
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:48,359
doing so I feel like the research that's

2345
01:32:45,399 --> 01:32:50,559
coming out now um it's a lot more easy

2346
01:32:48,359 --> 01:32:51,759
to access it than it was before you know

2347
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:54,320
and

2348
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:55,800
um there still is a lot of broke science

2349
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:57,639
that goes around but I think it's a lot

2350
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:59,639
less than what we previously had to deal

2351
01:32:57,639 --> 01:33:03,000
with so for sure I mean look we're still

2352
01:32:59,639 --> 01:33:06,159
both using pseudonyms to uh to display

2353
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,840
ourselves to the community it to have

2354
01:33:06,158 --> 01:33:09,519
some level of

2355
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:12,719
um

2356
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:15,760
anonymity there's still a huge

2357
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:18,600
stigma yeah I mean um federally it's not

2358
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:22,199
legal you know so um I always got to

2359
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:24,039
remind myself of that I know uh anytime

2360
01:33:22,198 --> 01:33:25,279
I travel it's just so weird especially

2361
01:33:24,039 --> 01:33:27,760
if you travel to a state where it's not

2362
01:33:25,279 --> 01:33:30,118
legal it's just like this is just

2363
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:32,239
bizarre yeah how do you people live like

2364
01:33:30,118 --> 01:33:34,880
this and it's crazy to think that like

2365
01:33:32,238 --> 01:33:36,000
you can fly out of JFK in New York and

2366
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:38,960
they don't care if you're carrying

2367
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,039
cannabis you can fly out of s SFO in San

2368
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:41,880
Francisco they don't care if you're

2369
01:33:40,039 --> 01:33:45,920
carrying cannabis but yeah you touch

2370
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:49,039
down in Kentucky you're [ __ ]

2371
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:51,239
yeah so although I'll say from

2372
01:33:49,039 --> 01:33:53,118
experience you know um having a pen in

2373
01:33:51,238 --> 01:33:54,959
your backpack's not that big of a deal

2374
01:33:53,118 --> 01:33:57,799
um n

2375
01:33:54,960 --> 01:34:01,480
I visit my I was like allegedly I

2376
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:01,480
visited in Tennessee it was no big

2377
01:34:02,039 --> 01:34:07,359
deal yeah kind of getting back to um the

2378
01:34:05,399 --> 01:34:11,439
the one good thing that came out of that

2379
01:34:07,359 --> 01:34:14,639
whole [ __ ] cluster [ __ ] of um of

2380
01:34:11,439 --> 01:34:16,118
buying those diseased clones was that's

2381
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:18,199
when I started learning about tissue

2382
01:34:16,118 --> 01:34:21,039
culture cuz I was obsessed with not

2383
01:34:18,198 --> 01:34:22,719
throwing my money away you know and um a

2384
01:34:21,039 --> 01:34:24,519
lot of those strains I we start talking

2385
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:25,800
about this but a lot of those strains of

2386
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:27,639
what they were supposed to be you know

2387
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:30,679
and I was just at the time assuming they

2388
01:34:27,639 --> 01:34:33,159
were what they were um you know they

2389
01:34:30,679 --> 01:34:34,920
were things that I was I bought seed

2390
01:34:33,158 --> 01:34:37,679
pack after seed pack you know one of

2391
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:39,480
them was Bruce Banner number three and

2392
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:41,399
you know I bought that knockoff one but

2393
01:34:39,479 --> 01:34:42,879
I also bought a ton of stuff that had

2394
01:34:41,399 --> 01:34:45,039
Bruce Banner mixed in just because it

2395
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:46,639
had it mixed in you know the same thing

2396
01:34:45,039 --> 01:34:49,960
with a lot of those breeder Cuts you

2397
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:51,679
know I bought so many packs of seeds

2398
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:54,118
because it was mixed with GMO and I

2399
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:56,960
wanted you know GMO but I didn't know

2400
01:34:54,118 --> 01:34:59,719
anybody and um there was one clone

2401
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:01,880
company pardon me um that I found um

2402
01:34:59,719 --> 01:35:03,520
right after the pandemic and I have not

2403
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:07,079
been able to find any information on

2404
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:10,639
them ever since it was called uh OG life

2405
01:35:07,079 --> 01:35:12,519
in San San Bernardino California um it

2406
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:14,118
was a breeder Collective uh I think I

2407
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:19,159
found it online you just searching

2408
01:35:14,118 --> 01:35:21,439
clones near me and um I only have

2409
01:35:19,158 --> 01:35:23,920
actually I only have one clone left from

2410
01:35:21,439 --> 01:35:27,399
them which sucks because they were

2411
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:29,199
really good um at the time I got SF EOG

2412
01:35:27,399 --> 01:35:31,479
Sour Diesel and Sour Diesel is the only

2413
01:35:29,198 --> 01:35:34,238
one I have left

2414
01:35:31,479 --> 01:35:35,678
um let's see here strawberry milkshake

2415
01:35:34,238 --> 01:35:37,439
which is one I haven't really heard of

2416
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:39,920
but the picture on their website sold me

2417
01:35:37,439 --> 01:35:41,319
it was super Frosty and I knew I wanted

2418
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:44,800
one that was going to be good for you

2419
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:47,279
know making bubble hash uh Jack herrer

2420
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:50,639
Gorilla Glue uh number four and then

2421
01:35:47,279 --> 01:35:54,279
Girl Scout cookie thin mint so I had uh

2422
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:58,480
all six of those from that uh company

2423
01:35:54,279 --> 01:36:00,039
um I mean uh luckily out of the ones

2424
01:35:58,479 --> 01:36:02,479
that remained I did test them and none

2425
01:36:00,039 --> 01:36:04,359
of them had hlvd that was years later so

2426
01:36:02,479 --> 01:36:06,198
I got lucky with that you know cuz I was

2427
01:36:04,359 --> 01:36:08,079
way before I knew about

2428
01:36:06,198 --> 01:36:11,118
hlvd

2429
01:36:08,079 --> 01:36:12,960
um but yeah so sorry I'm kind of jumping

2430
01:36:11,118 --> 01:36:15,238
around a little bit but no please why

2431
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:19,639
don't you kind of like talk about how

2432
01:36:15,238 --> 01:36:22,319
you started your um journey into tissue

2433
01:36:19,639 --> 01:36:24,800
culture uh what resources did you sort

2434
01:36:22,319 --> 01:36:27,158
of seek out and then

2435
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:29,440
um where do you feel as though you found

2436
01:36:27,158 --> 01:36:30,839
the best information because it sounds

2437
01:36:29,439 --> 01:36:33,759
like almost with everything else that

2438
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:36,880
you do you you were self-taught in uh in

2439
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:39,239
the tissue culture space as well yeah I

2440
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:40,880
mean if there's a will there's a way you

2441
01:36:39,238 --> 01:36:42,319
know just like programming just like

2442
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:44,920
everything you know

2443
01:36:42,319 --> 01:36:46,880
like the main thing that's going to be

2444
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:49,679
required of you is your drive is your

2445
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:51,039
drive for that knowledge you know and it

2446
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:53,000
doesn't matter how many resources you

2447
01:36:51,039 --> 01:36:55,840
have if you don't have that Curiosity

2448
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:57,359
and that desire to to learn more and to

2449
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:59,239
build off of what you've already learned

2450
01:36:57,359 --> 01:37:01,880
you know it doesn't matter you know

2451
01:36:59,238 --> 01:37:03,759
you're not going to get far so for me I

2452
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:06,000
had that Obsession you know about trying

2453
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:08,920
to save those those clones that I got

2454
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:11,359
from that clone you know vendor um and

2455
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:14,239
it didn't work out but that's what

2456
01:37:11,359 --> 01:37:16,118
started me you know learning about

2457
01:37:14,238 --> 01:37:17,678
tissue culture and the fact that tissue

2458
01:37:16,118 --> 01:37:20,799
culture especially marry stem tissue

2459
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:23,560
culture has the ability to basically

2460
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:27,320
make a new clone of that plant that is

2461
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:28,880
free of um viroids or any systemic

2462
01:37:27,319 --> 01:37:30,719
diseases that the plant may have you

2463
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:34,719
know whether it's viroids or funguses

2464
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:37,198
molds like whatever you know so um that

2465
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:39,000
really interested me and I had already

2466
01:37:37,198 --> 01:37:41,279
dabbled a little bit in Gourmet

2467
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:43,880
mushrooms so um I learned a little bit

2468
01:37:41,279 --> 01:37:48,479
about my ecology I had bought a Flo hood

2469
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:50,279
for that Gourmet mushrooms so yeah um

2470
01:37:48,479 --> 01:37:53,519
the kind that you eat you know nothing

2471
01:37:50,279 --> 01:37:55,960
nothing else so uh are there any other

2472
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:57,719
kind of mushrooms no no as far as I know

2473
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:59,520
like there's there's the kind that you

2474
01:37:57,719 --> 01:38:02,359
eat for subsidence and then there's the

2475
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:04,400
kind that you eat to die right so that's

2476
01:38:02,359 --> 01:38:06,198
that's probably it I don't think I'm

2477
01:38:04,399 --> 01:38:09,638
forgetting anything you know

2478
01:38:06,198 --> 01:38:11,479
no uh it probably take my my golden you

2479
01:38:09,639 --> 01:38:13,118
know thinking hat to put on you know to

2480
01:38:11,479 --> 01:38:16,399
start thinking about what other kind of

2481
01:38:13,118 --> 01:38:19,319
mushrooms your golden teacher hat my

2482
01:38:16,399 --> 01:38:20,960
golden teacher hat so um I had a Flo

2483
01:38:19,319 --> 01:38:23,519
hood and I had a little experience with

2484
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:25,880
making agar plates and you know um

2485
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:27,719
working on you know very sterile

2486
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:29,719
techniques and trying to make sure that

2487
01:38:27,719 --> 01:38:31,840
you're you're not putting your arm over

2488
01:38:29,719 --> 01:38:33,960
stuff that you're working on or you know

2489
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:35,960
um I even started before I had a flood I

2490
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:38,840
worked in

2491
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:40,158
um um what the [ __ ] are they called a

2492
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:42,000
still air still air box it's not

2493
01:38:40,158 --> 01:38:44,638
technically a still airbox but it's it's

2494
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,560
very similar to one um and actually I'll

2495
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:50,239
just say a side note um from what I

2496
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:52,400
understand still still airboxes are not

2497
01:38:50,238 --> 01:38:54,039
ideal cuz you put your arms into those

2498
01:38:52,399 --> 01:38:57,079
you know those little sleeves

2499
01:38:54,039 --> 01:38:59,760
and you can still push air inside the

2500
01:38:57,079 --> 01:39:01,198
Box by moving your arms in there too so

2501
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,880
from what I understand doing the the

2502
01:39:01,198 --> 01:39:04,559
method where you cut the holes in like a

2503
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:06,118
a tub is supposed to be a little bit

2504
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:07,840
easier cuz you can move a little bit

2505
01:39:06,118 --> 01:39:09,639
more gentle and create less airf flow

2506
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:10,679
but I don't know I don't if to worry

2507
01:39:09,639 --> 01:39:13,840
about that anymore cuz I have the flo

2508
01:39:10,679 --> 01:39:15,760
hood and Flo hoods are awesome so you

2509
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:18,679
know I had already um some experience

2510
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:21,199
with working and you know kind of a a

2511
01:39:18,679 --> 01:39:22,599
home Laboratory um setting and I had

2512
01:39:21,198 --> 01:39:24,479
already you know already had the

2513
01:39:22,599 --> 01:39:27,239
equipment so

2514
01:39:24,479 --> 01:39:29,718
um I went ahead

2515
01:39:27,238 --> 01:39:31,519
and at this point you know I thrown away

2516
01:39:29,719 --> 01:39:34,920
a bunch of plants and I was really

2517
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:36,960
discouraged you know um it threw me off

2518
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:41,440
of what I had planned on doing by a

2519
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:44,639
couple months and I I vowed never to buy

2520
01:39:41,439 --> 01:39:45,960
clones ever again I didn't care um but

2521
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:48,039
you know a couple months later one of

2522
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:50,520
the other mods on redit I was like hey

2523
01:39:48,039 --> 01:39:53,158
check out this Discord um this other

2524
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:54,599
breeder um and I I promised the breeder

2525
01:39:53,158 --> 01:39:57,839
that I won't say his name or anything

2526
01:39:54,599 --> 01:40:00,760
like that or you know whatever but

2527
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:02,440
um they had a falling out with one of

2528
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:05,840
their business partners to kind of keep

2529
01:40:02,439 --> 01:40:08,198
it you know um a little generic about

2530
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:11,000
what's going on but he was at a point

2531
01:40:08,198 --> 01:40:13,519
where he was ready to start selling off

2532
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:16,679
um the the strains that he's collected

2533
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:18,880
over the years you know so wow I started

2534
01:40:16,679 --> 01:40:22,399
off and he he was sell super cheap too

2535
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:24,039
you know and I initially was like no but

2536
01:40:22,399 --> 01:40:26,559
you know it was coming coming from

2537
01:40:24,039 --> 01:40:28,238
someone else that I I knew and you know

2538
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:30,760
he had on good authority that this

2539
01:40:28,238 --> 01:40:34,359
person was legit and they were selling

2540
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:36,639
clean clones and you know so I said [ __ ]

2541
01:40:34,359 --> 01:40:40,198
it let's let's order three and I think

2542
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:43,639
uh at that point I got uh GMO stardog

2543
01:40:40,198 --> 01:40:45,079
Cory cut and zerog grav which is kind of

2544
01:40:43,639 --> 01:40:48,400
a newer strain that that one's like

2545
01:40:45,079 --> 01:40:50,639
Oreos times GMO um cuz I was gearing up

2546
01:40:48,399 --> 01:40:53,399
to at that point I wanted to do a fifth

2547
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:55,880
seed run I I haven't done it by the way

2548
01:40:53,399 --> 01:40:58,559
but I wanted to do uh to use this star

2549
01:40:55,880 --> 01:41:00,760
95 male that I picked out and it was

2550
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:04,480
half star dog half

2551
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:06,280
I95 so um you know in my mind I was like

2552
01:41:04,479 --> 01:41:08,399
okay well let's try we'll get some of

2553
01:41:06,279 --> 01:41:10,000
these you know I've been chasing GMO for

2554
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:11,960
all these years buying all these seeds

2555
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,359
and this is potentially the actual GMO

2556
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:16,679
plant so let's just get that and then we

2557
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:18,238
can breed with it and I tested those

2558
01:41:16,679 --> 01:41:20,760
plants they were all clean all good to

2559
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:22,158
go and I waited a couple weeks and I was

2560
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:24,480
like [ __ ] man he's got that list all

2561
01:41:22,158 --> 01:41:27,479
these other all these other PL

2562
01:41:24,479 --> 01:41:30,479
so here I am I I think I bought like

2563
01:41:27,479 --> 01:41:33,198
over 40 from him all these breeder cuts

2564
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:35,718
and you know I've tested the first 16

2565
01:41:33,198 --> 01:41:37,559
that I got from them um all clean all

2566
01:41:35,719 --> 01:41:39,000
good to go I've grown out a ton of them

2567
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:41,119
you can check them out on the Instagram

2568
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:44,479
on on the Reddit you know they're all

2569
01:41:41,118 --> 01:41:47,079
amazing um the Tarpin are exactly you

2570
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:48,519
know for the most part um one of them we

2571
01:41:47,079 --> 01:41:50,399
thought was blue dream I guess it got

2572
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:51,960
mixed up in transportation it's not blue

2573
01:41:50,399 --> 01:41:53,479
dream unfortunately but it's still super

2574
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:55,719
bomb

2575
01:41:53,479 --> 01:41:57,598
so that one you know um there was a you

2576
01:41:55,719 --> 01:42:00,118
know uh this is not what it's supposed

2577
01:41:57,599 --> 01:42:02,279
to be but everything else um looks like

2578
01:42:00,118 --> 01:42:06,559
it's right on the money

2579
01:42:02,279 --> 01:42:08,118
um so basically once that happened I

2580
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:09,480
decided that I had to shift gears you

2581
01:42:08,118 --> 01:42:12,118
know cuz sometimes you just have to roll

2582
01:42:09,479 --> 01:42:16,638
the punches and instead of doing a fifth

2583
01:42:12,118 --> 01:42:19,238
line of f1s you know that um might be

2584
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:21,039
interesting you know like the star95 was

2585
01:42:19,238 --> 01:42:22,759
a little bit of a longer flower and you

2586
01:42:21,039 --> 01:42:25,560
know like we previously discussed I want

2587
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:28,480
flower times around the 8 weeks is is my

2588
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:32,400
ideal you know 8 weeks is a great um

2589
01:42:28,479 --> 01:42:35,198
flowering time to shoot for so uh I

2590
01:42:32,399 --> 01:42:37,479
decided to [ __ ] to change gears and to

2591
01:42:35,198 --> 01:42:40,799
start getting you know these breeder

2592
01:42:37,479 --> 01:42:42,238
cuts that are available um cuz it was

2593
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:45,159
presented to me as it was going to be a

2594
01:42:42,238 --> 01:42:46,759
limited time thing you know so sometimes

2595
01:42:45,158 --> 01:42:47,960
you got to get get it while the

2596
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:50,440
getting's good you know you got to

2597
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:52,359
strike all the iron's hot so um I

2598
01:42:50,439 --> 01:42:54,638
started collecting a bunch of these you

2599
01:42:52,359 --> 01:42:57,839
know plants and then at that point I

2600
01:42:54,639 --> 01:43:00,079
decided to take the tissue culture

2601
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:01,920
seriously um I had already done one

2602
01:43:00,079 --> 01:43:04,158
round of

2603
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:06,158
micropropagation um which doesn't

2604
01:43:04,158 --> 01:43:08,319
require a you know a microscope but I

2605
01:43:06,158 --> 01:43:12,799
was you know according to my research

2606
01:43:08,319 --> 01:43:14,639
the only way to you know really cure

2607
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:16,159
these plants of anything that they might

2608
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:18,719
have had you know if there was any

2609
01:43:16,158 --> 01:43:20,559
fungal infections or anything else uh

2610
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:23,639
was through marry stem and so I went

2611
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:25,480
ahead and I bought a microscope

2612
01:43:23,639 --> 01:43:27,118
um and I got that set up and you know I

2613
01:43:25,479 --> 01:43:31,238
started researching different tissue

2614
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:34,158
culture uh the media protocols so you

2615
01:43:31,238 --> 01:43:36,638
know the recipe is called a protocol

2616
01:43:34,158 --> 01:43:39,118
that's a little bit of the lingo um but

2617
01:43:36,639 --> 01:43:41,319
you know I started making my own and I

2618
01:43:39,118 --> 01:43:42,839
did some merry stems and I noticed after

2619
01:43:41,319 --> 01:43:45,238
a couple weeks I was getting growth and

2620
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:46,639
it was hey this is awesome like this is

2621
01:43:45,238 --> 01:43:50,678
actually it feels like it's something I

2622
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:54,880
can um I can actually do you know and uh

2623
01:43:50,679 --> 01:43:57,520
here we are uh I my very first marry

2624
01:43:54,880 --> 01:44:00,039
stem um I took back at the end of like

2625
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:02,080
August September this one was closer to

2626
01:44:00,039 --> 01:44:06,118
October so this is a gelato

2627
01:44:02,079 --> 01:44:08,719
41 um so I took a this was a merry stem

2628
01:44:06,118 --> 01:44:11,839
and now we have almost a full-on plant

2629
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:13,560
and it kind of sucks cuz it doesn't

2630
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:16,520
really yeah I don't think it's going to

2631
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:18,480
focus too well but you can see here at

2632
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:20,520
the very bottom we have a

2633
01:44:18,479 --> 01:44:22,479
callus and it's really hard to see on

2634
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:24,760
the camera but I promise you there's

2635
01:44:22,479 --> 01:44:27,158
these little little tiny white shoots of

2636
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:29,360
roots coming out of the callus too ni so

2637
01:44:27,158 --> 01:44:31,598
this is starting to root and the

2638
01:44:29,359 --> 01:44:34,479
significance about this is I didn't use

2639
01:44:31,599 --> 01:44:37,639
plant growth Regulators at all this is

2640
01:44:34,479 --> 01:44:41,118
completely done with just agar sucrose

2641
01:44:37,639 --> 01:44:43,359
which is just table sugar and M&amp;S uh

2642
01:44:41,118 --> 01:44:45,359
which again I'm probably going to

2643
01:44:43,359 --> 01:44:47,719
completely pronounce it incorrectly but

2644
01:44:45,359 --> 01:44:50,238
maruga and skoo uh I think that's how

2645
01:44:47,719 --> 01:44:53,158
you say it but um essentially it's three

2646
01:44:50,238 --> 01:44:55,238
items for tissue culture media you have

2647
01:44:53,158 --> 01:44:58,399
something to hold things in place so the

2648
01:44:55,238 --> 01:44:59,799
agar something to give the plant energy

2649
01:44:58,399 --> 01:45:01,879
which is the sugar because it's no

2650
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:03,880
longer utilized in photosynthesis and

2651
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:06,319
then something to give the plants um you

2652
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:11,279
know n nutrients you know it's food and

2653
01:45:06,319 --> 01:45:14,158
that's the M Ms so U maruga and skoo so

2654
01:45:11,279 --> 01:45:15,719
anyway that's kind of where I'm at um

2655
01:45:14,158 --> 01:45:17,598
I've really put a lot of my breeding

2656
01:45:15,719 --> 01:45:20,719
aspirations on the back burner while I

2657
01:45:17,599 --> 01:45:22,760
figure out um you know how to completely

2658
01:45:20,719 --> 01:45:25,439
pull off Mary Sim tissue culture at my

2659
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:29,199
house you know I have a laboratory set

2660
01:45:25,439 --> 01:45:32,799
up in my living room um you know

2661
01:45:29,198 --> 01:45:34,519
it's it's not ideal um but it works you

2662
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:38,480
know I've had some really good success

2663
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:40,800
from it and um luckily you know through

2664
01:45:38,479 --> 01:45:42,479
especially through this um this podcast

2665
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:44,599
you know we've been meeting some amazing

2666
01:45:42,479 --> 01:45:47,039
people in fact we just talked to Jesse

2667
01:45:44,599 --> 01:45:49,239
this morning and you know he was given

2668
01:45:47,039 --> 01:45:50,920
us all sorts of very valuable

2669
01:45:49,238 --> 01:45:53,879
information and I know unfortunately it

2670
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:55,920
was before we hit record sorry people

2671
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:58,199
uh but I was able to we got into some

2672
01:45:55,920 --> 01:46:00,039
good stuff we really did you know and I

2673
01:45:58,198 --> 01:46:02,000
I know actually come to think of it if

2674
01:46:00,039 --> 01:46:04,000
you watch that podcast I don't say

2675
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,319
anything during the entire thing and you

2676
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,920
know which is unfortunate you know CU I

2677
01:46:06,319 --> 01:46:10,198
didn't really contribute to what you

2678
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:11,599
guys are going to see but I was very

2679
01:46:10,198 --> 01:46:14,439
fortunate because I was able to talk to

2680
01:46:11,599 --> 01:46:16,079
Jesse before we hit record and I had a a

2681
01:46:14,439 --> 01:46:17,559
lot of questions that would take me

2682
01:46:16,079 --> 01:46:19,599
forever to Google and who knows if I

2683
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:22,119
would even get the right answer directly

2684
01:46:19,599 --> 01:46:23,440
answered for me you know and it's do you

2685
01:46:22,118 --> 01:46:24,920
want to touch on any of those things

2686
01:46:23,439 --> 01:46:27,000
that you felt were like little tidbits

2687
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:29,560
of information that you're still now

2688
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:32,158
like chomping at the bit to to start uh

2689
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:34,880
either testing out or other on yeah I

2690
01:46:32,158 --> 01:46:36,519
mean so um he he let us know he was

2691
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:39,800
going to share some of his protocols

2692
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:44,119
with us so I'm very interested to um

2693
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:47,039
kind of see how he mixes um stuff um one

2694
01:46:44,118 --> 01:46:48,839
thing he mentioned was uh it seems like

2695
01:46:47,039 --> 01:46:50,439
he's making his own and you know the

2696
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:51,840
thing about when we're talking with

2697
01:46:50,439 --> 01:46:54,799
people too is we want to give them a lot

2698
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:56,560
of space to to say everything that they

2699
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:58,000
want to say so there's going to be times

2700
01:46:56,560 --> 01:47:00,239
where I have burning questions and I I

2701
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:02,198
don't get a chance to ask it but it

2702
01:47:00,238 --> 01:47:04,319
seems like he's making his own nutrient

2703
01:47:02,198 --> 01:47:05,759
solution for cannabis you know because

2704
01:47:04,319 --> 01:47:08,158
he he had a lot of things that he was

2705
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:11,760
talking about where you know in Ms you

2706
01:47:08,158 --> 01:47:13,319
know there's certain um nutrients inside

2707
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:15,800
that mixture that are not appropriate

2708
01:47:13,319 --> 01:47:17,238
for cannabis because that mixture is

2709
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:19,679
actually made for Basil if I'm not

2710
01:47:17,238 --> 01:47:22,399
mistaken you know it's specifically for

2711
01:47:19,679 --> 01:47:24,840
growing basil but you know as tissue

2712
01:47:22,399 --> 01:47:26,960
culture has come more into the Cannabis

2713
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:29,000
Community um people have found that it's

2714
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:31,118
it works good enough you know for

2715
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:33,079
cannabis you know it's not perfect but

2716
01:47:31,118 --> 01:47:35,000
it works you know and you know that's

2717
01:47:33,079 --> 01:47:36,760
kind of the theme for me you know like

2718
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:39,560
sometimes if it works man it works like

2719
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:40,679
let's let's get some stuff accomplished

2720
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:44,960
you know

2721
01:47:40,679 --> 01:47:46,480
so um yeah I mean I'm I'm I'm very

2722
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:49,279
excited for the next step I'm going to

2723
01:47:46,479 --> 01:47:52,319
be start uh start working with some pgrs

2724
01:47:49,279 --> 01:47:54,319
myself um I have I have them already in

2725
01:47:52,319 --> 01:47:56,238
my fridge and it's just a matter of

2726
01:47:54,319 --> 01:47:59,238
experimenting with the right

2727
01:47:56,238 --> 01:48:01,198
ratios um so I I know I'm probably going

2728
01:47:59,238 --> 01:48:03,079
to pronounce it incorrectly again but we

2729
01:48:01,198 --> 01:48:05,719
have oxin and

2730
01:48:03,079 --> 01:48:07,719
cytokinins which are two categories of

2731
01:48:05,719 --> 01:48:10,319
the main types of plant growth

2732
01:48:07,719 --> 01:48:12,719
regulators and one of the tidbits that

2733
01:48:10,319 --> 01:48:16,479
I've um that's really just kind of

2734
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:19,439
impacted me lately is you know oxin

2735
01:48:16,479 --> 01:48:20,638
typically are you know to help rooting

2736
01:48:19,439 --> 01:48:23,118
like if you were just to kind of break

2737
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:24,760
it down to the the bare necessities like

2738
01:48:23,118 --> 01:48:26,559
there's different oxin and they do

2739
01:48:24,760 --> 01:48:28,719
different things you know um depending

2740
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:31,080
on what oxin it is but overall the

2741
01:48:28,719 --> 01:48:33,920
category you know is to help establish

2742
01:48:31,079 --> 01:48:37,079
roots and then cyto Kinnon is to help

2743
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:39,000
establish you know shoe growth or um the

2744
01:48:37,079 --> 01:48:41,000
way that Jesse put it this morning is

2745
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:43,800
you know oxin are for below and cyto

2746
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:46,000
kinnin are for above so you know that's

2747
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:48,320
that's very valuable piece of

2748
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:50,560
information um but another thing that

2749
01:48:48,319 --> 01:48:54,000
I've really learned is they work in

2750
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:56,480
conjunction with each other so so those

2751
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:59,399
plant growth Regulators actually

2752
01:48:56,479 --> 01:49:03,238
regulate each other as well depending on

2753
01:48:59,399 --> 01:49:05,039
the concentration of each one so um and

2754
01:49:03,238 --> 01:49:06,678
for the listeners out there uh you know

2755
01:49:05,039 --> 01:49:09,560
we're using the term plant growth

2756
01:49:06,679 --> 01:49:12,319
regulators and there is a lot of stigma

2757
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:14,560
within the Cannabis growing space about

2758
01:49:12,319 --> 01:49:17,158
plant growth Regulators simply because

2759
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:19,480
some of them that are used to control

2760
01:49:17,158 --> 01:49:21,638
flower structure growth can end up

2761
01:49:19,479 --> 01:49:23,799
leaving toxic residues that can be

2762
01:49:21,639 --> 01:49:26,118
harmful to Human consumption when

2763
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:28,400
combusted um but a lot of what we're

2764
01:49:26,118 --> 01:49:30,920
talking about whether it be something

2765
01:49:28,399 --> 01:49:34,920
that's like napthalene acetic acid or

2766
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:37,239
end3 buic acid um or or other oxin and

2767
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:38,800
cytokinin the these things occur

2768
01:49:37,238 --> 01:49:41,799
naturally within the plant and we're

2769
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:44,719
just applying them exogenously so from

2770
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:46,800
without outside the plant um to help

2771
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:48,840
promote the same growth patterns that

2772
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:52,279
they would promote within the plant

2773
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:54,279
endogenously mhm and I'll say this right

2774
01:49:52,279 --> 01:49:56,519
now too if you clone and you use root

2775
01:49:54,279 --> 01:49:58,679
growth hormones that's a plant growth

2776
01:49:56,520 --> 01:50:00,080
regulator right there yes so you're

2777
01:49:58,679 --> 01:50:03,039
you're probably already utilizing that

2778
01:50:00,079 --> 01:50:05,559
in your in your you know your techniques

2779
01:50:03,039 --> 01:50:08,039
um so one thing and again this is one of

2780
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:11,159
the the many articles that I found and

2781
01:50:08,039 --> 01:50:14,399
Jesse was able to kind of confirm um is

2782
01:50:11,158 --> 01:50:16,118
an high oxin to low cyto kinin ratio

2783
01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:19,879
favors root

2784
01:50:16,118 --> 01:50:22,719
formation um a low oxin high cyto kinon

2785
01:50:19,880 --> 01:50:25,079
favors shoot formation and then a

2786
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:28,359
balance oxin and cyto Canin maintains

2787
01:50:25,079 --> 01:50:30,198
undifferentiated callus growth and um

2788
01:50:28,359 --> 01:50:33,759
the way that I view undifferentiated

2789
01:50:30,198 --> 01:50:36,359
calluses is it's very similar to uh stem

2790
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:38,560
cells where they're malleable cells

2791
01:50:36,359 --> 01:50:40,039
where depending on the hormones that are

2792
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:41,800
being introduced to those cells

2793
01:50:40,039 --> 01:50:43,719
determine what direction those cells

2794
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:45,320
grow in are they going to be a chute are

2795
01:50:43,719 --> 01:50:48,679
they going to be roots are they going to

2796
01:50:45,319 --> 01:50:50,880
you know um there's several different

2797
01:50:48,679 --> 01:50:52,880
you know stages that you can you can

2798
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:56,520
basically uh manipulate using plant

2799
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:58,239
growth Regulators yep absolutely that's

2800
01:50:56,520 --> 01:51:02,000
that's a great touch on on kind of your

2801
01:50:58,238 --> 01:51:03,879
journey through and so far uh with um

2802
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:06,719
tissue culture and and I feel like that

2803
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:10,159
also kind of brings us up to almost your

2804
01:51:06,719 --> 01:51:13,118
current stage as a cultivator in general

2805
01:51:10,158 --> 01:51:17,359
um you know starting from a a

2806
01:51:13,118 --> 01:51:20,839
speaker moving into a rented room that

2807
01:51:17,359 --> 01:51:24,639
eventually got raided to now growing at

2808
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:27,159
home and following these different um

2809
01:51:24,639 --> 01:51:29,078
sort of steps and and develops

2810
01:51:27,158 --> 01:51:32,759
developments within your your

2811
01:51:29,078 --> 01:51:34,519
cultivation Journey based on almost

2812
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:37,480
sometimes it may have been barriers that

2813
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:41,480
you faced like with uh receiving

2814
01:51:37,479 --> 01:51:44,078
contaminated plants to wanting to

2815
01:51:41,479 --> 01:51:46,678
increase your productivity as a grower

2816
01:51:44,078 --> 01:51:49,399
overall within that space that you have

2817
01:51:46,679 --> 01:51:51,480
um as most hom Growers know you limited

2818
01:51:49,399 --> 01:51:53,118
space uh even with a high plant count of

2819
01:51:51,479 --> 01:51:56,039
say 99 plants

2820
01:51:53,118 --> 01:51:57,880
is still it's never enough you could

2821
01:51:56,039 --> 01:52:01,158
always have more space you can always do

2822
01:51:57,880 --> 01:52:03,920
more and uh then with limited time also

2823
01:52:01,158 --> 01:52:07,439
comes other restraints um but

2824
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:09,319
considering your journey has really

2825
01:52:07,439 --> 01:52:11,158
stayed something that you've kind of

2826
01:52:09,319 --> 01:52:14,158
developed yourself and it doesn't sound

2827
01:52:11,158 --> 01:52:17,679
like there's been too many outside

2828
01:52:14,158 --> 01:52:20,238
influences in terms of how the

2829
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:22,319
cultivation industry as a whole has sort

2830
01:52:20,238 --> 01:52:25,879
of developed um you know like you're not

2831
01:52:22,319 --> 01:52:29,880
the Holden working with a uh a

2832
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:32,039
commercial space or through a um a

2833
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:35,840
breeders Collective that requires a

2834
01:52:32,039 --> 01:52:37,880
certain amount of output or uh a clone

2835
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:41,719
Collective where you're providing clones

2836
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:44,199
for resale to people um so through your

2837
01:52:41,719 --> 01:52:46,920
unique lens what do you see within the

2838
01:52:44,198 --> 01:52:49,759
Cannabis industry and Community overall

2839
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:54,359
that you feel like could change for the

2840
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:56,880
better well um

2841
01:52:54,359 --> 01:53:00,759
that's a that's a good question uh I

2842
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:04,400
would say as laws become more relaxed

2843
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:07,440
and it's not such a big deal to get into

2844
01:53:04,399 --> 01:53:09,559
cannabis as a hobby we're going to see a

2845
01:53:07,439 --> 01:53:12,118
a more established Community not just a

2846
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:14,440
community of hobbyists and enthusiasts

2847
01:53:12,118 --> 01:53:16,078
who you know may potentially throw

2848
01:53:14,439 --> 01:53:18,678
caution into the wind you know to have

2849
01:53:16,078 --> 01:53:20,399
an online presence you know and even me

2850
01:53:18,679 --> 01:53:21,960
you know as someone who views himself as

2851
01:53:20,399 --> 01:53:23,879
a professional you know I still don't

2852
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:25,840
want to be all out there and you know

2853
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:28,520
like I don't want to be known as like

2854
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:30,679
the weed guy at work you know like um I

2855
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:33,199
mean I I love cannabis and I I love

2856
01:53:30,679 --> 01:53:35,800
growing and I've I've love the community

2857
01:53:33,198 --> 01:53:37,279
that comes with it too you know um but

2858
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:39,199
it it's not my whole life either you

2859
01:53:37,279 --> 01:53:41,880
know um I have a lot of other things a

2860
01:53:39,198 --> 01:53:43,759
lot of other interests that you know get

2861
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:46,359
me excited and you know that I want to

2862
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:48,520
work on you know one of the things I'm

2863
01:53:46,359 --> 01:53:50,000
uh it's kind of taking a backseat

2864
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:52,480
because of the you know tissue culture

2865
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:55,719
but I'm working on uh an album right now

2866
01:53:52,479 --> 01:53:57,439
now you know um I know how to play like

2867
01:53:55,719 --> 01:54:01,000
whatever instrument that I pick up you

2868
01:53:57,439 --> 01:54:02,158
know and um within the last it's been a

2869
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:04,960
little bit over a year now but I figured

2870
01:54:02,158 --> 01:54:07,319
out how to scream and so um and it

2871
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:09,439
sounds [ __ ] dope you know like I I

2872
01:54:07,319 --> 01:54:11,078
think it sounds pretty good and um with

2873
01:54:09,439 --> 01:54:14,158
this whole studio here you know I want

2874
01:54:11,078 --> 01:54:16,439
to sit down and and finish the album

2875
01:54:14,158 --> 01:54:19,359
that I started you know I I have uh it's

2876
01:54:16,439 --> 01:54:22,638
13 songs uh one of the songs is an intro

2877
01:54:19,359 --> 01:54:23,880
but they're all recorded um they're all

2878
01:54:22,639 --> 01:54:26,159
out and I just it's a matter of

2879
01:54:23,880 --> 01:54:28,239
re-recording them and redoing those

2880
01:54:26,158 --> 01:54:29,879
vocals but uh you know that's another

2881
01:54:28,238 --> 01:54:31,158
thing that I I want to get accomplished

2882
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:33,359
you know and I think that's going to be

2883
01:54:31,158 --> 01:54:35,198
probably one of my goals this year I

2884
01:54:33,359 --> 01:54:38,559
mean it sounds like because of the fact

2885
01:54:35,198 --> 01:54:41,638
that we have to still somewhat you know

2886
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:43,639
be a little bit withheld with uh from

2887
01:54:41,639 --> 01:54:47,359
you know how we expose ourselves outside

2888
01:54:43,639 --> 01:54:49,118
of the immediate cannabis Community um

2889
01:54:47,359 --> 01:54:51,279
it almost sounds like you you'd like to

2890
01:54:49,118 --> 01:54:54,238
see the stigma be lifted a little bit

2891
01:54:51,279 --> 01:54:56,279
more so that can incorporate these

2892
01:54:54,238 --> 01:54:58,118
aspects of your life whether it be the

2893
01:54:56,279 --> 01:55:00,158
consumption of cannabis the breeding of

2894
01:54:58,118 --> 01:55:01,839
cannabis the growing of cannabis and all

2895
01:55:00,158 --> 01:55:05,118
those different things that you now

2896
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:07,119
spend a lot of your time on to be just

2897
01:55:05,118 --> 01:55:10,039
as easy to talk about as the fact that

2898
01:55:07,118 --> 01:55:12,359
you're also creating an album uh of your

2899
01:55:10,039 --> 01:55:13,960
own music you know through your own

2900
01:55:12,359 --> 01:55:15,759
creative Endeavors and that's something

2901
01:55:13,960 --> 01:55:18,439
that you can you know you can go to the

2902
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:19,960
bar you don't drink but you can go out

2903
01:55:18,439 --> 01:55:22,319
to dinner you can go and hang out with

2904
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:26,239
friends from work and talk about your

2905
01:55:22,319 --> 01:55:29,118
your musical Endeavors in an open way

2906
01:55:26,238 --> 01:55:31,439
that that doesn't necessarily require a

2907
01:55:29,118 --> 01:55:34,439
mask to be pulled down over your

2908
01:55:31,439 --> 01:55:36,638
identity whereas you may not necessarily

2909
01:55:34,439 --> 01:55:39,960
feel the same level of comfortability

2910
01:55:36,639 --> 01:55:42,679
talking about hey I I breed cannabis in

2911
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:45,000
my spare time I do cannabis marem tissue

2912
01:55:42,679 --> 01:55:47,679
culture in my spare time I have all

2913
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:50,000
these growing Endeavors that I'm doing

2914
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:51,639
on my own time and it feels like you

2915
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:54,078
almost have to cut a piece of yourself

2916
01:55:51,639 --> 01:55:55,279
out to be able to fit in to the cookie

2917
01:55:54,078 --> 01:55:57,399
that is

2918
01:55:55,279 --> 01:56:01,238
uh the current

2919
01:55:57,399 --> 01:56:02,920
US uh political sphere you know totally

2920
01:56:01,238 --> 01:56:05,198
agree like there's times where

2921
01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:08,000
especially if I've been like hard

2922
01:56:05,198 --> 01:56:10,078
hardcore focused on cannabis you know

2923
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:12,920
like I've been tissue culturing every

2924
01:56:10,078 --> 01:56:15,039
day you know 10 hour days and I'm like

2925
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:16,359
just up to my eyeballs and I I get out

2926
01:56:15,039 --> 01:56:19,560
to someone where I have to be a little

2927
01:56:16,359 --> 01:56:21,719
bit more Square so you say so so to say

2928
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:23,199
um I feel like I'm so boring like I have

2929
01:56:21,719 --> 01:56:24,960
nothing to talk talk about I'm like this

2930
01:56:23,198 --> 01:56:27,359
person must think that I'm just like the

2931
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:28,960
most Bland person when I'm like dude I

2932
01:56:27,359 --> 01:56:30,839
want to tell you about all this [ __ ]

2933
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:32,679
[ __ ] but you know because everything

2934
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:35,760
interesting on your mind is not

2935
01:56:32,679 --> 01:56:37,800
appropriate unfortunately right but you

2936
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:40,760
brought another point up too like

2937
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:43,079
something I would love to see is um a

2938
01:56:40,760 --> 01:56:45,960
place you can go and smoke just like a

2939
01:56:43,078 --> 01:56:47,639
bar you know a cannabis centered bar cuz

2940
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:49,239
you know after I stopped smoking

2941
01:56:47,639 --> 01:56:52,639
obviously I wasn't hanging out of bars

2942
01:56:49,238 --> 01:56:54,198
anymore so like as a kind of for me as a

2943
01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:56,078
cannabis user we don't have that place

2944
01:56:54,198 --> 01:56:57,879
of community where we can go to and

2945
01:56:56,078 --> 01:57:00,279
physically hang out and smoke with each

2946
01:56:57,880 --> 01:57:02,800
other and like without having to worry

2947
01:57:00,279 --> 01:57:05,519
about you know um you know like cops

2948
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:06,800
rolling up or whatever it is or I mean

2949
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:08,560
yeah we could do it at someone's house

2950
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:10,039
but that's not it's definitely not the

2951
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:12,280
same as being able to go to a public

2952
01:57:10,039 --> 01:57:13,960
place you know that you never know like

2953
01:57:12,279 --> 01:57:15,719
oh my my homie is going to show up maybe

2954
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:16,960
you know like he's there sometimes and

2955
01:57:15,719 --> 01:57:18,840
you never know like who you're going to

2956
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:22,880
see and what kind of conversation going

2957
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:24,960
to come so I mean for sure I Canabis

2958
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:26,159
Cal California sober you know like I

2959
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:29,158
don't get

2960
01:57:26,158 --> 01:57:31,719
that and and I feel like you know using

2961
01:57:29,158 --> 01:57:34,759
some form of social lubricant you know

2962
01:57:31,719 --> 01:57:37,000
whether it be having a drink at a bar or

2963
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:38,679
uh you know pulling out a joint and

2964
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:41,399
passing it around a bunch of friends at

2965
01:57:38,679 --> 01:57:43,279
a barbecue or something like that

2966
01:57:41,399 --> 01:57:45,879
there's I feel like there's just

2967
01:57:43,279 --> 01:57:48,559
something in humans that love that act

2968
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:51,319
of sharing something together and having

2969
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:52,880
this sort of uh either talking point or

2970
01:57:51,319 --> 01:57:55,599
something that helps release a little

2971
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:58,639
bit of the inhibitions that are placed

2972
01:57:55,599 --> 01:58:00,560
on us by either societal pressures or

2973
01:57:58,639 --> 01:58:02,279
ingroup pressures or other things like

2974
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:04,159
that that make it so it's it's like hard

2975
01:58:02,279 --> 01:58:05,800
to talk about this or that but you know

2976
01:58:04,158 --> 01:58:09,198
with a little something to help break

2977
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:12,119
the ice uh so to speak the mental Ice uh

2978
01:58:09,198 --> 01:58:14,559
it does seem that like yeah why why

2979
01:58:12,118 --> 01:58:16,960
can't there just be a place where people

2980
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:18,880
can consume cannabis together and hang

2981
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:21,439
out and talk and do all the things that

2982
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:23,520
people do at bars you know I've heard

2983
01:58:21,439 --> 01:58:26,158
from Plenty of cops that they'd rather

2984
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:28,719
deal with 100 stoned people than 10

2985
01:58:26,158 --> 01:58:31,638
drunk people you know like 10 drunk

2986
01:58:28,719 --> 01:58:34,039
people are going to cause an exorbitant

2987
01:58:31,639 --> 01:58:38,400
amount more damage potentially than 100

2988
01:58:34,039 --> 01:58:41,118
stoned people could ever create

2989
01:58:38,399 --> 01:58:43,279
um yeah that that's a really good point

2990
01:58:41,118 --> 01:58:45,880
we do need some form of consumption

2991
01:58:43,279 --> 01:58:45,880
lounge

2992
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:51,198
or I don't even know what that we can

2993
01:58:48,439 --> 01:58:53,879
meet up and we can we can bake up yeah

2994
01:58:51,198 --> 01:58:55,719
why not I feel like it it should happen

2995
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:57,440
hopefully it happens I know that there's

2996
01:58:55,719 --> 01:58:59,399
some states like New York where it was

2997
01:58:57,439 --> 01:59:01,638
written into the legislation initially

2998
01:58:59,399 --> 01:59:03,799
that there would be consumption lounges

2999
01:59:01,639 --> 01:59:05,000
or places where the public could go and

3000
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:07,159
consume and it wouldn't just be

3001
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:08,639
something that's a private club so you

3002
01:59:07,158 --> 01:59:11,039
know they're they're circumventing the

3003
01:59:08,639 --> 01:59:13,000
law by making it membership only so your

3004
01:59:11,039 --> 01:59:15,399
membership makes it so that it's kind of

3005
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:17,118
like you own part of that property and

3006
01:59:15,399 --> 01:59:18,439
so you're basically smoking in your own

3007
01:59:17,118 --> 01:59:21,519
home and they can't tell you you can't

3008
01:59:18,439 --> 01:59:22,638
do that um but yeah there needs to be

3009
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:25,920
something there

3010
01:59:22,639 --> 01:59:26,840
uh without so many loops and Hoops to

3011
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:31,480
jump

3012
01:59:26,840 --> 01:59:34,960
through um but okay yeah so I I see how

3013
01:59:31,479 --> 01:59:38,678
you know breaking down the stigma making

3014
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:40,560
it more available for for society to

3015
01:59:38,679 --> 01:59:41,679
partake in as a whole just like we do

3016
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:44,280
with all these other things those are

3017
01:59:41,679 --> 01:59:47,078
some great ways to to see the community

3018
01:59:44,279 --> 01:59:49,599
sort of develop over the next 5 to 10

3019
01:59:47,078 --> 01:59:52,039
years um I I would say one other thing I

3020
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:54,119
want to see too um and especially as

3021
01:59:52,039 --> 01:59:56,760
tissue culture becomes more prevalent in

3022
01:59:54,118 --> 01:59:58,519
the industry is I want to see a lot more

3023
01:59:56,760 --> 02:00:00,280
clean plants out there you know I don't

3024
01:59:58,520 --> 02:00:03,239
want anyone to have to deal with what I

3025
02:00:00,279 --> 02:00:05,519
had to deal with last year and you know

3026
02:00:03,238 --> 02:00:06,598
um have to throw away plants or risk

3027
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:09,520
contaminating the plants that you've

3028
02:00:06,599 --> 02:00:11,360
been working on for years you know so um

3029
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:13,000
hopefully we can move away from you know

3030
02:00:11,359 --> 02:00:15,439
Shady people in the industry who are

3031
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:17,198
here just to make a quick buck and you

3032
02:00:15,439 --> 02:00:19,118
know uh get those people replaced with

3033
02:00:17,198 --> 02:00:20,759
people who actually you know have a

3034
02:00:19,118 --> 02:00:22,799
passion for cannabis and are here

3035
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:24,639
because you know they they want to share

3036
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:27,599
the joy of growing with other people you

3037
02:00:24,639 --> 02:00:29,719
know so absolutely yeah I I agree with

3038
02:00:27,599 --> 02:00:32,239
that 100% I I did want to take an

3039
02:00:29,719 --> 02:00:34,399
opportunity to um do a couple shout outs

3040
02:00:32,238 --> 02:00:37,238
to some of the um seed banks that I

3041
02:00:34,399 --> 02:00:38,519
really like um this cool shirt that I'm

3042
02:00:37,238 --> 02:00:41,158
wearing right here it's from North

3043
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:43,520
Atlantic seedco that's dope um from what

3044
02:00:41,158 --> 02:00:45,198
I understand it's a like a woman run uh

3045
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:47,679
Seed Company in uh

3046
02:00:45,198 --> 02:00:50,078
Massachusetts and um they have a lot of

3047
02:00:47,679 --> 02:00:51,639
really good brands on that seed bank um

3048
02:00:50,078 --> 02:00:53,118
but one thing that really stood out to

3049
02:00:51,639 --> 02:00:55,078
me not not just to mention like whenever

3050
02:00:53,118 --> 02:00:56,719
you place an order they're super quick

3051
02:00:55,078 --> 02:00:59,519
tons of freebies you know on whatever

3052
02:00:56,719 --> 02:01:03,239
you order but anytime if I ever had a

3053
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:04,880
question or um any anything um I was

3054
02:01:03,238 --> 02:01:07,198
always able to reach out to that company

3055
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:10,239
and they would promptly reach back with

3056
02:01:07,198 --> 02:01:12,118
very very friendly kind emails you know

3057
02:01:10,238 --> 02:01:13,399
um when I first started causing strains

3058
02:01:12,118 --> 02:01:14,679
I reached out to him you know just to

3059
02:01:13,399 --> 02:01:17,238
get some more information about getting

3060
02:01:14,679 --> 02:01:18,880
brands on there and super nice

3061
02:01:17,238 --> 02:01:20,359
encouraging email back so I just wanted

3062
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:22,440
to give a shout out if you're looking

3063
02:01:20,359 --> 02:01:24,319
for a place to get SE seeds you know

3064
02:01:22,439 --> 02:01:27,158
that's where I got a lot of my genetics

3065
02:01:24,319 --> 02:01:29,880
from North Atlantic Seed Company another

3066
02:01:27,158 --> 02:01:32,319
one that I really liked was attitude um

3067
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:35,078
I use attitude UK which uh I think it's

3068
02:01:32,319 --> 02:01:36,759
based in Spain now um but that was

3069
02:01:35,078 --> 02:01:38,679
before I kind of was aware of more than

3070
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:41,159
the North Americans but um I did get a

3071
02:01:38,679 --> 02:01:42,599
lot of genetics from attitude so I just

3072
02:01:41,158 --> 02:01:44,479
wanted to kind of you know cuz that was

3073
02:01:42,599 --> 02:01:45,760
another portion of my research is

3074
02:01:44,479 --> 02:01:49,678
figuring out where to get these seeds

3075
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:51,320
from you know so um you know maybe me

3076
02:01:49,679 --> 02:01:53,679
pointing those those companies out that

3077
02:01:51,319 --> 02:01:55,759
I had some you know good uh good success

3078
02:01:53,679 --> 02:01:57,800
with it might help some people out there

3079
02:01:55,760 --> 02:02:00,360
so yeah check out North Atlantic seedco

3080
02:01:57,800 --> 02:02:02,880
and attitude I understand that they have

3081
02:02:00,359 --> 02:02:04,960
a US Branch now if you're in the uh in

3082
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:06,400
America so you can order a lot quicker

3083
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:08,399
but yeah shout out to those uh seed

3084
02:02:06,399 --> 02:02:11,439
banks for sure that's a great little

3085
02:02:08,399 --> 02:02:13,638
shout out great little plug for uh where

3086
02:02:11,439 --> 02:02:16,238
to where to get good genetics um I mean

3087
02:02:13,639 --> 02:02:20,000
I love plugging things that um that work

3088
02:02:16,238 --> 02:02:22,039
for me you know I don't have any um you

3089
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,679
know I'm I'm not promoting anything know

3090
02:02:22,039 --> 02:02:25,679
and getting stuff in return like these

3091
02:02:23,679 --> 02:02:28,920
are just companies that I appreciate you

3092
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:30,319
know like um another one that I really

3093
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:31,719
like actually here let me let me grab

3094
02:02:30,319 --> 02:02:33,719
this piece cuz we can see it hold on

3095
02:02:31,719 --> 02:02:35,880
just a second I have a little glass

3096
02:02:33,719 --> 02:02:37,760
collection up there um but there's this

3097
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:38,599
company called glass Berry or glass

3098
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:42,000
Berry

3099
02:02:38,599 --> 02:02:43,800
cupcake and I love um the old school

3100
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:47,118
kind of a cool

3101
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:48,920
bubbl and they just I spent a lot of

3102
02:02:47,118 --> 02:02:50,519
time trying to track down some of those

3103
02:02:48,920 --> 02:02:52,679
pieces I remember looking at and seeing

3104
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:55,320
in head shops um back when I was in high

3105
02:02:52,679 --> 02:02:57,158
school and I couldn't really find these

3106
02:02:55,319 --> 02:02:58,439
like crazy ones or some of them were

3107
02:02:57,158 --> 02:02:59,960
just like too crazy where it was like

3108
02:02:58,439 --> 02:03:02,359
they wanted like hundreds and hundreds

3109
02:02:59,960 --> 02:03:03,639
of dollars and yeah it looks cool but

3110
02:03:02,359 --> 02:03:05,639
I'm never going to smoke out of that cuz

3111
02:03:03,639 --> 02:03:07,880
what what happens if I drop it you know

3112
02:03:05,639 --> 02:03:10,679
yeah um so I found this uh this company

3113
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:12,319
and they make um just some of those

3114
02:03:10,679 --> 02:03:16,199
headyy pieces that I was I was really

3115
02:03:12,319 --> 02:03:17,158
hoping to um to find cool so yeah shout

3116
02:03:16,198 --> 02:03:19,559
out to them

3117
02:03:17,158 --> 02:03:22,559
too well you know since you're kind of

3118
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:24,079
giv a few recommendations let's uh let's

3119
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:27,840
tie it into growing a little bit and

3120
02:03:24,078 --> 02:03:30,719
what would be a tip or a piece of advice

3121
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:33,840
that you would give to a new grower

3122
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:37,480
based on the experience that you

3123
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:40,440
have I would say

3124
02:03:37,479 --> 02:03:42,238
um it depends on you know really who I'm

3125
02:03:40,439 --> 02:03:45,238
talking to like if they're just getting

3126
02:03:42,238 --> 02:03:46,198
into it you know um it depends on your

3127
02:03:45,238 --> 02:03:48,479
financial

3128
02:03:46,198 --> 02:03:50,638
situation about how much you want to put

3129
02:03:48,479 --> 02:03:52,598
into this you know is this really a

3130
02:03:50,639 --> 02:03:53,359
hobby that you want to pursue or is it

3131
02:03:52,599 --> 02:03:55,719
something that you're just kind of

3132
02:03:53,359 --> 02:03:58,078
dipping your toe in that will probably

3133
02:03:55,719 --> 02:04:01,279
help determine how much you should spend

3134
02:03:58,078 --> 02:04:03,639
on your first setup you know um what

3135
02:04:01,279 --> 02:04:05,198
what uh where where you're growing like

3136
02:04:03,639 --> 02:04:06,840
what what's that place like is it in an

3137
02:04:05,198 --> 02:04:08,158
environment that you can control easily

3138
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:10,679
is it a place that you don't have to

3139
02:04:08,158 --> 02:04:13,759
worry about smells is it a place that

3140
02:04:10,679 --> 02:04:15,078
you can get water easily you know um

3141
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:19,079
those are all concerns when it comes to

3142
02:04:15,078 --> 02:04:22,158
growing so um for me I went with uh for

3143
02:04:19,078 --> 02:04:24,039
the majority um the t i pardon me I have

3144
02:04:22,158 --> 02:04:27,399
downstairs our gorilla glow uh grow

3145
02:04:24,039 --> 02:04:29,359
tents they cost a little bit extra but

3146
02:04:27,399 --> 02:04:32,638
um I've had them for years now and and

3147
02:04:29,359 --> 02:04:35,238
they're still just as um good condition

3148
02:04:32,639 --> 02:04:38,319
as when I first bought them ni um

3149
02:04:35,238 --> 02:04:40,519
however like this video Sun here you

3150
02:04:38,319 --> 02:04:42,319
know I just got a cheapo one because I I

3151
02:04:40,520 --> 02:04:45,440
needed you know running out of space

3152
02:04:42,319 --> 02:04:47,719
downstairs and um I had a different Viv

3153
02:04:45,439 --> 02:04:50,158
Sun one where the zipper completely came

3154
02:04:47,719 --> 02:04:51,800
off uh of the zipper track and there was

3155
02:04:50,158 --> 02:04:53,118
no way for me to put it back and

3156
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:56,360
eventually had to just throw that tent

3157
02:04:53,118 --> 02:04:59,479
away you know so um I am a firm believer

3158
02:04:56,359 --> 02:05:03,158
of buy nice or buy twice but you have to

3159
02:04:59,479 --> 02:05:04,799
have um to keep in mind how far are you

3160
02:05:03,158 --> 02:05:06,479
going to take this you know is it really

3161
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:11,079
worth it to buy really nice equipment

3162
02:05:06,479 --> 02:05:12,558
right away um I I grow LED lights now um

3163
02:05:11,078 --> 02:05:14,880
I feel like the technology has come to a

3164
02:05:12,559 --> 02:05:17,079
point where it's not just really

3165
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:19,239
efficient you know um whether it's you

3166
02:05:17,078 --> 02:05:21,078
know just cost-wise you know they're

3167
02:05:19,238 --> 02:05:22,158
they're usually at a really good price

3168
02:05:21,078 --> 02:05:24,319
point

3169
02:05:22,158 --> 02:05:25,920
um they don't produce a lot of heat

3170
02:05:24,319 --> 02:05:27,799
which that's um always been a

3171
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:29,559
traditional concern especially with like

3172
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:31,279
high pressure sodiums metal highlights

3173
02:05:29,559 --> 02:05:33,199
like all those lights produce a lot of

3174
02:05:31,279 --> 02:05:35,238
heat and you have to figure out how to

3175
02:05:33,198 --> 02:05:37,479
remove that heat you know so LEDs is a

3176
02:05:35,238 --> 02:05:40,000
lot less of a concern and then power

3177
02:05:37,479 --> 02:05:41,359
consumption too um they're able to be a

3178
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:45,118
lot more efficient than your TR

3179
02:05:41,359 --> 02:05:46,920
traditional grow uh lights um so I mean

3180
02:05:45,118 --> 02:05:49,000
it's not like it's more of a budget

3181
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:51,760
brand but I've had really good um

3182
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:54,359
experience with Mars Hydro um and I've

3183
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:56,440
got those lights off Amazon and and um

3184
02:05:54,359 --> 02:05:58,839
Walmart so I mean you can basically find

3185
02:05:56,439 --> 02:06:00,799
them anywhere but Mars Hydro I've had

3186
02:05:58,840 --> 02:06:02,880
really good um you know experience did

3187
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:05,279
you say Walmart yeah I bought them off

3188
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:07,880
at walmart.com a couple of

3189
02:06:05,279 --> 02:06:09,599
them well Walmart for people where

3190
02:06:07,880 --> 02:06:11,639
Amazon you know a lot of those companies

3191
02:06:09,599 --> 02:06:13,440
are doing it where they're trying to be

3192
02:06:11,639 --> 02:06:14,920
um like the the marketplace and then

3193
02:06:13,439 --> 02:06:16,759
they have a lot of different sellers on

3194
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:18,559
it so you're not going to find those gr

3195
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:21,039
lights at a Walmart but you could find

3196
02:06:18,559 --> 02:06:23,599
them on their on their site if I if I

3197
02:06:21,039 --> 02:06:26,238
walked into Walmart and saw Mars Hydro

3198
02:06:23,599 --> 02:06:29,000
sitting on a shelf I'd say well it looks

3199
02:06:26,238 --> 02:06:31,359
like growing is going to be legal soon

3200
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:33,118
yeah well grow growing is no longer cool

3201
02:06:31,359 --> 02:06:35,519
it's like watch your parents do

3202
02:06:33,118 --> 02:06:36,719
something thought was cool like oh god

3203
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:38,119
oh godam is that what I look like when I

3204
02:06:36,719 --> 02:06:40,439
do

3205
02:06:38,118 --> 02:06:41,279
that [ __ ] I don't want to do

3206
02:06:40,439 --> 02:06:43,439
this

3207
02:06:41,279 --> 02:06:46,439
anymore yeah

3208
02:06:43,439 --> 02:06:48,558
exactly oh well that's that's good piece

3209
02:06:46,439 --> 02:06:51,000
of advice you know um I feel like the

3210
02:06:48,559 --> 02:06:53,320
one that a lot of Growers should take

3211
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:55,920
away is or there's it's a it's kind of a

3212
02:06:53,319 --> 02:06:57,840
two-parter right so you know know how

3213
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:59,279
you what you want to do to get into it

3214
02:06:57,840 --> 02:07:00,719
like know what you're aiming to get out

3215
02:06:59,279 --> 02:07:02,960
of it is it something where you just are

3216
02:07:00,719 --> 02:07:05,439
like I I want to see how cannabis plants

3217
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:07,559
grow then yeah you might want to start

3218
02:07:05,439 --> 02:07:09,879
with something cheaper maybe a smaller

3219
02:07:07,559 --> 02:07:12,079
tent maybe use a closet that you already

3220
02:07:09,880 --> 02:07:16,039
have and just throw a light in there and

3221
02:07:12,078 --> 02:07:18,359
see what happens um or if you're like no

3222
02:07:16,039 --> 02:07:20,359
I I like I love cannabis and I want to

3223
02:07:18,359 --> 02:07:21,679
grow my own and I'm I'm I know that I'm

3224
02:07:20,359 --> 02:07:24,078
going to do this for a little bit but

3225
02:07:21,679 --> 02:07:27,679
then yeah you might want to go about the

3226
02:07:24,078 --> 02:07:29,238
the idea of buy buy once cry once and uh

3227
02:07:27,679 --> 02:07:31,599
and buy yourself something that's a

3228
02:07:29,238 --> 02:07:33,118
little bit better um or invest in

3229
02:07:31,599 --> 02:07:35,199
yourself a little bit more depending on

3230
02:07:33,118 --> 02:07:37,078
if you have a space where you can build

3231
02:07:35,198 --> 02:07:39,198
out part of a room like you did with

3232
02:07:37,078 --> 02:07:41,759
that that first room where uh you framed

3233
02:07:39,198 --> 02:07:44,078
it out and you know you can put in a

3234
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:46,599
little bit more air exchange and uh air

3235
02:07:44,078 --> 02:07:48,599
control uh and enironmental controls and

3236
02:07:46,599 --> 02:07:50,078
things like that or a really nice uh

3237
02:07:48,599 --> 02:07:52,559
like a Gorilla Grow Tent which are

3238
02:07:50,078 --> 02:07:54,158
probably I'd say those and like AC

3239
02:07:52,559 --> 02:07:55,599
infinities are probably some of the best

3240
02:07:54,158 --> 02:07:58,879
tents you can get on the market right

3241
02:07:55,599 --> 02:08:01,400
now um for their price points and uh I

3242
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:05,760
love AC Infinity for um I use them for

3243
02:08:01,399 --> 02:08:07,598
inline uh fans and just amazing so

3244
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:10,039
actually I have um I just recently got

3245
02:08:07,599 --> 02:08:13,000
some oscillating fans that clip on your

3246
02:08:10,039 --> 02:08:14,519
tent uh pole like the little height that

3247
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:16,359
you want and it doesn't take four space

3248
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:18,360
they're [ __ ] so sick dude yeah those

3249
02:08:16,359 --> 02:08:20,920
things are great I love that they now

3250
02:08:18,359 --> 02:08:22,479
have the uh different controllers that

3251
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:24,239
can enter face all these different

3252
02:08:22,479 --> 02:08:26,959
pieces of equipment whether it be a

3253
02:08:24,238 --> 02:08:28,879
humidifier dehumidifier uh your lighting

3254
02:08:26,960 --> 02:08:31,118
control your fan controls all these

3255
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:33,639
different things that you can tie in

3256
02:08:31,118 --> 02:08:37,479
together where that was something that

3257
02:08:33,639 --> 02:08:39,679
was pretty much only reserved for uh

3258
02:08:37,479 --> 02:08:43,279
commercial grow spaces through things

3259
02:08:39,679 --> 02:08:45,359
like growlink or aoya or open sprinkler

3260
02:08:43,279 --> 02:08:47,519
or all these different programs that

3261
02:08:45,359 --> 02:08:51,439
required some sort

3262
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:53,760
of um Subscription Service uh and the

3263
02:08:51,439 --> 02:08:55,198
the initial overhead cost was typically

3264
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:56,719
like even at the base level where it's

3265
02:08:55,198 --> 02:08:58,678
like oh this yeah this is enough for you

3266
02:08:56,719 --> 02:09:00,359
to run one room at scale and then you

3267
02:08:58,679 --> 02:09:04,440
look into it it's like

3268
02:09:00,359 --> 02:09:06,439
$188,000 with like $300 per month uh

3269
02:09:04,439 --> 02:09:08,519
subscription service and you're like I

3270
02:09:06,439 --> 02:09:11,198
dude I'm growing in like 510 I don't

3271
02:09:08,520 --> 02:09:13,119
need I I can't afford that this that's

3272
02:09:11,198 --> 02:09:16,319
more than my entire setup just to look

3273
02:09:13,118 --> 02:09:18,799
at it through a computer um so a lot of

3274
02:09:16,319 --> 02:09:22,118
people that didn't make sense until aoya

3275
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:24,960
started putting out a lot of uh really

3276
02:09:22,118 --> 02:09:26,880
really nice or Not Sorry AC Infinity

3277
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:28,880
started putting out a lot of really nice

3278
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:30,400
equipment for home Growers and um

3279
02:09:28,880 --> 02:09:34,960
another one that I like to shout out

3280
02:09:30,399 --> 02:09:39,078
would be ewit um EC wi t uh you can find

3281
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:41,559
a lot of their products on Amazon um but

3282
02:09:39,078 --> 02:09:42,759
they have uh like a home hub that

3283
02:09:41,559 --> 02:09:45,880
connects to a bunch of different

3284
02:09:42,760 --> 02:09:48,840
Wireless pieces of um monitoring

3285
02:09:45,880 --> 02:09:51,639
equipment so you can have uh substrate

3286
02:09:48,840 --> 02:09:54,078
monitoring for the moisture content you

3287
02:09:51,639 --> 02:09:56,679
can have environmental monitoring for

3288
02:09:54,078 --> 02:09:59,719
you can go as deep as like wind speed

3289
02:09:56,679 --> 02:10:01,960
lighting um humidity temperature vapor

3290
02:09:59,719 --> 02:10:05,239
pressure deficit and you can use all

3291
02:10:01,960 --> 02:10:07,000
those things to kind of make controlled

3292
02:10:05,238 --> 02:10:09,399
adjustments within your environment to

3293
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:12,920
make sure that you're growing as

3294
02:10:09,399 --> 02:10:14,679
optimally as possible for the plants um

3295
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:16,880
so all those things little things here

3296
02:10:14,679 --> 02:10:19,480
and there that that new Growers can use

3297
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:20,880
I feel like to to make sure that they're

3298
02:10:19,479 --> 02:10:23,198
doing something and that they can then

3299
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:24,480
correlate that to data if if that's how

3300
02:10:23,198 --> 02:10:25,799
their mind works and if that's how they

3301
02:10:24,479 --> 02:10:28,198
like to go about it I think that that's

3302
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:30,039
a a great thing for new Growers dude I

3303
02:10:28,198 --> 02:10:33,198
totally want to build my own Hub I I

3304
02:10:30,039 --> 02:10:34,800
have like all the uh all the sensors and

3305
02:10:33,198 --> 02:10:37,000
um have I ever talked to you about

3306
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:39,000
raspberry pies before yeah you know what

3307
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:40,559
that is yeah so just for our viewers

3308
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:42,719
that don't know I think I actually have

3309
02:10:40,559 --> 02:10:44,639
one around here somewhere so Raspberry

3310
02:10:42,719 --> 02:10:46,679
Pi is a single board

3311
02:10:44,639 --> 02:10:49,000
computer um here's what it looks like on

3312
02:10:46,679 --> 02:10:50,960
the inside just one board it's got like

3313
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:53,639
the heat sink I got a little fan but

3314
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:55,399
it's basically the size of a credit card

3315
02:10:53,639 --> 02:10:56,920
and I have one of these downstairs next

3316
02:10:55,399 --> 02:10:59,598
to my internet router and that actually

3317
02:10:56,920 --> 02:11:02,920
runs my website um so I have it as a web

3318
02:10:59,599 --> 02:11:04,440
server uh you know hosting my website

3319
02:11:02,920 --> 02:11:06,279
but um you can use them for all

3320
02:11:04,439 --> 02:11:08,960
different projects they're [ __ ] so

3321
02:11:06,279 --> 02:11:11,359
cool dude like raspberry pies um and

3322
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:14,520
then in the same vein arduinos Arduino

3323
02:11:11,359 --> 02:11:15,839
is another single board computer um but

3324
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:18,920
utilizing those little single board

3325
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:21,559
computers you can um using like a bread

3326
02:11:18,920 --> 02:11:22,960
uh board um which is if you're remember

3327
02:11:21,559 --> 02:11:24,159
from movies and you seen those phone

3328
02:11:22,960 --> 02:11:25,920
operators and they have all those

3329
02:11:24,158 --> 02:11:28,279
different switches and stuff it's kind

3330
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:30,399
of similar to that um but you can hook

3331
02:11:28,279 --> 02:11:32,559
up Those sensors and then write programs

3332
02:11:30,399 --> 02:11:35,000
to interact with the sensors so I have a

3333
02:11:32,559 --> 02:11:37,039
sensor for um moisture in the soil I

3334
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:39,880
have one for um it's supposed to tell

3335
02:11:37,039 --> 02:11:40,880
you like water temperatur so I think uh

3336
02:11:39,880 --> 02:11:43,800
there's water temperature and then

3337
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:45,039
there's water levels too so there's this

3338
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:46,320
one sensor where yeah actually the

3339
02:11:45,039 --> 02:11:48,399
sensor would sit at the bottom and when

3340
02:11:46,319 --> 02:11:50,558
the water level goes like below a

3341
02:11:48,399 --> 02:11:51,879
certain point it will send a signal so

3342
02:11:50,559 --> 02:11:53,639
you can tell if your water reservoir is

3343
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:56,840
getting too low it's like a pressure

3344
02:11:53,639 --> 02:11:59,920
sensor yeah M those are probes too and

3345
02:11:56,840 --> 02:12:02,559
then um I saw this project on YouTube

3346
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:05,000
called the Raspberry Pi bartender and it

3347
02:12:02,559 --> 02:12:07,320
was us utilizing pardon me these little

3348
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:09,639
these little pumps and it was all hooked

3349
02:12:07,319 --> 02:12:11,558
up to like um one was hooked up to a

3350
02:12:09,639 --> 02:12:12,920
bottle of vodka one was hooked up to

3351
02:12:11,559 --> 02:12:15,079
orange juice and you know a bunch of

3352
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:17,639
different drinks and the mixers and then

3353
02:12:15,078 --> 02:12:20,118
on the front of what they built they can

3354
02:12:17,639 --> 02:12:22,400
say I want a screwdriver put glass Down

3355
02:12:20,118 --> 02:12:24,118
Under the dispenser and

3356
02:12:22,399 --> 02:12:26,719
and then the computer using those those

3357
02:12:24,118 --> 02:12:29,158
pumps would do you know X parts of vodka

3358
02:12:26,719 --> 02:12:30,920
and then X parts of orange juice to make

3359
02:12:29,158 --> 02:12:32,558
the screwdriver is that just like

3360
02:12:30,920 --> 02:12:35,880
parastic pumps the ones that kind of

3361
02:12:32,559 --> 02:12:37,920
twirl uh against the silicone tubing

3362
02:12:35,880 --> 02:12:40,599
yeah was like you can utilize those with

3363
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:43,239
your nutrients with your pH Up PH down

3364
02:12:40,599 --> 02:12:46,000
and have those sensors and you could

3365
02:12:43,238 --> 02:12:49,279
basically have it dispense x amount of

3366
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:50,880
nutrients in in your U Reservoir and

3367
02:12:49,279 --> 02:12:53,078
then of course you have you know the the

3368
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:55,800
water mixing all around from your pumps

3369
02:12:53,078 --> 02:12:57,319
and stuff and then every 20 minutes it

3370
02:12:55,800 --> 02:13:00,279
would do a reading of the ph and if the

3371
02:12:57,319 --> 02:13:01,920
pH is off of the range that you want um

3372
02:13:00,279 --> 02:13:04,639
you could use the same pumps put in you

3373
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:06,559
know x amount of pH Up or pH Down

3374
02:13:04,639 --> 02:13:08,559
whatever it needs to go yeah and have it

3375
02:13:06,559 --> 02:13:10,520
cycle 20 more minutes so I was like dude

3376
02:13:08,559 --> 02:13:12,679
I have all these ideas of of a project

3377
02:13:10,520 --> 02:13:15,639
that I want to do to make have you seen

3378
02:13:12,679 --> 02:13:18,039
have you seen nerine no I haven't so

3379
02:13:15,639 --> 02:13:19,960
nerine is basically that exactly and it

3380
02:13:18,039 --> 02:13:21,519
uses like a recirculating pump and then

3381
02:13:19,960 --> 02:13:23,319
a bunch of parastic pumps comes with the

3382
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:26,639
different nutrients as well as pH Up and

3383
02:13:23,319 --> 02:13:28,359
PH down and a a pH probe and sensor and

3384
02:13:26,639 --> 02:13:31,159
then you can also link it it link it to

3385
02:13:28,359 --> 02:13:33,238
your substrate monitoring and uh it's

3386
02:13:31,158 --> 02:13:35,920
all controlled through one Hub so yeah

3387
02:13:33,238 --> 02:13:37,799
if you can make uh a copy of of what

3388
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:40,480
they're doing already so many people

3389
02:13:37,800 --> 02:13:42,440
would find so much use in that and if it

3390
02:13:40,479 --> 02:13:45,638
can all be ran off of Raspberry Pi and

3391
02:13:42,439 --> 02:13:49,000
people can you know if you open source

3392
02:13:45,639 --> 02:13:50,679
that that uh that software for the the

3393
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:52,198
little Raspberry Pi Hardware there'd be

3394
02:13:50,679 --> 02:13:54,599
a lot of people that would benefit from

3395
02:13:52,198 --> 02:13:56,279
that I just I want to see if I can do it

3396
02:13:54,599 --> 02:13:57,679
you know that's I mean that's kind of

3397
02:13:56,279 --> 02:14:00,118
like the theme with everything I do it's

3398
02:13:57,679 --> 02:14:02,319
like can I do it let's let's try you

3399
02:14:00,118 --> 02:14:04,279
know yeah why not um you know another

3400
02:14:02,319 --> 02:14:05,279
thing too uh you know cuz I know we're

3401
02:14:04,279 --> 02:14:09,118
getting to the point where we should

3402
02:14:05,279 --> 02:14:12,439
probably wrap up um one piece of advice

3403
02:14:09,118 --> 02:14:14,598
I want to give Growers too is um things

3404
02:14:12,439 --> 02:14:17,558
don't have to be perfect for you to get

3405
02:14:14,599 --> 02:14:19,279
results you know um when I first you

3406
02:14:17,559 --> 02:14:21,400
know way before I had my little company

3407
02:14:19,279 --> 02:14:25,118
here and before I had any aspiration of

3408
02:14:21,399 --> 02:14:27,439
being you know um a breeder back when I

3409
02:14:25,118 --> 02:14:30,078
was learning about pollen and you know

3410
02:14:27,439 --> 02:14:33,039
the techniques there was one point where

3411
02:14:30,078 --> 02:14:35,118
I had a ton of plants in my backyard

3412
02:14:33,039 --> 02:14:36,760
shed you know a bunch of Ms that I was

3413
02:14:35,118 --> 02:14:39,439
just like let's just flower them out

3414
02:14:36,760 --> 02:14:41,159
we'll collect the pollen one at a time

3415
02:14:39,439 --> 02:14:43,759
and if I get around to utilizing the

3416
02:14:41,158 --> 02:14:45,078
pollen cool but if not no big deal at

3417
02:14:43,760 --> 02:14:46,679
least I don't have to uh keep these

3418
02:14:45,078 --> 02:14:48,000
males alive anymore you know they're

3419
02:14:46,679 --> 02:14:50,000
they're not high priority I have these

3420
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:51,920
other males I have I know for sure I

3421
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:54,520
want to do um runs with but these ones

3422
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:57,078
are a maybe so I collected a bunch of

3423
02:14:54,520 --> 02:14:59,320
different pollen now the problem was out

3424
02:14:57,078 --> 02:15:01,840
in my shed in the backyard somehow we

3425
02:14:59,319 --> 02:15:04,519
got a Spiderman infestation and it was

3426
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:06,520
bad like to the point where I was lucky

3427
02:15:04,520 --> 02:15:08,639
that I was able to get the plants past

3428
02:15:06,520 --> 02:15:11,440
three weeks of flower was such a bad

3429
02:15:08,639 --> 02:15:13,000
investation and so what I did is I got

3430
02:15:11,439 --> 02:15:15,638
um I went to Walmart and I got a bunch

3431
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:17,760
of moving boxes and uh they're like

3432
02:15:15,639 --> 02:15:21,118
medium size they were like a150 two

3433
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:23,800
bucks a pop and I would set that up I

3434
02:15:21,118 --> 02:15:25,598
would lay tin foil on the bottom of it

3435
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:27,639
um and so you know I taped up the bottom

3436
02:15:25,599 --> 02:15:29,440
or you know you fold the the bottom so

3437
02:15:27,639 --> 02:15:32,440
it's not going to fall out and then at

3438
02:15:29,439 --> 02:15:34,078
the top I would um on two sides across

3439
02:15:32,439 --> 02:15:36,719
from each other you know cut like three

3440
02:15:34,078 --> 02:15:39,439
holes and then I would feed string in uh

3441
02:15:36,719 --> 02:15:40,760
across the top and I would hang the buds

3442
02:15:39,439 --> 02:15:42,198
so they're hanging at the top of the

3443
02:15:40,760 --> 02:15:44,000
cardboard and then any of the pollen

3444
02:15:42,198 --> 02:15:47,799
would fall down to you know the tin foil

3445
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:49,279
at the bottom there and um so I was like

3446
02:15:47,800 --> 02:15:51,480
well [ __ ] man like I don't want to bring

3447
02:15:49,279 --> 02:15:54,118
any of this in my house it's infested

3448
02:15:51,479 --> 02:15:55,279
with spidermites you know and I'm not

3449
02:15:54,118 --> 02:15:56,558
going to be able to get spidermites off

3450
02:15:55,279 --> 02:15:59,078
the plant material but I'm going to

3451
02:15:56,559 --> 02:16:01,440
still try to collect the pollen so one

3452
02:15:59,078 --> 02:16:02,799
by one I took all those plants and I you

3453
02:16:01,439 --> 02:16:04,919
know put them in those boxes and I put

3454
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:06,559
them in my garage and I'm in Southern

3455
02:16:04,920 --> 02:16:10,078
California here where our summers are

3456
02:16:06,559 --> 02:16:12,119
getting you know 115 no problem so it

3457
02:16:10,078 --> 02:16:15,359
was in the garage for about two months

3458
02:16:12,118 --> 02:16:17,039
in summer heat and by all accounts on

3459
02:16:15,359 --> 02:16:18,920
everything that I've researched that

3460
02:16:17,039 --> 02:16:20,238
pollen should have not been viable at

3461
02:16:18,920 --> 02:16:21,480
all it should have been just completely

3462
02:16:20,238 --> 02:16:23,158
dead

3463
02:16:21,479 --> 02:16:25,839
and you know again I was just doing the

3464
02:16:23,158 --> 02:16:27,359
best I could you know like what am I

3465
02:16:25,840 --> 02:16:31,760
going to do just throw it all out might

3466
02:16:27,359 --> 02:16:35,279
as well try so um there was a point

3467
02:16:31,760 --> 02:16:38,599
before um yeah this is way before I I I

3468
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:41,319
did my um my my my company and

3469
02:16:38,599 --> 02:16:43,359
everything I had at that point before I

3470
02:16:41,318 --> 02:16:46,159
did the line uh using the pineapple

3471
02:16:43,359 --> 02:16:48,200
passion smoothie mail um I collected

3472
02:16:46,159 --> 02:16:49,359
some of that from you know that instance

3473
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:51,120
when it was in the garage again it

3474
02:16:49,359 --> 02:16:51,800
shouldn't have been viable so I had a VI

3475
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:56,040
of

3476
02:16:51,799 --> 02:16:58,039
it and a couple months down the line I

3477
02:16:56,040 --> 02:17:01,719
was having trouble cloning one of my

3478
02:16:58,040 --> 02:17:04,359
plants that was already in flour and so

3479
02:17:01,718 --> 02:17:06,239
in order for me to be like well you know

3480
02:17:04,359 --> 02:17:09,200
it's I have the potential right now to

3481
02:17:06,239 --> 02:17:10,558
lose my pineapple upside down cake plant

3482
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:12,439
because you know I haven't been able to

3483
02:17:10,558 --> 02:17:15,679
successfully have a rude and it's

3484
02:17:12,439 --> 02:17:17,280
already week two of flour so I took that

3485
02:17:15,679 --> 02:17:19,439
pollen that I collected again shouldn't

3486
02:17:17,280 --> 02:17:21,760
have been viable at all and I used my

3487
02:17:19,439 --> 02:17:23,920
little paintbrush and I painted you know

3488
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:26,200
a couple um of the bigger nugs on that

3489
02:17:23,920 --> 02:17:28,280
plant and lo and behold they were fully

3490
02:17:26,200 --> 02:17:30,079
pollinated I had so many seeds in there

3491
02:17:28,280 --> 02:17:32,319
so that's awesome the point to everyone

3492
02:17:30,079 --> 02:17:34,959
is shoot for Perfection but don't let it

3493
02:17:32,318 --> 02:17:37,119
get in the way of progress you know um

3494
02:17:34,959 --> 02:17:39,279
because You' be surprised even if things

3495
02:17:37,120 --> 02:17:41,280
aren't optimal about what you can pull

3496
02:17:39,280 --> 02:17:44,079
off you know just give your chance to

3497
02:17:41,280 --> 02:17:47,439
try it you know right on that's a that's

3498
02:17:44,079 --> 02:17:50,920
a great way to kind of end the the talk

3499
02:17:47,439 --> 02:17:54,079
about cannabis cultivation and breeding

3500
02:17:50,920 --> 02:17:57,159
I feel like you know perseverance and

3501
02:17:54,079 --> 02:18:00,079
persistency will really pay off in a lot

3502
02:17:57,159 --> 02:18:03,478
of ways if you if you don't let things

3503
02:18:00,079 --> 02:18:05,718
stand in your way in terms of failures

3504
02:18:03,478 --> 02:18:09,840
or how someone else says it has to be

3505
02:18:05,718 --> 02:18:11,478
done or you know just because you you

3506
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:13,318
yeah just because it's it's been told to

3507
02:18:11,478 --> 02:18:14,879
you there's absolutely no no way that

3508
02:18:13,318 --> 02:18:17,239
that can work if if you think that it

3509
02:18:14,879 --> 02:18:20,239
can work especially when it comes to

3510
02:18:17,239 --> 02:18:21,959
something that's as esoteric as a plant

3511
02:18:20,239 --> 02:18:24,599
where like we still don't know all the

3512
02:18:21,959 --> 02:18:27,039
different processes that the roots have

3513
02:18:24,599 --> 02:18:30,318
and and and relations that they'll have

3514
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:32,679
with melal colonies like uh Endo fights

3515
02:18:30,318 --> 02:18:34,840
like we're we're not we're not 100% sure

3516
02:18:32,679 --> 02:18:37,439
on all these different things so when

3517
02:18:34,840 --> 02:18:39,239
someone says that they're 100% sure

3518
02:18:37,439 --> 02:18:40,398
someone won't something won't work

3519
02:18:39,239 --> 02:18:43,879
that's when you can be sure that they're

3520
02:18:40,398 --> 02:18:46,599
full of [ __ ] because that you can't be

3521
02:18:43,879 --> 02:18:48,638
100% on almost anything in this life so

3522
02:18:46,599 --> 02:18:52,719
only siths deal in

3523
02:18:48,638 --> 02:18:52,718
absolutes only only siths

3524
02:18:53,959 --> 02:19:00,638
yeah yes only siths deal in absolutes

3525
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:02,120
that's a great call back love that all

3526
02:19:00,638 --> 02:19:04,199
right well let's get into a couple of

3527
02:19:02,120 --> 02:19:06,120
these little wrapup questions just so we

3528
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:09,000
can wrap this up for the for the guests

3529
02:19:06,120 --> 02:19:11,359
or for the uh the listeners here um so

3530
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:13,519
what's your favorite strain of all time

3531
02:19:11,359 --> 02:19:17,159
[ __ ] man um I mean there's a lot of

3532
02:19:13,519 --> 02:19:19,040
contenders but I got a I got to say sfog

3533
02:19:17,159 --> 02:19:20,558
nice that's just such a solid and the

3534
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:22,160
history that I have with that strain you

3535
02:19:20,558 --> 02:19:25,119
know it's it's always going to be really

3536
02:19:22,159 --> 02:19:27,638
close to my heart and um unfortunately I

3537
02:19:25,120 --> 02:19:30,679
think I've lost the my sfog clone that I

3538
02:19:27,638 --> 02:19:32,239
had from OG life back in 2020 U I have

3539
02:19:30,679 --> 02:19:33,920
it on my shelf here in tissue culture

3540
02:19:32,239 --> 02:19:35,718
but that culture is not looking too good

3541
02:19:33,920 --> 02:19:37,679
you know it's oh no it's been a learning

3542
02:19:35,718 --> 02:19:39,678
process but no problem our homie Gabby

3543
02:19:37,679 --> 02:19:42,280
has assured me that you know when I'm

3544
02:19:39,679 --> 02:19:44,159
ready you know I can I can you know P

3545
02:19:42,280 --> 02:19:47,200
you know purchase it from him there so

3546
02:19:44,159 --> 02:19:50,079
cool um you know no no worries you know

3547
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:52,680
and one thing too like that I've I've

3548
02:19:50,079 --> 02:19:54,478
really had to accept in in my heart cuz

3549
02:19:52,680 --> 02:19:56,680
it's so hard I love all these strains

3550
02:19:54,478 --> 02:19:58,478
you know but I got to remember that you

3551
02:19:56,680 --> 02:20:00,079
know I have strains that I've made but

3552
02:19:58,478 --> 02:20:01,760
the majority of these breeder cuts that

3553
02:20:00,079 --> 02:20:05,239
I have they're just someone else's

3554
02:20:01,760 --> 02:20:06,920
creation so it's not always it's not

3555
02:20:05,239 --> 02:20:08,439
exactly my responsibility to make sure

3556
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:10,079
that these strains don't die out you

3557
02:20:08,439 --> 02:20:12,120
know cuz someone else probably has them

3558
02:20:10,079 --> 02:20:13,600
so you know that's that's part of the

3559
02:20:12,120 --> 02:20:15,560
process too is learning to let go you

3560
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:18,359
know learning to accept what is and what

3561
02:20:15,559 --> 02:20:20,039
is not I've I've held on to plans for

3562
02:20:18,359 --> 02:20:21,399
way too long in the commercial setting

3563
02:20:20,040 --> 02:20:23,640
just because

3564
02:20:21,398 --> 02:20:26,000
you hear how much they cost and you go

3565
02:20:23,639 --> 02:20:28,719
oh my God I don't want to lose that but

3566
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:30,239
you know most most people it's like you

3567
02:20:28,719 --> 02:20:32,478
break that barrier to entry they'll just

3568
02:20:30,239 --> 02:20:34,359
send you another cut if you [ __ ] it up

3569
02:20:32,478 --> 02:20:37,279
it's not that expensive to just pay for

3570
02:20:34,359 --> 02:20:39,920
shipping again um you already showed the

3571
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:41,920
initiative of wanting it so yeah that's

3572
02:20:39,920 --> 02:20:44,239
a that's a good little extra bit of

3573
02:20:41,920 --> 02:20:46,719
tidbit there little bonus bonus tidbit

3574
02:20:44,239 --> 02:20:48,920
of information for new Growers is be

3575
02:20:46,719 --> 02:20:50,679
okay with letting go of plants don't

3576
02:20:48,920 --> 02:20:52,520
don't hold on to plants for too long if

3577
02:20:50,680 --> 02:20:54,840
they're not worth it you know whether it

3578
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:58,399
be health or pest pressure pathogen

3579
02:20:54,840 --> 02:21:00,079
pressure just inability to clone um

3580
02:20:58,398 --> 02:21:02,279
don't worry about it you there's there's

3581
02:21:00,079 --> 02:21:03,920
plenty more plants out there I'm already

3582
02:21:02,280 --> 02:21:07,040
pretty deep in it right now with my my

3583
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:08,559
tissue culture stuff so right I I don't

3584
02:21:07,040 --> 02:21:11,479
want to get to the point where I have to

3585
02:21:08,559 --> 02:21:12,719
be like okay well maybe this maybe

3586
02:21:11,478 --> 02:21:14,840
trying to hold on to all these strains

3587
02:21:12,719 --> 02:21:16,199
isn't working out so you know I mean

3588
02:21:14,840 --> 02:21:17,840
with tissue culture though you have that

3589
02:21:16,200 --> 02:21:19,920
ability to hold on to a lot more than

3590
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:22,639
you would otherwise and uh once you get

3591
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:24,120
your methodol down um it shouldn't be

3592
02:21:22,639 --> 02:21:25,799
something that is like even a question

3593
02:21:24,120 --> 02:21:28,160
you you'll be able to put stuff in in

3594
02:21:25,799 --> 02:21:31,679
culture and kill the plant the same day

3595
02:21:28,159 --> 02:21:34,398
yeah yeah and I've already done that

3596
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:37,359
like when I first started I had so much

3597
02:21:34,398 --> 02:21:39,159
confidence and so this gelato 41 I

3598
02:21:37,359 --> 02:21:42,359
bought this and I've never grown this

3599
02:21:39,159 --> 02:21:44,119
out this is something I bought from um

3600
02:21:42,359 --> 02:21:45,840
breeders direct you know um we have the

3601
02:21:44,120 --> 02:21:48,520
little tidbit about breed direct you

3602
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:50,960
know where Gabby sells his clones but

3603
02:21:48,520 --> 02:21:54,920
yeah I I bought that plant just put into

3604
02:21:50,959 --> 02:21:57,039
culture so that's funny I mean hey if

3605
02:21:54,920 --> 02:21:58,760
you're going all in might as well right

3606
02:21:57,040 --> 02:22:01,399
yeah you know like well I mean the way I

3607
02:21:58,760 --> 02:22:03,719
look at it too is um I'm I'm very

3608
02:22:01,398 --> 02:22:05,599
fortunate you know where again you know

3609
02:22:03,719 --> 02:22:09,119
because of my job it pays for all my

3610
02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:11,159
bills and and then some so I do have

3611
02:22:09,120 --> 02:22:14,120
somewhat of a disposable income where I

3612
02:22:11,159 --> 02:22:15,719
can just kind of throw money you know at

3613
02:22:14,120 --> 02:22:17,880
at those trains and and hopefully I can

3614
02:22:15,719 --> 02:22:20,119
get it to work out so I mean some of

3615
02:22:17,879 --> 02:22:22,759
those trins that I bought um like the

3616
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:24,520
the robberry diesel um I'm not so sure

3617
02:22:22,760 --> 02:22:26,800
if I'm going to be able to to have it

3618
02:22:24,520 --> 02:22:28,680
get through the tissue culture process

3619
02:22:26,799 --> 02:22:31,719
and you know that's okay you know like

3620
02:22:28,680 --> 02:22:34,120
an expensive lesson but every every time

3621
02:22:31,719 --> 02:22:35,799
that I got a new order of plants it

3622
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:39,120
really did help Propel me to continue

3623
02:22:35,799 --> 02:22:41,279
working so you know even if not if it if

3624
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:42,800
it doesn't work out that's fine but at

3625
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:44,840
the end of this I'm going to have so

3626
02:22:42,799 --> 02:22:46,679
much more knowledge on tissue pure than

3627
02:22:44,840 --> 02:22:48,398
I did when I first started so that's

3628
02:22:46,680 --> 02:22:50,520
just as valuable as the plant yeah

3629
02:22:48,398 --> 02:22:52,119
that's what I like I look at too like

3630
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:55,079
I've been holding on to my strengths for

3631
02:22:52,120 --> 02:22:56,600
so long and here we are um it hasn't

3632
02:22:55,079 --> 02:22:58,079
even been a year and I've been making

3633
02:22:56,600 --> 02:23:00,200
all these Connections in the community

3634
02:22:58,079 --> 02:23:02,639
with other you know awesome Growers who

3635
02:23:00,200 --> 02:23:04,439
have their own Collections and now it

3636
02:23:02,639 --> 02:23:07,079
seems kind of silly that I held on so

3637
02:23:04,439 --> 02:23:08,639
hard and I tried working you know

3638
02:23:07,079 --> 02:23:10,639
against all these different odds you

3639
02:23:08,639 --> 02:23:11,879
know like we even get a chance to talk

3640
02:23:10,639 --> 02:23:14,039
about some of the pests that I've

3641
02:23:11,879 --> 02:23:16,438
encountered you know like I actually

3642
02:23:14,040 --> 02:23:19,800
successfully like what 3 years ago was

3643
02:23:16,439 --> 02:23:21,359
able to save um six of my strengths and

3644
02:23:19,799 --> 02:23:23,398
you know this is way before I had a ton

3645
02:23:21,359 --> 02:23:25,880
of strains but six of my strains from

3646
02:23:23,398 --> 02:23:27,478
spidermites I had a full spidermite

3647
02:23:25,879 --> 02:23:29,119
infestation inside who knows where it

3648
02:23:27,478 --> 02:23:31,398
came from whether it was the pets that

3649
02:23:29,120 --> 02:23:34,040
we have or my fiance loves you know

3650
02:23:31,398 --> 02:23:36,719
house plants you know that's a very big

3651
02:23:34,040 --> 02:23:39,319
potential for um infecting your your

3652
02:23:36,719 --> 02:23:41,398
grow space You Know by the way um FYI

3653
02:23:39,318 --> 02:23:43,799
guys if you get plants from Like Home

3654
02:23:41,398 --> 02:23:45,639
Depot or you know Lowe's or whatever

3655
02:23:43,799 --> 02:23:47,199
like chances are they probably have

3656
02:23:45,639 --> 02:23:49,239
pests on them so when you bring them

3657
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:52,279
inside you probably bring those pests

3658
02:23:49,239 --> 02:23:55,520
inside but yeah I mean I I saved all

3659
02:23:52,279 --> 02:23:59,319
those plants but it was a process and it

3660
02:23:55,520 --> 02:24:01,520
was very stressful for me you know um so

3661
02:23:59,318 --> 02:24:03,600
it now that I I know all these people

3662
02:24:01,520 --> 02:24:06,760
were they have amazing collections

3663
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:08,159
themselves and I know like legitimate

3664
02:24:06,760 --> 02:24:10,439
Growers people who aren't going to be

3665
02:24:08,159 --> 02:24:13,279
selling me like disease Cuts you know

3666
02:24:10,439 --> 02:24:15,359
like it doesn't feel like such a a

3667
02:24:13,279 --> 02:24:18,000
gigantic responsibility for me to make

3668
02:24:15,359 --> 02:24:19,920
sure that these strains stay alive

3669
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:21,760
because if they don't stay alive chances

3670
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:24,439
are someone else still has them so you

3671
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:26,639
know for sure let let go of that that

3672
02:24:24,439 --> 02:24:28,239
stress man it's just weed you know like

3673
02:24:26,639 --> 02:24:30,519
we stress it's just a plant there's

3674
02:24:28,239 --> 02:24:32,760
billions of them out there yeah right

3675
02:24:30,520 --> 02:24:34,560
yeah well Okay cool so just one more

3676
02:24:32,760 --> 02:24:37,600
question then who is your favorite

3677
02:24:34,559 --> 02:24:37,600
breeder of all

3678
02:24:39,639 --> 02:24:45,318
time that's a good question I mean if

3679
02:24:43,559 --> 02:24:47,559
you had to choose a breeder where you

3680
02:24:45,318 --> 02:24:50,680
could choose any of their work to

3681
02:24:47,559 --> 02:24:52,079
restart your own breeding processes like

3682
02:24:50,680 --> 02:24:54,159
let's go about it that way because that

3683
02:24:52,079 --> 02:24:56,719
might help narrow it down a little bit

3684
02:24:54,159 --> 02:24:59,318
for your specific

3685
02:24:56,719 --> 02:25:02,119
scenario so thinking about that I would

3686
02:24:59,318 --> 02:25:04,079
probably go with one of the Breeders

3687
02:25:02,120 --> 02:25:07,160
that have been working on the same line

3688
02:25:04,079 --> 02:25:08,719
for a very long time so I forget which

3689
02:25:07,159 --> 02:25:11,559
interview we were talking about this but

3690
02:25:08,719 --> 02:25:13,478
we touched on the fact that all these

3691
02:25:11,559 --> 02:25:15,278
like even even these kind of higher end

3692
02:25:13,478 --> 02:25:16,639
companies like exotic genetics I like

3693
02:25:15,279 --> 02:25:20,520
the stuff that I've grown from them you

3694
02:25:16,639 --> 02:25:22,398
know I've grown maybe five seven under

3695
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:24,520
10 strains from them so I I've had a

3696
02:25:22,398 --> 02:25:26,639
variety of stuff and everything is has

3697
02:25:24,520 --> 02:25:28,640
been interesting or you know something

3698
02:25:26,639 --> 02:25:31,398
that was at least worth keeping around

3699
02:25:28,639 --> 02:25:32,799
for a couple runs you know so um they

3700
02:25:31,398 --> 02:25:34,959
have some really good stuff but that

3701
02:25:32,799 --> 02:25:37,719
being said every single year they have

3702
02:25:34,959 --> 02:25:39,719
like a new line of seeds and when you

3703
02:25:37,719 --> 02:25:42,438
think about it those are probably just

3704
02:25:39,719 --> 02:25:46,079
all f1s you know like they don't really

3705
02:25:42,439 --> 02:25:47,760
talk about their you know their breeding

3706
02:25:46,079 --> 02:25:49,959
process with it or anything like that

3707
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:51,840
but chances are those are just your

3708
02:25:49,959 --> 02:25:53,879
initi Crossing of of that plan so

3709
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:55,760
they're not stabilized so if I were to

3710
02:25:53,879 --> 02:25:58,478
start over again I would probably go

3711
02:25:55,760 --> 02:26:00,559
with a company um that's been working

3712
02:25:58,478 --> 02:26:02,000
with the same lines for years and years

3713
02:26:00,559 --> 02:26:03,879
so you're you're more likely to get

3714
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:06,680
something that's probably like an F4 or

3715
02:26:03,879 --> 02:26:08,759
something you know so uh Brothers Grim

3716
02:26:06,680 --> 02:26:10,760
is one that I grew out um that I really

3717
02:26:08,760 --> 02:26:11,880
liked you know the c99 I think we talked

3718
02:26:10,760 --> 02:26:14,318
about that earlier with me thinking it

3719
02:26:11,879 --> 02:26:17,199
was the most hucog genic strain that's

3720
02:26:14,318 --> 02:26:19,680
not exactly true but um you know they've

3721
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:22,120
been growing c99 and there that's got

3722
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:23,479
its own history behind it and if I were

3723
02:26:22,120 --> 02:26:24,880
to say what I learned from it you know I

3724
02:26:23,478 --> 02:26:28,119
might tell it incorrectly cuz it's not

3725
02:26:24,879 --> 02:26:31,039
my history to tell um but you know

3726
02:26:28,120 --> 02:26:32,200
another one that I just recently got and

3727
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:33,880
uh who knows when I'm going to be able

3728
02:26:32,200 --> 02:26:37,359
to get to these seeds but I I got some

3729
02:26:33,879 --> 02:26:39,318
Black Widow from Mr Nice you know and um

3730
02:26:37,359 --> 02:26:41,760
for our viewers who know cannabis

3731
02:26:39,318 --> 02:26:43,519
history you know that's the the main

3732
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:45,719
breeder responsible for White Widow you

3733
02:26:43,520 --> 02:26:47,800
know it was it was a team up um for

3734
02:26:45,719 --> 02:26:49,398
greenhouse back in the day and you know

3735
02:26:47,799 --> 02:26:51,119
they they they split ways you know and

3736
02:26:49,398 --> 02:26:53,159
he was able to keep his his breeding

3737
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:55,560
stock but he had to leave behind the

3738
02:26:53,159 --> 02:26:58,760
name of White Widow and that you know he

3739
02:26:55,559 --> 02:27:00,840
basically re redubbed it black Widow so

3740
02:26:58,760 --> 02:27:03,639
um they still offer Black Widow seeds

3741
02:27:00,840 --> 02:27:06,559
you know and um so actually I bought two

3742
02:27:03,639 --> 02:27:09,599
packs I think was during uh Black Friday

3743
02:27:06,559 --> 02:27:11,680
so I got 60 seeds so one of these days

3744
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:14,520
I'm going to do a legit Black Widow run

3745
02:27:11,680 --> 02:27:16,960
and um see if I can find something very

3746
02:27:14,520 --> 02:27:19,279
interesting from that but so just a kind

3747
02:27:16,959 --> 02:27:21,159
of I I've said a lot of things but

3748
02:27:19,279 --> 02:27:22,640
really I I would find one of those

3749
02:27:21,159 --> 02:27:24,520
companies that have been around for

3750
02:27:22,639 --> 02:27:26,439
years and years and years and have

3751
02:27:24,520 --> 02:27:28,279
worked with some of the same strains so

3752
02:27:26,439 --> 02:27:30,279
you know that chances are is probably

3753
02:27:28,279 --> 02:27:32,079
going to be um stable because there's

3754
02:27:30,279 --> 02:27:33,520
there's so many f1s out there I mean I'm

3755
02:27:32,079 --> 02:27:36,359
I'm guilty of it too everything on my

3756
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:38,319
site's an F1 um and I mean we we got

3757
02:27:36,359 --> 02:27:40,318
into a little bit of of why I only have

3758
02:27:38,318 --> 02:27:42,318
f1s right now um and that's not going to

3759
02:27:40,318 --> 02:27:45,039
be forever I don't want to Forever have

3760
02:27:42,318 --> 02:27:46,478
just f1s but um I feel like you're going

3761
02:27:45,040 --> 02:27:47,680
to have a lot more stability with

3762
02:27:46,478 --> 02:27:49,799
someone that's been working on those

3763
02:27:47,680 --> 02:27:51,920
strains for years versus just the flavor

3764
02:27:49,799 --> 02:27:53,239
of the week

3765
02:27:51,920 --> 02:27:55,239
I agree with that wholeheartedly it

3766
02:27:53,239 --> 02:27:57,760
makes me think of um someone else we've

3767
02:27:55,239 --> 02:27:59,920
talked about before in the show uh skunk

3768
02:27:57,760 --> 02:28:03,159
Master Flex of skunk house genetics

3769
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:05,680
where he has his um LaRog and I think

3770
02:28:03,159 --> 02:28:08,200
it's taken all the way to almost I think

3771
02:28:05,680 --> 02:28:10,680
last I've heard it was like an F9 or F10

3772
02:28:08,200 --> 02:28:14,720
generation so you know just really

3773
02:28:10,680 --> 02:28:16,359
intense OG uh dominant turpine and

3774
02:28:14,719 --> 02:28:18,199
structure profiles that he then bred

3775
02:28:16,359 --> 02:28:21,840
into all the different Burger strains

3776
02:28:18,200 --> 02:28:24,279
like the Donnie Burger the um GMO or not

3777
02:28:21,840 --> 02:28:27,880
the sorry he readed it with GMO I think

3778
02:28:24,279 --> 02:28:29,840
to get like Donnie burger and um Han

3779
02:28:27,879 --> 02:28:31,879
Solo burger and triple burger and hash

3780
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:34,279
burger and all these different Burger

3781
02:28:31,879 --> 02:28:37,278
strains where it's like just intense

3782
02:28:34,279 --> 02:28:40,520
Savory notes uh that you would find

3783
02:28:37,279 --> 02:28:43,920
within GMO or OG or different things

3784
02:28:40,520 --> 02:28:45,319
like that so I could I totally can say

3785
02:28:43,920 --> 02:28:46,879
that that would be something I would

3786
02:28:45,318 --> 02:28:49,000
probably do as well if it were something

3787
02:28:46,879 --> 02:28:52,438
where I needed to then take those

3788
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:55,079
genetics and continue to breed with them

3789
02:28:52,439 --> 02:28:57,439
for whether it be medicine or effect or

3790
02:28:55,079 --> 02:28:59,159
structure something like that it would

3791
02:28:57,439 --> 02:29:01,439
make a lot of sense to choose something

3792
02:28:59,159 --> 02:29:04,119
that's already been worked well down the

3793
02:29:01,439 --> 02:29:06,159
fial generation yeah I mean because

3794
02:29:04,120 --> 02:29:09,200
think about everything now too like F1

3795
02:29:06,159 --> 02:29:12,559
after F1 after F1 after F1 and you know

3796
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:14,680
it just I mean you you've probably run

3797
02:29:12,559 --> 02:29:17,760
into the same thing but I've grown so

3798
02:29:14,680 --> 02:29:20,239
many different strains from seeds and a

3799
02:29:17,760 --> 02:29:22,559
lot of the seeds um a lot of the strains

3800
02:29:20,239 --> 02:29:24,680
will have a A hermy or two in them you

3801
02:29:22,559 --> 02:29:26,199
know and it's just it's one of those

3802
02:29:24,680 --> 02:29:27,840
things about modern cannabis and it's

3803
02:29:26,200 --> 02:29:30,120
because we've been mixing so many

3804
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:32,398
different things and not really giving

3805
02:29:30,120 --> 02:29:35,720
us a chance to work with it and try to

3806
02:29:32,398 --> 02:29:37,639
remove some of those you know um I I

3807
02:29:35,719 --> 02:29:41,719
guess you could say bad jeans from you

3808
02:29:37,639 --> 02:29:43,719
know um the the Jean Pool so I mean so I

3809
02:29:41,719 --> 02:29:46,679
mean I I've learned a hell of a lot

3810
02:29:43,719 --> 02:29:48,679
since my my first couple lines too and I

3811
02:29:46,680 --> 02:29:50,479
mean really the direction I was headed

3812
02:29:48,680 --> 02:29:52,960
in with making those you know those

3813
02:29:50,478 --> 02:29:54,519
lines where I plan on working with those

3814
02:29:52,959 --> 02:29:57,639
combinations those those new strains

3815
02:29:54,520 --> 02:29:59,760
that I've made you know um in the future

3816
02:29:57,639 --> 02:30:01,920
you know that's the right direction but

3817
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:04,398
you know I I want to narrow down and

3818
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:05,799
make sure that I can stabilize you know

3819
02:30:04,398 --> 02:30:07,519
some of these things that I've created

3820
02:30:05,799 --> 02:30:09,438
so um that's definitely going to be a

3821
02:30:07,520 --> 02:30:10,600
gold mine but right now we're just I'm

3822
02:30:09,439 --> 02:30:12,840
stuck in the middle of this tissue

3823
02:30:10,600 --> 02:30:15,800
culture stuff and uh I'm even

3824
02:30:12,840 --> 02:30:17,239
considering um once I have completely

3825
02:30:15,799 --> 02:30:19,079
you know reverted the genetics back

3826
02:30:17,239 --> 02:30:20,119
through tissue culture and I've tested

3827
02:30:19,079 --> 02:30:22,879
them again make sure that they're

3828
02:30:20,120 --> 02:30:24,800
completely clean of viroids and fungal

3829
02:30:22,879 --> 02:30:27,559
infections and everything um I'm

3830
02:30:24,799 --> 02:30:30,398
considering probably doing some clone uh

3831
02:30:27,559 --> 02:30:31,600
offerings um we didn't even get a chance

3832
02:30:30,398 --> 02:30:34,039
to talk about it I know we've probably

3833
02:30:31,600 --> 02:30:36,000
talked about in other shows but another

3834
02:30:34,040 --> 02:30:37,840
very um appealing aspect of tissue

3835
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:40,120
culture is the fact that you can store

3836
02:30:37,840 --> 02:30:42,079
genetics on a shelf for months and

3837
02:30:40,120 --> 02:30:43,880
months at a time you know and not only

3838
02:30:42,079 --> 02:30:45,159
does it take up very little space

3839
02:30:43,879 --> 02:30:46,679
compared to a mother plant but you don't

3840
02:30:45,159 --> 02:30:48,559
have to worry about feeding and watering

3841
02:30:46,680 --> 02:30:50,520
it like it's just chilling in the

3842
02:30:48,559 --> 02:30:52,398
container you know so

3843
02:30:50,520 --> 02:30:54,520
um the fact that you can kind of store

3844
02:30:52,398 --> 02:30:55,760
genetics and have an actual Library

3845
02:30:54,520 --> 02:30:57,079
where it's on the shelf and you can pull

3846
02:30:55,760 --> 02:30:59,079
it out like you're checking out a book

3847
02:30:57,079 --> 02:31:01,760
and you know like I think that's really

3848
02:30:59,079 --> 02:31:04,520
awesome so it's a huge tool for a

3849
02:31:01,760 --> 02:31:06,960
breeder yeah yeah absolutely I mean so I

3850
02:31:04,520 --> 02:31:08,439
I think um my future is going to be you

3851
02:31:06,959 --> 02:31:11,438
know probably some limited clone

3852
02:31:08,439 --> 02:31:14,000
offerings and then getting back to uh I

3853
02:31:11,439 --> 02:31:16,239
probably want to do another F1 um line

3854
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:18,159
or two just so I can do some feminized

3855
02:31:16,239 --> 02:31:20,079
seeds um because that's another thing

3856
02:31:18,159 --> 02:31:21,478
that people ask you know is they're

3857
02:31:20,079 --> 02:31:23,840
either really excited that I have only

3858
02:31:21,478 --> 02:31:25,398
regular seeds or they're very bummed I

3859
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:27,760
don't have any you know feminized ones

3860
02:31:25,398 --> 02:31:29,478
so right I might do some feminized runs

3861
02:31:27,760 --> 02:31:33,079
but I really want to start drilling down

3862
02:31:29,478 --> 02:31:35,438
on those f1s I made awesome man well you

3863
02:31:33,079 --> 02:31:37,559
know I'm I'm sure like myself included

3864
02:31:35,439 --> 02:31:40,398
the community can't wait to see what

3865
02:31:37,559 --> 02:31:42,719
continues for Cosmic strains and uh how

3866
02:31:40,398 --> 02:31:45,719
your breeding Journey continues and your

3867
02:31:42,719 --> 02:31:47,959
tissue culture Journey continues and um

3868
02:31:45,719 --> 02:31:50,318
hopefully we can in the future then do

3869
02:31:47,959 --> 02:31:52,839
another episode where we can touch on

3870
02:31:50,318 --> 02:31:55,398
where you're at then uh compared to

3871
02:31:52,840 --> 02:31:59,000
where you are at now and and kind of see

3872
02:31:55,398 --> 02:32:01,039
how your continued breeding Journey

3873
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:02,840
develops yeah I think it' be interesting

3874
02:32:01,040 --> 02:32:05,240
especially if I'm able to pull off

3875
02:32:02,840 --> 02:32:08,639
hydroponics in the tent you know um that

3876
02:32:05,239 --> 02:32:11,039
we can do another way you grow and um I

3877
02:32:08,639 --> 02:32:12,599
can you know hopefully bring back some

3878
02:32:11,040 --> 02:32:15,040
of the growing pains I had through that

3879
02:32:12,600 --> 02:32:16,760
process you know so absolutely you know

3880
02:32:15,040 --> 02:32:18,600
I'm I'm hard-headed if nothing you know

3881
02:32:16,760 --> 02:32:21,239
and I'll I'll keep bang my head against

3882
02:32:18,600 --> 02:32:22,920
the wall until I figure it out you know

3883
02:32:21,239 --> 02:32:24,600
well with that perseverance you're going

3884
02:32:22,920 --> 02:32:26,200
to provide a lot of information for the

3885
02:32:24,600 --> 02:32:29,200
community that's going to be value for a

3886
02:32:26,200 --> 02:32:31,640
bunch of other grow Growers so you know

3887
02:32:29,200 --> 02:32:34,159
Cosmic thank you so much for joining me

3888
02:32:31,639 --> 02:32:37,079
today and I really appreciate your time

3889
02:32:34,159 --> 02:32:38,478
and and telling your story um I really

3890
02:32:37,079 --> 02:32:40,639
think that it'll help a lot of other

3891
02:32:38,478 --> 02:32:42,639
people look at what they're doing not

3892
02:32:40,639 --> 02:32:44,680
only within cannabis but outside of

3893
02:32:42,639 --> 02:32:47,159
cannabis and and think is is this

3894
02:32:44,680 --> 02:32:50,000
something that I want to do because the

3895
02:32:47,159 --> 02:32:52,478
next journey is literally just you

3896
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:54,920
taking the incentive to start it

3897
02:32:52,478 --> 02:32:56,679
yourself you know and just taking things

3898
02:32:54,920 --> 02:32:58,520
one step at a time you know don't look

3899
02:32:56,680 --> 02:33:00,079
at sometimes you can't look at the big

3900
02:32:58,520 --> 02:33:03,399
picture you just have to look at your

3901
02:33:00,079 --> 02:33:04,840
immediate goals and you know cuz it's a

3902
02:33:03,398 --> 02:33:06,799
marathon you know it's not something you

3903
02:33:04,840 --> 02:33:08,559
can just Sprint and finish you know you

3904
02:33:06,799 --> 02:33:10,398
have to really just continuously work at

3905
02:33:08,559 --> 02:33:13,000
it so I mean that applies a lot of

3906
02:33:10,398 --> 02:33:14,559
things in life you know y absolutely

3907
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:16,040
well again thank you so much and uh

3908
02:33:14,559 --> 02:33:17,318
we'll talk to you soon yeah thank you

3921
02:33:40,239 --> 02:33:43,799
too you know so maybe I'll will

3922
02:33:41,719 --> 02:33:45,799
eventually I'll do your job as the host

3923
02:33:43,799 --> 02:33:47,000
and we can hear about your journey you

3924
02:33:45,799 --> 02:33:48,559
know cuz I'm I'm sure a lot of people

3925
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:50,840
are going to want to learn about you

3926
02:33:48,559 --> 02:33:53,680
know D you were a chef and now you're

3927
02:33:50,840 --> 02:33:55,398
like a commercial grower like that's

3928
02:33:53,680 --> 02:33:56,960
from one like that's you know that's

3929
02:33:55,398 --> 02:33:57,959
that's crazy that's a cool journey and

3930
02:33:56,959 --> 02:34:00,079
I'm sure a lot of us are going to want

3931
02:33:57,959 --> 02:34:02,119
to hear that well we'll save that story

3932
02:34:00,079 --> 02:34:05,000
for another day but uh until then you

3933
02:34:02,120 --> 02:34:07,000
know uh we'll just keep on working on

3934
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:09,520
building the community up because that's

3935
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:12,520
the way we grow all right thanks
