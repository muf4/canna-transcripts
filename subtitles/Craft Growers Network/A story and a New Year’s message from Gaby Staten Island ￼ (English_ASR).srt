00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,480
what's up this is Gabby Staten Island

2
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:05,160
here on the craft Growers Network and I

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,240
wanted to take this opportunity to share

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,280
a little bit of my story and thoughts

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,440
for the new year this is something until

6
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:14,759
now only friends of mine knew about in

7
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:16,640
2017 Soma County was ravaged by a

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,278
terrible fire at the time my daughter

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,518
Lily was 3 weeks old my fianceé Leah had

10
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,920
postpartum preclampsia which is quite

11
00:00:21,518 --> 00:00:26,759
dangerous the police pounded on our door

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,320
at 2 a.m. telling us we needed to leave

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,279
we left with nothing but a diaper bag we

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:35,119
left cash pounds of flour my entire

15
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,320
collection of seeds I had made and saved

16
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:40,558
and all of our belongings I left with

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,719
slippers no shoes I even left my wallet

18
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,959
we thought we were leaving as a

19
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,960
precaution but we didn't believe our

20
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,600
house would burn down and we would lose

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,679
everything which we did we got a hotel

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,239
with a help from someone in line at a

23
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:56,198
hotel because we had no cash or a wallet

24
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,320
that morning we awoke to the reality

25
00:00:56,198 --> 00:01:01,640
that we had lost everything I'll never

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,320
forget that day Ben from IC Collective

27
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:07,079
sent someone over to our hotel with a

28
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:09,640
giant bag of weed rosin a dab rig and a

29
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,840
torch our landlord put us up in his home

30
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,239
and he moved out into his mother's so we

31
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,280
could have a place to live and all of

32
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:19,839
our friends and family showed love and

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,920
support they brought us food and so much

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,520
clothes was donated to us since we

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,879
literally left with the clothes on our

36
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,239
back is one of the worst things that

37
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:30,560
ever happened to me but in this terrible

38
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:33,078
time I saw how much we were really loved

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,280
by our friends and family and it

40
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:38,719
continued to give us strength to

41
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,560
continue on 2 years later tragedy hit us

42
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,000
again my grow shop burned to the ground

43
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,000
because of a faulty plug that had

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,519
nothing plugged into it besides a Wi-Fi

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,118
router fires got us again then Co hit

46
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,438
the accumulation of all these events

47
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,959
spun me into a deep depression it was a

48
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:58,758
very dark time for me I remember

49
00:01:55,959 --> 00:02:00,959
sleeping in my Dusty dirty van one night

50
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,239
because Le and I were fighting W ing it

51
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,919
was really cold I had no blankets and I

52
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:08,439
was truly wishing I was dead but I knew

53
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,959
I couldn't leave my family like this I

54
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:13,800
pushed on started working at commercial

55
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,120
Farms as cultivation director and it was

56
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,319
the first time I had a job in a while

57
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,000
but I was just lucky to have an income

58
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,839
so I could support my family I was still

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,959
suffering from depression and did not

60
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,319
know how to relieve it I think it was

61
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,239
2021 that LE and I went to a concert at

62
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:33,159
the Mystic Theater in Petaluma that

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,080
concert saved my life from a life of

64
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:37,680
depression the artist was Mike love his

65
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,719
music was beautiful and his message was

66
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,560
so powerful there was this one song

67
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:45,680

so now to more current times I was

109
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:37,240
invited to a group on Reddit by Cosmic

110
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,199
who's now a regular co-host on the

111
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,439

112
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,800
including wolf who's also a co-host on

115
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,120
we talk Cosmic he's the one that

116
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,120
encouraged me to just make the first

117
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,840
podcast he offered to help and he he

118
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,519
recorded it for me on Zoom he also

119
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,719
taught himself to do meisam tissue

120
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,159
culture and has inspired me to restart

121
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,400
my tissue culture education you can find

122
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,680
him at Cosmic strains official on

123
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:10,038
Instagram wolf he reminds me of NATO dog

124
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,959
in all the best ways he's softs spoken

125
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:13,918
and so intelligent he's been growing for

126
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:15,719
four years but has been so immersed in

127
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,599
education I believe he's more

128
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,160
knowledgeable than many people growing

129
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,240
for decades I'm learning from him every

130
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,960
day but most important he's been a great

131
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,840
friend that I can lean on and ask advice

132

166
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,120
I believe I will have longlasting

167
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,639
friendships with them I can only assume

168
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,240
you can tell how much my friendships

169
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:07,759
mean to me finally our

170
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,439
viewers when I made this podcast I told

171
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,680
people I didn't care if anyone enjoyed

172
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:14,639
the podcast I told them I was doing it

173
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,680
for myself but I never thought about how

174
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,160
much I'd appreciate it if it was enjoyed

175
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,038
by viewers finally our viewers when I

176
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,199
made this podcast I told people I didn't

177
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,439
care if anyone enjoyed this podcast I

178
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,840
told them I was doing it for myself but

179
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,839
I never thought about how much I'd

180
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:30,159
appreciate it if it was enjoyed by

181
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:31,719
viewers

182
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,680
if you told me two months ago when we

183
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,360
started this that all of our videos

184
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,199
would get thousands of views right out

185
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,919
of the gate and there would be no hate

186
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,120
in the comments and nothing but

187
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:43,758
positivity and love I wouldn't believe

188
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,360
you I'm grateful for you all the

189
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,520
positive responses encouraged me to

190
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,280
continue to build this network into the

191
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:53,799
best we can I know I've gone on for a

192
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:55,478
long time but hey my name is Gabby I

193
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,680
just want to end it by saying if you're

194
00:07:55,478 --> 00:07:59,519

195
