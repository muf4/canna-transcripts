00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:11,759
hello and welcome to another episode of

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,879
The Way We Grow podcast I am your host

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:18,160
Nick wolf my co-hosts today are Gabby

4
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:20,600
Staten Island and Cosmic Our Guest today

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,518
is Jesse with Mothership Labs where they

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,160
specialize in tissue culture breeding

7
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,799
compliant Sops and training their

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,599
mission is to support the Cannabis

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,320
industry through science technology

10
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,359
while still aiming to preserve the

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,079
culture and genetics that started it all

12
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:37,960
uh so Jesse welcome to the show how are

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,320
you doing

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,239
today I doing great thank you for having

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,000
me on today this is uh checking out the

16
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:48,119
show it's excited about what you guys

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,359
are doing and uh glad to be a part of it

18
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:51,878
for sure well we were uh talking a

19
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:53,558
little bit before the show and you were

20
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:55,079
kind of explaining a few of the

21
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:57,198
different things that you have going on

22
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,518
currently so you know I think one of the

23
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,920
first thing our viewers are going to

24
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:03,878
notice and uh to any of the listeners

25
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,079
out there check us out on YouTube but uh

26
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:07,519
you have a huge amount of plants sitting

27
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,519
behind you so why don't you talk a

28
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:11,719
little bit about um like what what

29
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:14,840
you're doing today and what's uh new in

30
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:17,118
your grow world yeah so I'm uh down in

31
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,600
Florida right now um working with the

32
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:22,920
company they do a lot of ornamentals and

33
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:27,719
all kinds of different plants so this is

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:30,280
their TC lab they produce a crazy amount

35
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,118
um and what we're trying to do is help

36
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,799
you know build a system to where you

37
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:36,560
could benefit breeders

38
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:40,159
cultivators have stock of just

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,719
disease-free plants um and kind of build

40
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,479
a new model essentially so hope we'll be

41
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:48,200
able to tell you more about that as it

42
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:52,118
develops but um a lot of good people

43
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,960
fantastic Growers um and kind of

44
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:56,560
shifting into being able to help

45
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:59,639
preserve and provide at a a much larger

46
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,799
scale so uh definitely been traveling a

47
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,718
lot I was just in Michigan too and uh

48
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,640
thankfully I'm in Florida so I'm humid

49
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,799
again but um yeah it's pretty cool to

50
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,800
see like so many so many plants and the

51
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,920
management and everything the operations

52
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:18,040
behind it it is a ton of tissue culture

53
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:19,639
here so for sure it definitely looks

54
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:22,079
like it and I think you were saying that

55
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:24,639
this facility alone produces over 5

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:29,519
million unique xplants per

57
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:32,119
year I I believe so and they do I mean

58
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:35,159
have like 200 Acres huge

59
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,920
facilities um a lot of different plants

60
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:39,799
nursery and that's kind of what I see

61
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,598
you know in the future that at least in

62
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,360
some areas um starting with genetic

63
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:48,679
stock and professional breeding um kind

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,159
of evolving into that area so yeah lots

65
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,040
of lots of plants here um so it's

66
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:57,318
exciting to see things at a a large

67
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:59,280
scale and what it what it could be um

68
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:03,598
big part of our goal is like how does

69
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:06,919
that apply to the industry and um how

70
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,959
can we kind of shape that so it benefits

71
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:11,238
Growers and breeders that that kind of

72
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,959
started this and have been you know

73
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:16,000
doing this for a long time you

74
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:17,640
know yeah I feel like that's really

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,598
important it seems like there are a lot

76
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:24,439
of breeders um from yester year uh to

77
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:26,719
use a term that still don't have access

78
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:29,158
to tissue culture or different lab

79
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,359
testings that would help them make

80
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:34,280
either more educated breeding um

81
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,840
practices or decisions as well as also

82
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:40,519
just being able to preserve a bunch more

83
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,759
genetics at a lower cost considering um

84
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:45,319
costs aren't going down when it comes to

85
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:46,878
overhead in the Cannabis industry uh

86
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:48,759
where tissue culture though as an

87
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,840
investment could definitely lower your

88
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:52,359
overhead when it comes to even even just

89
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,039
something as simple as maintaining a

90
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,959
large stock

91
00:03:54,039 --> 00:04:01,039
population absolutely yep uh and why we

92
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,840
came out as tissue culture and try to at

93
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,000
least educate and help support that side

94
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,039
is

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,840
um i' I've been growing in around

96
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,519
cannabis since I was like 10 years old I

97
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,920
think growing up in

98
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,680
Kentucky I started there and then went

99
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:20,879
to commercial operations and then to

100
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,639
biotech and then back to cannabis so I

101
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:25,360
had had that mentality like I I'm not

102
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,478
sending my breeding lines to somebody

103
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,000
else in a lab you know sure um so that's

104
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:33,560
kind of how it started is like teach

105
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,399
people how to do it and make it easier

106
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,038
better more affordable um and then we

107
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,918
can start trading and do a lot more

108
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:44,079
business that way like I can send stuff

109
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:46,599
to your lab we can you know trade

110
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:49,800
phenotypes for breeding and and compound

111
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:52,400
that kind of success um absolutely

112
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,199
collaboration for the win collaboration

113
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,319
man yeah yeah so front facing it's

114
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,120
tissue culture that we see huge need in

115
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:02,240
the market for that we do a lot of uh

116
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,079
you know molecular breeding and

117
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:09,639
operation stuff and um just trying to

118
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:11,918
support where we saw the needs um for

119
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:16,400
cultivators in the market you know and

120
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:17,799
just build off that you know for sure um

121
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,519
well you know you kind of already

122
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,840
touched on it a little bit but let's

123
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,680
take it back a little bit and talk about

124
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,239
your first experience with growing

125
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,199
plants in general what got you into

126
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,038
wanting to pursue a career or a life

127
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,800
path in Plants um I mean it sounded like

128
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:36,038
you did cannabis pretty darn early but

129
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,560
where was there anything that kind of

130
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:41,279
piqu your interests earlier than

131
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,839
that uh I feel it's always somebody's

132
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,839
older brother you

133
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:49,638
know that uh makes the introduction I

134
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:53,079
think that's what it was and just being

135
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:56,439
young I was like this seems cool and uh

136
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:58,519
being a part of that group know and I

137
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,839
wasn't like smoking a bunch of weed that

138
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:03,120
that young I I tried it that just being

139
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:07,038
around the plants is what interested me

140
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,560
so um Kentucky there the culture there

141
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:11,199
for cannabis has been going on for a

142
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,759
long time I mean there's people in the

143
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,960
mountains that have been just

144
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:17,199
generations of Growers there like that's

145
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,079
that's what they do that's what they

146
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,840
have been doing um so it's definitely

147
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,879
been around for a long time there and as

148
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:27,239
I got older I think I was looking more

149
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:30,639
in the scientific side of things that I

150
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:34,000
wanted to I was just did like how does

151
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:37,560
the world work and how does this plant

152
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,680
work um at the time it was like a cool

153
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,800
plant that I could attach science to you

154
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,720
know in school it's like corn and wheat

155
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,918
I was like I don't care about corn and

156
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,319
wheat other than eating it um so I think

157
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:52,038
that's what did I was like this is I

158
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:56,080
could be cool and learn science behind

159
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:59,038
weed I got started it out um you know

160
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:01,000
growing up as I got older my father

161
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,360
ended up getting neurological disease

162
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,079
and things like that at the same time

163
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,560
that you started getting indications

164
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:10,318
that cannabis can help you know

165
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,280
Alzheimer's and all these other Theses

166
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:16,639
so that stuck with me early on and where

167
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:20,878
I wanted to continue pursuing the uh the

168
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:23,319
plant and the research side so um a lot

169
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,639
of stuff in between there you know

170
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:28,479
getting older and and going through you

171
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:32,478
know high school and everything else but

172
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:35,318
um then friends started getting cancer

173
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:39,839
or disease that it could potentially

174
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:42,720
help help cure or alleviate you know so

175
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,198
um outside of you know growing around

176
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:49,080
the country and doing you know doing

177
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,680
everything on tour we'll say um I was

178
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:52,639
like I have to learn how to grow it I

179
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,079
have to learn how to manage operations I

180
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,038
have to learn how to breed and then

181
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:00,158
after learn the science and that's kind

182
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:02,360
of where I started so I started learning

183
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:05,959
how to grow from um you know older

184
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:08,639
brothers and everyone else uh in those

185
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:11,000
communities um and then moved out to

186
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,038
Colorado that's where I wanted to you

187
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,879
know be like okay this is a professional

188
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:18,639
environment now um and started there as

189
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,400
a trimmer actually how old were you when

190
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,840
you moved out to

191
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:27,719
Colorado uh do seen that long ago it was

192
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:30,158
2014 so I think I was like

193
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,879
28 I want to say

194
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:36,679
wow that's crazy to think about um and

195
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:39,479
at the time because I was I was like you

196
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:41,359
know hustling doing everything else and

197
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,360
just being in that that side of the

198
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,399
industry to get an apartment I had to

199
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,800
get a job and show everything on paper

200
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,720
and I was like oh man so I I moved here

201
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:56,319
and was delivering pizzas uh to start

202
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,360
out and I was like whatever it takes um

203
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,360
so I was highly motivated like I got to

204
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,519
make change in my life to to pursue this

205
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,800
stuff right um a lot of good people in

206
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,519
my life supported me down that road and

207
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:12,159
so deliver you know going from that

208
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:14,919
world to you know dropping a a large

209
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:19,838
pepperoni off for like a $2 tip was just

210
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:21,519
crazy I like whatever I'll do it then um

211
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,399
like I'll take it man like this is what

212
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:27,159
we got to do so uh how long had you been

213
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,799
growing before you moved to

214
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:31,639
Colorado you know when it starting 10

215
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:34,199
you know I did grow here and there and

216
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:39,559
play around with it um I think getting

217
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:42,000
serious with it I was closer to 16 17

218
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:44,559
where I was like I'm going to grow weed

219
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,759
um and there's lot of different ways out

220
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,439
there by then indoor you know was taken

221
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:51,639
off we were just used to outdoor uh

222
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,839
Kentucky soil is

223
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:55,759
incredible um so it's really easy to

224
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,839
grow like You' flick a seed out there

225
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:00,200
and come back and there's just some

226
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,200
amazing weed um

227
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,399
but getting the indoor game we had you

228
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:08,278
know HPS lights and all that um took it

229
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,480
was like a different learning curve

230
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:12,480
right like nutrients and all these other

231
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,120
factors that I was like you can't just

232
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,639
throw it out there and it grows so

233
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,000
started getting on forums and learning

234
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:22,399
from uh other Growers that I knew and um

235
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,759
so yeah I've been growing for a long

236
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,839
time bunch of different methods you know

237
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:29,919
we had some Hydro guys in town they're

238
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:33,440
like that's awesome weed I like this one

239
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:38,240
so huge Community out there um that I

240
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,680
got to get experience in genetics and um

241
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,120
start breeding early on and and learn

242
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:46,319
some of those things before research and

243
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,679
a lot of the science behind it started

244
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,240
coming out too so um well talk a little

245
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,039
bit about some of those early growing

246
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,839
experiences and kind of where where you

247
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,599
found success and where you might have

248
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,920
had some uh trepidations that might have

249
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,240
led you away from a specific styal into

250
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:05,958
another

251
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:10,839
one yeah so Kentucky high humidity right

252
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:12,879
uh very high that end of the season um I

253
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:15,920
remember one it was those think is

254
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:18,439
Alaskan Thunder we had like under a

255
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:22,000
highway like we just let him go that one

256
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,959
lasted into December just no problem at

257
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,600
all so it was like the easy way of

258
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:30,039
growing that like I

259
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:33,278
knew um and I love outdoor the Kentucky

260
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:34,919
soil grown too was just phenomenal uh we

261
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:38,399
had some stuff up in the hills there

262
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:41,360
that was like Perfect all year round and

263
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,919
I got into the um indoor stuff and

264
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,879
that's where I was like I don't know if

265
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:47,639
I like this at all just way too much

266
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:49,879
management and measuring nut you know

267
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,680
chemical fertilizers and all that stuff

268
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:53,720
just produce a different product I was

269
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:57,199
unfamiliar with so I didn't know how to

270
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:59,519
do it that you know starting out um but

271
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,240
really when I started talking to like

272
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,278
older Growers that had been doing it a

273
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,720
long time and learned that I could grow

274
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:09,759
some like really really good weed just

275
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,639
follow what they're doing uh that's when

276
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,240
I started enjoying it a lot more you

277
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:16,680
know because you're growing bad weed

278
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,519
it's just it's not fun so yeah getting

279
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:21,319
over that hump I guess um and there's

280
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,759
you know few different people there wer

281
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,199
hu huge grows um I was growing up around

282
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:29,838
Lexington so you have outskirts of town

283
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:32,958
and some of those areas that were um

284
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:36,040
easy to set up you know some basement or

285
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:38,719
and then we had Farmland away from the

286
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:42,399
city that we could go out to um grow a

287
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,000
lot more so I think the genetics there

288
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,839
was the most exciting part at least

289
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,639
looking back um a lot of old school

290
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:52,760
stuff I haven't seen in forever but the

291
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:55,399
stuff the the uh generational Farmers

292
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:58,799
had didn't really have names for it was

293
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:01,198
the best um you're thinking selecting

294
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,519
over years and years of this they you

295
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:05,479
know some of these have resistances to

296
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,839
that high humidity you know buritis and

297
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,920
stuff like that um that grow just

298
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:12,959
incredibly well in those

299
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:14,639
areas and that's how they fed their

300
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:18,239
families you know and that's how I was

301
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:21,639
taught like this is part of our family's

302
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,159
Heritage and how we're going to survive

303
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:26,799
um so that was kind of beating into my

304
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:28,919
head early on it's like just don't mess

305
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:29,759
with people's genetics don't mess with

306
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:31,278
them

307
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,600
you know everybody had their their main

308
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:38,799
cash crop that was you know a Northern

309
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:40,959
Lights cross over here or and product

310
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,439
was just traded like I want some of that

311
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,838
I'll give you some of my Northern Lights

312
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,920
and you know afghanis came in um and

313
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,920
then hybrids and I think that's what got

314
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:53,838
me on breeding and um trying to learn

315
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:55,679
more about it because it's hard to

316
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,279
identify new genetics when you didn't

317
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:01,479
know that world existed like everything

318
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:03,639
is weed uh at some point and then

319
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,639
somebody brings you something special

320
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:09,079
like what is this like where did it come

321
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:11,079
from yeah um when you first found that

322
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:13,198
super special weed since you were kind

323
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:15,239
of already plugged into the growing

324
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,758
community in the area did you

325
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,240
immediately kind of go oh man how are

326
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,639
they growing it I want to learn how to

327
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,560
do that uh because this stuff is the

328
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:26,240
best and what was what were some of

329
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:28,518
those uh like methods that you saw that

330
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,320
people were doing that in your opinion

331
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:32,320
produced the best bud when you were

332
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,639
first finding some of that stuff that

333
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,839
you thought were you know levels above

334
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,879
the other

335
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:43,399
stuff um it was this soil grown um at

336
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:45,240
the time it wasn't like all these inputs

337
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:47,399
and knowledge behind what they do is

338
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,159
like those little tricks that these old

339
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:52,559
guys had they're like yeah just let it

340
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:55,759
sit there for a while um I think the one

341
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:59,719
method that was actually discussed see

342
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:01,800
remember subcool mixing in the uh the uh

343
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,879
little mini pools and stuff cook your

344
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:06,719
own soil started doing some of those

345
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:08,240
recipes and modifications to it and

346
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,920
that's why I was like oh man this is

347
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,879
like crazy weed um before you see a lot

348
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:17,879
of that like called Flat weed back then

349
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:20,799
like it's green tastes phenomenal

350
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:24,838
everyone loves it but in comparison like

351
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:28,240
it's is flatweed like gets the job done

352
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,040
um and you had these new mixes coming

353
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,000
out from you know some of these known

354
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:34,759
breeders and and people started catching

355
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
on I was like what is this it doesn't

356
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:41,120
even look like weed to me The Taste the

357
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,639
just everything uh was just incredible

358
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,600
so I think that's when the organic like

359
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:48,879
it was all organic at that point um the

360
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,560
weed that I was smoking and getting

361
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,600
older brothers and their friends

362
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:56,198
bringing stuff in from C it was like

363
00:15:52,600 --> 00:16:00,680
this is insane but I kind of gravitated

364
00:15:56,198 --> 00:16:04,078
towards um just those organic mixes and

365
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:07,039
um how they're keeping that soil alive

366
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:09,318
and they didn't know the microbial thing

367
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:12,759
Le everything behind it they're

368
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:15,278
fallowing a recipe too you know um so

369
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:17,399
learning that way was it was awesome was

370
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:19,600
familiar to me from growing outdoor I'm

371
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:23,120
like yes nature takes care of most of

372
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,440
that right um so it's definitely stuck

373
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,720
with me nowadays I want to go back and

374
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,920
grow more outdoor but I just got to I'm

375
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,800
grow throwing them in in tubes and stuff

376
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:38,000
right now so yeah so so then like yeah

377
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:39,958
what what translated you out of um where

378
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,839
you were focused on growing and then you

379
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:45,119
said I want to actually go more into

380
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,279
biotechnologies and find out more it

381
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,799
sounded like you were really interested

382
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:49,318
in how these plants were growing and

383
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:51,679
what was causing them to do their

384
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:54,278
different things and and and processes

385
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:57,000
so what kind of LED you into that

386
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:58,679
path uh it started because I just I was

387
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,360
growing just some flat weed right I was

388
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:03,758
like I got to make my weed

389
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,919
better uh so you know you start reading

390
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:09,279
and get into soil science and then uh

391
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:11,919
down that radit hole was I would say the

392
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:13,480
first step and then my weed started

393
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,799
competing they're like man this is

394
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,558
really good I was like science is

395
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:22,199
science is the way right and just kept

396
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:24,798
reinforcing those uh those pieces for me

397
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:27,759
and like my my dad was a researcher too

398
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:30,558
so we were um I had this scientific mind

399
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:34,519
from what I was told

400
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:36,960
and um I was in that that world of

401
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:38,918
research right I sure beat other

402
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,600
researchers when I was little and so I

403
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:45,360
had a lot of that kind of pushing me in

404
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:47,199
that direction too and I think weed

405
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:50,079
being you know in my life at the time

406
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,679
like I I could attach it to that like

407
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:54,839
I'm cool because I grow weed but I also

408
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:56,600
love science you know it was I think it

409
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:59,639
was important to me when I was in that

410
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:01,959
early stages of my life too um

411
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,799
acceptance and all the things humans go

412
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:08,679
through right right um and just continue

413
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:10,000
to follow it you know just figuring out

414
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:12,720
how things

415
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,839
work it sort of adds a legitimacy to

416
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:20,640
something that was seen as something so

417
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:23,079
um Infamous uh in terms of what a what a

418
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,559
career path could take if you wanted to

419
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:26,519
follow something where you were growing

420
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:29,519
cannabis but then you started to talk

421
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:32,839
about it in this very uh

422
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,519
more higher education scientific uh

423
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:36,079
terminologies some people would take you

424
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:38,440
a little bit more serious and you're not

425
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:41,199
the first person that I've heard say

426
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:44,320
that yeah that that's it and the I think

427
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,159
the communication it brought to you

428
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:49,639
where like you're equal right it's like

429
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:51,799
this guy grows the best weed but I know

430
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,038
some of these things and it starts

431
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:55,639
bridging that

432
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:59,079
communication and building those

433
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,440
relationships I guess um so give a

434
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:03,918
different perspective to where like I

435
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:07,558
can do all these things that still cool

436
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:11,240
and you know Associated and accepted I

437
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:13,079
guess um and we meet you know every once

438
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,480
in a while and share our experiences and

439
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:18,119
our weed and um learn more things and

440
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:21,279
start learning together you know as a

441
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:23,479
community so definitely a big influence

442
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:25,240
just learning so I come back and be like

443
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,360
check this out like look what I found

444
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,279
out how to do or uh and and started

445
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:32,240
becoming a lot more fun when I the more

446
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:34,960
I knew the more fun I had meeting up

447
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,159
with some of my friends and stuff so

448
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,600
definitely a huge

449
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:39,799
influence and if I if I did my math

450
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:42,240
correctly you said you've been doing

451
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:45,038
tissue culture for 12 years but you

452
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,200
moved out to pursue cannabis cultivation

453
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:50,119
in Colorado in 2014 so you were already

454
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,159
dabbling in tissue culture before you

455
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:54,879
moved out to Colorado is that

456
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:56,919
correct yeah so I did uh started with

457
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:01,360
mushrooms much like a lot of a lot of

458
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:03,840
other guys right um that was fun as well

459
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:06,399
and I wasn't doing like tissue culture

460
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:09,639
every day or going you know hard down

461
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,200
that rabbit hole um I came out because I

462
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,799
was still learning about weed I was like

463
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,960
I figure out how to grow this at a

464
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:18,759
commercial scale um so it kind of on the

465
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:22,360
back burner for a little while and

466
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:24,879
reintroduced um by somebody else that

467
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:28,119
just passing more knowledge you know and

468
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,440
uh motivating me to start learning more

469
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:34,639
about that just another Avenue that we

470
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:36,320
could develop tools with um learning

471
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,600
like first when I started getting into

472
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:42,158
it I was like this is just unfamiliar

473
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:45,359
it's very different from U mushroom work

474
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,360
you know and but I was pointed in the

475
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:50,199
right direction so I could start

476
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:52,639
building the knowledge base and playing

477
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,798
around I had my own equipment I've had

478
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,840
for a long time and starting to get into

479
00:20:55,798 --> 00:21:00,599
the Cannabis side it was very difficult

480
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:03,759
like this is not working at

481
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:08,158
all but is getting used to the tools and

482
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:10,000
figuring out um what's possible and

483
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,080
knowing that some of these things exist

484
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
in in the world of science and

485
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:18,480
cultivation uh maybe a better grower and

486
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,960
more motivated to learn I

487
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,798
guess but yeah it's been definitely been

488
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,360
around a long

489
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:28,200
time for sure I mean I I know that uh in

490
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:30,558
general in agriculture it's been used

491
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,840
for different fruiting trees and stuff

492
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:35,440
since around the 70s in high production

493
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:39,439
but was even dabbled in in the 30s and

494
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,480
40s um so it's got a long history almost

495
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,200
almost a century of use within

496
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,558
agriculture which is super impressive

497
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,038
for something that is still almost uh

498
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:52,079
viewed as The Cutting Edge of new

499
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:55,640
technology um in a in a blossoming

500
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:58,720
market like the Cannabis industry um oh

501
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:01,559
yeah yeah it's for hard to propagate

502
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:05,278
species right I think so with orchids

503
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:06,879
and um yeah you know coming out and

504
00:22:05,278 --> 00:22:09,159
everyone's like have you heard of tissue

505
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,480
culture it's been around for a long time

506
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:15,039
it it's hasn't been perfected I feel for

507
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,558
cannabis specifically and the

508
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:20,720
applications and um long-term storage

509
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:24,960
and all the other other stuff you can do

510
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,480
with tissue culture so that's I think

511
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,600
part of the reason for that is that

512
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,640
cannabis is not a difficult to propagate

513
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:35,119
plant and if it was if it was difficult

514
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,799
to propagate then we probably would have

515
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:40,359
gone to tissue culture much sooner but

516
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:43,119
because it's pretty easy to take clones

517
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:45,038
you know we uh we haven't done that I

518
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:47,599
have a quick question and a comment for

519
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:51,519
you first the question is are you

520
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:55,519
familiar with the grow Stores um new

521
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:57,038
Earth in Kentucky they were in New Earth

522
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:58,599
they were in mexic now they're in

523
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:01,240
Louisville

524
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:03,199
yeah yeah okay yeah so there's some they

525
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,798
go ahead I think so yeah yeah so they

526
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,360
had grow stores in the80s during green

527
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:09,119
Merchant and they still have one today

528
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:11,399
in

529
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,439
Louisville and um we're actually

530
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,919
interviewing them tomorrow on the your

531
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,200
weed stories oh that's so I was

532
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,120
wondering if you knew those guys we

533
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,640
might know some of the same people so

534
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:26,479
these they kind of like grow the hydro

535
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,320
shops and stuff there obviously that's

536
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,720
where people went to get like Fox Farm

537
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:34,200
and right you know all the supplies but

538
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,880
some of them and I haven't kept up with

539
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,240
I know some of them kind of Chang names

540
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,840
or locations because it was starting to

541
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,519
uh you know get watched a little more

542
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:44,558
and like all right what what's going on

543
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:47,000
here and I know one of them moved to

544
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:49,200
Louisville so I'm wondering if about

545
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,679
that same crew yeah man now they're

546
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,919
called one CRA

547
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,320
yeah that would be crazy yeah we're

548
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,480
interviewing them tomorrow and the the

549
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:01,599
comment that I wanted to make is is that

550
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:05,720
most people don't realize that

551
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:08,158
Kentucky and um Florida were hot beds

552
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,880
for growing Canabis you know people

553
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,440
people when they think about cannabis

554
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,159
they think about California and but you

555
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,440
know um yesterday I think Nick and I or

556
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:19,240
me and someone else were talking about

557
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:22,080
the Gainesville green famous weed from

558
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:26,120
Florida and you know so much cannabis

559
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:28,639
was grown in Kentucky as well um it was

560
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:31,558
number one export I think yeah for a

561
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,200
while oh and you know the the weed I was

562
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:37,079
used to and California had great weed

563
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:40,880
too but like some of these Kentucky boys

564
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:43,278
are crazy like how how good some of that

565
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,440
flower is man you it's

566
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:47,278
unbelievable um I could imag yeah

567
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,519
definitely they it's been around a long

568
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:51,759
time and there's places out there like

569
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:56,000
you you just don't go you know you don't

570
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:57,919
want to go out there at all um that's

571
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,759
and that's kind of how I grew up like

572
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,480
just for respecting the plant and the

573
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:04,599
people like don't mess with it you know

574
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,278
let them do their thing let them keep

575
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:08,319
their genetics and everything school

576
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:11,480
because it was a way of light like

577
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:15,678
they're feeding families and um trade

578
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:17,200
and all that for long long time um I

579
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,480
think I was lucky to get brought up in

580
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,399
that that side of the community too just

581
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:26,599
to teach me respect for for all these

582
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:29,239
things so yeah andan high quality weed

583
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:33,240
has grown in Kentucky for

584
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:35,519
sure nice yeah tell us tell us some of

585
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,399
the exciting things in your in your grow

586
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,558
world right right now about tissue

587
00:25:37,398 --> 00:25:41,359
culture like what's what have you been

588
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:43,119
developing what have you been working on

589
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:46,038
where have you found some successes and

590
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:47,918
some some failures that uh might be able

591
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:49,679
to help teach the community that's

592
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,640
looking into either starting a small

593
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,159
home tissue culture lab or even

594
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,159
commercial cultivators that may be

595
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:59,559
listening or watching this that are

596
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:02,200
looking into potentially uh sourcing uh

597
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:03,440
good tissue culture um what are some of

598
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,679
these different things that you feel

599
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,480
like uh you could shed a little bit more

600
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,759
light

601
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:13,159
on oh there's a lot there's a lot there

602
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:15,000
um so tissue culture is a extremely

603
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:20,278
powerful tool

604
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:23,200
right if used properly um the main

605
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:26,000
pieces of that that I hear or discussed

606
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,798
about right now is like genetic storage

607
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,359
uh pathogen remediation right

608
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:34,119
uh micro

609
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:35,678
propagation so what what I set out to do

610
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:39,558
was I you know I've run all the you know

611
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:42,600
Ms media dkw everything in between and

612
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:44,398
um I can you explain what dkw is and

613
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:49,959
what Ms media are for those that don't

614
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:52,278
oh y yep so um migi and skoo uh that is

615
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,120
basically these names are are the

616
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:57,640
scientists who created them for the most

617
00:26:54,119 --> 00:27:00,199
part right um they discovered that they

618
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:03,240
have all the the components to sustain

619
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:06,278
plant life in vitro in vitro meaning I

620
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:10,640
think it's Italian in glass uh so

621
00:27:06,278 --> 00:27:13,398
sustaining life in glass um essentially

622
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,440
so all the what that means is there's a

623
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:18,239
uh you have your nutrients hormones

624
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:21,080
vitamins just all these things that your

625
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,599
cells and tissue needs to survive and

626
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:26,759
and grow right in combination with light

627
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:28,879
and your your environment temperatures

628
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:32,558
uh so if you look at the different forms

629
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:35,000
of that dkw just another form is driver

630
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:37,639
kuaki uh Walnut

631
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,319
media um there's specific ones that are

632
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:43,640
formulated for tobacco and different

633
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:45,480
plants across the board uh that

634
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,240
scientists work on and develop and

635
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:52,399
validate like this is for best for this

636
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:55,679
plant right um so starting out you know

637
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:57,278
the a lot of the Woody culture media and

638
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,919
protocols and everything was just used

639
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:03,038
for cannabis

640
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:04,919
um dkw seems to work better S of growth

641
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:08,879
but it's it's made for

642
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:11,519
walnuts um so if you think of it in that

643
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,960
that lens we're giving the wrong I was

644
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,919
like we're giving the wrong food to

645
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,798
these cannabis plants right they want

646
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,759
completely different profile of uh

647
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:22,038
nutrients and vitamins and everything

648
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:25,519
else um and that's what I was used to

649
00:28:22,038 --> 00:28:27,759
using it was like Ms dkw and some

650
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:31,079
modifications so when I started getting

651
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:33,200
into to it um we actually started doing

652
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:35,599
research at a research

653
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,880
laboratory uh molecular

654
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:41,719
genetics uh we installed tissue culture

655
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:44,679
lab we had gcms hplc so we could look at

656
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:47,440
all the turpins and just everything for

657
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:50,440
breeding um I might have been one of the

658
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:53,798
first out in Colorado that we had whole

659
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:56,278
laboratory set up Grow rooms on rotation

660
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:59,359
planting seed and we were trying to

661
00:28:56,278 --> 00:29:02,159
identify uh qtl work so quantitative

662
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:05,719
trait Loi so basically like where these

663
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:08,840
genes are and what are they responsible

664
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:11,000
for the example I use like The Color

665
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:13,278
Purple it's like okay where do these

666
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
jeans that are responsible for the color

667
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:18,759
purple

668
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,759
live um when we identify them we can

669
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:23,240
test for them pop a bunch of seed this

670
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:25,119
big and tell you if it's going to be

671
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,399
purple or not it's like kind of the

672
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:30,599
short version of that which we can get

673
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:32,359
more into that too um in order to do

674
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:34,359
that we had to sustain life and use

675
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:36,798
tissue culture and develop these things

676
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:40,558
so there's kind of the background there

677
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:43,000
but starting with those available media

678
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:46,599
um and public research and everything we

679
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,000
could gather um it starts at Woody

680
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:51,199
culture protocols and everything else

681
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,319
right so you quickly see like all right

682
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,200
we could get these to live we get them

683
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:59,439
to root and but they're just not healthy

684
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,200
they're not healthy enough to manipulate

685
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,558
and that's what I try to teach is it's

686
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,200
not like

687
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:06,839
micropropagation it's you want to learn

688
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,960
how to manipulate this tissue within

689
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:12,359
this environment and setup so I think

690
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,440
the exciting things that I've been

691
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:19,278
working on just this past year is

692
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:22,000
fine-tuning what that is like the exact

693
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:25,359
uh components to tissue culture media

694
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,759
for cannabis and hemp um the exact

695
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:32,439
hormones and you know just the entire

696
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:36,119
Pro program to support that so went I

697
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:39,759
think this the entire year 12-hour days

698
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:42,518
just going through it um that's been the

699
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:44,079
most exciting for me as far as you know

700
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:46,440
what we we developed and what we're

701
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:49,038
working on now uh because it makes such

702
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:53,880
a huge difference like perfect health

703
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:57,319
all the way through rooting no problem

704
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:59,200
subcultures zero loss uh in health

705
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:02,519
throughout the problem process because

706
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,080
we want to get sustainable storage right

707
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:06,240
we're just taking clone the different

708
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:09,599
genetics if it was seed that'd be

709
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,480
different right that's um the best way

710
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:15,798
to sore genetics I say but since we want

711
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,440
to hold on to all these clones um we

712
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:19,319
want to start there first because we're

713
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,880
breeders we're cultivators everything

714
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:24,879
else so we want it to sort long term

715
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:27,200
without mutations or loss of uh the

716
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,639
Fidelity of the genetics themselves

717
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,798
adding on other

718
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:34,798
stress factors that cause epigenetic

719
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:37,319
changes uh and things long term that

720
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:39,679
could affect how these genes are

721
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:43,038
expressing um a lot of people say

722
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,278
genetic drift and which don't get me

723
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:46,839
started on

724
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:48,960
that but uh that's for a that's for a

725
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:52,199
population group it's not for a single

726
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:56,319
plant ah so happy to hear you say that

727
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:58,919
y this wolf guy is pretty smart yeah oh

728
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:01,759
no we started talking was like all right

729
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:04,919
I'll be on your podcast sir it's

730
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:07,319
great but you look at all the the issues

731
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:09,000
right you're cloning off mother so we

732
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:12,240
want to develop the tools that actually

733
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,679
work right um I've been doing that with

734
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:19,038
MS and dkw media and everything else for

735
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:21,880
a while which like it's just hard to use

736
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:24,919
they're not healthy you can see

737
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,360
deficiencies in the plant you can see

738
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:29,480
things are just harder to root when you

739
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:31,359
pull them out

740
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:34,759
what were some of the major changes that

741
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:36,879
you made from using Ms or dkw media to

742
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:38,278
your current setup I feel like that's

743
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,159
going to be something that a lot of

744
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:42,798
people uh should hear because I have a

745
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:44,519
feeling I might know a couple of them

746
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:45,839
but from someone that has as much

747
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:49,038
experience as you I feel like it would

748
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:51,038
be really good to hear that sure yeah I

749
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:55,359
hate to say it but there more cow mag

750
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:56,720
man it start was start there oh man yeah

751
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:59,918
after all this time I was like are you

752
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,079
kidding me is it calcium nitrate so that

753
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:05,720
you're also increasing the nitrogen

754
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:10,158
load uh so lowering the amount of

755
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:13,240
ammonia nitrate right so that definitely

756
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,200
contributes a ton to hyper hydrosity

757
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,919
meaning you know you get that

758
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:20,399
translucent look and they they kind of

759
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:23,080
shrivel um so yeah there's there's a lot

760
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:26,439
of factors there right um so you start

761
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:29,158
at ammonia nitrate so you definitely

762
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:31,159
lower that like immediately available

763
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:34,360
nitrogen that they can they can use

764
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:39,000
quickly also as way too much ammonia

765
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:42,038
right um so the other one is Cal Mag

766
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:46,240
calcium magnesium need to be raised up

767
00:33:42,038 --> 00:33:49,599
um I just started using calcium nitrate

768
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,519
so uh what else man there's a lot yeah

769
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:52,759
there's some things that you I just

770
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,919
stripped out

771
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:59,240
altogether um one of them I think cobalt

772
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:02,038
chloride dkw has nickel don't need

773
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,240
nickel has way too much sulfur it's got

774
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:06,879
the balance

775
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:09,239
sulfur um and then if you look at the

776
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,079
how nutrients are absorbed by the tissue

777
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:15,479
right it's through diffusion so if you

778
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:18,000
can manipulate the density of your agar

779
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,280
you can start controlling how much of

780
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,559
that those nutrients it's it's getting

781
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,879
or the the rate of that absorption right

782
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:28,159
um so all those components together are

783
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:33,078
made a huge difference but then you look

784
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:35,960
at the vitamin complex right um lot of

785
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:37,679
people there's gamborg B5 V

786
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:42,199
vitamins

787
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:44,519
um thomine hydrochloride in that there's

788
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:46,078
way way way too much because all these

789
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:48,440
things if they're not Balan it's going

790
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,519
to change how these nutrients are

791
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,679
absorbed by the plant it's going to

792
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:54,960
change how the sugar is process so

793
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:58,240
specifically thomine hydrochloride it

794
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:01,159
will um kind of catalyze how that's

795
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:04,358
processed and and pulled in um and if

796
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:07,159
anything's out of balance it's just like

797
00:35:04,358 --> 00:35:09,480
um just picture of deficiency right all

798
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:12,679
this has to be be kind of balanced and

799
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:15,079
and done uh and then proper uh

800
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:15,799
ventilation for your vessels is is huge

801
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:19,839
for

802
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:23,160
cannabis um so you know dkw does a great

803
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:27,039
job at least I use Ms sometimes if I'm

804
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:29,358
out of my my mix um it has a lot higher

805
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:31,838
nitrogen con content so if you're doing

806
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:34,480
a marim dissection you can start getting

807
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:37,239
that process moving a little quicker I

808
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:41,639
found um than

809
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:45,000
dkw and get getting into more tissue and

810
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:47,879
growth dkw seems to to work better the

811
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,960
vitamins had a huge impact though uh

812
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,160
more than I'd expect them to do I guess

813
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,880
um so if you look at there's I guess a

814
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:58,279
reference called L's Barrel or Le's law

815
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:02,000
of the minimum right missing one of

816
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:04,800
those planks yeah yeah um and I can send

817
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,318
links or pictures whatever to help share

818
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,440
with your viewers too but it's the same

819
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:12,759
kind of concept and then there's molders

820
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:15,358
nutrient interactions right all that

821
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:18,040
stuff applies in vitro it's still a

822
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:21,318
plant it still needs this balanced uh

823
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:25,279
nutrition and um we're just promoting it

824
00:36:21,318 --> 00:36:27,920
with hormones and supplementing sugars

825
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,920
uh because it can't photosynthesis size

826
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,838
and everything else right so if you kind

827
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,200
of break it down like that it's like

828
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:37,639
cannabis wants cannabis food tons of

829
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:39,879
references we can look at like you know

830
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:42,358
all the nutrients that we use to just

831
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:44,960
grow weed with right so if you start

832
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:48,559
there with that balance you can build

833
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,559
and make something effective um the

834
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:52,759
there's other amino acids and some

835
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:55,920
things that I started working with that

836
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,319
are helping to control that that rate

837
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,680
and make it more bioavailable and and

838
00:36:58,318 --> 00:37:02,759
process that we found extremely

839
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:03,719
effective um and I think that's what

840
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,760
started

841
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:10,239
making um cutting time off of growth

842
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:12,319
like we can get rapid crazy growth uh

843
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:15,439
from some of these final

844
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:19,719
formulas but in order to understand that

845
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:21,800
and compare we run every single trial

846
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:24,078
you know public research every formula

847
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,359
that's available just to understand and

848
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,280
start manipulating those those factors

849
00:37:26,358 --> 00:37:32,719
right um

850
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:36,200
deionized water huge or Ro I know some

851
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:38,279
people use coconut water and um all that

852
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:40,719
is going to relate to absorption of

853
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:44,200
these nutrients and being able to speed

854
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:48,439
up slow down and control that metabolism

855
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:51,559
right the light intensity the light

856
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:54,358
spectrum everything so every time I

857
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:55,318
discuss tissue culture people are like

858
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:57,559
give me the

859
00:37:55,318 --> 00:37:59,400
formula that's not it I can give you the

860
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:01,519
formula and you can just fail miserably

861
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,480
still right you have to have the

862
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:07,239
internal components and the external and

863
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,240
the techniques and um that's what makes

864
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:12,318
it successful well that's what that's

865
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:15,399
what a formula is right it's not just

866
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:16,679
one little thing it's the entire thing

867
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,400
that you know you have to put it

868
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:20,039
together correctly I have a question

869
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,599
based on something that you just said

870
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:25,559
about light and so first you said that

871
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,559
these plants can't

872
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:31,239
photosynthesize and but then you said

873
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:33,759
said that um the light is important and

874
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:36,838
this is something that Nick and I were

875
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:39,040
discussing and also um you know I have a

876
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:41,480
little hobby tissue culture lab you know

877
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:43,159
with a friend of mine and he was telling

878
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:47,240
me so my friend was saying that we don't

879
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:48,879
need very much light and you know Nick

880
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:53,759
said that you know in his research that

881
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:56,119
you need like 150 to 200 of ppfd and I'm

882
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,640
looking at your jars over there and

883
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:01,440
they're stacked one on top of it another

884
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:03,559
with what appears to be fairly low light

885
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,599
so if you could answer the question

886
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:07,480
about like what are the light

887
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:10,599
requirements generally I know it's you

888
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:13,039
know absolutely yeah well picture of

889
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:16,119
being able to control all this right so

890
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:18,239
you're looking at um and there's it's a

891
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:22,838
two-part kind of trick question right

892
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:25,118
the photos photosynthesis part so I I'll

893
00:39:22,838 --> 00:39:28,318
start there photosynthesis they're

894
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:31,559
creating uh sugars essentially energy to

895
00:39:28,318 --> 00:39:34,039
grow the plant um we supplement sugars

896
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:35,759
to help you know provide and boost that

897
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:38,599
especially at the cellular level they're

898
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,480
not going to be making their own a lot

899
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:43,400
of species they will stop

900
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:46,318
photosynthesizing and their um stomatos

901
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:49,200
kind of get stuck flows and they just

902
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:52,519
you become in stasis right if you have

903
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:55,000
the ventilated caps and you know CO2

904
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:57,599
still present that's something I haven't

905
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,838
measured you know I need I would love to

906
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:04,039
and you know do a some deeper research

907
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:06,599
on that but that's kind of like textbook

908
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:09,880
they slow and then stop

909
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:12,640
photosynthesizing is it true I

910
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:16,160
mean I'm gonna look into it we'll see

911
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:19,078
hope we get some answers right but from

912
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:20,799
from what I've heard it's uh it they do

913
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:23,160
stop photosynthesizing but they don't

914
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,440
stop their Risco cycle but they just

915
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:28,159
supplement the photosynthates that they

916
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,760
would produce through photosynthesis

917
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:33,960
uh with the provided carbohydrate load

918
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:37,119
within the media so they no longer need

919
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,039
to provide their own carbohydrates to

920
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,318
still continue this rabisco cycle of

921
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:45,599
nutrient processing and continuing to

922
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:48,880
build cellular uh growth and cellular

923
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:52,559
multiplication absolutely yep so we

924
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,599
looking at developing sugarless media

925
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:58,078
right and so think about that the hybrid

926
00:40:54,599 --> 00:41:00,200
systems we need CO2 you need

927
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,318
kind of these like traditional things

928
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:05,399
plants you know how we grow plants um

929
00:41:03,318 --> 00:41:08,039
that' be huge just way less

930
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:11,200
contamination or issues and you know

931
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:13,920
sterile work and stuff like that um but

932
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:16,679
I think getting down to measuring it and

933
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:19,000
being like okay this is true at maybe at

934
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:21,639
these points and what does that kind of

935
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,800
process or curve look like right just to

936
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:28,358
get a deeper understanding so you get

937
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:30,560
into light intensity um these uh if

938
00:41:28,358 --> 00:41:32,279
you're able to like slow that metabolism

939
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:35,000
and process down right cooler

940
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,800
temperatures lower intensity and you're

941
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,358
just slowing all that process maybe

942
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,839
higher density media so slowing that

943
00:41:40,358 --> 00:41:45,880
diffusion process as well um and these

944
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:48,318
are all different species behind me here

945
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,599
um when you get it scale you don't want

946
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:52,519
everything just growing rapidly you know

947
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:55,039
you need to control that production

948
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:57,079
cycle um and you can use a combination

949
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:59,920
of these things to to slip you know make

950
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:02,240
that that happened um for cannabis I

951
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,559
think I had one in vro the same vessel

952
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:09,679
for about a year and you know pulled it

953
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:12,799
out and it was just fine but it's it

954
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:18,399
didn't have a vented cap it had really

955
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:21,599
dense um agar and higher concentration

956
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,000
of the of uh nutrients in there so it

957
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:25,519
could last you know it's just kind of

958
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,519
slowly pulling that up that gets you an

959
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:31,880
idea how you can manipulate and CH some

960
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:35,759
of these factors but my main production

961
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:38,720
uh rack will say it's like 50 micr moles

962
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,760
per square meter that's it so that's

963
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:42,759
that's very

964
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,880
low very it's low right it's but

965
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:49,119
Spectrum so it's almost Balan

966
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:53,400
Spectrum um of veg and flowering right

967
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:55,880
blue and red that's almost even on there

968
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,800
so and I've done you know veg lights or

969
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,920
you know that heavier blue spum and you

970
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,960
can get a little more stretchier you

971
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:06,440
know elongated growth but I get to the

972
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:09,960
rooting phase and it just I wasn't

973
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,480
seeing the results that I wanted so um

974
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,599
keeping under the Spectrum and that

975
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,719
intensity I think the highest all goes

976
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:19,880
up to 80 micr moles per square meter um

977
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:22,078
you're not stressing the the plants out

978
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,960
you don't want to force them to grow

979
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:27,160
using higher light and hormone

980
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,920
specifically you want to be very

981
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:32,639
judicious using your hormones to promote

982
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,519
that type of growth uh so finding that

983
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:36,118
zone where you're not just like forcing

984
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:38,239
all that on there you know control

985
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:40,880
within a margin that's when you start

986
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:43,159
seeing health and and it gets easier

987
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,160
because the plants will they'll react

988
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:49,598
faster their tissue is just healthier

989
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:52,639
they root faster everything else um and

990
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,720
I've done it under I think 100 uh 100

991
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:58,078
micromoles per square meter different

992
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:59,159
lights that I had at the time we saw

993
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,079
excellent

994
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:06,279
growth but it's just not nearly the same

995
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:07,760
as you know what I've developed now um

996
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:11,000
because you can

997
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:13,440
get more stress that you're adding on to

998
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,920
the you know on the epigenetic level and

999
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,358
things that we're we're setting up to

1000
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:20,639
start digging through that could affect

1001
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:22,960
the genetics because in the end we want

1002
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:25,799
you know the same or even better coming

1003
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:29,000
out than what what's going in uh to the

1004
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:30,960
tissue filter process right right and a

1005
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,039
lot of people don't understand like how

1006
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,358
these things can accumulate and change

1007
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:38,880
uh epigenetic stressors and methylation

1008
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:41,558
can be passed on to the next Generation

1009
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,160
too could you uh briefly describe what

1010
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:47,200
methylation is I I haven't uh heard that

1011
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:49,838
term used before as it pertains to like

1012
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:53,078
the degradation of genetics or or um

1013
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:54,679
changes in the tics yeah yeah that's a I

1014
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:56,760
guess an easier example there's

1015
00:44:54,679 --> 00:44:57,759
different forms of this that can happen

1016
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,839
so

1017
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,839
um your DNA is not going to change but

1018
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:06,880
through stress and and this happens in

1019
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:09,480
humans as well which is just terrifying

1020
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:13,000
um you can accumulate these methyl

1021
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:15,838
groups um I won't go too much into

1022
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,159
histone protein stuff but it starts

1023
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:20,838
limiting its ability to transcribe right

1024
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:24,358
or its ability to

1025
00:45:20,838 --> 00:45:27,239
express so over time uh and again it's

1026
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:30,000
heritable to the Next Generation uh over

1027
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:32,199
time you can you know accumulate these

1028
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,639
things like again it doesn't change your

1029
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:40,480
DNA but it starts limiting those genes

1030
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:43,118
to uh ability to express right so when

1031
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,719
people discuss like man this plant just

1032
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:48,760
isn't the same or it's you know dutting

1033
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:51,358
out or whatever it's like you've been

1034
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:55,119
cloning off this for 20 years you know

1035
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:58,159
this thing is just stressed out and uh

1036
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:00,119
it's not happy right um so that's one

1037
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:02,279
form of this and you can look in you

1038
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:05,160
know going deeper there's specific

1039
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:08,599
locations that this can happen on um

1040
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:11,279
that starts binding it in onto histone

1041
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:14,720
proteins right that's where all this

1042
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,680
stuff is W like uh wrapped up so where

1043
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:19,358
it can fit into the

1044
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:23,039
chromosome um otherwise it would just be

1045
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:24,639
stretched out crazy L um but more of

1046
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:27,279
those that happen picture like a magnet

1047
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:29,400
it's just binding that to the sights and

1048
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:32,240
it starts restricting its ability to

1049
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,960
transcribe and therefore expressing I

1050
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:36,439
explain

1051
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:40,280
that I think I understand that it's kind

1052
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:43,920
of like a um they're almost like uh

1053
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:46,160
suppressors of expression where uh as

1054
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,559
they accumulate over time you can lose

1055
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:51,318
more and more of the genetic expression

1056
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:54,760
that may have made that uh specific cult

1057
00:46:51,318 --> 00:46:56,920
ofar desirable initially um and and one

1058
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:59,160
of the examples that I feel like is very

1059
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:02,119
fascinating within this uh discussion as

1060
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:05,039
well is I've even heard people have a

1061
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:06,720
specific cut and they just loved how it

1062
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:09,440
was performing and they're like I just

1063
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:11,480
want to get this onto culture so that I

1064
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,760
can preserve it for the long run they

1065
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:16,639
get it into culture they've been assured

1066
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,880
that it's uh safe and backed up so they

1067
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:21,118
kill off their mother populations they

1068
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:24,240
then get this tissue culture back and it

1069
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:26,160
has all the coas to ensure that it there

1070
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:27,479
was no mishandling where it could have

1071
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:29,318
been

1072
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,519
accidentally exchanged with another

1073
00:47:29,318 --> 00:47:34,079
genetic but they get this genetic back

1074
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:35,838
so it's for sure what they gave them and

1075
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,079
all of a sudden it is completely

1076
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:40,358
different undesirable and not what they

1077
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:42,280
wanted to grow anymore and it's because

1078
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:46,679
these these different

1079
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:51,119
um uh sort of genetic Inhibitors that

1080
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:53,960
build up over time can actually create a

1081
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:56,920
more desirable product when it comes to

1082
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:59,280
the Cannabis that we like to smoke and

1083
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:01,240
consume as well as you know maybe

1084
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,559
there's a picturesque quality to it

1085
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:06,358
where something removes the ability for

1086
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:08,359
the bra to structure in a certain way so

1087
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:10,480
that but the triome density Remains the

1088
00:48:08,358 --> 00:48:14,880
Same so all of a sudden it's just this

1089
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:16,719
more Frosty um uh resin dense flower

1090
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,039
that then when removed the flower

1091
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:20,719
structure becomes larger which

1092
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:23,558
technically is a healthier plant because

1093
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:26,838
it can support greater uh embryo life

1094
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:29,880
for more seeds because that's the entire

1095
00:48:26,838 --> 00:48:31,880
purpose of the plant in in the in nature

1096
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:35,400
is to produce seeds so that it can

1097
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:38,519
preserve its genetic lineage um so I've

1098
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:42,400
heard this you know be viewed as oh man

1099
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:45,440
it it's ruined this cultivar that I love

1100
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,559
versus almost now we have to say listen

1101
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,679
we want to get the cultivar that we love

1102
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:51,880
on tissue culture as soon as possible

1103
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:53,159
because we will be able to go back to

1104
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:56,880
that same

1105
00:48:53,159 --> 00:49:00,440
expression time and time again without

1106
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:02,880
viral loads pathogen loads other sort of

1107
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,119
genetic stressors that sort of are

1108
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,880
sitting there like you said and they

1109
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:09,798
attach themselves to the plant's genetic

1110
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:12,200
structure over time where it it's only

1111
00:49:09,798 --> 00:49:13,880
then removed through either like a

1112
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,598
meristematic tissue culture where you're

1113
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:18,160
removing it from the vascular structure

1114
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:20,798
and all these different things

1115
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:23,759
um I find that really fascinating that

1116
00:49:20,798 --> 00:49:26,159
that you brought that up thank you yeah

1117
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,960
if you think about oh do you have a

1118
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:31,318
question Gab oh what I was going to say

1119
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:34,199
is is you know this is something that

1120
00:49:31,318 --> 00:49:37,119
has been experienced with I think most

1121
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:40,879
pronounced is with the sour diesel and

1122
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:42,760
so oh yes the sour diesel I have a clone

1123
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,760
that me and my friends have had for

1124
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:48,160
decades but it's just not the same you

1125
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:51,319
know it's gone through those epigenetic

1126
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:54,480
changes and you know

1127
00:49:51,318 --> 00:49:56,358
like it's just it's it's what it is you

1128
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:00,358
know I think in another podcast what we

1129
00:49:56,358 --> 00:50:03,440
talk about is you know if you have a

1130
00:50:00,358 --> 00:50:07,000
clone of let's say wolf for

1131
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:08,760
example and one clone one of the Clone

1132
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,039
you have two clones right and one of

1133
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:13,599
them eats a healthy diet every day and

1134
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:16,039
then the other one eats Burger King and

1135
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:19,039
Taco Bell by the time that they're you

1136
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:21,798
know 30 years down the line they're

1137
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:24,679
going to be significantly different and

1138
00:50:21,798 --> 00:50:27,639
then if we take the clone of the Taco

1139
00:50:24,679 --> 00:50:30,639
Bell wolf you know it's not going to be

1140
00:50:27,639 --> 00:50:33,879
the same as the clone of the wolf that

1141
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:36,798
ate a healthy diet all of his life so

1142
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:39,000
absolutely so the lessons are number one

1143
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:41,358
always eat a healthy D diet stay away

1144
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,838
from Taco Bell eat some eat some fruit

1145
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:47,279
but also like yeah like Nick said is we

1146
00:50:44,838 --> 00:50:50,159
want to tissue culture these genetics

1147
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,839
early on you know and if we would have

1148
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:55,440
tissue culture the sour you know 10 or

1149
00:50:52,838 --> 00:50:58,279
20 years ago we wouldn't have this

1150
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,760
problem that we do now

1151
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:03,280
so that's and you know I hear using

1152
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:05,680
tissue culture specifically marim

1153
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,400
culture right it resets the genetics

1154
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:10,558
just like it was from seed again and

1155
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:12,960
that's that's not true right um it does

1156
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:15,119
a lot of these Health you know benefits

1157
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,920
Reviving getting rid of all of these

1158
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:20,599
pathogens and everything else even

1159
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,240
without going make you young again it's

1160
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:24,838
not going to make I'm working on it

1161
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:27,439
trust me yeah and it's not going to take

1162
00:51:24,838 --> 00:51:31,798
away all the bad things that she

1163
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:34,960
did right but it could or I think it

1164
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:39,920
could right so a lot of this has to

1165
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:41,838
do um so just a if you go down really

1166
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,119
really small or let's say Maris

1167
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:47,679
dissection right the majority of these

1168
00:51:44,119 --> 00:51:50,160
issues you have endites you know fungus

1169
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:53,000
bacteria that you have no idea are even

1170
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:55,759
in there right over accumulating even

1171
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,079
viruses that people just don't test for

1172
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:01,480
right that's a huge factor that could

1173
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:04,359
limit Vigor yield performance all those

1174
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:06,679
things we can get rid of all of that and

1175
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:09,679
that's the mechanical action of just

1176
00:52:06,679 --> 00:52:12,358
taking the you know new cells right

1177
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:15,039
there's no tissue for those to live in

1178
00:52:12,358 --> 00:52:18,719
um but if you get to and same with

1179
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:22,119
viruses or most viruses if you get to

1180
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:25,719
these changes or these modifications I

1181
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:27,400
guess on the DNA itself then how does

1182
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:29,719
that be removed

1183
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:34,039
uh there's some indications to the the

1184
00:52:29,719 --> 00:52:38,318
NAD Pathways right so niin nicotinic

1185
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:39,239
acid can promote removing those um

1186
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:41,519
there's

1187
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:45,598
some it's kind of a different mode of

1188
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:47,880
action I would say or describe it as uh

1189
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:50,480
that some of these sites are filled up

1190
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:53,480
before you know methylation can kind of

1191
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:56,798
stick on there so it is possible and I

1192
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:58,920
think some of that does get removed

1193
00:52:56,798 --> 00:53:01,759
um if you're using some of the you know

1194
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:04,000
the right formula or additives or um

1195
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,680
combinations right and we're at the

1196
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,239
point now where we can measure these

1197
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:12,399
things and Technology didn't have all

1198
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:15,199
this uh before so we have new sequencing

1199
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:19,039
methods um Next Generation sequencing

1200
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:21,719
came out right and now we have nanopore

1201
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:24,639
sequencing where I can do a I could

1202
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:26,838
sequence You Know Field applications on

1203
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:28,798
piece of equipment probably this big

1204
00:53:26,838 --> 00:53:31,440
come out to the grow sequence it and

1205
00:53:28,798 --> 00:53:34,599
then run it right so we have the

1206
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:38,519
technology and now we can we can

1207
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:41,760
accurately measure um and monitor the

1208
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:44,358
epig genome right so now we can verify

1209
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:47,240
these things have been removed or

1210
00:53:44,358 --> 00:53:49,480
accumulating what we don't know yet is

1211
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:50,919
the ecosystem that all of these things

1212
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:53,920
create amongst

1213
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:56,599
themselves that's where I start just

1214
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,680
going crazy so you get methyl groups and

1215
00:53:56,599 --> 00:54:03,400
then you know Ubiquiti and all these

1216
00:53:58,679 --> 00:54:06,239
other other long words and what kind of

1217
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:09,480
pressures do the interactions between

1218
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:12,039
those cause like we keep going down that

1219
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,719
rabbit hole but um the more we

1220
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:17,639
understand that the more we can uh

1221
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:20,598
create and figure out to truly

1222
00:54:17,639 --> 00:54:22,679
clean genetics down to the DNA level

1223
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:25,880
right removing these methylation methyl

1224
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:27,798
groups so it it sounds like um if I'm

1225
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:32,079
understanding correctly you're providing

1226
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:34,838
almost like a uh a growth hormone or a

1227
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:39,559
regulator to the plant to help promote

1228
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:42,838
its um Expediting growth away from

1229
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:45,798
contaminated genetic material um which

1230
00:54:42,838 --> 00:54:49,078
makes me think a lot about how resetting

1231
00:54:45,798 --> 00:54:51,838
genetics uh if you are using clonal

1232
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:55,680
propagation is extremely important to do

1233
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:58,400
it regularly to maintain um vigorous

1234
00:54:55,679 --> 00:55:02,399
growth because vigorous growth will

1235
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:05,559
help uh not necessarily remove pathogens

1236
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:09,599
but prevent the uh buildup within the

1237
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:12,359
tissue and create a lower um uh

1238
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:14,359
threshold or a lower economic threshold

1239
00:55:12,358 --> 00:55:17,000
that you need to meet in order to make

1240
00:55:14,358 --> 00:55:19,880
sure that it's still maintaining at a

1241
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,318
specific output as a crop um but it

1242
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:23,680
sounds like what you're able to do is

1243
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:25,960
use that to then even completely remove

1244
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:26,960
some of these epigenetic changes over

1245
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,720
time

1246
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:32,039
by

1247
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:36,598
successively outgrowing the different

1248
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:38,839
aspects that are preventing um a genetic

1249
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:40,440
expression that was desirable that is no

1250
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:43,838
longer

1251
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:46,880
found yeah well everything's always more

1252
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:49,480
complex right there's way more you know

1253
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:54,318
deeper stuff you can get into that is my

1254
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:57,280
hope and that is what we we're building

1255
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:59,880
towards um I will never say I can do

1256
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:02,240
that until I have the data in front of

1257
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:04,280
me and I've proven that you know but if

1258
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:07,038
you think these things are possible and

1259
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:10,200
this is how it functions it's like I

1260
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:12,400
mean that's possible it's like okay well

1261
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:14,719
we have a path forward to where we could

1262
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,798
potentially you know truly reset these

1263
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:20,759
genetics and maybe get the reg the sour

1264
00:56:17,798 --> 00:56:23,880
diesel back to where it was right even

1265
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:26,480
in the you know in the grow room it's a

1266
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:30,000
the result is genotype by Environmental

1267
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:32,599
interaction right um You can get these

1268
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,318
things to express more or less and we

1269
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:36,680
can measure that we can do RNA

1270
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:38,880
sequencing and all these you know bunch

1271
00:56:36,679 --> 00:56:42,919
of highle science stuff and we can

1272
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:45,720
measure gene expression um we can now

1273
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:47,960
see you know epigenetic pressures and

1274
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:50,879
things that are are

1275
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:53,880
restricting uh their ability to express

1276
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:57,079
we know the exact you know sites of Gene

1277
00:56:53,880 --> 00:57:00,318
regulation and um that controls those

1278
00:56:57,079 --> 00:57:05,079
things you know it's like H

1279
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:07,038
H3 on H3 K1 or something like a very

1280
00:57:05,079 --> 00:57:09,599
specific point so that's how far

1281
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:13,280
Sciences come and how do we manipulate

1282
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:16,640
it rights make a very targeted approach

1283
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:18,839
um rather than having to sort of uh use

1284
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:21,159
like a shotgun blast to try and get

1285
00:57:18,838 --> 00:57:23,239
everything uh all it once or hope that

1286
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:25,679
you hit a few things while you're while

1287
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:28,239
you're trying this specific remediation

1288
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:31,239
method you almost now take the plant

1289
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:33,439
tissue run it through the analysis uh it

1290
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:35,199
spits out the data for you of course I'm

1291
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,119
simplifying this but it it gets you the

1292
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:39,318
data you take that data you you go

1293
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:41,680
through oh uh this data fits in here on

1294
00:57:39,318 --> 00:57:44,440
the chart I can now take this

1295
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:46,960
application uh or this methodology apply

1296
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:50,798
it to that plant tissue and we should

1297
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:53,880
have a 10% success rate of removing the

1298
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:55,719
um the issue that we found retest all

1299
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:58,358
the data or retest all the tissue after

1300
00:57:55,719 --> 00:58:00,279
that next successive generation take

1301
00:57:58,358 --> 00:58:03,038
that plant that shows that it was

1302
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:06,798
removed and boom you have the next the

1303
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:08,680
next line within your your um uh your

1304
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:11,639
steps that to remove everything that you

1305
00:58:08,679 --> 00:58:15,480
want to remove from the the epigenetic

1306
00:58:11,639 --> 00:58:17,199
uh changes since I'm yeah and yeah go go

1307
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:20,240
ahead I was G say since I'm the simple

1308
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:24,038
simpleton here and not as smart as you

1309
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:26,519
and and wolf um to simplify it and use

1310
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:30,119
the same analogy we using before you

1311
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:32,798
know if we have wolf who's been eating

1312
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:36,200
Taco Bell and you know Burger King for

1313
00:58:32,798 --> 00:58:38,480
30 years there are things that he can do

1314
00:58:36,199 --> 00:58:40,759
to improve his health you know like if

1315
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:42,679
he has high cholesterol maybe he takes

1316
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:44,440
cholesterol medication and stuff like

1317
00:58:42,679 --> 00:58:47,078
that and he can lower it so there's

1318
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:50,000
certain things that we can do you know

1319
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:53,119
with tissue culture and other means to

1320
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,798
improve the health of our plants and our

1321
00:58:53,119 --> 00:59:00,480
genetics but we don't know how

1322
00:58:56,798 --> 00:59:02,440
to turn back the clock and fix every all

1323
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,920
the damage that we've done yet maybe

1324
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:07,358
someday we will you know but but

1325
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,920
currently like we know what we know and

1326
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:10,719
and we're learning more every day and

1327
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:13,920
it's it's

1328
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:15,399
exciting exactly yeah like we have

1329
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,838
because there's so many fields of

1330
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:20,400
research that like I want to learn

1331
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:24,000
everything is a problem I'm like oh go

1332
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:27,280
learn this though but if you look at how

1333
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:30,239
fast technology and research is is

1334
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:33,798
rapidly developing right now we have

1335
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:38,479
ai um integrating those fields of

1336
00:59:33,798 --> 00:59:40,759
research with AI with genetics with um

1337
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:45,159
then it I think we'll we'll find

1338
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:48,039
Solutions really fast um but it's a

1339
00:59:45,159 --> 00:59:50,000
combination right keep your genetics uh

1340
00:59:48,039 --> 00:59:53,359
you know if I'm reading I'll pop a bunch

1341
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,400
of seed put a coffee in vro if you're

1342
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:56,639
keeping it in tissue culture and it's

1343
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:59,680
not healthy

1344
00:59:56,639 --> 01:00:01,719
you're just adding more problems to it

1345
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:04,000
right so just don't keep it in tissue

1346
01:00:01,719 --> 01:00:06,879
culture keep a healthy mom until you you

1347
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,920
can you can figure it out because those

1348
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:13,039
types of uh you can run into mutations

1349
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:15,559
epigenetic pressures everything else

1350
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:20,160
rapidly if you're you know putting them

1351
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:22,400
in vitro and um uh doing it that way

1352
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:26,199
stress something that's already

1353
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:29,200
stressed exactly it's just like h kill

1354
01:00:26,199 --> 01:00:31,239
me please right and you can always

1355
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:33,399
reculture it and you know keep it

1356
01:00:31,239 --> 01:00:36,318
rolling but you're just adding more of

1357
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:38,000
that onto it right I'll always refer to

1358
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:40,318
the first part of tissue culture as the

1359
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,798
proofing phase because you got to make

1360
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:43,679
sure that everything that's going into

1361
01:00:41,798 --> 01:00:48,000
culture is healthy enough to sustain

1362
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:50,399
growth um so I think that was uh you

1363
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,798
know we we had Cosmic on earlier but he

1364
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:55,000
had to jump out but one of the things

1365
01:00:51,798 --> 01:00:57,719
that he was talking about is the uh

1366
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:00,400
potential for contam ination when using

1367
01:00:57,719 --> 01:01:02,719
uh a single uh culture vessel for

1368
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:05,960
multiple xplants or multiple

1369
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:10,038
meristematic uh tissue cultures um just

1370
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:12,720
based on either the uh use of improper

1371
01:01:10,039 --> 01:01:15,760
aseptic techniques improper cleaning

1372
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:20,519
practices prior to uh putting into

1373
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:27,119
culture um so what are some of the steps

1374
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:29,880
that you take to help uh reduce the um

1375
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:33,160
or to increase the viability of your

1376
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:36,039
initial xplants when going directly from

1377
01:01:33,159 --> 01:01:38,318
a mother population or a stock plant

1378
01:01:36,039 --> 01:01:41,640
population at a

1379
01:01:38,318 --> 01:01:45,358
facility yeah that's a so refer to a

1380
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:46,920
stage zero right um there's a lot of

1381
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:49,880
preparation you can just do with your

1382
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:53,240
mother plant to start uh if you think

1383
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:56,160
endites that are in the tissue you can

1384
01:01:53,239 --> 01:01:59,719
remove a lot of those you know use a a

1385
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:01,719
product with um like biosafe zero tall

1386
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:04,480
something like that it's pulling it into

1387
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:07,838
the tissue and it can kill a lot of

1388
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:11,318
these uh you know Anor robic things and

1389
01:02:07,838 --> 01:02:13,278
um knock those down quite a bit right uh

1390
01:02:11,318 --> 01:02:15,119
stuff you know pythium when you get

1391
01:02:13,278 --> 01:02:18,559
pythium goes all the way up and it

1392
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:20,440
starts getting limp on top if you add

1393
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:22,480
those then it starts straightening it up

1394
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:24,480
because it's killing uh that in the

1395
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,400
tissue itself so if you're having

1396
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:30,199
trouble with contamination I would

1397
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:31,960
definitely start there um getting it you

1398
01:02:30,199 --> 01:02:36,598
know just knocking as much down as you

1399
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:38,838
can when you take your samples um I've

1400
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:41,039
haven't seen a huge difference with with

1401
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:44,719
the right formulations you always keep

1402
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:47,920
that in mind in health or subculture or

1403
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:50,278
everything where I'm taking that tissue

1404
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:53,000
uh the best is obviously going to be

1405
01:02:50,278 --> 01:02:53,838
lower parts of the plant and if you

1406
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,480
think

1407
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:58,480
endogenous hormones

1408
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,880
um enolation or the this

1409
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,880
photomorphogenic response right if it's

1410
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:05,680
in low light conditions it's going to

1411
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:07,599
try and stretch towards that light

1412
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:11,199
there's hormones in there that are

1413
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:14,480
already in the tissue so those always

1414
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:16,399
have a faster response as far as growth

1415
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:21,278
um but you're also Getting

1416
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:23,680
Thinner uh little stock to to cut so we

1417
01:03:21,278 --> 01:03:25,798
can Surface sterilize as much as we want

1418
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:29,399
but if it has a really thick stock that

1419
01:03:25,798 --> 01:03:31,960
you're trying to put um into the agar

1420
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:33,880
you're not going to penetrate and kill

1421
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:37,400
uh everything inside right that's a

1422
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:40,559
really so I go down this my like

1423
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:44,079
initiations are probably this big I say

1424
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:46,160
tiny um remove all the tissue that's not

1425
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:48,960
going to contribute to Healthy Growth

1426
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:50,798
you don't need it right um because if

1427
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:53,798
you leave it on there there's it could

1428
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:56,318
be harboring harboring contaminants that

1429
01:03:53,798 --> 01:03:58,480
you might not see for months like it'll

1430
01:03:56,318 --> 01:04:00,358
just build and then a leaf touches the

1431
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:03,639
side of a vessel and then it's

1432
01:04:00,358 --> 01:04:06,480
contaminated right so the purpose of

1433
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:10,000
this is like get rid of all that stuff

1434
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:12,599
we know that it will grow and just be

1435
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,278
really really healthy in in uh culture

1436
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:16,760
with the the formulas things we've

1437
01:04:14,278 --> 01:04:18,239
developed so you just start there get

1438
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:21,640
rid of the chances that there's

1439
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:24,719
contamination in deeper thicker tissue

1440
01:04:21,639 --> 01:04:27,038
um it makes a huge difference can I stop

1441
01:04:24,719 --> 01:04:30,798
you and ask a quick question

1442
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:34,039
yeah so I mean you're you're kind of

1443
01:04:30,798 --> 01:04:36,440
blowing my mind right now by saying that

1444
01:04:34,039 --> 01:04:38,799
you should use the lower tissue on the

1445
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:40,880
plant because what I've always been

1446
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:42,679
taught even from the people that taught

1447
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:45,480
me tissue culture was that you want to

1448
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:48,639
use the top newest

1449
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:51,760
growth um so are you saying that that's

1450
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:53,879
not true that you know uh something on

1451
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:56,960
the bottom that may have been there for

1452
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:58,880
longer and is thinner and you know

1453
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:02,440
stretched out is actually better parent

1454
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:03,880
material than like the apic you know the

1455
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:06,358
top of the

1456
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:08,960
plant uh yeah that's what I that's what

1457
01:05:06,358 --> 01:05:12,558
I use and there's different sides to it

1458
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:14,720
right if you're taking a mar stem um you

1459
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:17,839
get that apex of the tissue those are

1460
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:20,480
going to be bigger up top remember

1461
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:22,480
you're cutting all that tissue off right

1462
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,760
doesn't matter they're way easier to

1463
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:27,440
dissect and and isolate they're bigger

1464
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:29,960
and you have more aggressive kind of new

1465
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:33,000
cell growth cell division and growth

1466
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:35,440
right um but if you're putting in um you

1467
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:39,159
know node node culture or just a shoot

1468
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:41,000
tip um I always take it from the bottom

1469
01:05:39,159 --> 01:05:45,199
uh I think University of weth came out

1470
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:48,519
with a paper that's saying you know sub

1471
01:05:45,199 --> 01:05:50,960
subcultures they have a lower decline in

1472
01:05:48,519 --> 01:05:53,079
health from the basil stock if you're

1473
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:56,960
taking from that which really like those

1474
01:05:53,079 --> 01:06:00,318
low shoots that are um just coming off

1475
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:02,599
the stock on the bottom right for sure

1476
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:06,480
makes me think of like UV radiation and

1477
01:06:02,599 --> 01:06:09,359
how that can also damage um genetics

1478
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:11,278
within uh any plant and or any living

1479
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:13,239
creature uh so anything that has a

1480
01:06:11,278 --> 01:06:15,199
little bit of a more shade response

1481
01:06:13,239 --> 01:06:18,199
where it is trying to push a hormonal

1482
01:06:15,199 --> 01:06:20,838
growth rather than using the the light

1483
01:06:18,199 --> 01:06:23,358
directly on it to to promote and drive

1484
01:06:20,838 --> 01:06:26,480
the growth um you're going to have a

1485
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:30,400
little bit of a a greater potential for

1486
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:32,960
healthiest genetic tissue um and this is

1487
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,400
something that I feel like uh just for a

1488
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:37,798
little clarification you know like if

1489
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:41,278
you are doing clonal propagation using a

1490
01:06:37,798 --> 01:06:45,119
lower uh Branch may not produce the most

1491
01:06:41,278 --> 01:06:48,480
vigorous clone so using upper growth for

1492
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:51,440
clonal propagation is usually the most

1493
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:54,199
advantageous simply because it does have

1494
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:56,599
a lot more available photosynthates

1495
01:06:54,199 --> 01:06:58,239
directly on site ready to be used

1496
01:06:56,599 --> 01:07:00,200
because of the photosynthetic process

1497
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:02,118
that's happening that close to the light

1498
01:07:00,199 --> 01:07:04,679
but when you're not relying on

1499
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:06,920
photosynthesis to provide the plant with

1500
01:07:04,679 --> 01:07:08,558
the carbohydrates it needs for growth

1501
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:10,358
than something with a higher hormonal

1502
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:12,240
load and it does sound like it would do

1503
01:07:10,358 --> 01:07:15,199
a lot better in

1504
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:19,078
vro yeah yep and you're not having to

1505
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:21,078
add these extra hormones and you know uh

1506
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:23,079
say it makes a big difference right so

1507
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:25,839
the thin little little shoots that are

1508
01:07:23,079 --> 01:07:27,920
popping up EAS way easier easier to

1509
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:30,599
sterilize like thoroughly sterilize so

1510
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:33,079
you're confident it's not going to start

1511
01:07:30,599 --> 01:07:35,680
growing in you know couple months down

1512
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:38,480
the line right and I see just a fash

1513
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:40,598
response but that also has to do with

1514
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:43,480
formulations and and things like that

1515
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:47,680
you're going to see dramatic difference

1516
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:50,119
um so if you just stick to just thin

1517
01:07:47,679 --> 01:07:52,239
tissue that hasn't been because there a

1518
01:07:50,119 --> 01:07:54,680
lot of those top pieces that you want to

1519
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:56,679
take regular clones or cuting right you

1520
01:07:54,679 --> 01:07:59,558
want those big thick

1521
01:07:56,679 --> 01:08:01,719
stems um kind of go the opposite it

1522
01:07:59,559 --> 01:08:04,200
doesn't it doesn't feel like it makes

1523
01:08:01,719 --> 01:08:06,558
sense but that's where I see the very

1524
01:08:04,199 --> 01:08:09,318
most success uh as far as sterilizing

1525
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:11,319
and preventing contamination you know

1526
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:12,880
that's that's an awesome trick for

1527
01:08:11,318 --> 01:08:15,440
people that are trying to get into this

1528
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:18,279
and and find success early on because

1529
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:23,640
it's such a long process to go from even

1530
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:26,319
nodal culture to uh a a an xplant that

1531
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:28,759
you can then put back into rotation as

1532
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:31,560
either a mother or a um a production

1533
01:08:28,759 --> 01:08:33,798
plant uh that it's really hard for some

1534
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:36,199
people to then lose all that progress

1535
01:08:33,798 --> 01:08:38,278
and and want to continue um we even see

1536
01:08:36,198 --> 01:08:41,919
that even just with hom Growers popping

1537
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:44,520
a seed and and getting some you know uh

1538
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:46,399
thrips or some some disease or just

1539
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:48,719
powdery Milo or something that hinders

1540
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:51,039
their their overall grow and they just

1541
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:53,880
don't want to do it again so limiting

1542
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:57,198
those little potentials for issue is so

1543
01:08:53,880 --> 01:09:01,759
huge um and I would like you to touch

1544
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:06,238
on the uh the difference between noal

1545
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:09,640
and marem tissue culture and what you

1546
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:11,639
prefer to do first if you're going in to

1547
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:14,759
do genetic

1548
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:17,279
preservation um would you would you

1549
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:20,640
start with nodal to tissue culture or

1550
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:22,199
would you uh start with marem um and

1551
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:25,719
just to preface this a little bit I've

1552
01:09:22,198 --> 01:09:28,719
always thought that you go from

1553
01:09:25,719 --> 01:09:33,279
or noal 2 meristem while it's all in

1554
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:38,039
vitro uh so that you can have

1555
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:40,600
um you you you do that uh zero um

1556
01:09:38,039 --> 01:09:42,880
generation to really make sure that it's

1557
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:45,079
uh the healthiest tissue possible yeah

1558
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:47,480
so it' just be great to kind of hear

1559
01:09:45,079 --> 01:09:51,318
your opinion on whether you like to

1560
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:52,959
start with Nole or um marem uh tissue

1561
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:57,480
culture and

1562
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:59,480
why sure so when somebody's learning I

1563
01:09:57,479 --> 01:10:01,759
just I always suggest start with noal

1564
01:09:59,479 --> 01:10:06,519
culture get the process and everything

1565
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:10,199
down right um when I am saving something

1566
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:16,000
you for long-term storage or keeping a

1567
01:10:10,198 --> 01:10:18,399
clean copy um I always do uh bare stem

1568
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:21,880
right if I pop it from seed usually I'll

1569
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:23,839
just do you know a node um because it

1570
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:26,719
hasn't been exposed to all these other

1571
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:29,480
things and collecting end of fights and

1572
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:31,480
fungus and everything else um I try to

1573
01:10:29,479 --> 01:10:35,158
do it early though so you're not having

1574
01:10:31,479 --> 01:10:36,959
that full xylem and you know things that

1575
01:10:35,158 --> 01:10:40,839
can get in there I'll just take one

1576
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:44,600
sterilize it keep a clean copy in any

1577
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:47,319
other genetic that I bring in meristem

1578
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:50,159
100% but do you start with

1579
01:10:47,319 --> 01:10:52,960
meristem I do yeah so once you have a

1580
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:55,559
clean copy right from Mar stem that you

1581
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:58,319
can multiply everything coming out of is

1582
01:10:55,560 --> 01:11:01,719
clean right and that's that's the the

1583
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:04,559
idea I have a huge collection of

1584
01:11:01,719 --> 01:11:07,439
genetics um I don't know where a lot of

1585
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:10,480
these came from or I do but you know the

1586
01:11:07,439 --> 01:11:12,359
facility they came from what they have

1587
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:15,879
whether you know sometimes I know it has

1588
01:11:12,359 --> 01:11:18,158
a virus um and I'll take the same

1589
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:21,760
precautions if it I know it doesn't have

1590
01:11:18,158 --> 01:11:25,079
a virus you just you know be safe and

1591
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:27,280
follow best practice and protocols and

1592
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:28,439
um you'll prevent the spread right

1593
01:11:27,279 --> 01:11:30,679
because you could take something out of

1594
01:11:28,439 --> 01:11:33,639
culture you did from meristem and just

1595
01:11:30,679 --> 01:11:36,000
give it a virus like pretty quick right

1596
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:38,360
um but new genetics you know I got some

1597
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,039
of my old stuff back the other day I

1598
01:11:38,359 --> 01:11:43,238
just want some of the the classics Super

1599
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:47,279
Lemon Haze Golden Goat things like that

1600
01:11:43,238 --> 01:11:49,678
right um whether to study or breed with

1601
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:51,880
doesn't matter marasim dissection that

1602
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:54,319
way I'm confident that it's clean and

1603
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:56,480
done properly and once I have tissue in

1604
01:11:54,319 --> 01:12:01,158
there I can pull as many of those out as

1605
01:11:56,479 --> 01:12:03,319
I want um the difficult part uh with

1606
01:12:01,158 --> 01:12:04,960
bear stem is the the length of time

1607
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:07,319
maintenance checking them making sure

1608
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:10,239
it's growing and um that's something

1609
01:12:07,319 --> 01:12:13,559
we've cut down dramatically like rule of

1610
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:15,000
thumb people say about nine months um I

1611
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,960
don't want to speak too soon so I still

1612
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,560
got to go home and make sure make sure

1613
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:23,198
it's alive but we you know we could

1614
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:25,880
easily cut that in half or um we're

1615
01:12:23,198 --> 01:12:27,238
looking about three four months

1616
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:31,400
um

1617
01:12:27,238 --> 01:12:34,759
potentially from from Mar stem to

1618
01:12:31,399 --> 01:12:38,399
a like um fully hardened off plant ready

1619
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:40,320
to go into production yep uh but that

1620
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:43,119
rate of growth and these are this new

1621
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:45,920
formula just for this I still want to

1622
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:48,719
make sure that's healthy rate of growth

1623
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:51,000
right right um I'm still not using tons

1624
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:54,760
of hormones or anything like same you

1625
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:57,639
know kind of uh approach that I use but

1626
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:59,520
um you can have rapid growth and have

1627
01:12:57,639 --> 01:13:02,159
mutations and and other problems that

1628
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:04,800
you definitely can't see right

1629
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:06,799
especially if you're breeding with it so

1630
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:09,400
we're going to look further into that at

1631
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:12,159
a deeper level but if you start with Mar

1632
01:13:09,399 --> 01:13:15,319
stem and you know it's clean and and you

1633
01:13:12,158 --> 01:13:18,559
can feel confident in that

1634
01:13:15,319 --> 01:13:22,119
then everything else you do from there

1635
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:24,320
um is going to be better than what you

1636
01:13:22,119 --> 01:13:25,920
had right because even a tiny little

1637
01:13:24,319 --> 01:13:28,599
node that you can sterilized you're

1638
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:30,920
still going to it still could Harbor is

1639
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,679
you know like a tiny tiny Spore or

1640
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:35,520
something you're not going to see the

1641
01:13:32,679 --> 01:13:38,960
effect of it but over time the plant

1642
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:42,000
grows and those spores or contaminates

1643
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:44,319
grow inside as well right um and that's

1644
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,198
the biggest piece because the the stuff

1645
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:50,359
I've pulled out of tissue culture from

1646
01:13:46,198 --> 01:13:53,000
marem it is explosive growth like and

1647
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:55,719
it's not too many hormones it's because

1648
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,560
nothing else except the plant's tissue

1649
01:13:55,719 --> 01:14:00,679
is utilizing the nutrients and

1650
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:02,719
everything else um you know you push it

1651
01:14:00,679 --> 01:14:04,639
in and grow it'll get a collection of

1652
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:08,158
these endef fights and you know other

1653
01:14:04,639 --> 01:14:10,159
things in there but um that's where you

1654
01:14:08,158 --> 01:14:12,759
know part of our name is the mothership

1655
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:16,679
Labs we get new sets of mother stock

1656
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:19,079
from the system every quarter or however

1657
01:14:16,679 --> 01:14:21,279
however long you want um and you just

1658
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:23,800
don't have to worry you get extremely

1659
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:25,599
vigorous healthy plants high yields all

1660
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:27,960
the stuff that people think of when when

1661
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:30,079
you talk about tissue culture but you

1662
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:34,158
turn around you're like we're not seeing

1663
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:35,079
that like why right so um definitely

1664
01:14:34,158 --> 01:14:37,879
start with

1665
01:14:35,079 --> 01:14:41,039
marem uh to practice and kind of dial

1666
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:43,639
things in getting familiar with

1667
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:46,119
everything node culture is just a great

1668
01:14:43,639 --> 01:14:49,199
way to burn through tissue you can get

1669
01:14:46,119 --> 01:14:51,000
plenty of it um because once you're

1670
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:53,238
comfortable and you can manipulate these

1671
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:56,679
things and you you know what to look for

1672
01:14:53,238 --> 01:14:58,879
then meristem is uh a lot easier to like

1673
01:14:56,679 --> 01:15:01,600
monitor once you get it past that first

1674
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:03,800
stage it's it's just the same stuff like

1675
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:07,159
transfers clean them up a little bit

1676
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:08,920
make sure they're they're healthy um and

1677
01:15:07,158 --> 01:15:10,599
becomes much easier but if you start

1678
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:13,719
with marem and you haven't done this

1679
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:16,239
before it's um I won't say it's

1680
01:15:13,719 --> 01:15:17,920
overwhelming it's just like a difficult

1681
01:15:16,238 --> 01:15:21,039
First Step you're like I don't know if I

1682
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:22,760
can do this the learning curve again is

1683
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:24,719
just practice like if you just get used

1684
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:25,760
to the motions and what you're looking

1685
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:28,359
for

1686
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:31,800
and proper technique then the rest is

1687
01:15:28,359 --> 01:15:33,279
easy you know U well it's pretty easy

1688
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:37,159
you know some troubleshooting here and

1689
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:39,639
there but um I want the stock that I

1690
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:42,679
grow and especially stock that I breed

1691
01:15:39,639 --> 01:15:44,960
with to be as clean as I can and as

1692
01:15:42,679 --> 01:15:47,760
healthy as I can um because talking

1693
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:50,039
about epigenetic pressures earlier on

1694
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:53,400
right those are heritable to the Next

1695
01:15:50,039 --> 01:15:56,198
Generation Um so you definitely start

1696
01:15:53,399 --> 01:15:59,920
with uh as clean as you can in until we

1697
01:15:56,198 --> 01:16:02,158
get um you know more easier Solutions

1698
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:04,239
right I guess to kind of reset these

1699
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:06,559
things but which I think will come I

1700
01:16:04,238 --> 01:16:09,000
mean the the technolog is there which is

1701
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:11,880
crazy so for

1702
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:14,039
sure Gabby did you have a question I did

1703
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:16,920
so you know

1704
01:16:14,039 --> 01:16:20,439
I like I said I have a hobby tissue

1705
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:23,520
culture lab and um I've only done nodal

1706
01:16:20,439 --> 01:16:25,759
tissue culture in the past and I want to

1707
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:28,440
learn how to do meristem

1708
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:30,760
and so when I went to the lab you know

1709
01:16:28,439 --> 01:16:33,319
the other day it took so much time to

1710
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:34,880
prep that I didn't have time to do

1711
01:16:33,319 --> 01:16:37,079
meristem and I had already taken all

1712
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:40,480
these clones so I wanted to stick some

1713
01:16:37,079 --> 01:16:43,079
in Nole if you have a clone that's in

1714
01:16:40,479 --> 01:16:45,079
Nole and you want to do meristem off of

1715
01:16:43,079 --> 01:16:47,639
it would you suggest doing this

1716
01:16:45,079 --> 01:16:49,359
sanitization procedure

1717
01:16:47,639 --> 01:16:51,880
again

1718
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:54,119
um I that's something that I was

1719
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:55,880
thinking you don't think you have to

1720
01:16:54,119 --> 01:16:57,679
well I mean I think thinking the right

1721
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:59,440
way that's that's what want because you

1722
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:02,119
had mentioned that it's possible that

1723
01:16:59,439 --> 01:17:06,359
it's not clean when you when you do a

1724
01:17:02,119 --> 01:17:09,198
nodal tissue culture and I was thinking

1725
01:17:06,359 --> 01:17:11,039
you know normally when you do nodal

1726
01:17:09,198 --> 01:17:13,119
culture at least the first time you

1727
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:14,840
stick it in you got to sterilize it

1728
01:17:13,119 --> 01:17:16,599
after that if it hasn't grown anything

1729
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:18,880
you just pull it out divide it and put

1730
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:21,400
it in New Media but if I'm going from

1731
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:23,480
noal to Mar stem do you think it's

1732
01:17:21,399 --> 01:17:25,638
important that I didn't again do that

1733
01:17:23,479 --> 01:17:27,638
sanitization process

1734
01:17:25,639 --> 01:17:29,560
I don't think so I mean you could

1735
01:17:27,639 --> 01:17:32,520
technically right you could let's you

1736
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:36,199
got a thick piece of stem and during

1737
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:38,840
that process you cut through a stem it

1738
01:17:36,198 --> 01:17:42,399
gets something on there and gets onto

1739
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:45,800
the the uh the cell tissue or the mar

1740
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:47,679
stem you want to remove um or the tip of

1741
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:51,400
your tool when you're placing it onto

1742
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:53,560
the medium then you could get it but

1743
01:17:51,399 --> 01:17:57,079
really if you if your confident clean

1744
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:59,239
you're removing anything that those can

1745
01:17:57,079 --> 01:18:01,279
live in anyway right it's not going to

1746
01:17:59,238 --> 01:18:03,638
live in the the clump of cells that

1747
01:18:01,279 --> 01:18:07,158
you're removing so I think you'll be

1748
01:18:03,639 --> 01:18:09,520
fine doing that um the way I do I

1749
01:18:07,158 --> 01:18:12,479
usually sterilize from tissue so it's

1750
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:15,560
healthy rapid growth that hasn't gone in

1751
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:19,519
in vitro yet and I'll sterilize those to

1752
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:21,360
put in um but you can do it both ways

1753
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:23,320
yeah if you you know I have some I'm

1754
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:26,158
going to dissect when I get home that

1755
01:18:23,319 --> 01:18:29,319
are just in vessels they're fil huge

1756
01:18:26,158 --> 01:18:31,799
filling them out but um I don't have a

1757
01:18:29,319 --> 01:18:33,479
copy that's acclimated and ready to go I

1758
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,960
don't I want to start the process and

1759
01:18:33,479 --> 01:18:37,279
get you know get the rest of my

1760
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:40,560
collection done right so you can easily

1761
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:42,800
pull that out um under the microscope

1762
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:45,600
and it's again just feeling comfortable

1763
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:48,920
uh we have some methods that are fast

1764
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:52,079
easy and overall accurate is what you

1765
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:54,279
want um and biggest suggestion if you

1766
01:18:52,079 --> 01:18:55,880
get some if you go to the dentist ask

1767
01:18:54,279 --> 01:18:57,599
them for

1768
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:59,960
uh some of their tools most of the time

1769
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:02,400
they'll recycle them or send them back

1770
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:04,359
somewhere but they are the best for

1771
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:06,960
marison dissection you can kind of just

1772
01:19:04,359 --> 01:19:10,519
peel those primordial primordial

1773
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:12,560
structures off to expose that and just

1774
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:15,520
take it right off what type of tools are

1775
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:17,480
we talking about so those dental picks

1776
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:20,440
oh they're like the handles and they

1777
01:19:17,479 --> 01:19:23,718
have like H different shape yeah to

1778
01:19:20,439 --> 01:19:26,759
everyone hat oh my God best thing for

1779
01:19:23,719 --> 01:19:28,639
dissecting ever like wow um all right

1780
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:31,239
that's a when you get in there with Like

1781
01:19:28,639 --> 01:19:33,840
a Knife oh yeah it's it's huge there's

1782
01:19:31,238 --> 01:19:35,359
some other ones we'll talk about um you

1783
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:37,719
get in there with a blade like scalpel

1784
01:19:35,359 --> 01:19:40,960
blade even number 11 which is like

1785
01:19:37,719 --> 01:19:43,880
thinner it's still hard to kind of sort

1786
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:45,679
through that um that little structure

1787
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:49,039
and it's okay you're not like ripping it

1788
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:50,639
things off like you do is you wantel it

1789
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:53,880
off these are the leaves I'll kind of

1790
01:19:50,639 --> 01:19:56,639
like push them to the side right and on

1791
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:58,800
both sides so kind of like opens up then

1792
01:19:56,639 --> 01:20:00,880
you can visually like see the structure

1793
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,079
and where you're you're going into

1794
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,440
because after a little bit you're like I

1795
01:20:02,079 --> 01:20:07,479
don't even know what I'm cutting here

1796
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:09,198
I'm just like mashing things up right um

1797
01:20:07,479 --> 01:20:11,479
especially if it's on you know a

1798
01:20:09,198 --> 01:20:14,279
dissection plate so I I hold mine

1799
01:20:11,479 --> 01:20:15,279
straight up in the air like this and

1800
01:20:14,279 --> 01:20:18,198
I'll get

1801
01:20:15,279 --> 01:20:21,679
forceps and so it's sticking up in the

1802
01:20:18,198 --> 01:20:23,759
air and I'll peel you know the

1803
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:26,920
primordial leaf and any structures to

1804
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:28,880
the side so you kind of see it it's way

1805
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:31,440
way easier it's just another thing that

1806
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:33,840
takes practice right you do that 10

1807
01:20:31,439 --> 01:20:35,678
million times right you're you're

1808
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:39,039
cruising I can do one in like five

1809
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:41,079
minutes and just knock them out um it's

1810
01:20:39,039 --> 01:20:44,560
all in the prep work and like I have all

1811
01:20:41,079 --> 01:20:46,119
my tools everything's good okay um

1812
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:48,679
because then you know it's you're you

1813
01:20:46,119 --> 01:20:50,599
get taught certain things and you like

1814
01:20:48,679 --> 01:20:53,158
humans just you're like we have to have

1815
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:54,800
these tools and this it's whatever works

1816
01:20:53,158 --> 01:20:57,000
best for you I have a different hand

1817
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:59,719
shape or a different you know my elbow I

1818
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:01,639
got a bum elbow and you know you find a

1819
01:20:59,719 --> 01:21:05,600
tool that's really effective that that

1820
01:21:01,639 --> 01:21:07,480
works for you um and just use it you

1821
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,679
know so I got I got a set of dental

1822
01:21:07,479 --> 01:21:11,519
tools I get them for five bucks from the

1823
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:14,880
dentist if you buy them new they're like

1824
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:17,120
50 bucks you can autoclave them uh some

1825
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:20,679
have little tiny blades on the tip you

1826
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:23,920
know makes it much much easier um and

1827
01:21:20,679 --> 01:21:26,000
another one is go talk to my dentist oh

1828
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:28,119
every time I I go there she's like I got

1829
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,479
like five more for you I'll give them to

1830
01:21:28,119 --> 01:21:34,439
my clients and stuff and I'm like all

1831
01:21:30,479 --> 01:21:36,079
right by your clients um I'm sorry to

1832
01:21:34,439 --> 01:21:37,599
interrupt but something that I'm super

1833
01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:41,479
interested in

1834
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:43,239
is what does Mothership Labs do like I I

1835
01:21:41,479 --> 01:21:46,279
know that you're a tissue culture lab

1836
01:21:43,238 --> 01:21:48,839
but are you are you selling tissue

1837
01:21:46,279 --> 01:21:51,238
culture clones are you teaching people

1838
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:55,920
how to do tissue culture um are you

1839
01:21:51,238 --> 01:21:59,000
doing um what uh what is it called like

1840
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:03,880
when you just hold all genetics like a

1841
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:06,198
repository like a bank yeah so um we I

1842
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:09,000
build Labs so I design build Labs pretty

1843
01:22:06,198 --> 01:22:11,079
much any scale you know we can do uh

1844
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,679
fully automated robotic tissue culture

1845
01:22:11,079 --> 01:22:17,800
Labs if you want if you want to spend

1846
01:22:12,679 --> 01:22:19,520
the money um they exist um and we

1847
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:22,000
started off because you know I've been

1848
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:25,120
running big programs and breeding and

1849
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,079
research and um

1850
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:29,479
there's just a lot of bad experiences

1851
01:22:27,079 --> 01:22:32,119
and bad business we went through in the

1852
01:22:29,479 --> 01:22:34,718
this industry right and I ended up

1853
01:22:32,119 --> 01:22:38,279
working with uh my current partner Jay

1854
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:40,158
he's he's awesome and a couple of those

1855
01:22:38,279 --> 01:22:42,158
experiences we we went through and we

1856
01:22:40,158 --> 01:22:46,839
were like we work really well together

1857
01:22:42,158 --> 01:22:48,960
he Bal he keeps me in the lab he says um

1858
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:52,480
and you know Business Development sales

1859
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:54,679
he does he's just amazing man the other

1860
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:57,599
the stuff that I don't want to do right

1861
01:22:54,679 --> 01:23:00,000
I'm not good at right um and we started

1862
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:02,199
this because we wanted to choose people

1863
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:06,079
to work with that had the same values

1864
01:23:02,198 --> 01:23:08,559
and um you know Vision that we do so we

1865
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:11,319
kind of organically shaped to where we

1866
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:12,800
can do a ton of different things but

1867
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:17,279
this is the way we can help people the

1868
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:19,600
most like in the immediate term um so

1869
01:23:17,279 --> 01:23:22,000
coming out building labs and showing

1870
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:24,039
people like Advanced Techniques and you

1871
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,679
know developing formulas like here you

1872
01:23:24,039 --> 01:23:29,399
go like we do all the hard work just

1873
01:23:26,679 --> 01:23:31,800
just go and seeing them be

1874
01:23:29,399 --> 01:23:33,198
successful um when they're off when

1875
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:35,360
they're on their own now we have an

1876
01:23:33,198 --> 01:23:37,039
affiliate lab we can just like form of

1877
01:23:35,359 --> 01:23:39,839
communication right we can send each

1878
01:23:37,039 --> 01:23:42,039
other clean genetics whenever and build

1879
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:46,480
each other's catalogues and make crosses

1880
01:23:42,039 --> 01:23:49,399
and uh it it's been awesome so the

1881
01:23:46,479 --> 01:23:51,198
long-term vision is breeding research

1882
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:54,039
more you know more of the stuff that

1883
01:23:51,198 --> 01:23:55,678
that we love to do and uh collaborate

1884
01:23:54,039 --> 01:23:59,439
with other people that that do that we

1885
01:23:55,679 --> 01:24:02,960
have powerful tools and so we use all of

1886
01:23:59,439 --> 01:24:05,799
our uh capabilities to create powerful

1887
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:10,198
tools that are easy to use and that you

1888
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:11,719
can apply um to make your help sustain

1889
01:24:10,198 --> 01:24:14,599
the the industry because there's been a

1890
01:24:11,719 --> 01:24:16,800
lot of collapse uh across the board

1891
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:19,440
right so like let's save these genetics

1892
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:21,920
like preserve them now we can do it so

1893
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:23,719
they're healthy and we're not having

1894
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:27,279
long-term issues we can have the real

1895
01:24:23,719 --> 01:24:30,039
genetics sword um and I'll do sometimes

1896
01:24:27,279 --> 01:24:32,119
I'll just do it for um because you you

1897
01:24:30,039 --> 01:24:35,760
run into the trust thing too right like

1898
01:24:32,119 --> 01:24:37,439
sem your genetics and I'll hold them um

1899
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:40,520
that's why I started like building

1900
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:42,638
people Labs right I the first version I

1901
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:44,719
just had like a mobile kit that I pieced

1902
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:48,118
together I'd show up and be like I'll

1903
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:50,639
show you tis tissue culture is not hard

1904
01:24:48,118 --> 01:24:52,439
like and you show somebody the process

1905
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:54,600
that's not that hard like you can do it

1906
01:24:52,439 --> 01:24:58,198
man like I got your back like let's go

1907
01:24:54,600 --> 01:25:00,960
it's funny to say that I mean I I want

1908
01:24:58,198 --> 01:25:03,079
to if you guys will humor me for a

1909
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:04,800
second I want to tell a little story

1910
01:25:03,079 --> 01:25:07,158
yeah yeah do you know who Bill Graham is

1911
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:09,679
the guy who sells the the home tissue

1912
01:25:07,158 --> 01:25:12,599
culture kit yeah I've heard yeah I've

1913
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:16,279
heard Bill Graham for sure so you know

1914
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:19,039
he gave me a kit and I kept it for over

1915
01:25:16,279 --> 01:25:20,880
a year sealed in the Box never used it

1916
01:25:19,039 --> 01:25:23,679
because I was intimidated and I just

1917
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:27,760
felt like I had to get ready you know I

1918
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:30,000
had to build this sterile space and I I

1919
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:31,840
like I said it was intimidating and so

1920
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:35,118
one day he comes over to my shop cuz I

1921
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:36,239
own the hydro store and he comes to the

1922
01:25:35,118 --> 01:25:38,679
shop and he says that's it we're just

1923
01:25:36,238 --> 01:25:41,638
going to do this and he already had

1924
01:25:38,679 --> 01:25:44,719
media prepared but he broke out the

1925
01:25:41,639 --> 01:25:47,440
pressure cooker so we could make media

1926
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:49,800
and then y um it wasn't cannabis because

1927
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:53,799
it was my grow store but we had scented

1928
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:55,840
geraniums and redwood trees and we

1929
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:58,520
divided them up we used a rubber made

1930
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:01,400
tough box turned on its side with the

1931
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:04,400
front door of my store opening so like

1932
01:26:01,399 --> 01:26:07,519
it was in my retail space the door was

1933
01:26:04,399 --> 01:26:10,679
opening and we put the plants in there

1934
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:13,199
and everything grew and we got it's very

1935
01:26:10,679 --> 01:26:15,639
little of any contamination and then

1936
01:26:13,198 --> 01:26:17,158
after that I was so inspired I did

1937
01:26:15,639 --> 01:26:19,359
tissue culture every day like if you

1938
01:26:17,158 --> 01:26:21,039
came into my store it smelt like alcohol

1939
01:26:19,359 --> 01:26:22,639
and bleach cuz I'm constantly spraying

1940
01:26:21,039 --> 01:26:24,880
the stuff doing the tissue

1941
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:27,440
culture but now

1942
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:30,800
I've ended up kind of in that same

1943
01:26:27,439 --> 01:26:33,158
situation for many years

1944
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:36,199
where I'm scared to do

1945
01:26:33,158 --> 01:26:38,799
Marist you know like I got you cover man

1946

I'm just trying to like break that seal

1947
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:44,039

intim it seems it seems so like and

1951
01:26:52,279 --> 01:26:57,118
honestly it's kind of like passing it

1952
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:59,760
forward right cuz where I came from is

1953
01:26:57,118 --> 01:27:02,039
like nobody helped me for a long time I

1954
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:04,920
had to like fight and

1955
01:27:02,039 --> 01:27:07,118
scratch uh you got into the industry

1956
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:09,760
nobody was going to share information

1957
01:27:07,118 --> 01:27:11,198
with you like that's my recipe or I was

1958
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:13,320

will will be successful together you

1966
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:33,279

1968
01:27:33,279 --> 01:27:37,198
this like it's it isn't that hard it's

1969
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:40,639
like someone teaching you how to grow

1970
01:27:37,198 --> 01:27:42,359
weed the first time too it's like it's

1971
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:44,440
like such like how you know and then you

1972
01:27:42,359 --> 01:27:47,439

1973
01:27:44,439 --> 01:27:50,198
hard yeah and it it started my entire

1974
01:27:47,439 --> 01:27:53,759
career PAAD like learning like you need

1975
01:27:50,198 --> 01:27:54,960
to learn in this area I'm like okay cool

1976
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:58,199
and

1977
01:27:54,960 --> 01:28:00,600
just surrounding myself with um people

1978
01:27:58,198 --> 01:28:02,439
that are way smarter than myself and

1979
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:05,039
learning to ask the right questions

1980
01:28:02,439 --> 01:28:09,079
because you you find if you got good

1981
01:28:05,039 --> 01:28:11,359
people around you they that are educated

1982
01:28:09,079 --> 01:28:13,960
in you know whatever subject if you talk

1983
01:28:11,359 --> 01:28:16,799
to them they love to share that right

1984
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:19,960
and I've been to Laboratories where like

1985
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:22,400
like I've been to you know phds like

1986
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:24,118
I've dedicated my entire life to this

1987
01:28:22,399 --> 01:28:26,319
and some of those people end up just tur

1988
01:28:24,118 --> 01:28:29,639
turning out samples or having to run

1989
01:28:26,319 --> 01:28:31,279
more business than science you know and

1990
01:28:29,639 --> 01:28:34,639
their dream when their little kid was to

1991
01:28:31,279 --> 01:28:37,399
be a scientist so you start like can you

1992
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:39,319
show me this or what about that I go

1993
01:28:37,399 --> 01:28:40,679
home and do my homework and come back be

1994
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:43,840
like all right I ran into some more

1995
01:28:40,679 --> 01:28:45,760
questions like their their eyes light up

1996
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:48,639
they're like I know all about like he's

1997
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:51,639
asking about this and that's what

1998
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:54,639
inspired me uh a long time ago to go

1999
01:28:51,639 --> 01:28:56,840
down biotech and all this and

2000
01:28:54,639 --> 01:29:00,159
um otherwise it kind of dies right you

2001
01:28:56,840 --> 01:29:02,159
you hear tissue culture lab and the

2002
01:29:00,158 --> 01:29:03,839
first thing is like way too expensive

2003
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:06,519
you got a whole sterile room and all

2004
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:09,119
this stuff and I mean if you're doing it

2005
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:12,520
this scale you know you you want some

2006
01:29:09,118 --> 01:29:14,399
preventatives in place and um but you

2007
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:15,880
don't need to do this if you're at your

2008
01:29:14,399 --> 01:29:18,679
house I buil one at my house that's

2009
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:20,239
pretty crazy but maybe another I ended

2010
01:29:18,679 --> 01:29:21,600
up just building a lab in my house so I

2011
01:29:20,238 --> 01:29:24,519
could do all this we should do a lab

2012
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:27,000
tour sometime of your of your home lab

2013
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:29,679
um just over video we just invited

2014
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,439

2015
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:34,600

01:29:31,439 --> 01:29:37,559
in whenever you want uh got these I got

2017
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:42,039
these AI cameras too so we could do a

2018
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:43,400
lab tour and a marm EX too if you want

2019
01:29:42,039 --> 01:29:45,118
that would be be great that would be

2020
01:29:43,399 --> 01:29:47,879
awesome I've been recently looking at

2021
01:29:45,118 --> 01:29:50,000
videos on YouTube trying to like figure

2022
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:54,480
out how to do it one thing I wanted to

2023
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:56,439
add is you know until recently you and

2024
01:29:54,479 --> 01:29:59,198
and maybe you know and even Bill Graham

2025
01:29:56,439 --> 01:30:02,599
and some other people um we had the guy

2026
01:29:59,198 --> 01:30:06,000
from kenic come on educating people

2027
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:07,679
about tissue culture and cannabis the

2028
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,359
guys that were doing it didn't want to

2029
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:12,039
do it you know like they want to keep

2030
01:30:10,359 --> 01:30:15,079
their secrets and make you think that

2031
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:17,639
it's really hard to do because that's

2032
01:30:15,079 --> 01:30:21,800
their business plan to like make money

2033
01:30:17,639 --> 01:30:23,560

appreciate people like you that are

2035
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:28,679

2047
01:30:56,158 --> 01:31:01,759
I could start using it you know like it

2048
01:30:59,399 --> 01:31:05,439
to me and and my partner Jay it's less

2049
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:07,159
about like um sometimes I'll just show

2050

2052
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:16,840
it but um it's less about gatekeeping

2053
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:19,000
the knowledge so I can make money and

2054
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:21,000
there's the money will come man if I'm

2055
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:23,600
teaching people to do this properly we

2056
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:25,439
all advance in this money to be made

2057
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:28,679
teaching people how to do it too and

2058
01:31:25,439 --> 01:31:31,879
building up labs and yeah I get we build

2059
01:31:28,679 --> 01:31:34,199
a network and and exchange information

2060
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:36,520
it's less about me like providing mine

2061
01:31:34,198 --> 01:31:38,799
it's like let's exchange information and

2062
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:41,560
knowledge uh and continue to grow you

2063
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:43,920
know yeah and and some of those earlier

2064
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:47,080
companies that did have these very

2065
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:49,920
proprietary tissue culture recipes for

2066
01:31:47,079 --> 01:31:53,359
cannabis they were evaluated at an

2067
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:54,359
extremely high um at an extremely high

2068
01:31:53,359 --> 01:31:56,799
valuation

2069
01:31:54,359 --> 01:31:59,719
due to their recipes and methodologies

2070
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:01,800
and so they were beholden to contracts

2071
01:31:59,719 --> 01:32:05,399
to not release that information out to

2072
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:06,880
anybody even if it was friends family

2073
01:32:05,399 --> 01:32:09,559
somebody that was just looking to get

2074
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:11,719
into tissue culture because they would

2075
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:13,360
um they would void their contractual

2076
01:32:11,719 --> 01:32:15,679
obligations and their fiduciary

2077
01:32:13,359 --> 01:32:18,000
responsibilities to these investors

2078
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:20,920
where I think one of the recipes was

2079
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:24,359
valuated at $10 million just for the

2080
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:27,600
tissue culture recipe and

2081
01:32:24,359 --> 01:32:29,479
that was you know 5 to 10 years ago and

2082
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:32,239
that company is now out of business

2083
01:32:29,479 --> 01:32:34,439
because they realized that you can have

2084
01:32:32,238 --> 01:32:35,959
this awesome recipe but if you're not

2085
01:32:34,439 --> 01:32:37,919
then sharing it with the community and

2086
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:41,079
helping the community understand the

2087
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:44,480
value behind tissue culture there is no

2088
01:32:41,079 --> 01:32:46,880
reason to do it in the first place um ex

2089
01:32:44,479 --> 01:32:49,839
exactly Y and you know I've heard so

2090
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:51,760
much bad information or misinformation

2091
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:53,480
right some of the information is like

2092
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:56,239
that's what they learned and were told

2093
01:32:53,479 --> 01:32:59,479
and which is okay like I I understand

2094
01:32:56,238 --> 01:33:03,638
that too but the work we did and like

2095
01:32:59,479 --> 01:33:07,238
the focus work I'm I'm so tired did this

2096
01:33:03,639 --> 01:33:08,600
entire year it's like it works and all

2097
01:33:07,238 --> 01:33:12,319
these things that you heard tissue

2098
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:13,719
culture can do is possible and let's

2099
01:33:12,319 --> 01:33:15,599
let's touch on one of those actually

2100
01:33:13,719 --> 01:33:17,920
really quickly sorry to cut you off but

2101
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:21,840
I feel like one of the biggest

2102
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:23,800
controverses in um through the views of

2103
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:27,079
cannabis cultivators when it comes to

2104
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:30,600
tissue culture right now is the removal

2105
01:33:27,079 --> 01:33:33,118
of hops lat and vroid through martic

2106
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:35,079
tissue culture and you and I were

2107
01:33:33,118 --> 01:33:37,559
actually put in contact with each other

2108
01:33:35,079 --> 01:33:40,039
through our mutual uh connection at Tumi

2109
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:42,280
genomics because that's right yeah

2110
01:33:40,039 --> 01:33:46,079
because I had reached out to find out

2111
01:33:42,279 --> 01:33:47,319
more about Hops and vroid Remediation

2112
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:50,118
because it is something where some

2113
01:33:47,319 --> 01:33:51,679
people will say there's no guarantee it

2114
01:33:50,118 --> 01:33:55,118
can't happen and they've been doing

2115
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:59,118
tissue culture for years or decades but

2116
01:33:55,118 --> 01:34:01,198
they're caught I believe in a mindset of

2117
01:33:59,118 --> 01:34:02,920
limitations where they don't think that

2118
01:34:01,198 --> 01:34:04,719
something's possible because they just

2119
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:06,560
haven't been able to do it yet and what

2120
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:08,359
I always like to tell people you know

2121
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:11,880
this is also for people that have been

2122
01:34:08,359 --> 01:34:14,039
growing for 30 years 40 years cannabis

2123
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:15,520
and are stuck in a specific set of ways

2124
01:34:14,039 --> 01:34:18,279
where they say this is how I've always

2125
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:20,920
done it this is how it works and I'm not

2126
01:34:18,279 --> 01:34:22,359
going to listen to new methodologies

2127
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:25,279
I've already been doing this for 30

2128
01:34:22,359 --> 01:34:27,479
years how could something be better and

2129
01:34:25,279 --> 01:34:29,599
so I feel like there people pigeonhole

2130
01:34:27,479 --> 01:34:32,759
themselves in a lot of these mentalities

2131
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:35,920
unfortunately but I was put in direct

2132
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:38,360
contact with you because of your ability

2133
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:40,118
that you've shown to remove hop lat and

2134
01:34:38,359 --> 01:34:41,639
thyroid and so I'd like to pick your

2135
01:34:40,118 --> 01:34:44,359
brain a little bit about that where you

2136
01:34:41,639 --> 01:34:47,039
found success and how that success has

2137
01:34:44,359 --> 01:34:49,839
sort of been able to been proven out

2138
01:34:47,039 --> 01:34:53,279
over time sir yeah I mean it's it's a

2139
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:56,360
Hot Topic right uh and yeah when you

2140
01:34:53,279 --> 01:34:58,840
first out I thought like a a potential

2141
01:34:56,359 --> 01:35:00,439
client and I was like he's asking he's

2142
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:03,119
asking a lot of questions there what's

2143
01:35:00,439 --> 01:35:04,439
going on right but I was it was great to

2144
01:35:03,118 --> 01:35:07,479
connect you're asking the right

2145
01:35:04,439 --> 01:35:10,039
questions right which was um it's it's

2146
01:35:07,479 --> 01:35:12,959
refreshing in a lot of ways

2147
01:35:10,039 --> 01:35:16,880
so as everything is right the world is

2148
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:19,239
it's more complex than can you remove it

2149
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:22,719
can you not right it's different with

2150
01:35:19,238 --> 01:35:25,759
different genetics um there is the the

2151
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:29,679
mechanical removal part right removing

2152
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:32,440
the the the cells at the the apical uh

2153
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:34,319
Dome um not connected the vascular

2154
01:35:32,439 --> 01:35:37,638
system which a lot of these things can

2155
01:35:34,319 --> 01:35:39,920
be moved through the tissue right um

2156
01:35:37,639 --> 01:35:42,440
that is one part of it but they I

2157
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:44,719
believe there's been some instance where

2158
01:35:42,439 --> 01:35:47,158
they have transferred through other

2159
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:50,560
avenues right you know through these

2160
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:52,599
cellular mechanisms and I group that in

2161
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:54,159
like more research needs to be needs to

2162
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:57,600
be done to

2163
01:35:54,158 --> 01:36:00,118
understood um but there's some genetics

2164
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:03,039
that are knocking out in the first try

2165
01:36:00,118 --> 01:36:08,118
and be like I'm the best there ever was

2166
01:36:03,039 --> 01:36:11,679
at TC some genetics extremely just a

2167
01:36:08,118 --> 01:36:15,519
pain to to do that with it's not all the

2168
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:17,840
same right so there like the variety of

2169
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:20,800
how these things evolved in the tissue

2170
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:23,000
down to the uh the cellular mechanisms

2171
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:24,079
right they're not all the same cannabis

2172
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:28,479
has a

2173
01:36:24,079 --> 01:36:32,800
um very different uh plant in some ways

2174
01:36:28,479 --> 01:36:35,118
right so starting there the methodology

2175
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:38,079
and treatments and there's a variety of

2176
01:36:35,118 --> 01:36:40,839
those available right you can use broad

2177
01:36:38,079 --> 01:36:44,439
antivirals you can do I there's a ton of

2178
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:47,279
things you can apply um to help prevent

2179
01:36:44,439 --> 01:36:48,279
frost contamination and and have that be

2180
01:36:47,279 --> 01:36:50,960
more

2181
01:36:48,279 --> 01:36:54,679
successful uh rule of thumb is I think I

2182
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:56,920
told you too is like 50% of the sample

2183
01:36:54,679 --> 01:36:58,880
right is what you want to expect but

2184
01:36:56,920 --> 01:37:01,840
there's also those you know those

2185
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:06,639
outliers where like none of those came

2186
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:09,800
out clean um or all of them so going

2187
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:12,600
down to the techniques um so I'm sure

2188
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:13,960
you guys told like cold treatments and

2189
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:16,560
you know a lot of different ways to

2190
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:18,000
approach it the cell actually don't know

2191
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:22,119
about cold treatment can you briefly

2192
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:24,158
touch on that oh sure so you can um

2193
01:37:22,118 --> 01:37:27,118
basically take your you know I'll take a

2194
01:37:24,158 --> 01:37:30,799
sample this big right uh just your your

2195
01:37:27,118 --> 01:37:33,639
tissue and protect it so I got a kind of

2196
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:35,800
step process to you know protect it

2197
01:37:33,639 --> 01:37:37,800
store it in a

2198
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:41,560
refrigerator um and I know some people

2199
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:43,800
that have gone way colder than that but

2200
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:47,159
it's basically really really cold for a

2201
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:50,279
short amount of time or refrigerator for

2202
01:37:47,158 --> 01:37:52,158
we do like two months or so um I've

2203
01:37:50,279 --> 01:37:55,399
adapted that into using some synthetic

2204
01:37:52,158 --> 01:37:57,799
seed um techniques as well to protect

2205
01:37:55,399 --> 01:37:59,638
those uh protect those organs and make

2206
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:02,760
sure we're going to get functionality of

2207
01:37:59,639 --> 01:38:05,000
out of the cells to grow um but

2208
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:08,000
essentially you're you're just slowing

2209
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:11,198
everything down uh it always starts with

2210
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:13,560
the sample that you take right so

2211
01:38:11,198 --> 01:38:16,158
remember uh the photomorphogenic

2212
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:19,360
responses you can get a plant to stretch

2213
01:38:16,158 --> 01:38:22,118
out pretty quick using far red light

2214
01:38:19,359 --> 01:38:24,839
right so why not stretch that out it's

2215
01:38:22,118 --> 01:38:28,319
growing really fast then take your

2216
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:32,480
xplant so already you've either limited

2217
01:38:28,319 --> 01:38:35,319
or diluted as much as you can right from

2218
01:38:32,479 --> 01:38:36,839
the the bottom of that plant um because

2219
01:38:35,319 --> 01:38:40,519
template viral you're you're talking

2220
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:42,639
links to this metabolism and growth uh

2221
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:44,320
so if you can just stretch it out and if

2222
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:48,118
you know far red light you can get that

2223
01:38:44,319 --> 01:38:51,799
to happen pretty quick right and start

2224
01:38:48,118 --> 01:38:53,920
there you're already ahead um so at

2225
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:57,239
least a viral load and everything else

2226
01:38:53,920 --> 01:39:00,039
you're working with uh cold storage does

2227
01:38:57,238 --> 01:39:04,439
kind of same thing and I've heard heat

2228
01:39:00,039 --> 01:39:07,800
cold it's all I think needs to be

2229
01:39:04,439 --> 01:39:09,839
evaluated further to get like real truth

2230
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:11,320
behind some of these things but because

2231
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:13,800
we're looking at just the mechanical

2232
01:39:11,319 --> 01:39:17,399
separation if it's not able to get into

2233
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:19,279
those cells why does it matter right

2234
01:39:17,399 --> 01:39:23,399
which could it could get into those

2235
01:39:19,279 --> 01:39:25,479
cells so a lot of that I think is just

2236
01:39:23,399 --> 01:39:27,759
an attempt to kind of slow everything

2237
01:39:25,479 --> 01:39:29,638
down so it's not spreading into the

2238
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:33,039
tissue you're going to just dissect

2239
01:39:29,639 --> 01:39:34,840
anyway um So currently I just use that

2240
01:39:33,039 --> 01:39:38,198
far red light which you can get isolated

2241
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:41,639
spectrums of that take your your xplant

2242
01:39:38,198 --> 01:39:43,559
and do a proper dissection and that uh

2243
01:39:41,639 --> 01:39:44,880
there's techniques which I'll go when

2244
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:47,760
when we're in the lab I'll go over with

2245
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:49,880
all that stuff for you guys so makes a

2246
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:53,039
huge difference right because if I'm

2247
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:55,760
sitting there smearing you know hlbb all

2248
01:39:53,039 --> 01:39:58,920
over the samples I'm plating up and so

2249
01:39:55,760 --> 01:40:00,280
on so forth um got to prevent that and

2250
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:03,880
that's I think the hardest part where

2251
01:40:00,279 --> 01:40:06,559
you can isolate that efficiently um I

2252
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:09,039
use ocular scissors and you know for eye

2253
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:11,440
surgeries things like that you find the

2254
01:40:09,039 --> 01:40:12,960
right tool or the best tool for the job

2255
01:40:11,439 --> 01:40:15,279
so you go to the eye doctor and get

2256
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:16,880
their used tools too see this is a

2257
01:40:15,279 --> 01:40:20,000
you're catching on right we just got to

2258
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:23,319
schedule appointments pick up pick up

2259
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:24,960
tissue culture supplies we're good man

2260
01:40:23,319 --> 01:40:26,960
all righty just make a list of all the

2261
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:29,279
doctors that we got to grab their uh

2262
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:31,719
recyclables from or go search in that

2263
01:40:29,279 --> 01:40:35,000
dumpster behind the building to see like

2264
01:40:31,719 --> 01:40:37,960
oh man we got some ocular scalples we

2265
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:41,439
need well uh funny enough the last tool

2266
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:43,279
is like a hyperemic or hypmic needle

2267
01:40:41,439 --> 01:40:47,039
that you can just because it has the

2268
01:40:43,279 --> 01:40:48,840
sharp end that you can pull that off

2269
01:40:47,039 --> 01:40:51,960
without touching any other tissue on

2270
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:53,960
there right so then you have a in the oh

2271
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:57,000
I got a clean pull then you're able to

2272
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:59,560
just remove it and just kind of plate it

2273
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:01,039
like that a sharpen spoon I'm a rookie

2274
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:03,840
but it's funny that you say that because

2275
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:06,960
I watched a video and it literally

2276
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:09,400
looked like he didn't cut the marem out

2277
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:10,960
he popped it out it's like he just went

2278
01:41:09,399 --> 01:41:13,479
in then he went like this like you know

2279
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:15,239
first he peeled it open a little bit and

2280
01:41:13,479 --> 01:41:17,118
then he just popped it out I was like

2281
01:41:15,238 --> 01:41:18,839
man he made that look too simple we need

2282
01:41:17,118 --> 01:41:21,359
to do that in slow motion or it needs to

2283
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:24,319
be slow motion and and even zoomed in

2284
01:41:21,359 --> 01:41:28,359
more than yeah the microscope was

2285
01:41:24,319 --> 01:41:30,158
showing because yeah technique right and

2286
01:41:28,359 --> 01:41:32,279
if you think about just tissue in

2287
01:41:30,158 --> 01:41:34,399
general if it's water logged and been

2288
01:41:32,279 --> 01:41:36,880
sitting in you know you just sterilize

2289
01:41:34,399 --> 01:41:40,479
it and you went took a break that tissue

2290
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:42,520
is going to be different than um you

2291
01:41:40,479 --> 01:41:45,799
know you uh you picture like asparagus

2292
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:49,599
and an ice ba ice bath right it's still

2293
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:51,679
crispy and you can kind of snap it right

2294
01:41:49,599 --> 01:41:54,000
so if it's sitting in there in your

2295
01:41:51,679 --> 01:41:56,440
sterilization solution and it's just

2296
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:58,599
it's absorbing liquid it's going to be a

2297
01:41:56,439 --> 01:42:01,198
little more gummy and hard to kind of

2298
01:41:58,599 --> 01:42:03,239
pop off right so a lot of those things

2299
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:05,799
is where you fine-tune those skill sets

2300
01:42:03,238 --> 01:42:07,519
and don't you start I'm sorry but don't

2301
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:11,159
you isn't that part of the process like

2302
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:13,000
you put it in water and you and you soak

2303
01:42:11,158 --> 01:42:15,439
it and clean it then you put it in

2304
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:17,198
bleach and whatever and then you soak it

2305
01:42:15,439 --> 01:42:18,879
in water again aren't they always going

2306
01:42:17,198 --> 01:42:21,759
to be water logged by that

2307
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:23,800
point um no no not if you're just

2308
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:27,360
efficient with with that process right

2309
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:29,760
so I do a and I can run I think the most

2310
01:42:27,359 --> 01:42:32,759
I did in one day was like

2311
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:35,800
22 I would never recommend that it was

2312
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:38,440
it was painful um but I dialed this in

2313
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:40,039
because it has to be efficient for

2314
01:42:38,439 --> 01:42:44,319
people to use it right it goes back to

2315
01:42:40,039 --> 01:42:46,840
that concept um 50 mil tubes I have a

2316
01:42:44,319 --> 01:42:50,279
flat I just pull it up fill it to that

2317
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:52,960
line add the tissue cap it orbital

2318
01:42:50,279 --> 01:42:55,519
Shaker for five minutes uh and that's

2319
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:58,239
just with water washing particulate and

2320
01:42:55,520 --> 01:43:00,960
residues off for water in T20 or

2321
01:42:58,238 --> 01:43:03,718
polysorbate right empty them out and

2322
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:06,599
then I add bleach water that's five

2323
01:43:03,719 --> 01:43:09,760
minutes uh on the orbital Shaker another

2324
01:43:06,599 --> 01:43:12,920
five minutes for me to set up and

2325
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:14,159
prepare to start pulling tissue right so

2326
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:15,679
that way it's not getting over

2327
01:43:14,158 --> 01:43:18,399
sterilized or

2328
01:43:15,679 --> 01:43:21,319
oversaturated I'm just like empty them

2329
01:43:18,399 --> 01:43:24,198
out rinse and I'm already starting to

2330
01:43:21,319 --> 01:43:25,960
pull tissue off so you get in a rhythm

2331
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:28,598
like start with enough samples to where

2332
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:31,158
you get through it um and you start

2333
01:43:28,599 --> 01:43:33,039
making it more efficient with like 50

2334
01:43:31,158 --> 01:43:34,799
mil tubes or like whatever you have

2335
01:43:33,039 --> 01:43:36,800
right you're not sanitizing too much at

2336
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:40,760
a time because then it's just sitting

2337
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:42,719
there in water or exactly yeah so I

2338
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:44,440
stick to like made that mistake the

2339
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:46,480
other day it makes huge difference right

2340
01:43:44,439 --> 01:43:48,919
I mean I I mean I was only doing Nole

2341
01:43:46,479 --> 01:43:52,279
but still I'm assuming yeah get all

2342
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:54,639
flimsy and yeah so I I usually cap it at

2343
01:43:52,279 --> 01:43:57,319
like six different genetics at a time

2344
01:43:54,639 --> 01:44:00,319
now just because I'm I got lots of other

2345
01:43:57,319 --> 01:44:03,399
things I'm doing um and I can knock

2346
01:44:00,319 --> 01:44:06,479
those out get them in culture be good

2347
01:44:03,399 --> 01:44:09,719
you know um but start with one you can

2348
01:44:06,479 --> 01:44:11,718
do um I use 50 mil tubes just e and

2349
01:44:09,719 --> 01:44:14,158
you're not wasting too too much liquid

2350
01:44:11,719 --> 01:44:16,198
or having to manage too much liquid

2351
01:44:14,158 --> 01:44:20,598
right that's even worse you're juggling

2352
01:44:16,198 --> 01:44:22,439
like big jars and space yeah um so you

2353
01:44:20,599 --> 01:44:23,960
can just get a 50 mil tube rack and

2354
01:44:22,439 --> 01:44:27,158
Shake It you don't have an orbital

2355
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:32,599
Shaker and um but by the time I get to

2356
01:44:27,158 --> 01:44:34,638
that six sample or six pavar um it's

2357
01:44:32,599 --> 01:44:37,239
still good to go if I start pushing it

2358
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:39,800
do like 12 at once the last one I'm

2359
01:44:37,238 --> 01:44:43,799
starting to do is like getting flimsy

2360
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:45,920
and um it'll still grow but we want just

2361
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:50,119
the healthiest high quality tissue going

2362
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:53,199
in right right um so you know as you I

2363
01:44:50,118 --> 01:44:56,079
do a lot of like lean 5S training and

2364
01:44:53,198 --> 01:44:58,919
process procedure optimization stuff for

2365
01:44:56,079 --> 01:45:00,760
Laboratories and operations and that's

2366
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:03,639
why I broke it down because it's easier

2367
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:06,079
to train people pick that up easier

2368
01:45:03,639 --> 01:45:08,440
there's like less steps the steps make

2369
01:45:06,079 --> 01:45:11,639
sense like I'm not having to do

2370
01:45:08,439 --> 01:45:14,479
unnecessary things we we've tested them

2371
01:45:11,639 --> 01:45:18,039
and you can get to the final step of

2372
01:45:14,479 --> 01:45:19,879
dissection faster and and start moving

2373
01:45:18,039 --> 01:45:23,840
so then you don't have a guy in having

2374
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:26,079
to spend all day in a lab to get five

2375
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:29,719
clean samples and throwing out

2376
01:45:26,079 --> 01:45:32,079
everything else right I haven't I'm like

2377
01:45:29,719 --> 01:45:34,359
I haven't seen contamination a long time

2378
01:45:32,079 --> 01:45:37,439
uh which is awesome just be just solid

2379
01:45:34,359 --> 01:45:39,920
best practice and just follow the steps

2380
01:45:37,439 --> 01:45:42,839
and you're good you can just Mass

2381
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:44,599
produce initiations I guess that's

2382
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:47,239
awesome and just get fast just the

2383
01:45:44,599 --> 01:45:51,319
mechanics so going back to the

2384
01:45:47,238 --> 01:45:53,718
hlvd a lot of those things are are still

2385
01:45:51,319 --> 01:45:56,880
valid right best practice ractice

2386
01:45:53,719 --> 01:45:58,920
efficiency because if you're smearing

2387
01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:02,760
viruses all over stuff that's not going

2388
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:04,520
to do so well right um those first two

2389
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:07,079
steps are are very important and have

2390
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:08,679
done really well as far as success

2391
01:46:07,079 --> 01:46:12,760
getting that stretched out piece

2392
01:46:08,679 --> 01:46:16,039
hopefully that's outgrowing or diluting

2393
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:18,239
uh some of that to some extent um and

2394
01:46:16,039 --> 01:46:22,319
I've heard people say that like outgrows

2395
01:46:18,238 --> 01:46:24,079
hlvd in culture right and that's I

2396
01:46:22,319 --> 01:46:25,719
wouldn't be be confident in that I

2397
01:46:24,079 --> 01:46:30,039
haven't tested it but I wouldn't be

2398
01:46:25,719 --> 01:46:32,319
confident um and the mechanical removal

2399
01:46:30,039 --> 01:46:34,840
you can always put broadspectrum

2400
01:46:32,319 --> 01:46:38,599
antibiotics stuff like that in your your

2401
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:41,520
media plate um ribavarin or there's a

2402
01:46:38,599 --> 01:46:44,159
bunch of them you can do but as soon as

2403
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:46,920
you get that growth it's I don't you're

2404
01:46:44,158 --> 01:46:49,559
looking at surface contact right so you

2405
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:51,239
got have antibiotics put it on there and

2406
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:53,520
maybe it'll kill some when it's

2407
01:46:51,238 --> 01:46:55,678
contacting that but it's going to start

2408
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:57,560
growing unless that is getting pulled

2409
01:46:55,679 --> 01:47:02,359
into the tissue like I don't see that

2410
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:06,480
being effective either right um

2411
01:47:02,359 --> 01:47:08,679
so yeah I mean it's really caseby casee

2412
01:47:06,479 --> 01:47:10,678
basis I would say and when people ask me

2413
01:47:08,679 --> 01:47:12,279
to do it I'm like I mean this is the

2414
01:47:10,679 --> 01:47:15,480
truth this is what I've seen and I'm

2415
01:47:12,279 --> 01:47:18,599
trying to study this more at a deeper

2416
01:47:15,479 --> 01:47:21,198
level so I can give you the you know a

2417
01:47:18,599 --> 01:47:23,199
better answer but the the reality is

2418
01:47:21,198 --> 01:47:26,759
like there's there needs to be more

2419
01:47:23,198 --> 01:47:30,279
research um I see on average about 50

2420
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:33,119
50% success rate so I do twice as many

2421
01:47:30,279 --> 01:47:35,759
samples depending on how many I want 50%

2422
01:47:33,118 --> 01:47:37,279
success rate is great yeah some people

2423
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:38,719
that's their entire tissue culture

2424
01:47:37,279 --> 01:47:41,279
success rate so if you're getting that

2425
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:44,118
with hops and vroid that's crazy that's

2426
01:47:41,279 --> 01:47:48,198
extremely successful um I got you you

2427
01:47:44,118 --> 01:47:51,158
know I wanted to um to give a analogy

2428
01:47:48,198 --> 01:47:55,638
again and so kind of what we're talking

2429
01:47:51,158 --> 01:47:58,638
about is it reminds me of cancer so for

2430
01:47:55,639 --> 01:48:02,920
instance with cancer you know they cut

2431
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:04,560
it out right but there's still a chance

2432
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:06,599
that they didn't get it all out and that

2433
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:09,480
it hasn't you know and then you got to

2434
01:48:06,599 --> 01:48:11,520
go and and do it again you know and so

2435
01:48:09,479 --> 01:48:13,559
it's the same thing with tissue cult and

2436
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:14,880
actually with tissue culture I don't

2437
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:17,760
know what they have a better chance of

2438
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:19,520
removing cancer or hop late in vroid but

2439
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:22,280
the bottom line is you have to do the

2440
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:23,800
tissue culture and then you have to test

2441
01:48:22,279 --> 01:48:26,719
and then you have to do it again and

2442
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:29,440
even if you test you might have to test

2443
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:32,039
it again down the line or because it's

2444
01:48:29,439 --> 01:48:33,678
just hard to know if it's gone you know

2445
01:48:32,039 --> 01:48:36,840
so like people think they people think

2446
01:48:33,679 --> 01:48:39,399
they're cured of cancer and then years

2447
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:41,360
later it comes back because it was still

2448
01:48:39,399 --> 01:48:44,359
inside of them somewhere speaking on

2449
01:48:41,359 --> 01:48:48,238
testing and and the length of time from

2450
01:48:44,359 --> 01:48:51,399
your um your zero generation in tissue

2451
01:48:48,238 --> 01:48:53,718
culture from marem where you're aiming

2452
01:48:51,399 --> 01:48:56,319
where the aim is to remove Hops and

2453
01:48:53,719 --> 01:49:00,239
thyroid what is the furthest out you've

2454
01:48:56,319 --> 01:49:03,000
then tested say a um plant that has

2455
01:49:00,238 --> 01:49:06,279
fully come out of tissue culture is a

2456
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:09,439
mother plant or a stock plant at a

2457
01:49:06,279 --> 01:49:10,960
facility that was cleaned up you know

2458
01:49:09,439 --> 01:49:13,039
they removed all their hops slate and

2459
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:16,079
thyroid plants but they sent it out to

2460
01:49:13,039 --> 01:49:18,158
be tissue culture they then uh int took

2461
01:49:16,079 --> 01:49:20,238
those genetics again and started

2462
01:49:18,158 --> 01:49:21,799
following better practices to help

2463
01:49:20,238 --> 01:49:24,879
reduce the potential for Hops and

2464
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:26,520
thyroid um so what's the longest then

2465
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:29,319
that you've been able to go back and

2466
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:31,840
test something that test tested positive

2467
01:49:29,319 --> 01:49:33,880
for Hopson before tissue culture and

2468
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:36,239
then tested negative out of tissue

2469
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:38,880
culture was was there ever something

2470
01:49:36,238 --> 01:49:41,759
that you found you know that after like

2471
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:44,079
15 months like there shouldn't have been

2472
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:47,000
a contamination problem but it did test

2473
01:49:44,079 --> 01:49:49,000
for hops lant again or have you seen

2474
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,238
that if you don't have potential for

2475
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,920
contamination if it's not being

2476
01:49:50,238 --> 01:49:56,198
contaminated that it's been able to just

2477
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:58,399
sustain health and uh uh zero viral

2478
01:49:56,198 --> 01:50:00,839
pressure after yeah what's what's that

2479
01:49:58,399 --> 01:50:02,719
time span you've been able to see

2480
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:04,319
absolutely that's a great question

2481
01:50:02,719 --> 01:50:07,520
because a lot of people assume like

2482
01:50:04,319 --> 01:50:10,679
here's your plant for marem

2483
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:13,119
culture it tested negative you're good

2484
01:50:10,679 --> 01:50:15,920
to go and that's that's not the case

2485
01:50:13,118 --> 01:50:20,839
right because of the nature of the virus

2486
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:22,880
itself um the plant as it gets older and

2487
01:50:20,840 --> 01:50:25,119
you know metabolism starts moving your

2488
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:28,480
root system it's pushing all these

2489
01:50:25,118 --> 01:50:31,920
things around the viral load increases

2490
01:50:28,479 --> 01:50:35,598
um testing in itself the LOD so level of

2491
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:38,319
detection it's only so low that we can

2492
01:50:35,599 --> 01:50:40,000
identify it has the virus right it might

2493
01:50:38,319 --> 01:50:42,679
not be in the piece of tissue that we

2494
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:44,520
took and might and that's why you see

2495
01:50:42,679 --> 01:50:47,078
testing requirements like take some of

2496
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:50,280
this and a lot of it's in the root root

2497
01:50:47,078 --> 01:50:52,799
system that we can test for it right um

2498
01:50:50,279 --> 01:50:55,960
but when they're that little you might

2499
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:59,279
not notice it or detect anything at all

2500
01:50:55,960 --> 01:51:02,520
okay um I might and I'll never tell you

2501
01:50:59,279 --> 01:51:05,359
like put this in your clean grow you're

2502
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:07,040
you're good right um because six months

2503
01:51:05,359 --> 01:51:09,399
down the road all of your plants could

2504
01:51:07,039 --> 01:51:13,439
have it and it's it'll be my fault and

2505
01:51:09,399 --> 01:51:16,279
I'm I'm not gonna I'm not that guy so I

2506
01:51:13,439 --> 01:51:19,039
would say six months and there's people

2507
01:51:16,279 --> 01:51:21,198
that are far more qualified to to speak

2508
01:51:19,039 --> 01:51:24,960
on this than than I am that are studying

2509
01:51:21,198 --> 01:51:28,479
these fire like Tumi and you know um but

2510
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:30,760
from my knowledge and my um you know ask

2511
01:51:28,479 --> 01:51:33,399
asking people and things like that I

2512
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:36,360
would say like six months eight months

2513
01:51:33,399 --> 01:51:37,638
down the road I would still test it it's

2514
01:51:36,359 --> 01:51:40,679
because I'm paranoid and I don't want it

2515
01:51:37,639 --> 01:51:42,639
spreading right um but when it's this

2516
01:51:40,679 --> 01:51:45,480
big I would say you know like a teens

2517
01:51:42,639 --> 01:51:48,159
siiz plant when it has the a fully

2518
01:51:45,479 --> 01:51:51,279
developed root system and it's in that

2519
01:51:48,158 --> 01:51:53,238
um final environment uh I would say

2520
01:51:51,279 --> 01:51:55,039
where you know hotter temperature

2521
01:51:53,238 --> 01:51:56,879
humidity like you're going to you're

2522
01:51:55,039 --> 01:51:59,560
going to flower that out I would say

2523
01:51:56,880 --> 01:52:01,679
that's when you can feel more confident

2524
01:51:59,560 --> 01:52:04,639
you're like okay this thing it's good to

2525
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:07,920
go um by then I would already have

2526
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:10,039
subcultures in there or uh new copies to

2527
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:12,078
where like all right we're clean then

2528
01:52:10,039 --> 01:52:13,960
like release all those subcultures that

2529
01:52:12,078 --> 01:52:16,198
way you have the numbers coming back

2530
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:17,960
into your garden instead of just waiting

2531
01:52:16,198 --> 01:52:21,198
for test to come back and then you have

2532
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:24,198
one plant to start cloning right sure um

2533
01:52:21,198 --> 01:52:26,759
so that's the there strategy behind that

2534
01:52:24,198 --> 01:52:28,439
U not like here's your plant it's you

2535
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:30,639
know test it in six months get back to

2536
01:52:28,439 --> 01:52:33,238
me it's like here's your plant I got 50

2537
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:35,599
of these coming so if we pass that test

2538
01:52:33,238 --> 01:52:38,839
you got 50 new moms coming or how many

2539
01:52:35,599 --> 01:52:42,279
you want sure how far out have you been

2540
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:46,480
able to test like from clonal progyny uh

2541
01:52:42,279 --> 01:52:48,039
and have negative uh test results or

2542
01:52:46,479 --> 01:52:50,319
negative in the sense of that it it no

2543
01:52:48,039 --> 01:52:53,238
longer shows Hops and vroid after

2544
01:52:50,319 --> 01:52:55,158
removing it from that spe specific

2545
01:52:53,238 --> 01:52:57,718
cultivar how long have you been able to

2546
01:52:55,158 --> 01:52:59,719
see it test negatively for I think the

2547
01:52:57,719 --> 01:53:03,560
opposite question is more important

2548
01:52:59,719 --> 01:53:06,000
right that yeah I can test it myself

2549
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:08,280
right I have qpcr gel electropheresis

2550
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:11,238
everything so I use that to just

2551
01:53:08,279 --> 01:53:14,800
validate my process like uh this isn't

2552
01:53:11,238 --> 01:53:16,319
working we got we got to change um and

2553
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:19,440
that's what we want right the the

2554
01:53:16,319 --> 01:53:21,359
biggest issue is here's you know people

2555
01:53:19,439 --> 01:53:24,319
give me their favorite genetic for their

2556
01:53:21,359 --> 01:53:26,158
brand it was like happy to clean it up

2557
01:53:24,319 --> 01:53:28,479
putting it right back into a facility

2558
01:53:26,158 --> 01:53:31,198
that's just filled with viruses right

2559
01:53:28,479 --> 01:53:33,118
right um and I see that all the time

2560
01:53:31,198 --> 01:53:35,198
they're like oh so I'm get Vigor and all

2561
01:53:33,118 --> 01:53:38,118
this like you bite those first couple

2562
01:53:35,198 --> 01:53:40,039
Cycles it's going to perform way better

2563
01:53:38,118 --> 01:53:44,639
um but you're not solving solving the

2564
01:53:40,039 --> 01:53:48,800
issue so they don't have proper cleaning

2565
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:51,800
uh proper Sops in their Garden yeah and

2566
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:53,360
and you know you should always assume

2567
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:58,719
that you have

2568
01:53:53,359 --> 01:54:02,439
viroid and prac practices to not spread

2569
01:53:58,719 --> 01:54:05,039
it you know just kind of like safe sex

2570
01:54:02,439 --> 01:54:07,198
with random people you don't know like

2571
01:54:05,039 --> 01:54:08,399
yeah I mean you're not seeing her piece

2572
01:54:07,198 --> 01:54:12,519
but that doesn't mean she doesn't have

2573
01:54:08,399 --> 01:54:13,960
it you know or other STDs so you got to

2574
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:17,079
be

2575
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:19,639
careful a place like this right and this

2576
01:54:17,078 --> 01:54:22,479
um you see the logo they gave in the new

2577
01:54:19,639 --> 01:54:24,480
hat uh lab roots

2578
01:54:22,479 --> 01:54:27,279
why we are working with companies like

2579
01:54:24,479 --> 01:54:30,118
this we can flush your entire facility

2580
01:54:27,279 --> 01:54:32,880
out right now it's a much different

2581
01:54:30,118 --> 01:54:35,158
picture you're like wait hold on okay

2582
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:38,480
start harvesting those rooms at like

2583
01:54:35,158 --> 01:54:40,559
we'll schedule as these uh clean plants

2584
01:54:38,479 --> 01:54:43,638
come up we'll have a whole room ready

2585
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:45,960
you harvest a room and rotate clean it

2586
01:54:43,639 --> 01:54:48,319
sterilize it here's your first clean set

2587
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:50,560
just don't don't touch it like clean

2588
01:54:48,319 --> 01:54:53,078
room style like don't go in there new

2589
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:55,520
scissors and as they roast out you're

2590
01:54:53,078 --> 01:54:57,000
just flushing your entire facility out

2591
01:54:55,520 --> 01:55:01,440
with your own genetics you know we can

2592
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:04,840
do do that um and that that's what I see

2593
01:55:01,439 --> 01:55:06,559
the next phase of of getting some of

2594
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:09,279
these things restored right it's almost

2595
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:12,320
like a restoration project for for the

2596
01:55:09,279 --> 01:55:15,158
industry man um because there's so many

2597
01:55:12,319 --> 01:55:17,599
good genetics that I definitely don't

2598
01:55:15,158 --> 01:55:20,279
want to lose or because they could be

2599
01:55:17,599 --> 01:55:23,078
studied or they could be used for

2600
01:55:20,279 --> 01:55:25,399
breeding or and and have these kind of

2601
01:55:23,078 --> 01:55:28,599
varieties that um that are just

2602
01:55:25,399 --> 01:55:31,399
phenomenal man um but tools like this is

2603
01:55:28,599 --> 01:55:34,199
like we flush your whole facility out

2604
01:55:31,399 --> 01:55:36,439
you're way more successful and you have

2605
01:55:34,198 --> 01:55:38,439
it's almost like another chance just

2606
01:55:36,439 --> 01:55:40,519
test anything you know have a quarantine

2607
01:55:38,439 --> 01:55:43,598
Proto protocol before bringing something

2608
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:46,119
in your facility right or just hit me up

2609
01:55:43,599 --> 01:55:48,078
we got we got some Awesome Genetics too

2610
01:55:46,118 --> 01:55:50,279
sure um so there's always the the

2611
01:55:48,078 --> 01:55:52,880
functional tools of tissue culture but

2612
01:55:50,279 --> 01:55:54,519
then there's the strategy on how to to

2613
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:57,199
apply it so it's effective and you're

2614
01:55:54,520 --> 01:56:00,960
getting you're like getting the results

2615
01:55:57,198 --> 01:56:02,759
right and that's a big piece I see um a

2616
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:05,279
lot of these places missing is like if

2617
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:07,599
if I install a lab you could flush out

2618
01:56:05,279 --> 01:56:12,279
your entire facility you can you know

2619
01:56:07,599 --> 01:56:15,400
start generating enough stock um to have

2620
01:56:12,279 --> 01:56:17,759
just run I don't recommend propagation

2621
01:56:15,399 --> 01:56:20,638
micro propagation

2622
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:23,039
um unless you know exactly what you're

2623
01:56:20,639 --> 01:56:25,880
doing and you know how to measure it

2624
01:56:23,039 --> 01:56:28,960
right um and that I always take the a

2625
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:31,920
chunk from lean 5S is like deic Define

2626
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:35,118
analyze and proove on Define measure

2627
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:37,078
analyze improve control right and you

2628
01:56:35,118 --> 01:56:40,479
stick to that I apply it just everything

2629
01:56:37,078 --> 01:56:43,679
I'm like doing dishes saying it just

2630
01:56:40,479 --> 01:56:46,759
haunts me in my dreams but there's a lot

2631
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:48,719
I see Jay poking out here you do one

2632
01:56:46,760 --> 01:56:51,880
thing man the way you do

2633
01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:53,039
everything yeah so the the practical

2634
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:55,279
applic

2635
01:56:53,039 --> 01:56:58,198
like we have um some of our other

2636
01:56:55,279 --> 01:57:00,359
partners say like group of just amazing

2637
01:56:58,198 --> 01:57:03,198
scientists we're going to protoplast

2638
01:57:00,359 --> 01:57:06,519
Fusion labs and we create perfect

2639
01:57:03,198 --> 01:57:09,519
hybrids by fusing cells together cross

2640
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:11,199
species hybrids we can do so we're going

2641
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:12,639
to have another episode we're going to

2642
01:57:11,198 --> 01:57:13,960
try and reel it back in a little bit

2643
01:57:12,639 --> 01:57:16,880
here because it sounds like we're going

2644
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:20,520
to need to do another episode um

2645
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:22,719
somebody here you yeah yeah oh good yeah

2646
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:25,599
I'll introduce you to Rael good she's

2647
01:57:22,719 --> 01:57:30,840
from uh this is her lab here you want to

2648
01:57:25,599 --> 01:57:30,840
say hi hello hi very

2649
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:36,039
impressive yeah they're building some

2650
01:57:33,479 --> 01:57:38,000
some awesome stuff out here but um yeah

2651
01:57:36,039 --> 01:57:40,039
we love to connect with you again we'll

2652
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,479
get you some aim you know dissection

2653
01:57:40,039 --> 01:57:43,399
training whatever man we'll get you in

2654
01:57:41,479 --> 01:57:45,078
the lab remotely that's awesome or if

2655
01:57:43,399 --> 01:57:47,598
you guys come to Colorado you're you're

2656
01:57:45,078 --> 01:57:51,399
always welcome so I appreciate that like

2657
01:57:47,599 --> 01:57:53,920
I said I I have to go Jess I can help

2658
01:57:51,399 --> 01:57:56,679
with man nice meeting you

2659
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:58,199
and thank you for joining us Gabby oh

2660
01:57:56,679 --> 01:58:01,039
thank you Nick thanks for inviting me

2661
01:57:58,198 --> 01:58:01,039
what a what a great

2662
01:58:01,279 --> 01:58:07,639
talk cool um so yeah I mean so far we've

2663
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:10,320
really touched on I feel like some

2664
01:58:07,639 --> 01:58:12,440
aspects of the tissue culture side of

2665
01:58:10,319 --> 01:58:16,399
cannabis that a lot of

2666
01:58:12,439 --> 01:58:19,719
people do find very hard to wrap their

2667
01:58:16,399 --> 01:58:23,158
brain around and to there's there's not

2668
01:58:19,719 --> 01:58:25,639
an entry level uh tissue culture you

2669
01:58:23,158 --> 01:58:28,719
know like it you kind of have to jump

2670
01:58:25,639 --> 01:58:31,920
in uh you can't just get your feet wet

2671
01:58:28,719 --> 01:58:33,239
you got to go all the way in um Y and

2672
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:35,800
you've you've touched on a lot of those

2673
01:58:33,238 --> 01:58:39,279
different aspects that really do help

2674
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:41,079
support uh like you've like in your um

2675
01:58:39,279 --> 01:58:44,000
in your mission statement you're you're

2676
01:58:41,078 --> 01:58:46,479
wanting to support what's already here

2677
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:49,599
within the Cannabis industry and use

2678
01:58:46,479 --> 01:58:52,238
this tool and this technology to

2679
01:58:49,599 --> 01:58:55,440
continue that support so that people can

2680
01:58:52,238 --> 01:58:57,399
be more successful or you know find

2681
01:58:55,439 --> 01:59:00,960
their own Niche within the market that

2682
01:58:57,399 --> 01:59:03,479
helps them succeed um like for instance

2683
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:07,399
for my the farm that I help manage we

2684
01:59:03,479 --> 01:59:09,238
have a huge outdoor plot and we grow uh

2685
01:59:07,399 --> 01:59:11,319
over a 100 different cultivars in that

2686
01:59:09,238 --> 01:59:13,519
outdoor plot each year we also have an

2687
01:59:11,319 --> 01:59:17,039
indoor space and the indoor space only

2688
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:19,440
can get up to 22 21 to 22 harvests per

2689
01:59:17,039 --> 01:59:22,479
year and we're typically running only

2690
01:59:19,439 --> 01:59:23,759
between 1 and six cultivars there per

2691
01:59:22,479 --> 01:59:27,078
year so we can't even get through our

2692
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:29,159
full genetic library in a year and the

2693
01:59:27,078 --> 01:59:33,238
maintenance of mother plants and stock

2694
01:59:29,158 --> 01:59:36,118
plants is expensive it's expensive it's

2695
01:59:33,238 --> 01:59:38,638
tedious that's the thing that I find to

2696
01:59:36,118 --> 01:59:41,679
be one of the hardest aspects of

2697
01:59:38,639 --> 01:59:44,639
maintaining a large um stock plant

2698
01:59:41,679 --> 01:59:48,760
population is the constant need for

2699
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:52,560
organization the constant need for

2700
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:55,800
um uh proper techniques with within the

2701
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:58,159
cloning process that if something if you

2702
01:59:55,800 --> 02:00:00,679
get a hiccup it throws your schedule off

2703
01:59:58,158 --> 02:00:02,598
you need to then retake clones it throws

2704
02:00:00,679 --> 02:00:04,560
off if you only have a certain amount of

2705
02:00:02,599 --> 02:00:07,719
space with like we're a small farm we

2706
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:09,520
have limited space so it's it's hard to

2707
02:00:07,719 --> 02:00:13,239
maintain these different populations

2708
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:14,480
also with a small labor force um but

2709
02:00:13,238 --> 02:00:16,839
with tissue

2710
02:00:14,479 --> 02:00:18,919
culture it does seem as though there is

2711
02:00:16,840 --> 02:00:22,599
a lot of opportunity in a lot of

2712
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:24,440
different aspects of cultivation that

2713
02:00:22,599 --> 02:00:28,480
can kind of help

2714
02:00:24,439 --> 02:00:32,960
bring cannabis cultivation overall a few

2715
02:00:28,479 --> 02:00:35,279
steps forward um yeah definitely so with

2716
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:36,960
your experience and like I said before

2717
02:00:35,279 --> 02:00:39,279
we're going to have to come back to do

2718
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:41,078
another episode especially when you're

2719
02:00:39,279 --> 02:00:42,840
back home in your lab because I want to

2720
02:00:41,078 --> 02:00:44,599
go over your your different breeding

2721
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:47,360
practices and some of those projects

2722
02:00:44,599 --> 02:00:49,960
that you've done I'd love little I love

2723
02:00:47,359 --> 02:00:52,399
breeding stuff so it's one of the like

2724
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:54,480
real fun hobby aspects of cannabis

2725
02:00:52,399 --> 02:00:56,879
cultivation I feel like that anybody can

2726
02:00:54,479 --> 02:00:58,718
get into and they can really create

2727
02:00:56,880 --> 02:01:01,159
something that's really unique to them

2728
02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:03,679
it's almost like having a having that

2729
02:01:01,158 --> 02:01:05,279
awesome family recipe that you share

2730
02:01:03,679 --> 02:01:06,880
with people and they're like oh my God

2731
02:01:05,279 --> 02:01:08,759
that's the best food in the world how

2732
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:11,359
did you make this like we've just been

2733
02:01:08,760 --> 02:01:14,280
doing this forever um Keeps Us attached

2734
02:01:11,359 --> 02:01:16,479
to the the plant you know

2735
02:01:14,279 --> 02:01:18,319
absolutely so like I was saying though

2736
02:01:16,479 --> 02:01:20,559
we need to do another episode talk about

2737
02:01:18,319 --> 02:01:22,840
your breeding talk about your actual hom

2738
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:24,679
growing practices current ly where

2739
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:27,480
you're keeping these genetics alive

2740
02:01:24,679 --> 02:01:30,199
outside of culture because the inv vitro

2741
02:01:27,479 --> 02:01:31,799
culture you know that's one aspect of it

2742
02:01:30,198 --> 02:01:35,118
but you still then need to have the

2743
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:39,119
ability to have those plants in a actual

2744
02:01:35,118 --> 02:01:41,439
um growing environment uh yeah X vitro

2745
02:01:39,118 --> 02:01:43,118
and uh the different techniques and

2746
02:01:41,439 --> 02:01:46,238
stuff that you use there in order to

2747
02:01:43,118 --> 02:01:47,399
maintain a certain health I feel like

2748
02:01:46,238 --> 02:01:50,359
when you're looking at it through a

2749
02:01:47,399 --> 02:01:52,158
scientific lens of these are either

2750
02:01:50,359 --> 02:01:53,719
going to be for tissue culture they're

2751
02:01:52,158 --> 02:01:56,279
coming out of tissue culture and I need

2752
02:01:53,719 --> 02:01:59,639
to maintain a specific amount of Health

2753
02:01:56,279 --> 02:02:02,800
that ends up leading to really refined

2754
02:01:59,639 --> 02:02:06,239
cultivation practices really refined

2755
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:07,760
Environmental Lighting um irrigation

2756
02:02:06,238 --> 02:02:12,359
practices

2757
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:14,960
that are almost they're so essential for

2758
02:02:12,359 --> 02:02:18,118
actual cultivation of cannabis for

2759
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:21,439
flower production that I feel like we'd

2760
02:02:18,118 --> 02:02:23,880
be able to teach a lot of people more

2761
02:02:21,439 --> 02:02:25,479
when we dive back into that but

2762
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:28,400
considering you've had a lot of

2763
02:02:25,479 --> 02:02:30,718
experience in the illicit Market uh back

2764
02:02:28,399 --> 02:02:32,960
in the day you were able to translate

2765
02:02:30,719 --> 02:02:37,319
that into what sounded like helping with

2766
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:40,039
different uh medical and uh earlier uh

2767
02:02:37,319 --> 02:02:42,479
programs within say Colorado and around

2768
02:02:40,039 --> 02:02:44,599
those areas and then you also continue

2769
02:02:42,479 --> 02:02:46,519
with your home growing and your breeding

2770
02:02:44,599 --> 02:02:49,000
and all these different practices and

2771
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:51,320
aspects of the industry that you're in

2772
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:52,719
um I feel like you would be a great

2773
02:02:51,319 --> 02:02:56,078
person to ask ask where do you want to

2774
02:02:52,719 --> 02:02:58,480
see the Cannabis industry change or

2775
02:02:56,078 --> 02:03:01,319
develop in the next 5 to 10 years that

2776
02:02:58,479 --> 02:03:03,238
you feel as though we're missing

2777
02:03:01,319 --> 02:03:06,399
currently

2778
02:03:03,238 --> 02:03:07,479
um there's a last there's a lot there

2779
02:03:06,399 --> 02:03:10,719
you know

2780
02:03:07,479 --> 02:03:13,598
because I I started at least

2781
02:03:10,719 --> 02:03:16,719
professional cultivation and management

2782
02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:19,119
and you know um

2783
02:03:16,719 --> 02:03:21,239
coo restructuring other people's

2784
02:03:19,118 --> 02:03:22,279
programs all that stuff so I've seen a

2785
02:03:21,238 --> 02:03:24,118
lot

2786
02:03:22,279 --> 02:03:26,679
and I was able to ask a lot of these

2787
02:03:24,118 --> 02:03:31,118
questions and get different perspectives

2788
02:03:26,679 --> 02:03:34,520
right um I would like to see really you

2789
02:03:31,118 --> 02:03:36,118
know best practice stuff that um a lot

2790
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:38,480
of that's coming out too especially with

2791
02:03:36,118 --> 02:03:41,319
the virus and me like if you just follow

2792
02:03:38,479 --> 02:03:43,399
this it's you keep contamination out you

2793
02:03:41,319 --> 02:03:46,238
keep pests and things like that to

2794
02:03:43,399 --> 02:03:50,078
create a clean product right so that's

2795
02:03:46,238 --> 02:03:52,479
one testing um testing is all over the

2796
02:03:50,078 --> 02:03:55,439
place we had you know whole Lab we'd

2797
02:03:52,479 --> 02:03:57,279
send our stuff out for compliance we'd

2798
02:03:55,439 --> 02:04:00,078
run the same samples on our equipment

2799
02:03:57,279 --> 02:04:02,439
and another lab they're all different

2800
02:04:00,078 --> 02:04:06,359
right so standardizing that because if

2801
02:04:02,439 --> 02:04:10,078
it does become medicine we need to know

2802
02:04:06,359 --> 02:04:14,920
that those results are reliable and we

2803
02:04:10,078 --> 02:04:19,158
can use it as such right um that goes

2804
02:04:14,920 --> 02:04:21,800
also also into um what genetics are

2805
02:04:19,158 --> 02:04:24,078
truly you know everyone's renaming the

2806
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:26,800
find a good cut and then rename it how

2807
02:04:24,078 --> 02:04:31,279
do we build around that to where it is

2808
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:33,440
um oh thank you um how do we how are we

2809
02:04:31,279 --> 02:04:35,920
sure that if I go to this dispensary or

2810
02:04:33,439 --> 02:04:37,319
the you know wherever that evolves to

2811
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:39,480
and I need

2812
02:04:37,319 --> 02:04:42,599
medicine how do I know it's the same

2813
02:04:39,479 --> 02:04:45,839
plant that is helping me right right um

2814
02:04:42,599 --> 02:04:48,400
I think there's be application of uh so

2815
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:50,480
pharmacogenomics right we have the

2816
02:04:48,399 --> 02:04:52,359
Cannabis genome we can do that we have

2817
02:04:50,479 --> 02:04:53,799
the human genome

2818
02:04:52,359 --> 02:04:56,598
um some of the groups I'm working with

2819
02:04:53,800 --> 02:04:58,159
is to connect those pieces to see like

2820
02:04:56,599 --> 02:05:01,159
we could both smoke the same joint and

2821
02:04:58,158 --> 02:05:03,920
I'm freaking out and you're like I feel

2822
02:05:01,158 --> 02:05:06,118
great I love this our body just like all

2823
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:08,399
these plants are different our receptors

2824
02:05:06,118 --> 02:05:10,679
our brains are formed differently our

2825
02:05:08,399 --> 02:05:12,078
experience has shaped the development of

2826
02:05:10,679 --> 02:05:16,039
those right we know about the

2827
02:05:12,078 --> 02:05:19,319
methylation and how that is an aspect of

2828
02:05:16,039 --> 02:05:22,719
just how life um evolves and continues

2829
02:05:19,319 --> 02:05:25,519
to grow so how do we unravel that to

2830
02:05:22,719 --> 02:05:28,359
where we understand application for

2831
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:33,559
medicinal purposes and standardize those

2832
02:05:28,359 --> 02:05:35,880
pieces um and I would also like to help

2833
02:05:33,559 --> 02:05:39,239
like because we've had to create hybrid

2834
02:05:35,880 --> 02:05:41,480
breeding programs right classical

2835
02:05:39,238 --> 02:05:45,399
methodology I couldn't use I couldn't

2836
02:05:41,479 --> 02:05:48,198
grow fields for statistical analysis and

2837
02:05:45,399 --> 02:05:51,238
because of Regulation and compliance or

2838
02:05:48,198 --> 02:05:53,399
it was just not cost effective um how do

2839
02:05:51,238 --> 02:05:55,959
we get

2840
02:05:53,399 --> 02:05:57,839
better access for research and

2841
02:05:55,960 --> 02:06:01,039
development I know some of those are are

2842
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:04,920
starting to evolve as well um but if

2843
02:06:01,039 --> 02:06:08,439
we're not able to grow these plants to

2844
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:12,199
study them and improve without breaking

2845
02:06:08,439 --> 02:06:15,078
the bank um then that side is not going

2846
02:06:12,198 --> 02:06:17,638
to continue to evolve either right yeah

2847
02:06:15,078 --> 02:06:19,158
um so we we're all part of a groups

2848
02:06:17,639 --> 02:06:22,159
different groups to push these things

2849
02:06:19,158 --> 02:06:23,558
forward and uh contribute

2850
02:06:22,158 --> 02:06:25,679
so I think if you have your own breeding

2851
02:06:23,559 --> 02:06:29,039
program you have unique genetics for

2852
02:06:25,679 --> 02:06:31,960
your brand that we can fingerprint ID

2853
02:06:29,039 --> 02:06:35,000
those to at the genetic level um so we

2854
02:06:31,960 --> 02:06:36,559
know that's yours and that adds more

2855
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:40,078
power to the brand and builds their

2856
02:06:36,559 --> 02:06:43,679
customer base and so breeding programs

2857
02:06:40,078 --> 02:06:45,399
and Ed more education behind um how you

2858
02:06:43,679 --> 02:06:49,599
can do this effectively in in a

2859
02:06:45,399 --> 02:06:53,198
controlled way um I keep going but a a

2860
02:06:49,599 --> 02:06:56,159
lot of this into more the the molecular

2861
02:06:53,198 --> 02:06:59,439
marker assisted selection and being able

2862
02:06:56,158 --> 02:07:01,960
to truly pinpoint some of these things

2863
02:06:59,439 --> 02:07:03,799
um using te

2864
02:07:01,960 --> 02:07:05,559
biotechnology I you know it feel it

2865
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:07,719
sounds like we can wrap up a lot of what

2866
02:07:05,559 --> 02:07:10,119
you'd like to see in the better

2867
02:07:07,719 --> 02:07:13,480
application of the information we have

2868
02:07:10,118 --> 02:07:14,839
available and putting those practices

2869
02:07:13,479 --> 02:07:18,718
into

2870
02:07:14,840 --> 02:07:22,440
use and not not falling back to these

2871
02:07:18,719 --> 02:07:25,198
old you know quote unquote Bro Science

2872
02:07:22,439 --> 02:07:28,759
ways of growing cannabis and producing

2873
02:07:25,198 --> 02:07:30,879
cannabis um like it's still the illicit

2874
02:07:28,760 --> 02:07:33,679
Market you know like taking this and

2875
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:35,679
trying to truly quantify and qualify the

2876
02:07:33,679 --> 02:07:37,359
different aspects of the cannabis plant

2877
02:07:35,679 --> 02:07:41,559
how it interacts with the human endoc

2878
02:07:37,359 --> 02:07:44,399
canono system and trying to use proper

2879
02:07:41,559 --> 02:07:46,520
studies and and test samples and test

2880
02:07:44,399 --> 02:07:50,078
groups and different populations of

2881
02:07:46,520 --> 02:07:52,000
users to help understand how things

2882
02:07:50,078 --> 02:07:54,519
affect certain people

2883
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:56,319
how we can then take that data and give

2884
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:59,559
it to other people so that they don't

2885
02:07:56,319 --> 02:08:03,799
have to be a guinea pig for their own

2886
02:07:59,559 --> 02:08:06,199
medicinal needs um yeah exactly and you

2887
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:09,360
know I talked to groups that are um you

2888
02:08:06,198 --> 02:08:12,519
one has a daughter one has a a brother I

2889
02:08:09,359 --> 02:08:14,920
have lots of friends I've seen some that

2890
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:18,400
like they've cured their cancer like my

2891
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:21,078
best friend he had severe um lung cancer

2892
02:08:18,399 --> 02:08:21,960
and it's completely gone wow why do that

2893
02:08:21,078 --> 02:08:24,880
happen

2894
02:08:21,960 --> 02:08:26,719
you know how do we change some of these

2895
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:29,239
people's lives and have a positive

2896
02:08:26,719 --> 02:08:30,559
impact from what we're all of us are

2897
02:08:29,238 --> 02:08:32,678
just really good at I know some

2898
02:08:30,559 --> 02:08:35,360
cultivators that are far better than I

2899
02:08:32,679 --> 02:08:37,319
am I have a bad neck and back now

2900
02:08:35,359 --> 02:08:40,679
because I've been growing weed for so

2901
02:08:37,319 --> 02:08:44,118
long but how can we just organize

2902
02:08:40,679 --> 02:08:46,078
together and um share more information

2903
02:08:44,118 --> 02:08:47,759
because I I feel like that's a a huge

2904
02:08:46,078 --> 02:08:50,158
start right there just being able to

2905
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:53,440
freely talk about what's working and how

2906
02:08:50,158 --> 02:08:55,078
we can work together um and as a company

2907
02:08:53,439 --> 02:08:57,238
you know my my partner and I were like

2908
02:08:55,078 --> 02:09:00,279
if we can pay the bills and just keep

2909
02:08:57,238 --> 02:09:03,158
moving it'll happen right yeah we're

2910
02:09:00,279 --> 02:09:05,519
working on powerful tools for breeding

2911
02:09:03,158 --> 02:09:08,679
and biotechnology and connecting these

2912
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:10,880
other networks so um we can at least

2913
02:09:08,679 --> 02:09:14,319
contribute you know to that but it's

2914
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:16,159
can't just be you know we um so I love

2915
02:09:14,319 --> 02:09:18,118

2916
02:09:16,158 --> 02:09:21,399
used to be man like Growers Growers

2917
02:09:18,118 --> 02:09:23,000

2918
02:09:21,399 --> 02:09:25,238
positive change because it it is

2919
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:28,118
evolving it is going to continue to to

2920
02:09:25,238 --> 02:09:30,718
evolve and change um and it shouldn't be

2921
02:09:28,118 --> 02:09:34,719
just the people that have a ton of money

2922
02:09:30,719 --> 02:09:37,039
that um is allowed you know so anything

2923

um these guys here are are in the same

2926
02:09:43,158 --> 02:09:49,279
mindset this company uh lab Roots too

2927
02:09:46,439 --> 02:09:52,078
like we're we're hoping to use a lot of

2928
02:09:49,279 --> 02:09:54,679
their experience to scale and and have

2929
02:09:52,078 --> 02:09:56,039
some some power behind this too but it's

2930
02:09:54,679 --> 02:09:59,679
still going to take work to create a

2931
02:09:56,039 --> 02:10:01,840
model that we can keep within the the

2932
02:09:59,679 --> 02:10:03,800
community and the people you know right

2933
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:05,760
so I mean that's why I call this show

2934
02:10:03,800 --> 02:10:07,760
The Way We Grow because it has two

2935
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:11,400
meanings right I want to teach people

2936
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:15,280
how to grow commercially homeg growing

2937
02:10:11,399 --> 02:10:16,839
hobby tissue culture anything in between

2938
02:10:15,279 --> 02:10:19,000
I want to make sure that people have the

2939
02:10:16,840 --> 02:10:22,440
tools at their disposal and the

2940
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:30,078
resources they need to access knowledge

2941
02:10:22,439 --> 02:10:30,078
that has been withheld or gate kept for

2942
02:10:30,359 --> 02:10:34,279
decades not only do I want to help

2943
02:10:32,599 --> 02:10:36,279
people learn how to grow I want to grow

2944
02:10:34,279 --> 02:10:38,639
the community as a whole and I want to

2945
02:10:36,279 --> 02:10:41,679
grow the collaborative effort between

2946
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:44,039
different Growers and people that are in

2947
02:10:41,679 --> 02:10:46,279
cannabis and cannabis adjacent

2948
02:10:44,039 --> 02:10:48,639
businesses

2949
02:10:46,279 --> 02:10:51,399
because just like any other industry

2950
02:10:48,639 --> 02:10:54,039
that has really taken off it required

2951
02:10:51,399 --> 02:10:56,839
immense amounts of collaboration between

2952
02:10:54,039 --> 02:10:58,880
those who were working to really

2953
02:10:56,840 --> 02:11:01,159
progress the field in a way that they

2954
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:04,440
thought help the most people

2955
02:11:01,158 --> 02:11:06,799
possible and Y people like yourself who

2956
02:11:04,439 --> 02:11:10,399
are out there trying to help Implement

2957
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:14,199
best practices and um remove different

2958
02:11:10,399 --> 02:11:18,439
stigmas from practices that have been

2959
02:11:14,198 --> 02:11:20,719
controversial or argued about ad nauseum

2960
02:11:18,439 --> 02:11:23,158
you you're so valuable for the community

2961
02:11:20,719 --> 02:11:26,000
and for making sure that we do continue

2962
02:11:23,158 --> 02:11:27,558
to grow as a whole that that's why I

2963
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:29,399
have this podcast that's why I want to

2964
02:11:27,559 --> 02:11:31,400
get people on here like yourself and get

2965
02:11:29,399 --> 02:11:33,000
these stories told and get this

2966
02:11:31,399 --> 02:11:35,039
information out there because now people

2967
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:37,559
can reach out to you knowing that you

2968
02:11:35,039 --> 02:11:39,000
have this background and you know I keep

2969
02:11:37,559 --> 02:11:40,639
saying it we got to get back into

2970
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:42,039
another episode to talk more about your

2971
02:11:40,639 --> 02:11:44,359
homeg growing because some of the things

2972
02:11:42,039 --> 02:11:47,118
that I do like to impart the information

2973
02:11:44,359 --> 02:11:50,158
of is you know pitfalls for hom Growers

2974
02:11:47,118 --> 02:11:52,078
what you can teach new Growers um where

2975
02:11:50,158 --> 02:11:53,598
you found success in your home grow and

2976
02:11:52,078 --> 02:11:55,198
failures in your home grow and how you

2977
02:11:53,599 --> 02:11:57,119
learned from that and those are all

2978
02:11:55,198 --> 02:11:59,439
typically things that I touch on but

2979
02:11:57,118 --> 02:12:01,479
we're already kind of budding up on

2980
02:11:59,439 --> 02:12:03,479
where I feel like this would be a good

2981
02:12:01,479 --> 02:12:05,158
ending place so I'm going to actually

2982
02:12:03,479 --> 02:12:07,839
just kind of reain it in really quick

2983
02:12:05,158 --> 02:12:09,598
and wrap it up with a a few rapid fire

2984
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:12,319
questions that are always really fun to

2985
02:12:09,599 --> 02:12:14,559
hear from someone like yourself you're

2986
02:12:12,319 --> 02:12:16,558
you know you're a professional operating

2987
02:12:14,559 --> 02:12:19,800
at a high level within the Cannabis

2988
02:12:16,559 --> 02:12:22,960
industry but you still love cannabis so

2989
02:12:19,800 --> 02:12:25,360

Legend yeah it's such a tight-knit

3017
02:13:39,238 --> 02:13:43,919
community that it's really interesting

3018
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:46,118
to see how quickly uh things can happen

3019
02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:47,719
when you connect with one person and how

3020
02:13:46,118 --> 02:13:48,920
closely they might be tied to someone

3021
02:13:47,719 --> 02:13:51,719
else that you've connected with and

3022
02:13:48,920 --> 02:13:53,639
you're like like it's amazing 5 degrees

3023
02:13:51,719 --> 02:13:55,239
of separation is almost it's only like

3024
02:13:53,639 --> 02:13:56,639
two or three in the Cannabis industry

3025
02:13:55,238 --> 02:13:59,039
it's really it's really fascinating I

3026
02:13:56,639 --> 02:14:01,960
usually hide in behind the scenes I go

3027
02:13:59,039 --> 02:14:04,559
about lowkey high-tech CU I just stay in

3028
02:14:01,960 --> 02:14:07,000
the shadows just doing you know whatever

3029
02:14:04,559 --> 02:14:10,279
but um after talking to you I was like

3030
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:12,078
man this like I want to be a part of

3031
02:14:10,279 --> 02:14:15,078
this because that like we discussed on

3032
02:14:12,078 --> 02:14:17,519
the phone it's just like um I want to

3033
02:14:15,078 --> 02:14:20,000
use my my abilities in exchange

3034
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:21,480
knowledge and help support and because

3035
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:25,679
it changed my life you know and

3036
02:14:21,479 --> 02:14:27,519
hopefully I can at least Inspire and um

3037
02:14:25,679 --> 02:14:30,920
could just change the direction of uh

3038
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:33,000
somebody's path or build into something

3039
02:14:30,920 --> 02:14:36,039
much bigger which um that's that's

3040
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:37,559
fantastic so that's awesome well so

3041
02:14:36,039 --> 02:14:40,399
favorite strain sounds like you got a

3042
02:14:37,559 --> 02:14:42,639
few uh one from back in the day after

3043
02:14:40,399 --> 02:14:45,759
light your buddy grew you got some ones

3044
02:14:42,639 --> 02:14:47,840
that you're working on now um and so the

3045
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:49,679
next question of course is who's your

3046
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:53,039
favorite breeder of all

3047
02:14:49,679 --> 02:14:53,039
time uh

3048
02:14:53,479 --> 02:14:56,919
that

3049
02:14:54,399 --> 02:14:59,039
is well I have favorite breeders for

3050
02:14:56,920 --> 02:15:02,000
different reasons like some of these

3051
02:14:59,039 --> 02:15:04,118
Kentucky guys they'll just kind of like

3052
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:06,880
smell the wind you know and they're like

3053
02:15:04,118 --> 02:15:08,799
it's going to be a good crap like those

3054
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:10,960
guys because they have some stuff that's

3055
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:13,159
like doesn't even have a name they're

3056
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:16,000
like it's just weed like man this is the

3057
02:15:13,158 --> 02:15:18,879
best weed I've ever seen and I just love

3058
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:21,679
the I love that style they pick what's

3059
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:24,199
they select what's best to them and

3060
02:15:21,679 --> 02:15:28,319
their family and there's so much meaning

3061
02:15:24,198 --> 02:15:31,638
behind that um then other breeders I

3062
02:15:28,319 --> 02:15:34,399
don't know man it's because I have I've

3063
02:15:31,639 --> 02:15:36,559
had such a huge collection for so long

3064
02:15:34,399 --> 02:15:38,279
that I've just I have my own breeding

3065
02:15:36,559 --> 02:15:41,279
lines and stuff

3066
02:15:38,279 --> 02:15:42,599
but you I would say like some of the old

3067
02:15:41,279 --> 02:15:46,158
subcool

3068
02:15:42,599 --> 02:15:49,119
stuff was really exciting just like the

3069
02:15:46,158 --> 02:15:51,799
tur the profile like Vortex and some of

3070
02:15:49,118 --> 02:15:55,359
these that I used to get back in the

3071
02:15:51,800 --> 02:15:58,239
day um and I had some of his collection

3072
02:15:55,359 --> 02:16:02,598
left too that I need to pop you're the

3073
02:15:58,238 --> 02:16:06,558
second person to say his his Vortex oh

3074
02:16:02,599 --> 02:16:08,840
vort the the baby poop smells oh

3075
02:16:06,559 --> 02:16:10,880
man other than that I mean there's a lot

3076
02:16:08,840 --> 02:16:14,440
of talented breeders that are breeding

3077
02:16:10,880 --> 02:16:16,239
for you know the way like with the I

3078
02:16:14,439 --> 02:16:18,879
just picture them as isolated

3079
02:16:16,238 --> 02:16:22,118
populations almost and I feel like a lot

3080
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:23,599
of that is just bottlenecked and

3081
02:16:22,118 --> 02:16:26,519
being changed you know and that's

3082
02:16:23,599 --> 02:16:29,880
something I have some really crazy like

3083
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:32,679
different genetics that maybe we could

3084
02:16:29,880 --> 02:16:35,439
collab and start you know expanding the

3085
02:16:32,679 --> 02:16:37,200
gene pool to get more unique things and

3086
02:16:35,439 --> 02:16:39,000
stuff like that but there's just a ton

3087
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:42,000
of I can't even keep up with them these

3088
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:44,599
days I'm just in the lab just focusing

3089
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:47,718
on what I'm doing most of the time I

3090
02:16:44,599 --> 02:16:49,079
feel that and I you know the guys are

3091
02:16:47,718 --> 02:16:51,478
just making their own crosses because

3092
02:16:49,079 --> 02:16:53,079
they're passionate I I would say that's

3093
02:16:51,478 --> 02:16:55,398
well because that's where I started you

3094
02:16:53,079 --> 02:16:58,359
know like it's special to them and when

3095
02:16:55,398 --> 02:17:00,079
I'm able to smoke or grow that I think

3096
02:16:58,359 --> 02:17:01,840
that has the most meaning to me you know

3097
02:17:00,079 --> 02:17:04,159
it's not like a name or I don't care

3098
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:07,120
about any of that I care about the

3099
02:17:04,159 --> 02:17:09,799
connection and the experience with the

3100
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:11,760
people and the plants that that uh ties

3101
02:17:09,799 --> 02:17:13,920
it together you know it sounds like

3102
02:17:11,760 --> 02:17:16,639
you're a fan of anybody breeding uh with

3103
02:17:13,920 --> 02:17:18,000
passion and and an intent in mind rather

3104
02:17:16,638 --> 02:17:21,638
than a quick

3105
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:23,718
Buck yeah let let's put some some

3106
02:17:21,638 --> 02:17:26,119
biotechnology and you know high level

3107
02:17:23,718 --> 02:17:28,358
stuff behind it and then like I said all

3108
02:17:26,120 --> 02:17:30,399
of a sudden like I'll you extract DNA

3109
02:17:28,359 --> 02:17:35,000
once you're like that's not that's not

3110
02:17:30,398 --> 02:17:36,879
that hard yeah and maybe they can have

3111
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:39,718
uh some of the opportunities that I was

3112
02:17:36,879 --> 02:17:41,358
gifted you know just um but that's what

3113
02:17:39,718 --> 02:17:42,799
that's what I got into this that's why

3114
02:17:41,359 --> 02:17:45,159
what excited me and what I wanted to

3115
02:17:42,799 --> 02:17:47,879
pursue and it just evolved and I kept

3116
02:17:45,159 --> 02:17:49,799
going and learning and um I was only be

3117
02:17:47,879 --> 02:17:52,518
able able to do that because I was just

3118
02:17:49,799 --> 02:17:54,438
open and um

3119
02:17:52,519 --> 02:17:57,760
willing to learn you know and continue

3120
02:17:54,439 --> 02:18:00,398
learning so I wish that upon everybody

3121
02:17:57,760 --> 02:18:01,920
for sure all right well last question

3122
02:18:00,398 --> 02:18:03,279
what's your most memorable cannabis

3123
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:05,200
related

3124
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:09,399
experience oh

3125
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:11,880
man there's uh I've lived a long life

3126
02:18:09,398 --> 02:18:14,318
canis

3127
02:18:11,879 --> 02:18:16,079
um the guy that brought over the Afghan

3128
02:18:14,318 --> 02:18:19,239
nor the lights right and my friend's GNA

3129

3132
02:18:26,318 --> 02:18:30,558

3133
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:36,040
that's not weed like that's just fake

3134
02:18:30,558 --> 02:18:38,518
like looks crazy um and loaded up a bong

3135
02:18:36,040 --> 02:18:42,319
I ripped it and then stood up I'm like

3136
02:18:38,519 --> 02:18:45,800
62 63 blood just rushed my head and I

3137
02:18:42,318 --> 02:18:47,439
like passed out almost broke a glass

3138

table in

3139
02:18:47,439 --> 02:18:53,439
half that's like the the one that I will

3140
02:18:49,959 --> 02:18:54,959
never forget it was embarrassing but um

3141
02:18:53,439 --> 02:18:57,760
so that had to be cool back then I was

3142
02:18:54,959 --> 02:18:59,718
like younger I was like I'm fine yep I

3143
02:18:57,760 --> 02:19:01,639
mean there's so many memories along the

3144
02:18:59,718 --> 02:19:03,718
way though that I I'm sure I'll think of

3145
02:19:01,638 --> 02:19:06,279
man oh and I got I've totally passed out

3146
02:19:03,718 --> 02:19:08,558
from a gravity bong hit before just

3147
02:19:06,280 --> 02:19:09,760
going from the bucket standing up

3148
02:19:08,558 --> 02:19:12,000
hitting it and then just standing there

3149
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:16,280
and being like I held this for too long

3150
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:18,120
Boop oh man I was like all right well I

3151
02:19:16,280 --> 02:19:19,559
guess the the other one that sticks out

3152
02:19:18,120 --> 02:19:21,639
which is hilarious I mean we're in

3153
02:19:19,558 --> 02:19:24,039
Kentucky right we some

you so much for joining us today and

3193
02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:58,960
telling your story of how you got into

3194
02:20:56,840 --> 02:21:01,000
tissue culture some of your background

3195
02:20:58,959 --> 02:21:02,559
in the Cannabis industry and sort of

3196
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:05,439
where you want to see things go from

3197

here um you're an inspiration for a lot

3198
02:21:05,439 --> 02:21:09,600
of people that want to get into tissue

3199
02:21:07,079 --> 02:21:11,000
culture and are scientifically minded

3200
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:13,200
but want to get into the Cannabis

3201
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:15,680
industry and have seen some barriers to

3202
02:21:13,200 --> 02:21:17,840
entry due to the the stigma and

3203
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:20,120
stipulations of what is required in the

3204
