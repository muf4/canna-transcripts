during my time when I was in

60
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:12,000
university

61
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:17,319
um the quality of the German weed became

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,639
so poor and also um the people were um

63
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:22,158
putting additives to bring more weight

64
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:25,158
to the Black Market Wheat in Germany

65
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:30,079
with all different kinds with sand with

66
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:33,399
crushed glass with um also um with

67
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:38,400
hairspray and all all really disgusting

68
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:41,519
stuff and this was um um a period where

69
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,519
there was time where I had to write my

70
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,560
my exams and I was smoking a little bit

71
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,158
of Wheat and I found a back seat and I

72
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,598
think also with this uh a lot of people

73

during this years yeah so let me just

120
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:12,319
ask a question when you said um that you

121
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:15,279
were on the

122
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,680
forums it was 100% in

123
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:21,079
English um it was I was in German there

124
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:25,079
would have been two boards two forums in

125
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:27,198
German and for sure um I see Mech one of

126
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:30,079
the most important boards in my life I

127
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:33,000
would say and in Germany there have been

128
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:38,159
two um relevant forums the one was

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,720
called grower do CH for Swiss because

130
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,680
for the safety was in Switzerland yeah

131
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,240
paranoia time and the other one was

132
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,680
called H hburg um hemp

133
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,759
castle and yeah this have been the most

134
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,918
influential boards but um like we talked

135
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,439
before we started the podcast I speak

136
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,519
German Spanish and English and um during

137
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:03,478
this time also the internet was so small

138
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:05,799
compared to today that I was really

139
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:08,680
absorbing the knowledge in three

140
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,038
different languages guys goosebumbs

141
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,280
really completely my whole body because

142
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:18,360
you now that I'm talk I get reminded of

143
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:20,519
during this beginning times and yeah and

144
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,680
this was the beginning reading in fre

145
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:27,758
languages absorbing everything about

146
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,598
cannabis and starting to grow and um

147
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:34,800
like I said I start to learn so much

148
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:37,120
much about biology chemistry physics and

149
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,240
I have to say something I was studying

150
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:45,120
economics but after this small little

151
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,680
plant germinated in my uh garden and in

152
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,120
the in the

153
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,840
window I studied

154
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:56,199
cannabis by myself I'm I can claim that

155
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:59,719
there since then since 2010 I can say

156
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:02,759
every day at least one to two hours

157
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,280
reading and learning about this plant

158
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,280

159
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:11,199

00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:33,199
some Cuts I mean we have the jagon cot

168
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:37,000
for for example you know that one yeah

169
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,879
Jack Flash number five from s seats yeah

170
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,158
and there is a like offsprings from that

171
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:45,120
you know which is gesin and then yeah

172
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:47,200
you know some some guys did some

173
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,480
pollination with that because the the

174
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,080
the jagon was a producer still is yeah

175
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,720
but it's still it's a little bit in the

176
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,278
background today because the American

177
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,920
genetics know are more popular and but

178
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,600
there is there is shops that still have

179
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:01,838
these genetics right so the the plant

180
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,120
that that Dr Kos put out still alive

181
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,079
it's still around you know yeah it's a

182
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,839
it's it's a building block people are

183
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:11,359
still requesting this Cuts also in the

184
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,760
shops uh in Austria where they sell

185
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,440
cuttings and all the stuff and there is

186
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,240
also from the from the older Generations

187
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,040
a lot of people who are now waiting to

188
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,919
get their hands again on this genetics

189
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:26,439
mhm you know how met how how I met Gabby

190
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:28,838
I met Gabby through the the search for

191
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,480
the cam do you know I was looking for

192
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:34,320
the cam do it's because gab is directly

193
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,920
related to you know to giving it to

194
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,640
other people who are now having it and

195
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:42,759
uh you know it's like the cam do is a

196
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:46,559
legend in USA cam do is one of the um I

197
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:48,958
say there are certain backbone genetics

198
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:52,119
where you can see that so many other

199
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:54,958
crosses have been created with that and

200
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,799
Cham unique flavor everybody who knows

201
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:00,559
the original who gets also blind his

202
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:02,439
nose on a jar in immediately recognize

203
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:05,319
the

204
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,240
cham my theory is that the all the ogs

205
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,480
come from the cam you know like not all

206
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:14,278
but it's really related to OG plants the

207
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:17,399
OG Kush that we first had it's like all

208
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:21,039
it has all cam do in behind of it it's

209
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:23,720
all C do and of course out cross and

210
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:26,599
back crosses and but we are we are all

211
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,440
on in this part right uh can you tell me

212
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,600
uh which place did you grow up in

213
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,320
Germany where um I I have been growing

214
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:38,079
up in the

215
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:40,399
north um I had um um my my childhood was

216
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:43,838
in Mexico because my dad worked there

217
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:46,159
but when I we came back with six years

218
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,079
um I was um growing up in brown schwag

219
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:49,838
this is also where I'm now after living

220
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:53,359
in a lot of different places in the

221
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,880
world um I found my wife in my hometown

222
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,399
visiting my parents and yeah now I'm

223
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:01,879
back here um I started to grow at the

224
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,919
northern Coast um in Germany where I was

225
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:07,399
studying really

226
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:09,479
cold wet climate and I also immediately

227
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:12,600
tried outdoor in all different growth

228
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:17,639
Styles so yeah I'm I'm a nordish guy in

229
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:20,000
Germany nordish by Nature yeah

230
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:22,759
exactly I have some friends in Germany

231
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,879
but they're they're both in Berlin yeah

232
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:26,919
it's I would also say Berlin is in the

233
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:30,439
northern part of German but they don't

234
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:33,199
call thems I'm a nordish person yeah brw

235
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,279
is like the last thing where you say I'm

236
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,800
North from there it becomes the center

237
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:41,200
of

238
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:43,679
Germany uh so after this seat so you

239
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,839
started to realize genetics right you

240
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,838
were you were searching for for for

241
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,639
jeans right after that because if you if

242
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:53,279
it was a back seat so after that you

243
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:56,120
know reading through the forums you saw

244
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:58,278
all of these strains right what was your

245
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,919
first initial you know search for which

246
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:04,120
which genetics have you been interested

247
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:06,919
in the beginning um first of all I was

248
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:10,278
using a page which is still today one of

249
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:13,120
the most important Pages for uh research

250
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:16,519
for genetic it's called seedfinder

251
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,759
U um it's in different languages I

252
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:20,360
really can recommend to have a look

253
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:23,679
because there you really can see where

254
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:26,919
all the different line ages um influen

255
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:31,000
the next genetics and yeah this was the

256
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:34,000
time where Europe and um the states have

257
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,320
been still really separated from my

258
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,799
today perspective it was really the time

259
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:43,560
where you could say European genetics

260
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:47,838
and us or American genetics

261
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:52,679
and it have been really the time of the

262
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:57,399
skunk the um the outo genetic I was

263
00:12:52,679 --> 00:13:00,879
growing um fan du um really it was the

264
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:02,839
the basic genetics still Northern Lights

265
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:07,439
Haze different types of ha but I'm not

266
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:09,399
the haze guy to be honest and um yeah it

267
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,800
was really the beginning where where I

268
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:15,159
remember when I went on seat finder Yu I

269
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:16,838
saw the number of how many strains have

270
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:18,759
been listed on the platform it was

271
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:23,040
something around

272
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:26,439
7,500 so you have been po it was still

273
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:29,198
possible to get an overview yeah and um

274
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:32,120
and then it came the time for me where

275
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:36,399
where um I was traveling a lot of um

276
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:38,919
weekends to Amsterdam to go there to go

277
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,600
to area to gray area and shops like that

278
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:44,559
to get a glimpse of the genetics in

279
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,879
which have been growing in the states

280
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:51,039
and um it opened my whole perspective

281
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:55,399
because now for sure both sides have

282
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:56,879
access to both genan pools but it's this

283
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:59,720
was really a time where it still was

284
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,879
separated and I I remember my my first

285
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,800
time being in Amsterdam and smelling

286
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:07,919
some real orange turbs with the with the

287
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:12,559
influence of crooked with the Tangi with

288
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:15,599
was across uh which da DNA made um Tangi

289
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:17,919
with koshak Kush so I was a kosa Kush

290
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,519
lava and then somebody told me there is

291
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:23,838
something it tastes like orange I went

292
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:26,198
to Amsterdam I went to the first hulp um

293
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,160
which somebody told me there you find

294
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:31,479
the

295
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:33,919
24K I I remember my my moment where I

296
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,519
got my nose into this bag and it was

297
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:40,039
really bro this is Orange it's not lemon

298
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:43,560
it's the first time strict orange and

299
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:46,240
smoking this completely freaking out and

300
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:48,119
straight I remember how I asked how do I

301
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,600
get the seeds and then I had to work

302
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,959
from the from the bottom of Amsterdam to

303
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,839
the left side to the DNA genetics shop

304
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,719
and I bought the pack of seeds and I

305
00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:00,800
went home and I selected my own first

306
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,519
yeah 24k gold in the Tangi

307
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:06,399
Direction yeah this was my time where

308
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:10,440
where I really started to to combine

309
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:14,679
both worlds of European and the the

310
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:17,920
states and yeah crazy

311
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:20,159
time and yeah and then it for me like

312
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:25,439
you you said that the cham genetic is

313
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:28,559
such a important um backbone yeah um I

314
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,480
remember then when the first rumors of

315
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:33,559
the ke genetics came to Europe and

316
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,800
everybody was asking what is going on

317
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:38,679
low yielder crazy turbs and before I

318
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:42,359
have to say that the European genetics

319
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:45,318
also AK-47 all the stuff big butt orange

320
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,680
butt they have been also a little bit

321
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:50,679
more on the yield side it was more

322
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:52,719
during this time that for me I I started

323
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:53,638
to grow because I wanted to to grow my

324
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,120
own

325
00:15:53,639 --> 00:16:00,000
Supply but I wasn't completely into the

326
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,000
world of turs this started like I said

327
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,240
in Amsterdam when I had the possibility

328
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,198
to to to get a broader pallet of

329
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:12,120
turbs and it was more for big yielder

330
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:15,479
but this changed completely then when

331
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:18,560
the C cookies genetics came over to to

332
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,440
Europe and I I have to say I was hunting

333
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:23,518
because I wasn't that well connected I

334
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,440
was hunting the cookie genetics like 2

335
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,000
and a half years I smoked it in gray

336
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,199
area but I didn't get my hands on a cut

337
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
or a German grow who was growing this

338
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:37,599
and yeah this changed everything I would

339
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,480
say that cookie gen the cookie genetics

340
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,720
brought me to understand that I will

341
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,879
also sacrifice yield for better taste

342
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,959
and this was a huge shift in my

343
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:51,919
perspective on growing cannabis and from

344
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:54,679
there it really started that I wanted to

345
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,278
to know everything you know that is a

346
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:58,198
really important thing that you said no

347
00:16:56,278 --> 00:17:01,360
because it's still today like that it's

348
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:05,438
you have this Cuts Like you said big bot

349
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:08,000
White Widow AK-47s critical PL all these

350
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,600
cuts and then you have for example all

351
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,439
the American Cuts now apple banana uh

352
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:17,958
ice cream runs Detroit runs you know all

353
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:20,798
kind of uh Skittles crosses and and this

354
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:23,160
is exactly the the the term what we

355
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:27,279
first started to see was the yield was

356
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:30,320
lower yeah the Bots were harder heavier

357
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:34,200
but it was not so much y so everybody

358
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:36,519
was on Yi in the beginning in in Holland

359
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,840
everything was breed for yi you know it

360
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:43,558
was notet it was it had to be efficient

361
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,879
a lot of money turnover so yeah yeah but

362
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:48,160
now the story changed right yeah I think

363
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,440
there's something else that could have

364
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,679
influenced that for instance and I don't

365
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,720
know about Germany but I want to ask but

366
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:59,720
in Holland they all mixed tobacco with

367
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:01,279
their weed right or they did right so

368
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,519
when you're mixing tobacco with your

369
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:06,359
weed then all of a sudden the way it

370
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:10,319
tastes doesn't matter so much and you

371
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:12,519
know I I'd like to say what you know my

372
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:15,240
feelings on it and what I always mention

373
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:17,960
to my Dutch friends is you know you have

374
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,960

food it's like if you have a beautiful

376
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,600

378
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:28,240

379
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:31,960
you know and so and you know the few

380
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,720
friends that I have from um Germany and

381
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,240
I you know I don't I'm not in contact

382
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:40,440
with them as much anymore but they all

383
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:45,200
used to mix tobacco with their we too so

384
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:48,360
me too a lot of or I would say the the

385
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:55,000
main part of my stoner life but it

386
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:58,240
changed I am now um since one year I I

387
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,839
stopped to smoke tobacco I really went

388
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,519
to shaping and

389
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:06,439
dabbing and um I

390
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:09,679
also um combustion is still something I

391
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:14,038
call it it's a social thing with the

392
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,679
right guys with the right it has to be I

393
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:18,839
I

394
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:20,798
don't if it's if it's the really the

395
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:23,519
best wheat and the right person I will

396
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:26,879
smoke a joint with him but I have to be

397
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,759
truthful since I'm vaping and dabing so

398
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,520
much combustion became really wow and

399
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:35,640
now I have a completely new relationship

400
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:38,918
with uh cannabis um I never thought it I

401
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,880
I call it it's like I been married 25

402
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:43,200
years smoking yeah I've been married

403
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,679
with cannabis it already have been

404
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,400
normalized we talked to each other but

405
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:53,200
we don't really uh pay attention and

406
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:56,440
after I stopped smoking tobacco and I

407
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,960
really reduced combustion to two to 3%

408
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,120
of my consumption my relationship ship

409
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,400
with cannabis is completely different

410
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:06,199
I'm I yeah I don't want to tell the

411
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,559
people don't smoke with tobacco

412
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,759
everybody in Europe has

413
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:14,119
his yeah um his own story and yeah the

414
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,400
culture of smoking with tobacco is still

415
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:19,079
big but it's a shift there the people

416
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:23,159
because now they are really starving for

417
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:27,319
quality and their understanding for Pure

418
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:29,799
smoke is really growing also um and we

419
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:31,759
will also later talk about the um new

420
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:33,879
situation in Germany with the

421
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,720
decriminalization for me my mission

422
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,520
mission is and this is really good that

423
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:41,880
I stopped smoking that much a year ago

424
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:43,879
is now that I also can tell the people

425
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:47,440
as not not telling them what to do

426
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,799
showing them how I consume and I'm

427
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,080
telling the people if you are a

428
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:54,679
firsttime user now because you as a

429
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:58,798
consumer are legal please try not to

430
00:20:54,679 --> 00:21:00,519
burn use Vapes and dabs and stay stay

431
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:03,200
away from burning if you never have been

432
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:05,720
smoking so this is my Approach at the

433
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,440
moment but for sure I also burn some

434
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:12,400
good pure joints and donuts with my

435
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,320
friends sometimes you know we we say

436
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,159
that

437
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:19,038
um we don't want to be

438
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,360
influencers we want to be inspires

439
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,919
inspirers Educators and inspiring the

440
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:27,879
people exactly I I know that the biggest

441
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:31,400
shift you can create in other people is

442
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:34,278
not telling them what to do living in

443
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,679
Germany we say labas en and for live it

444
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:37,960
and show

445
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:42,440
them and the effect

446
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:45,519
is much bigger and also have a much

447
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,798
longer effect on the people and um I can

448
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:52,278
tell you something I'm streaming also on

449
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:55,359
Twitch and we have like 500 people in

450
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:58,038
average in the Stream and I I I was

451
00:21:55,359 --> 00:22:01,399
using here a ball Vape yeah I I I have

452
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:03,200
been a pipe smoker and this device

453
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,840
changed my life because I can smoke

454
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:11,038
still or I can Vape a pipe with a huge

455
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:11,038
impact and but I call it it's vegan

456
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:19,798
smoking yeah so and in my chat so many

457
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:22,038
people I um tell are are writing me that

458
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:23,879
they stopped smoking tobacco it's it's

459
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:25,960
life changing and when then I read that

460
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:30,278
they are nearly quitting combustion it's

461
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:32,360
crazy really it's all about a healthy

462
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:36,038
relationship with this plant and this is

463
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:38,879
part of it so I have a a question and a

464
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:43,720
comment about that um first I'll give

465
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:47,360
you the the comment so I also

466
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:51,200
predominantly Vape now and the reason

467
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:53,399
why is because and so in the past I'd

468
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,679
wake up in the morning and I would roll

469
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,600
10

470
00:22:54,679 --> 00:23:01,320
joints okay and I had a a case that

471
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:04,000
would hold five joints and so I had two

472
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:08,079
of them so I could leave with with 10

473
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,599
joints and um you know I'd probably

474
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:12,278
smoke five to seven of them but I always

475
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:15,918
had a couple extra in case I'm with

476
00:23:12,278 --> 00:23:17,759
other people when I share weed I don't

477
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,360
want to share mouth to

478
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:23,038
mouth you know like to me it's just it's

479
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,519
mostly unnecessary like if we were going

480
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:28,119
to have a beer we wouldn't buy one beer

481
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:30,759
and share it right there's an abundance

482
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:33,000
and so you know where I'm coming from

483
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:34,839
there's such an abundance of weed why

484
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,359
would we ever share a joint why don't I

485
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:41,000
just give you a joint I smoke a joint um

486
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:43,918
so I I used to have 10 joints a day and

487
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,359
I smelt like an ashtray everywhere that

488
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,559
I went and honestly I was young and I

489
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:53,558
didn't give a

490
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:57,038
[ __ ] you know it's like I didn't

491
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:59,798
care um but now thinking about it it's

492
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:01,359
like I kind of smell Pretty Dirty you

493
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:04,278
know just like always smelling like a

494
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:06,599
roach not even smelling of fresh weed

495
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:11,119
right fresh weed smells beautiful your

496
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:14,000
ashtray not so much right no and I had

497
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:16,038
tried Vape carts but they were all

498
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,240
shitty you know cuz they're all

499
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:19,720
distillate you know with a little bit

500
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,480
and back then it was distillate and they

501
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,839
would flavor it flavor it with TPS that

502
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:27,159
weren't even cannabis right yeah um but

503
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:31,038
then I discovered something and I

504
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:34,080
discovered fresh FR Frozen sauce

505
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:38,319
turps okay so you know what sauce is

506
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:40,439
right yeah wait a second go ahead

507
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:42,278
Germany is now this is the most

508
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,919
important thing look the good thing is

509
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:46,720
that technology is so far ahead now that

510
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:48,960
really the end consumer the hom grower

511
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,120
can buy these cartridges and the good

512
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,440
thing is and this is this is really

513
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:57,839
changing the whole game that even high

514
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:00,200
quality flower rosin is able now to with

515
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:02,359
this uh um I don't know to say this in

516
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,120
English there is no coil anymore it's

517
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:08,199
ceramic yeah so my community is really

518
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:10,678
making their own pant and it's

519
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,000
completely different to what you told

520
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:16,440
before the distillate so yeah I

521
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:21,558
understand your approach completely

522
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:25,440
so to so this is sauce

523
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:29,759
turps and for for those that don't know

524
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:32,080
when they make um sauce or diamonds with

525
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:34,119
butane and and this was made with fresh

526
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:37,678
frozen flour but when they make it with

527
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:40,599
butane in the process the THC falls to

528
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:45,559
the bottom and the tpin will rise to the

529
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:48,119
top and so the tpin on the top are so

530
00:25:45,558 --> 00:25:48,879
valuable that what they do is they pour

531
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:51,959
it

532
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,880
off okay and nowadays when you buy a

533
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,440
cart and it's flavored with with tpin

534
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,080
like this sauce turps they'll put a

535
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,600
small percentage G right because they

536
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:05,678
just want to add

537
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:07,879
flavor and I buy the TPS straight and I

538
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:11,399
should go and grab a jar and and or a

539
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:17,120
couple jars and show you um know it's

540
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:20,158
okay go say hello yeah um so so um I

541
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:22,959
fill these carts with straight sauce

542
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,320
turps now the regular carts that you

543
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:29,079
know are available at a dispensary are

544
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:32,319
maybe like 85% THC cuz they're May

545
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:35,678
with you know either distill it or the

546
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:37,480
now they they melt the diamonds and turn

547
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,679
the diamonds into something that can be

548
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:45,319
consumed in here um but this has about

549
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:47,120
40% THC maybe 50 um but the Tarpin are

550
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:50,918
through the roof like

551
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:54,439
15% right so I smoke this because the

552
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:58,640
way it tastes is just so G I can tell

553
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:02,679
you something go ahead 2012

554
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,840
look 2009 2010 it started with growing

555
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:07,640
and

556
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:10,519
immediately um the the Curiosity for all

557
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:14,679
around this plant and culture started to

558
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:18,000
grow and also for dabbing yeah 2010 2012

559
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:20,320
the time Titan needles glass Dome with

560
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
glass needle yeah this time of dabbing

561
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:25,278
and

562
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:28,398
BHO and I went to a to a really good

563
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:31,278
extraction art not artist a really good

564
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:35,158
extractor in Berlin

565
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:38,759
2012 because I wanted to taste the first

566
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:41,320
time B from somebody else yeah not my

567
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:45,839
own just to see where I

568
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:48,119
am and he told me when I

569
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:51,480
arrived do you want a small one or do

570
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:55,038
you want a big magc a big big dab and I

571
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,480
said a big one and he told me I have to

572
00:27:55,038 --> 00:28:00,879
tell you

573
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:04,640
something I I smoked so many extract

574
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:07,240
that I lost my passion and taste for

575
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,799
flour and I will give you one

576
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:12,720
advice

577
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:15,720
don't consume so much extracts that you

578
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:19,640
lose your passion for flour and since

579
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:22,120
2012 this is in my head and I'm really

580
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:25,038
thankful this gave me because I have

581
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:27,558
ADHD and sometimes you go crazy with

582
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:30,359
this handicap or with the superpower and

583
00:28:27,558 --> 00:28:33,079
especially sometimes you go crazy with

584
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:35,439
consumption but this was the best advice

585
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:38,678
I because I love this plant so much and

586
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,558
the flower till today I never got into

587
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:43,880
this situation because I have his voice

588
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:45,440
till today in my mind yeah so it's

589
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,080
really important that we talk about

590
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,919
something like that because people who

591
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:53,720
start with consuming extracts they have

592
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:57,799
to be aware of that

593
00:28:53,720 --> 00:29:01,319
and what I do is I'm a medical patient

594
00:28:57,798 --> 00:29:03,960
but also a recreational user and how do

595
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:07,558
I differentiate during the week I have

596
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:10,200
to function really good and there my

597
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:12,678
Approach or my goal is to have a level

598
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:18,159
of cannabinoids in my system which let

599
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:20,960
me be um relax with my movement but

600
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:23,640
clear my head and for that it's less

601
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:28,558
than I thought the first years of being

602
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:31,759
medical user and the dabbing extract is

603
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:34,398
something I take for the weekend it's

604
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:37,440
for me for sure everybody I know people

605
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:39,599
who can handle it really well and smoke

606
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,600
every day a little bit of dab one dab or

607
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:43,599
two dabs but I know I like like the

608
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:46,319
taste too much so for me it's really

609
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:48,599
something when Friday or Saturday or

610
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:50,798
Sunday this is my dabbing time then I

611
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:53,918
have the head space to enjoy and to get

612
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:55,679
into the the artwork of extracts I'm

613
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,919
consuming in this moment and this is a

614
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:01,679
good way mhm very smart

615
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:05,480
I and so during the week you're vaping

616
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,120
flour yeah vaping strictly yeah no

617
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,839
smoking I do want to see the tools that

618
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:11,079
you

619
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:13,439
use so give me a second I have a lot in

620
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:15,278
my at home go go go go take a second and

621
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,440
find it and I'm going to go bring some

622
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:20,640
uh extract to show you as well yeah

623
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,399
please all righty Vincent first I want

624
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,038
you to show us your tools that you used

625
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:27,158
to smoke out of yeah I Vape at the

626
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:31,038
moment I'm using three different devices

627
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:34,039
one is at home um first of all I use a

628
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:38,798
ball Vape with a rig or with a pipe like

629
00:30:34,038 --> 00:30:41,398
I said I was 25 years pipe smoker and um

630
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:45,398
this really changed everything why

631
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:48,158
because you have such a huge heat

632
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:51,119
retention capacity and also with the

633
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:54,039
balls which are inside of this coil um

634
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:57,038
you bring in one hit the whole heat onto

635
00:30:54,038 --> 00:30:58,558
the material and there's what what I at

636
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:01,359
the beginning why I never started to

637
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:03,839
vape was I hate 7 Minute sessions to get

638
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:07,599
out all the ingredients of a little bit

639
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:11,199
of weed but in the moment I found um

640
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:14,398
Dino VAP or a ball Vape or also this

641
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,600
electronic vape and why is it this one

642
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:19,119
because usually till I would say two

643
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:22,158
years ago all the electronic devices

644
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:24,518
also just went to 210 Celsius I don't

645
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:27,919
know in Fahrenheit and this one can go

646
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:30,519
to 240 so really close to combustion and

647
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:33,480
and to be true for me it's more okay

648
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:37,599
it's also the studies that if you vape

649
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:41,759
that high also some caner cing

650
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:44,599
ingredients can occure but for me it's

651
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:48,759
it's even better it's better to to burn

652
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:50,359
then burning and smoking um a bushire

653
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:54,158
this is how I feel at the moment when

654
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:56,199
I'm smoking too much then uh vaping on a

655
00:31:54,159 --> 00:32:00,278
really high temperature and also the

656
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:02,679
dino VAP is for me The Joint I smoke and

657
00:32:00,278 --> 00:32:06,960
this is my pipe I was using I used to

658
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:09,880
smoke yeah and with that I'm completely

659
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,798
satisfied and so the the thing that you

660
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,399
have that has a cord on it that's the

661
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:15,720
heating element you don't put the weed

662
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:18,678
in here right no no you put the wheat in

663
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,000
here mhm and you see it's nearly burning

664
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:24,120
I really I am the guy who Vapes really

665
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,200
high temperature and um he is just

666
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:30,678
missing the uh so I put my finger on

667
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,840
here and then the heat comes through and

668
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:36,038
yeah you have a it's a thermal

669
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:38,759
extraction device yeah and you the the

670
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:40,798
difference to the older devices that

671
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:42,398
this devices I'm using have the

672
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:46,000
capability of

673
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:48,719
extracting quick and this gives you and

674
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,398
also build up big clouds and this gives

675
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,000
you the

676
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:57,038
satisfying uh pressure on the lung and

677
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,119
also the quick feeling of the tur of the

678
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:01,398
effect of the canab oids and the tpin

679
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:03,719
and the eers and everything in your head

680
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:06,319
yeah it's not okay we have to wait and

681
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:10,000
this changed everything for me so I

682
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:13,119
don't have um I don't have to wait which

683
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,638
was usually with the old Vape devices

684
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:20,038
which with my ADHD I'm impatient

685
00:33:16,638 --> 00:33:23,199
so and does that thing heat up quickly

686
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:25,038
or it take um three minutes um with this

687
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,919
one so it's really I know that I need

688
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:30,519
some medication in the office then I

689
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:33,278
press my button I let it heat up and at

690
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:34,240
home I also use all different kinds I'm

691
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:38,798
a

692
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:41,440
traditional Dabber with torch and now

693
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:44,480
there are different ways to uh to use

694
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,880
still your quad Banger without a torch

695
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,519
and really this is my way I when I'm

696
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:53,278
when I'm on the go I prefer some digital

697
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:55,839
press the bottom devices from different

698
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:59,200
companies and when I'm home I really

699
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:03,158
like to sit down because for me

700
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:06,720
extracts is something special in Germany

701
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:09,200
we don't have a market till now so

702
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,480
um when you are in touch with other

703
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:17,078
extraction artists or you get your hands

704
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:19,679
on certain badges for me Rosen is an art

705
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:22,839
and I take it seriously with functional

706
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:27,720
art and consuming art through a piece of

707
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:29,639
art so the way that how extract um come

708
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:34,678
comes into my hands means somebody have

709
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:39,358
been selecting a genetic W growing it

710
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:42,320
washing it pressing it and curing it so

711
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:44,039
I get a piece of art and then I take

712
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,039
also at the weekend my time to consume

713
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:49,039
it through a nice piece and yeah to be

714
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:53,719
with

715
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:56,759
it yeah I I hear what you say like the

716
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:59,799
to make the best rosin it definitely

717
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:04,400
takes a little bit more of a as you said

718
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:07,039
Artistic Touch than um with butane for

719
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:11,358
instance with butane it's about you know

720
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:16,039
following this process which is you know

721
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:19,078
it's science yeah so but

722
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:20,358
um yeah I thank you for breaking out

723
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:23,320
your tools because I'm interested

724
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:24,960
because I want to vape more flower you

725
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,280
know because okay I have to tell you

726
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,440
something

727
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:32,960
okay why why a ball Vape is really

728
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,400
building a wave at the moment in

729
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,000
Germany I tell you something I never

730
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,240
thought I

731
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,519
will be able to

732
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:45,039
say with such a device and please don't

733
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:47,960
look at me with the big pipe this is my

734
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:50,239
tool here go with a small rig yeah you

735
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:53,880
can use it with a regular or a little

736
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:58,318
bit bigger rig and you will experience

737
00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:02,519
wheat on a taste level close under

738
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:05,480
maybe 0.5 away with a gap to exract to

739
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:08,159
the [ __ ] to to the I would

740
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,920
say Okay flower Rosen I know in the

741
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:11,480
states that people say flower Rosen what

742
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,639
is that but in Germany you have to

743
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:17,358
understand we have a huge hom grow

744
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:19,400
culture and the people saw extracts on

745
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:22,838
uh on Instagram and they wanted to have

746
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:24,559
hands their hands on their own rosin so

747
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:26,799
the quickest way to educate the people

748
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:30,199
is flower rosin and then showing them

749
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,400
how to wash cash and then they never do

750
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:36,000
flower rosin again but what I want to

751
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:43,599
say okay flower rosin is just a small

752
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:44,358
Gap to this with 0.4 gram of wheat in

753
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,800
this

754
00:36:44,358 --> 00:36:51,119
ball you will you will call me and tell

755
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:53,200
me what vaping is so tasteful why

756
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,720
because here you can put a lot of flour

757
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:59,078
in and like I said the first hit is

758
00:36:55,719 --> 00:37:01,318
really all the tpin and nearly not all

759
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:03,480
but a huge amount of cannabinoids get

760
00:37:01,318 --> 00:37:06,279
evaporated and you get the taste on your

761
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:09,039
lips no combustion I'm really an

762
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:11,480
advocate for ball vaping really from the

763
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:13,920
bottom of my heart I love this device

764
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:16,440
well you see when we talked about how I

765
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,639
get inspired every show you're inspiring

766
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:23,200
me to go out and buy a ball Bap a ball

767
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:28,159
VAP because cuz I don't have one and and

768
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:31,960
you know I do I do enjoy flower too you

769
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:35,519
love it yeah and so now when uh to give

770
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:38,838
you an example when I dab I like to do

771
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:41,119
it at a very low temperature because dab

772
00:37:38,838 --> 00:37:44,679
which which is your temperature so

773
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:48,079
honestly I use um a torch yeah but I I

774
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:50,279
like to do a cold start perfect okay and

775
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:53,839
I I pretty much don't let it get that

776
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:57,200
hot you know like it'll stop smoking you

777
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:59,440
know before I'm even done hitting it I

778
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:02,358
don't like when you get that giant dab

779
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,318
and it's just it it chokes you and uh

780
00:38:02,358 --> 00:38:06,078
you were going to tell your story about

781
00:38:04,318 --> 00:38:09,000
your first dab and then I think it got

782
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:11,079
interrupted by yourself I think you like

783
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,679
but I want to tell you hold on I I want

784
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:14,720
to tell you quickly so when I did my

785
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:18,838
first

786
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:21,078
dab um my friend gave me

787
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:24,599
diamonds like and it seemed like the

788
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:27,318
tiniest little bit on this thing and

789
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:29,760
when I did the dab I literally thought I

790
00:38:27,318 --> 00:38:32,800
was was going to pass out I was I was

791
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,560
dizzy I me I had to sit down that never

792
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:39,039
happens from weed you know so and and

793
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:42,159
when I dab I also want a tiny tiny

794
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:44,199
little dab because I just want to taste

795
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:46,318
it I know I'm going to get high no

796
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:48,838
matter what because the concentration is

797
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:51,239
is I don't need these when I see these

798
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:53,519
videos of people doing giant dabs I'm

799
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:55,799
like what the heck you know it's like

800
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:58,039
for me I just want the tiniest little it

801
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:01,039
can never be too small

802
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:02,920
really just just a little bit go and

803
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:07,519
tell us your dab story yeah I also

804
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:10,318
prefer to on a sash or um to enjoy a few

805
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:14,719
more dabs because I want to experience

806
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:17,039
the different flavors so I I'm also a um

807
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:19,279
the my first stb is something I don't do

808
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:23,079
with first timers so I really have a

809
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:25,280
mission when on events in Germany or I I

810
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:27,400
try to give people their first stb

811
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,040
because I would love to give them a

812
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:33,039
beautiful experience so they that they

813
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:35,719
advocate for it and that they don't fear

814
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:37,639
High potency and passing out we will

815
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:40,279
come to this right now but I think this

816
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:43,159
is the better way I became older and I

817
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,720
like that the people say to others oh

818
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:48,440
this was nice and it was not

819
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:50,838
overwhelming yeah so my first step from

820
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:53,559
a different person in Berlin I said I

821
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:56,519
want a big me so I got a big Ma and I

822
00:39:53,559 --> 00:40:00,799
had the same experience like you I I I

823
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:02,800
felt like I had a a board nailed on my

824
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,839
face and I had to walk through whole

825
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,960
Berlin to the place where I was staying

826
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:12,480
and I said to myself okay that was crazy

827
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:16,880
and nothing I need in my daily life big

828
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:18,800
deps can be funny but yeah the right

829
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,000
occasion

830
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:24,280
and like I said till today it's in my

831
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,760
mind but what happened

832
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:33,720
also um when I met this grower

833
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:36,280
um I got in I got in Berlin in touch

834
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:39,358
with new genetics he gave me some cuts

835
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:41,640
big Buddha blue cheese goosebumbs

836
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:44,639
wow what a

837
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:47,879
genetic and I brought him some cuts and

838
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:51,279
this was the first time starting to to

839
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:54,480
live culture not just in in the in the

840
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,880
internet really to meet people that they

841
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,280
trusted you to let you come home to

842
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,200
share

843
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:04,720
genetics and from there everything

844
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:07,358
evolved 2012 also Instagram became

845
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:10,078
bigger and bigger and now something's

846
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:12,719
change uh in my life because you asked

847
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,640
at the beginning for my story

848
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:17,239
2012

849
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:20,480
2013 Instagram

850
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:22,719
became also in Germany so important for

851
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,519
the Cannabis culture and it's a Pity

852
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:28,719
that we have so many problems with this

853
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:31,480
network because I I started to network

854
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:33,598
with the whole world my alas was German

855
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:36,400
Gardner I still have this account and

856
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:39,318
this is really my private grower account

857
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,480
and what I did with this account was to

858
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:44,440
honor the people who gave me all the

859
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,400
knowledge on the forums I just

860
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:52,440
transferred the knowledge to social

861
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:54,079
media really early 2012 2030 13 so this

862
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,760
was a really

863
00:41:54,079 --> 00:42:00,720
important period of my time because

864
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,839
just by keeping the cycle alive of all I

865
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:03,799
learned to share with other people on

866
00:42:02,838 --> 00:42:07,960
social

867
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:11,079
media um I built my network and I also

868
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:13,400
got into a position where I was one not

869
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:14,720
the biggest but one of the Instagram

870
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,440
accounts in Germany who have been

871
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:20,598
knowing for educating others and showing

872
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:24,679
them how to extract how to wash all this

873
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:27,760
stuff and this is the the um the how you

874
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:30,118
say that in English um the base for what

875
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:34,760
I'm doing today to educate and to make

876
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:38,519
my living also legally since nearly six

877
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:41,119
years long time before legalization

878
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:43,199
decriminalization to uh um to bring food

879
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:46,400
to on the table for my family with

880
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:48,960
cannabis for sure I was growing also and

881
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:53,318
I have also my back stories in the black

882
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:56,400
market and um I remember also

883
00:42:53,318 --> 00:42:58,159
2013 um I got how do you call it when

884
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:04,280
yeah I got

885
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:06,838
um the yeah so and I there was nothing I

886
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:10,599
could do there was and I knew that the

887
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:13,719
money also have been spent

888
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:15,800
and I had to take the decision do you

889
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:19,480
want satisfaction or do you want to

890
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:22,039
continue life satisfaction would uh to

891
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:25,000
break some bones no that's not me I love

892
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:26,880
the plant yes I was selling but it was

893
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,159
to bring good weed to the people and I

894
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,800
never never saw myself as a criminal I

895
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:33,078
think in the Cannabis industry we know

896
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,519
exactly what I'm talking about yeah I

897
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:39,400
saw myself more as a caregiver making

898
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:41,159
money but if there come this criminal

899
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:45,240
stuff into it I was immediately out and

900
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:47,639
I told myself [ __ ] so much money but

901
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:50,118
there must be a way to earn this legally

902
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:53,879
with cannabis one day one day not in the

903
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:58,640
moment and this fort kept going and

904
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:58,640
going in my head and

905
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:06,079
20145 it started that medical marijuana

906
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:10,399
in Germany became a bigger

907
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:13,280
thing that the first patients got from

908
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,160
2009 it started but in my awareness it

909
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,119
started

910
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:20,480
2012 13 that I saw more patients popping

911
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:23,640
up but really fighting hard in front of

912
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:27,880
a core to get the right to get from the

913
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:31,920
Netherlands bedan really shitty weed

914
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:34,200
and there was one case one case where

915
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,480
you have to this is such a funny story

916
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:39,519
so there was a

917
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:42,199
patient and he got busted with wheat and

918
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:44,920
he said I claim this as my right as a

919
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:48,279
patient because the German healthc care

920
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:51,358
system doesn't provide cannabis to me

921
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:55,400
and it's um how you say that if if I

922
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:57,679
don't get my medicine it's like um

923
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:01,000
unconstitutional yeah it no yeah it it

924
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:04,719
it it um it's like hurting me and I and

925
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,880
if before um yeah I don't know there my

926
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:10,838
English is not good enough he called it

927
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:13,400
his right so he and then he got a case

928
00:45:10,838 --> 00:45:16,159
in front of the court and the

929
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:18,720
judge said something which was written

930
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:19,759
in an article which made me click yeah

931
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:23,799
it

932
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:26,000
was okay I have to give you as one of

933
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,960
the first patients in Germany the right

934
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,400
to grow your own

935
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:34,199
own because in this room there is no

936
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:36,920
other expert knowing more about this

937
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:40,639
plant than you why because when they

938
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:44,280
busted him they found his grower uh

939
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:47,358
diary with everything written down which

940
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:50,319
crop which plant how many days how much

941
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:52,598
amount blah blah blah and the the the

942
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:55,558
judge said I have to admit that in this

943
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:59,318
room there is no other expert than you

944
00:45:55,559 --> 00:46:01,559
so I have and you you are really really

945
00:45:59,318 --> 00:46:03,480
ill and sick and you need this as

946
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:05,519
medicine and the German healthc care

947
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:08,838
system isn't capable of providing you

948
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:12,000
that but I give you some rules and they

949
00:46:08,838 --> 00:46:13,558
are they will make it impossible for you

950
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,838
this was yeah he said you are allowed to

951
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:20,839
grow you are the expert but you have to

952
00:46:16,838 --> 00:46:24,639
have a a half meter thick concrete walls

953
00:46:20,838 --> 00:46:27,239
you need a a safety class five door like

954
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:29,480
a pharmacy so the the the judge

955
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:31,799
immediately made it impossible but he

956
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:36,199
gave him the right and for me this story

957
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:37,280
said to me if you show people also if

958
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:40,279
you are a

959
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,160
criminal that you have been growing weed

960
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,359
and you love this plant and you can

961
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:47,598
educate about

962
00:46:44,358 --> 00:46:51,239
them when it becomes legal you have some

963
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:54,318
like a record yeah and this is why I

964
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:56,358
intensified my work on social media

965
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:58,239
because I told myself one day people

966
00:46:56,358 --> 00:47:00,519
will ask where you know all this from

967
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:03,279
and then you can say ah yeah I have been

968
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:06,400
on the internet and sharing the love for

969
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:09,440
the plant since years and this is why I

970
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,838
am Vincent weed so what happened I

971
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,880
became

972
00:47:10,838 --> 00:47:15,239
patient and it was the crer the the the

973
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:18,400
not the cruelest it was one of the

974
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:22,598
hardest decision of my life 2016 I

975
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:27,000
started to to go for the papers to

976
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:27,000
become a legal cannabis patient

977
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:32,838
2017 the law

978
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:35,240
changed and it it became much easier to

979
00:47:32,838 --> 00:47:37,119
become a medical cannabis patient not

980
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:40,919
easy

981
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:43,200
easier and I said okay with my doctor we

982
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:46,200
will take the approach with the new

983
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:49,558
law and my wife told

984
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:50,679
me I know I still was growing and I

985
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:53,680
became

986
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:56,239
patient and the the wheat was shitty

987
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:57,399
from the pharmacy I couldn't consume

988
00:47:56,239 --> 00:48:01,318
this wheat

989
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:05,519
so I was still growing and then

990
00:48:01,318 --> 00:48:08,199
2018 there was a company it's she the

991
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:12,039
company was called Sense Media the first

992
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:15,279
German media house for cannabis content

993
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:19,920
with a magazine with YouTube channels

994
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:22,559
with events no legalization but the

995
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:26,079
investors gambled and said if we build

996
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:28,319
up a media company and we will legalize

997
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,160
one day then we have all the assets we

998
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:31,599
need to promote our products this was

999
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:34,558
the goal of the

1000
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:37,280
company and they came to me and they

1001
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:40,119
asked me because there have been some

1002
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,880
role models in the German and also

1003
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:44,559
International YouTube space which have

1004
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:47,440
been teaching me to grow

1005
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:49,839
cannabis and they found out that I have

1006
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,639
this Instagram about teaching the German

1007
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:56,119
community about growing and they asked

1008
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:59,159
me do you want to show face on one of a

1009
00:48:56,119 --> 00:49:01,798
YouTube channel we want to build up with

1010
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:04,519
you and educate the

1011
00:49:01,798 --> 00:49:06,679
Germans and I had to take the decision

1012
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:09,000
to stop growing my wheat because my wife

1013
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:12,639
told me when you show face no plant in

1014
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,760
our house if you want to go this path

1015
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:16,960
you have to go with the medicine of also

1016
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:19,000
if it's shitty from the pharmacy and

1017
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:22,519
then you can live your dream and earn

1018
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,239
money legally with cannabis and I said

1019
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:27,519
okay I've I slept a few nights and I

1020
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:30,759
said okay I will stop growing for a

1021
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:34,358
certain period of time some

1022
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:36,559
years become a patient with I this was

1023
00:49:34,358 --> 00:49:38,598
the difference also I also became this

1024
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:41,839
is something crazy the

1025
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:44,079
um I went in front of the court to get

1026
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:46,159
the right that my health insurance

1027
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:48,519
company have to pay for my

1028
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:50,519
cannabis it's really hard to get this

1029
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:52,880
status in Germany and I got the status

1030
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:55,280

yeah this I had to smoke radiated weed

1048
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:44,759
the first two two and a half years three

1049
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:48,719
years of being a patient and not growing

1050
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:51,799
anymore and this was the start where

1051
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:55,078
seven years ago I showed face and I have

1052
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:57,599
to say how it is there have been people

1053
00:50:55,079 --> 00:51:03,039
walking the path

1054
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:05,880
on legalized movement and being um

1055
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:08,798
real um

1056
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:11,519
activists long long long before me I'm

1057
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:14,679
just a regular dude like I said at the

1058
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:17,079
beginning who through his passion became

1059
00:51:14,679 --> 00:51:20,318
into a situation where he could live

1060
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:23,839
start to live a dream he never thought

1061
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:27,440
he would have to show face for cannabis

1062
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:30,159
education by that I also

1063
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:33,639
took the responsibility with the the

1064
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:37,279
growing reach I got I never will say I'm

1065
00:51:33,639 --> 00:51:41,519
a activist but I support every German

1066
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:45,680
activist with my reach so for sure I I I

1067
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:48,639
took the responsibility and I started to

1068
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:50,639
to make YouTube videos about growing and

1069
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:55,400
also using my reach to tell the people

1070
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:57,199
to go to demonstrate and I took also the

1071
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:59,358
um

1072
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:01,519
that I went also to the demonstrations

1073
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:05,719
because there are a lot of I call them

1074
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:07,358
influencers I call me educator but go to

1075
00:52:05,719 --> 00:52:09,598
this demonstration but you don't see

1076
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:11,920
them there and I said I told you how I

1077
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:14,119
work I don't tell the people what to do

1078
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,400
I do it by myself and by that I tried to

1079
00:52:14,119 --> 00:52:18,318
pull them with me and this is from the

1080
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,599
beginning I was showing face I went to

1081
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:23,960
the demos and the demonstrations and I I

1082
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,760
told them go there and I have been also

1083
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:28,599
with them there so that I could claim

1084
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:31,280
the next time Where Have You Been yeah

1085
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:33,318
and I I never would say I'm an activist

1086
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,880
but I take the responsibility which also

1087
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:40,199
comes with the reach and so I'm more a

1088
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:43,640
educator and show the people my path

1089
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:45,798
with growing cannabis and for sure also

1090
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:48,440
showing face for the legalized movement

1091
00:52:45,798 --> 00:52:51,239
this is a part of the job I call it

1092
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:55,880
really and yeah and now I'm making six

1093
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:56,959

1094
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:00,480
which hired

1095

1096
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,358
salary from a half year of work and now

my wife I don't have a job anymore the

1099
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,440
story is a little bit longer but I make

1100
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:15,359
it in this case a little bit

1101
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:16,880
shorter was completely depressed because

1102
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:20,119
you have to imagine there is no

1103
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:23,039
legalization at the Horizon we I had my

1104
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:26,160
job in the Cannabis Market

1105
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:28,719
legally earning food for my family and

1106
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:31,279
then I had to quit by myself the job and

1107
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:34,480

get it to make it profitable how do you

1113

1172
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:25,240
people would steal his book cuz they

1173
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:27,598
were scared to buy

1174
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:30,759
it they were scared to go to the cash

1175
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:35,160
register to buy it I I um my first three

1176
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:38,079
years of indoor growing I never put one

1177
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:40,838
step into a grow hydro store because I

1178
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:43,400
was so paranoid the police is standing

1179
00:56:40,838 --> 00:56:46,199
outside they are filming everybody they

1180
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:49,400
will come to my home they will no so

1181
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:52,679
everything I I bought was from Home

1182
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:54,358
Depot and we have like um um I don't

1183
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:57,598
know the word where where you buy all

1184
00:56:54,358 --> 00:57:00,679
the building materials yeah Home Depot

1185
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:03,599
is Home Depot okay yeah so it was really

1186
00:57:00,679 --> 00:57:06,038
Home Depot and giving money to a friend

1187
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:09,680
who isn't growing to buy the only piece

1188
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:12,520
I couldn't buy which was the um the

1189
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:12,519
active carbon

1190
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:22,760
filter so similar to your story

1191
00:57:18,679 --> 00:57:27,239
um I was a grower and I was offered a

1192
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:31,440
job at a hydro shop at a grow shop and

1193
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:34,838
the plan was to work there for a year so

1194
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:37,760
I could establish some credit buy a home

1195
00:57:34,838 --> 00:57:40,558
and then quit go back to Growing cuz

1196
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:45,520
when I was growing I I couldn't get a

1197
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:48,400
loan to buy a house you know but when I

1198
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:51,559
started working there I realized how

1199
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:53,240
much I love talking about cannabis and

1200
00:57:51,559 --> 00:57:55,599
teaching people about

1201
00:57:53,239 --> 00:57:58,159
cannabis and so what I didn't tell you

1202
00:57:55,599 --> 00:58:00,760
was when I took the job at the grow shop

1203
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:02,558
I shut down my garden as well yeah you

1204
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:06,240
know for many years eventually I started

1205
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:09,880
up again but um for many years I stopped

1206
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:11,598
growing because it was just I was out

1207
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:13,559
there right in front of everything

1208
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:18,880
exactly and and it was I felt that it

1209
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:21,760
was too risky for me to grow and I also

1210
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:24,599
was working before I had this job as a

1211
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:26,640
content creator I also this is why I

1212
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:27,880
made this story shorter yeah it was

1213
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:31,159
really you don't need to make the story

1214
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:34,720
short no okay it's really it's really

1215
00:58:31,159 --> 00:58:38,879
the the student starting to grow having

1216
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:42,239
a few years of experience getting home

1217
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:45,039
to my hometown to finish my study with

1218
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:47,399
the final paper I had to write and

1219
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:49,599
during this time I was watching uh

1220
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:52,559
looking for a job and yeah I got my

1221
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:55,359
first they they I was the then I went

1222
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:56,880
into the hydro store and I bought stuff

1223
00:58:55,358 --> 00:58:58,558
there and they knew me and they gave

1224
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,960
them weed you know the story was that in

1225
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:03,640
Berlin No in brown here in my home

1226
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,639
there's one there too yeah and then the

1227
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:08,118
I asked when you have a job please call

1228
00:59:05,639 --> 00:59:11,558
me yeah and then it came that one had to

1229
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:14,318
leave and a spot was free and behind the

1230
00:59:11,559 --> 00:59:17,240
counter selling and I immediately took

1231
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:19,920
this opportunity I made it uh I was

1232
00:59:17,239 --> 00:59:22,318
nearly two years in this uh hydro store

1233
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:25,519
and this was the base after reading and

1234
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:27,440
growing by myself I'm starting to build

1235
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:30,639
setups for the people and there was two

1236
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:33,280
options they came back and told me what

1237
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:35,719
the [ __ ] you have been selling me there

1238
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:37,680
it's rubbish it doesn't work or they

1239
00:59:35,719 --> 00:59:39,919
came back and said here's the same

1240
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:42,598
amount of budget I need the same stuff

1241
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:45,480
again because so and um the the good

1242
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:49,200
thing is that I had each product in my

1243
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:51,599
hand from this Market each fan each

1244
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:55,038
filter each fertilizer went through my

1245
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:57,000
hands I I asked my boss he gave me the

1246
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:59,039
opportunity to test everything I wanted

1247
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,159
because he knew when I know something I

1248
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:04,319
can sell it better and this two years

1249
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:07,358
selling and getting feedback from The

1250
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:09,558
Growers which products are good or bad

1251
01:00:07,358 --> 01:00:12,719
or don't work together this was the

1252
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:15,240
Baseline and after that I I like I said

1253
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:17,798
I studied economics I went into the into

1254
01:00:15,239 --> 01:00:20,759
the management of a shop grow

1255
01:00:17,798 --> 01:00:24,960
shop I had the deal that after a few

1256
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:27,839
years I own 50% with Milestones which

1257
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:30,199
give me with would pay out 5% of the

1258
01:00:27,838 --> 01:00:33,719
company 5% so that I reach

1259
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:35,358
15 he wanted me because I had the idea I

1260
01:00:33,719 --> 01:00:38,439
never thought that I will make YouTube

1261
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:42,000
but I told him I can and I am good on

1262
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:47,039
Instagram and if I make a YouTube

1263
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:48,639
channel for our shop we can upsale even

1264
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:50,559
better this was

1265
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:53,960
2017

1266
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:56,519
yeah and then he absorbed all my

1267
01:00:53,960 --> 01:01:00,240
knowledge I I wrote

1268
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:02,159
down um like plans how to educate the

1269
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:04,919
sellers which products to sell to a

1270
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:08,440
beginner to advant or to a we had

1271
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:09,720
different strategies and six days before

1272
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:12,639
the contract

1273
01:01:09,719 --> 01:01:17,558
would uh start to work that he can't

1274
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:19,358
move back he fired me and this is this

1275
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:23,400
this is the way yeah it's it's all the

1276
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:25,759
time that my life my steps I had to to

1277
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:28,119
do to become where I am today was all

1278
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:30,440
the the time kicking me in my stomach

1279
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:32,358
and testing me if I really want to work

1280
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:33,480
legally with cannabis and I said all the

1281
01:01:32,358 --> 01:01:36,679
time

1282
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:39,240
yeah I will find my way so again coming

1283
01:01:36,679 --> 01:01:42,440
this was also something I came home to

1284
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:45,519
my wife and she said what's going on in

1285
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:47,440
six days is uh in five days is Christmas

1286
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:50,358
we have New Year's Eve you lost your job

1287
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:53,240
you lost your your um shares of this

1288
01:01:50,358 --> 01:01:54,400
company he kicked you right before

1289
01:01:53,239 --> 01:01:58,479
everything

1290
01:01:54,400 --> 01:02:01,318
would un redoble he kicked you out and

1291
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:03,559
then the next time was when I lost my

1292
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:06,400
job because the company get bankrupt so

1293
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:08,519
I had many times where I get a huge

1294
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:11,240
setback and had to explain my whole

1295
01:02:08,519 --> 01:02:13,278
family in a in a nonexisting

1296
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:16,679
legalization on the horizons that I

1297
01:02:13,278 --> 01:02:19,480
still will work in this market so it was

1298
01:02:16,679 --> 01:02:24,278
driven by Passion and never by money

1299
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:26,480
yeah and yeah and um then I said okay

1300
01:02:24,278 --> 01:02:29,639
let's start a YouTube channel by my own

1301
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:33,199
you are crazy I convinced her and now I

1302
01:02:29,639 --> 01:02:35,960
said okay how can I start that and there

1303
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:39,358
are um in the

1304
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:41,159
German system if you have been working

1305
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:43,880
you get money I don't know how you call

1306
01:02:41,159 --> 01:02:46,759
that in the states yeah unemployment or

1307
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:50,559
unemployment yeah so and when you are in

1308
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:53,160
the system they also have programs where

1309
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:55,519
they they are where you can write a

1310
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:57,719
business plan and when they see a

1311
01:02:55,519 --> 01:03:01,119
potenti potential they don't force you

1312
01:02:57,719 --> 01:03:03,078
to find a new job they give you a halfe

1313
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,640
support that you can start this job

1314
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:07,680
because then they get you out of the

1315
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:10,318
system yeah of the unemployment system

1316
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:12,558
and I wrote a business plan I want I

1317
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:15,519
make it long story short I want to

1318
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:18,319
become a content creator for cannabis I

1319
01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:20,960
have uh seen in my old company that we

1320
01:03:18,318 --> 01:03:24,920
can make this amount of money with that

1321
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:28,000
many output of videos I can uh I can uh

1322
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:30,639
earn that much amount of money and the

1323
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,880
woman I presented the business plan she

1324
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:35,558
was completely

1325
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:37,160
um she didn't know how to work with it

1326
01:03:35,559 --> 01:03:39,278
because the business plan was good I

1327
01:03:37,159 --> 01:03:41,440
studied economics but the topic was

1328
01:03:39,278 --> 01:03:44,798
completely crazy she she said okay we

1329
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:47,960
have to change something you you you you

1330
01:03:44,798 --> 01:03:50,719
you cross out all the word cannabis and

1331
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:53,559
you don't talk about the market and I

1332
01:03:50,719 --> 01:03:57,038
will get this somehow done for you

1333
01:03:53,559 --> 01:04:01,760
approved and I I'm so than ful so you

1334
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:05,520
did did yeah I got a supportive €1,500

1335
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:08,240
for 6 months [ __ ] man so I could focus

1336
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:09,038
on building the YouTube channel five

1337
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:11,358
years

1338
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:14,278
ago great man and yeah it worked so I

1339
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:18,519
got support from the German government

1340
01:04:14,278 --> 01:04:21,159
to build a cannabis business long before

1341
01:04:18,519 --> 01:04:24,519
legalization so that's that's such a

1342
01:04:21,159 --> 01:04:26,879
great story I wish I could like be a fly

1343
01:04:24,519 --> 01:04:31,199
on the wall looking at that lady when

1344
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:32,680
she's reading your um proposal and I the

1345
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:35,679
only thing it makes me a little sad that

1346
01:04:32,679 --> 01:04:37,558
they made you take out the Cannabis but

1347
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:39,399
but I'm glad that you got it that's

1348
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:42,278
that's what's most important was that

1349
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:44,200
they gave not even man not even seeds

1350
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:46,679
were allowed at that time you know in

1351
01:04:44,199 --> 01:04:49,118
can you know in Europe all Europe was SE

1352
01:04:46,679 --> 01:04:51,919
seeds you could sell but but to speak to

1353
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:54,440
speak was allowed to speak was allowed

1354
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:57,000
yeah right so to speak he wasn't doing

1355
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:58,880
anything illegal by talking about it by

1356
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,719
being an advocate for it no there is

1357
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:04,640
something there is something as a

1358
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:06,480
YouTuber since as the first 6 and a half

1359
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:10,639
years now we have the

1360
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:12,838
decriminalization I had to be so careful

1361
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:15,798
what I said and

1362
01:05:12,838 --> 01:05:17,920
how I I explained you how I made my

1363
01:05:15,798 --> 01:05:21,119
content and what wasn't allowed I wasn't

1364
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:24,358
allowed to say you have to take the

1365
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:27,798
plant and cut it and place it and dunk

1366
01:05:24,358 --> 01:05:30,159
it and put in and wait because then I

1367
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:31,559
was giving a straight advice to the

1368
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:35,519
viewer of the

1369
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:39,559
video I had really to be strict

1370
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:42,719
with if you take a cutting the process

1371
01:05:39,559 --> 01:05:44,960
no no the process of taking a cutting is

1372
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:47,919
to take a mother plant to cut it like

1373
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:50,199
this to dip it to put it and I had to

1374
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:52,519
put the disclaimer and really my my team

1375
01:05:50,199 --> 01:05:54,558
behind me at the First Youtube channel

1376
01:05:52,519 --> 01:05:56,318
they teached me to be really really

1377
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:58,480
careful with my wording

1378
01:05:56,318 --> 01:06:00,838
because the government could watch my

1379
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:04,760
video and say

1380
01:06:00,838 --> 01:06:08,358
okay he is giving advice to be

1381
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:12,599
conspiracy exactly it was

1382
01:06:08,358 --> 01:06:14,960
crazy conspiracy I mean it's not

1383
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:17,400
conspiracy laws whether in the US or in

1384
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:19,199
other countries are just crazy yeah you

1385
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:22,200
know when when you're not actually you

1386
01:06:19,199 --> 01:06:24,199
know because conspiracy means like we're

1387
01:06:22,199 --> 01:06:27,838
working together to do

1388
01:06:24,199 --> 01:06:29,558
something bad right but you're not

1389
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:32,558
conspiring with people that you never

1390
01:06:29,559 --> 01:06:35,079
actually met or talked to you know you

1391
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:37,960
were you were educating but yeah yeah I

1392
01:06:35,079 --> 01:06:41,000
was helping for sure but uh but you know

1393
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:43,720
it was the same thing here again in The

1394
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,239
Grow shops you weren't allowed to talk

1395
01:06:43,719 --> 01:06:49,639
about wheat no you know they would

1396
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:51,399
always say that it was a tomato or I

1397
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:53,519
shouldn't you know that changed when I

1398
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:55,760
when I had my grow Stop Shop eventually

1399
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:58,358
things changed because um medic

1400
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:00,240
marijuana became legal and and so we

1401
01:06:58,358 --> 01:07:03,078
became much more open about talking but

1402
01:07:00,239 --> 01:07:04,598
when I used to go to a grow shop the

1403
01:07:03,079 --> 01:07:07,760
mere mention of cannabis would get you

1404
01:07:04,599 --> 01:07:11,200
thrown out exactly I was throwing out

1405
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:13,000
out people as an employee and um each

1406
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:15,000
time we had like this discussions in the

1407
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,239
team when somebody came in and he was

1408
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:21,159
like really penetrant with asking this

1409
01:07:17,239 --> 01:07:24,519
questions and we [ __ ] is he is he a

1410
01:07:21,159 --> 01:07:28,159
cop it was you know it was considered

1411
01:07:24,519 --> 01:07:32,119
illegal to sell something to someone

1412
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:35,239
that you knew was was gonna do something

1413
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:38,200
illegal exactly you know and I mean I

1414
01:07:35,239 --> 01:07:40,719
guess the same thing still applies for

1415
01:07:38,199 --> 01:07:43,598
other things like if you go to a

1416
01:07:40,719 --> 01:07:46,759
drugstore and you know you're buying you

1417
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:48,480
know psea fed every day then they might

1418
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:52,079
stop you because they think that you're

1419
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:54,599
making drugs or or something like that

1420
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:57,039
but yeah you know when you tell your

1421
01:07:54,599 --> 01:07:57,838
stories and I had the same situation

1422
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:00,039
with

1423
01:07:57,838 --> 01:08:02,318
Sasha they're so

1424
01:08:00,039 --> 01:08:04,240
similar you know I I have similar

1425
01:08:02,318 --> 01:08:06,838
stories and I won't tell them now about

1426
01:08:04,239 --> 01:08:09,479
how Partners were giving me equity and

1427
01:08:06,838 --> 01:08:12,759
then ripped me off and and stuff like

1428
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:16,238
that and it's just amazing to me that

1429
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:19,480
you know 6 7,000 miles away however far

1430
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:21,439
you you guys are the stories are all the

1431
01:08:19,479 --> 01:08:24,559
same sometimes it happens at a a

1432
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:27,719
different time but you know the

1433
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:29,880
similarities are are incredible and are

1434
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:31,640
you are your videos still online those

1435
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,600
early videos of you teaching people how

1436
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,920
to make

1437
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:37,600
clones well I encourage anyone that

1438
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:39,520
speaks German to check it out I'm going

1439
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:43,359
to try to check it out without speaking

1440
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:45,960
German but uh yeah that's great yeah the

1441
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:48,159
the the the beautiful thing to come into

1442
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:51,719
the presence is

1443
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:54,079
that I like I said I stopped growing my

1444
01:08:51,719 --> 01:08:59,679
passion

1445
01:08:54,079 --> 01:09:03,039
I my system was re my system was

1446
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:06,560
crying get your hands on for sure I

1447
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:08,439
never let the contact to the plant occur

1448
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:11,920
completely I still was

1449
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:14,158
doing which was risky but not that risky

1450
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:17,000
I still was making Consulting I went

1451
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:20,198
into the gardens I helped the people so

1452
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:22,560
in out yeah in out I wanted to ask you

1453
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:24,798
about that when you talked about when

1454
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:27,600
you become a medical patient that you

1455
01:09:24,798 --> 01:09:29,158
had to start smoking really bad weed but

1456
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:32,359
you didn't have friends that could hook

1457
01:09:29,158 --> 01:09:37,000
you up yeah for sure but you the for

1458
01:09:32,359 --> 01:09:40,199
sure 100% but it was like this was my

1459
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,198
status and

1460
01:09:41,479 --> 01:09:45,479
I I had to buy the wheat at the

1461
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:47,158
beginning

1462
01:09:45,479 --> 01:09:52,158
1,200

1464
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:57,679
shitty dead weat and then for sure

1465
01:09:55,679 --> 01:10:01,319
friends of mine and also through the

1466
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:04,760
Consulting I got my my good quality top

1467
01:10:01,319 --> 01:10:07,439
shelf weed but I couldn't rely on it and

1468
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:10,119
I couldn't buy it because I had to spend

1469
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:13,000
it to get my card and to show that I buy

1470
01:10:10,119 --> 01:10:16,519
my weed this was the the problem I had

1471
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,960
to show that I buy it every month yeah

1472
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:19,880
if you didn't buy enough they would say

1473
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:22,198
you don't need as much yeah they say

1474
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:24,719
then they would say ah okay you got the

1475
01:10:22,198 --> 01:10:27,039
the recipe for your medical and now you

1476
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:29,239
are buying it or growing it and this was

1477
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:32,158
important and this is why I went to the

1478
01:10:29,238 --> 01:10:35,639
court and said also I I am a patient

1479

1480
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:41,880
medical amount and

1481
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:45,719

1482
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:48,079

1547
01:13:41,319 --> 01:13:47,238
transition you know from the time that

01:13:43,279 --> 01:13:49,198
illegality the total illegal and now uh

1549
01:13:47,238 --> 01:13:52,079
all the world is thinking like it's

1550
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:54,638
legalized but I know it's decriminalized

1551
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:56,800
yeah can you explain a little bit from

1552
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:59,560
your pers Ed what is going on in Germany

1553
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:01,840
right now yeah this is exactly where I

1554
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:04,000
wanted to continue so I said and now you

1555
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:06,239
know how I met my wife also through

1556
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:10,520
cannabis um definitely taking the

1557
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:13,000
decision to marry this woman and then I

1558
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:15,440
was making YouTube I wasn't growing I

1559
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:19,560
told you I stopped growing for showing

1560
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:23,559
face and then the 1 of April this year

1561
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:27,560
no last year we got a

1562
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:32,039
decriminalization it was a [ __ ] hard

1563
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:35,320
battle and it's far away from being a

1564
01:14:32,039 --> 01:14:38,719
perfect law it's a really complicated

1565
01:14:35,319 --> 01:14:38,719
law and with a lot of

1566
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:46,800
nonsense but we have our foot into the

1567
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:49,199
door so I I'm growing again just free

1568
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:52,679
plans just free plans you have to

1569
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:55,479
imagine I'm glad and happy but not

1570
01:14:52,679 --> 01:14:57,880
satisfied because I can't hold mothers I

1571
01:14:55,479 --> 01:15:00,759
can't build up a library at the moment

1572
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:02,920
with I can't go on a on a on a hunt for

1573
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:05,400
genetics for fenos it's impossible at

1574
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:07,719
the moment for me as a private person

1575
01:15:05,399 --> 01:15:12,000
can I ask about that do they consider a

1576
01:15:07,719 --> 01:15:14,920
plant having Roots yeah um we had some

1577
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,719
oh this is now the the reason I was

1578
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:19,560
going to ask is can you have tissue

1579
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:23,119
culture can you grow mother plant be

1580
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:25,920
this would be the the best argument

1581
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:27,359
because okay we go we dive somewhere

1582
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:30,880
into the

1583
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:36,158
law in the law is written that if that a

1584
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:40,719
cannabis plant is a fe is a female plant

1585
01:15:36,158 --> 01:15:44,238
with um with flowers or at least with

1586
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:48,039
the beginning of flower with the uh with

1587
01:15:44,238 --> 01:15:48,039
the sexing yeah with the

1588
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:56,119
pistols and then there is the term

1589
01:15:52,399 --> 01:16:00,039
materal um

1590
01:15:56,119 --> 01:16:04,079
um parts of the plan to

1591
01:16:00,039 --> 01:16:05,840
reproduce and we F and we hoped because

1592
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:07,158
this law isn't perfect and a lot of

1593
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:09,119
things will

1594
01:16:07,158 --> 01:16:13,000
be um

1595
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:15,760
determinated in front of Court yeah and

1596
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:20,439
the the the judges are now saying that

1597
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:23,800
each plant with roots in

1598
01:16:20,439 --> 01:16:28,479
soil and even we have the problems that

1599
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:31,360
even the jfy the easy pla or the rock

1600
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:33,279
wool that when it comes to the case that

1601
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:36,119
they come to your home and they find 25

1602
01:16:33,279 --> 01:16:39,599
plants and you have cuting the judge at

1603
01:16:36,119 --> 01:16:43,079
the moment will bring it and say it's a

1604
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:46,800
plant even if the law it's written

1605
01:16:43,079 --> 01:16:49,800
different and it's a [ __ ] up

1606
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:51,679
situation really this is why I'm

1607
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:55,119
teaching the people or not teaching but

1608
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:57,719
telling them we are not legal

1609
01:16:55,119 --> 01:17:01,079
we are decriminalized we still have to

1610
01:16:57,719 --> 01:17:03,760
fight for a real

1611
01:17:01,079 --> 01:17:06,840
legalization enjoy your new

1612
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:09,760
freedom but don't get cozy on your

1613
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:12,480
[ __ ] sofa we have to go on the

1614
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:15,320
[ __ ] Street to to fight for a real

1615
01:17:12,479 --> 01:17:16,879
for me legal it's okay if there is like

1616
01:17:15,319 --> 01:17:19,399
I'm not allowed to have more than three

1617
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:21,960
kilos at home and it's okay for me but

1618
01:17:19,399 --> 01:17:25,079
it's not the case it's 50 GRS I'm not

1619
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:28,760
able to grow free plants which are

1620
01:17:25,079 --> 01:17:31,479
allowed to the maximum and say okay I I

1621
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:33,880
keep all the flowers at home and on the

1622
01:17:31,479 --> 01:17:37,198
50 g is very little it's nothing it's

1623
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:38,880
one tiny plant yeah I I have here a

1624
01:17:37,198 --> 01:17:40,000
little bit hanging and it's nearly the

1625
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:43,400
half

1626
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:47,880
so and yeah I mean 50

1627
01:17:43,399 --> 01:17:49,039
gr you know for instance if it takes two

1628
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:51,319
months to

1629
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:54,039
grow okay and you're only allowed to

1630
01:17:51,319 --> 01:17:56,759
have 50 gr you're not allowed to have

1631
01:17:54,039 --> 01:18:00,880
more than a gram a day so yeah and this

1632
01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:05,560
is exactly the thing the law says that

1633
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:09,199
um 50 gr of dried consumable flow but

1634
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:12,440
the I keep the dirty words away but when

1635
01:18:09,198 --> 01:18:12,439
they come bust

1636
01:18:13,359 --> 01:18:21,039
you if they come and they bust you which

1637
01:18:17,238 --> 01:18:23,519
still occures and you are just a real

1638
01:18:21,039 --> 01:18:25,319
good citizen paying taxes and growing

1639
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:28,560
for your own and don't bringing more

1640
01:18:25,319 --> 01:18:32,679
than 25 gs on the street you are even

1641
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:36,679
not allowed to share a joint with your

1642
01:18:32,679 --> 01:18:38,679
friends you are not allowed to share

1643
01:18:36,679 --> 01:18:43,399
weed different

1644
01:18:38,679 --> 01:18:45,800
story are not legal in Germany okay yeah

1645
01:18:43,399 --> 01:18:49,000
we have to spread it to the world but we

1646
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:52,159
have our foot in the door

1647
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:55,920
so I everything starts somewhere just so

1648
01:18:52,158 --> 01:18:59,198
you know and like I mean it's still

1649
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:01,079
it's still a great I it's it's really

1650
01:18:59,198 --> 01:19:03,960
late this should have happened a long

1651
01:19:01,079 --> 01:19:07,119
time ago but this still is a really

1652
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:09,960
great first step definitely you know I

1653
01:19:07,119 --> 01:19:12,319
am also and and then you know as we

1654
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:14,399
taught you know the government that that

1655
01:19:12,319 --> 01:19:17,039
this should be allowed then eventually

1656
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:19,198
it'll be more and and more and and then

1657
01:19:17,039 --> 01:19:22,760
before you know it there will be you

1658
01:19:19,198 --> 01:19:24,799
know Cannabis shops you know on on every

1659
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:28,760
street like there is in big cities here

1660
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:30,400
yeah the thing is we as humans are

1661
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:34,000
unpatient

1662
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:38,238
and from a economical

1663
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:41,560
perspective a four to fiveyear rhythm in

1664
01:19:38,238 --> 01:19:44,599
politici in politics on inan economics

1665
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:48,320
it's called like one year of a human

1666
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:51,600
being so the problem is that I learned

1667
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:53,920
because now I'm so long time observing

1668
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:57,400
the process and now we have new

1669
01:19:53,920 --> 01:20:00,440
elections next problem but what I want

1670
01:19:57,399 --> 01:20:03,359
to say is that I know that now we can

1671
01:20:00,439 --> 01:20:06,158
show the people that we don't become

1672
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:09,039
zombies smoking weed so there will

1673
01:20:06,158 --> 01:20:12,158
occure a higher acceptance we have the

1674
01:20:09,039 --> 01:20:14,198
highest um when they make polls who

1675
01:20:12,158 --> 01:20:17,879
wants to legalize who don't want to

1676
01:20:14,198 --> 01:20:21,839
legalize anymore or further step we have

1677
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:26,319
the highest acceptance

1678
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:27,719
52% I I continue There yeah yeah yeah

1679
01:20:26,319 --> 01:20:31,039
yeah yeah

1680
01:20:27,719 --> 01:20:35,109
yeah maybe because yeah yeah yeah we

1681
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:37,279
have the highest acceptance of

1682
01:20:35,109 --> 01:20:40,679
[Laughter]

1683
01:20:37,279 --> 01:20:42,359
legalization am I throwing you off no no

1684
01:20:40,679 --> 01:20:45,600
we have the highest acceptance of

1685
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:49,599
legalizations than ever yeah but we

1686
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:53,840
are not legal so

1687
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:55,320
um it's it's crazy this law and it would

1688
01:20:53,840 --> 01:21:00,199
take a whole

1689
01:20:55,319 --> 01:21:03,759
own podcast to go through

1690
01:21:00,198 --> 01:21:07,039
the the whole law and to explain

1691
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:10,000
everything with hom growing with project

1692
01:21:07,039 --> 01:21:13,039
test projects with cannabis Social Clubs

1693
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:15,960
with the new elections being in front of

1694
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:19,198
us right now and people being feared

1695
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:21,480
that this law will be how you call it um

1696
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:24,919
repealed

1697
01:21:21,479 --> 01:21:28,319
repealed crazy so many people 4 and a

1698
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:31,199
half to 6 million people as

1699
01:21:28,319 --> 01:21:33,198
consumers can be relieved that they are

1700
01:21:31,198 --> 01:21:37,599
not criminal anymore and they have to

1701
01:21:33,198 --> 01:21:42,119
fear to become criminals again well but

1702
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:46,320
I don't see that really but I can't deny

1703
01:21:42,119 --> 01:21:49,800
that I am also in a little bit of fear

1704
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:52,479
because the whole world is going crazy

1705
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:54,159
and we getting from a democracy to a in

1706
01:21:52,479 --> 01:21:56,559
the states I don't want to talk about

1707
01:21:54,158 --> 01:22:02,119
that but also Europe the shift to the

1708
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:02,120
extreme right is there

1709
01:22:02,359 --> 01:22:10,679
and really short if I watch now which

1710
01:22:06,439 --> 01:22:14,359
possible Co coal Coalition yeah are

1711
01:22:10,679 --> 01:22:17,000
possible in Germany it's crazy it's

1712
01:22:14,359 --> 01:22:20,079
really it's

1713
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:23,000
hard if the conservative party which is

1714
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:27,119
not the extreme right they alone they

1715
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:29,359
want to to Really to to undo this law

1716
01:22:27,119 --> 01:22:31,000
and this is something they claim also

1717
01:22:29,359 --> 01:22:33,880
but they don't will have a coalition

1718
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:36,600
partner because all the other parties

1719
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:39,440
Who legalized let's call them legalized

1720
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:40,880
parties they are the only options in

1721
01:22:39,439 --> 01:22:42,599
certain

1722
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:44,920
different

1723
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:50,639
combination to build

1724
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:55,239
a to build um government a

1725
01:22:50,639 --> 01:23:00,719
government but there is the huge amount

1726
01:22:55,238 --> 01:23:02,678
of afd right party and also if the

1727
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:05,239
conservatives said they don't will work

1728
01:23:02,679 --> 01:23:05,239
with them

1729
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:15,238
together we don't know MH and if this D

1730
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:18,719
yeah so you know also similar stuff has

1731
01:23:15,238 --> 01:23:21,439
happened here too you know it's um it's

1732
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:23,439
like the EB and flow of the tide things

1733
01:23:21,439 --> 01:23:26,198
get better and then they get worse I

1734
01:23:23,439 --> 01:23:29,198
mean there was County in California

1735
01:23:26,198 --> 01:23:31,439
where they legalized it to grow and then

1736
01:23:29,198 --> 01:23:33,559
all these people set up their grows and

1737
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:36,319
then the then the county changed their

1738
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:39,600
mind you know the sheriff didn't wanted

1739
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:41,079
to fulfill the law I heard also yeah so

1740
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:45,520
I mean like I said the Sim the

1741
01:23:41,079 --> 01:23:49,519
similarities are yeah are palpable yeah

1742
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:51,760
czy okay um so you said you wanted to

1743
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:55,360
tell the the good side of the

1744
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:56,920
story yeah there are also definitely

1745
01:23:55,359 --> 01:24:01,519
good parts

1746
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:04,800
now you can grow free Plants it's a

1747
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:07,560
beginning uh a lot of people are not

1748
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:09,520
criminals anymore who never have been

1749
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:12,960
criminals yeah who have been just

1750
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:15,199
consumers and lovers of the plant and

1751
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:19,760
took the decision to consume cannabis

1752
01:24:15,198 --> 01:24:19,759
instead of other things after

1753
01:24:20,439 --> 01:24:27,799
work the beauty the beauty is

1754
01:24:25,359 --> 01:24:29,559
that you see now the culture the

1755
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:33,880
Cannabis culture in Germany which have

1756
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:35,360
been there all decades and was living

1757
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:39,199
under the

1758
01:24:35,359 --> 01:24:42,118
surface and from the moment from the 1

1759
01:24:39,198 --> 01:24:44,719
of April where the new

1760

1762
01:24:51,158 --> 01:24:55,879

1793
01:26:17,279 --> 01:26:22,920
moment yeah it's a seed germinating it's

1794
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:25,238
a seed that's beginning to grow and it's

1795

1797
01:26:28,039 --> 01:26:34,000
push of

1798
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:37,440
also the content I could do right now I

1799
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:40,880
could show washing hash also if YouTube

1800

tries to [ __ ] me up and to H restrict

1801
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:43,039
the

1802
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:49,800
content I could wash hash and inspire

1803
01:26:46,679 --> 01:26:54,039
people to wash hash on the next level I

1804
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:55,679
don't I'm not a pro I'm a student but to

1805
01:26:54,039 --> 01:26:57,679
the the beauty is that I am in touch

1806
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:59,880
with all the hash artists

1807
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:03,079
internationally and with every German

1808
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:05,279
hash Artist Artist and I could ask and

1809
01:27:03,079 --> 01:27:08,760
spend time with them washing

1810
01:27:05,279 --> 01:27:12,519
and again from the forums to social

1811
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:15,400
media from me having the possibility to

1812
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:17,719
be side by side with people washing on

1813
01:27:15,399 --> 01:27:19,839
the highest level transferring this

1814
01:27:17,719 --> 01:27:21,800
knowledge to the whole community and I

1815
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:25,400
can tell you in the last weeks and

1816
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:29,719
months the level of hash hom Growers are

1817
01:27:25,399 --> 01:27:33,158
washing from Dirty scent to white stuff

1818
01:27:29,719 --> 01:27:37,118
and now drying without freeze dryer we

1819
01:27:33,158 --> 01:27:38,759
have really the the air drying movement

1820
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:41,599
at the moment because the people can't

1821
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:44,440
afford a freeze dryer but they want

1822
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:49,560
higher quality so they go the painful

1823
01:27:44,439 --> 01:27:52,319
way of of simulating sulation in just a

1824
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:55,600
freezer and sifting the hash and drying

1825
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:58,158
it with W vacuum and putting it back in

1826
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:00,520
the freezer without a freeze

1827
01:27:58,158 --> 01:28:04,799
