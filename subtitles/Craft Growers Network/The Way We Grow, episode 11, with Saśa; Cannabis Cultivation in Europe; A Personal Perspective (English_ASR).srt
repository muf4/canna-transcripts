US citizens to find me actually because

actually gens

21
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:07,158
is a term in German which means a garden

22
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:09,759
dwarf the the caregiver of your garden

23
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,320
you know like you know in German culture

24
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:13,000
there is people who have a lot of people

25
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:15,599
have these Gardens and they have this

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,239
little dwarf hidden inside of the garden

27
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,839
somewhere he's hiding you know I I

28
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:23,839
actually few years ago I did it

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,400
purposely when I open up my own company

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,000
that uh I wanted to Target the German

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,280
speaking Market actually I was not

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,239
interested in us Market at that time or

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,159
any other Market uh so I purposely did

34
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:41,319
it cuz I'm small guy I have a little

35
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:43,399
beard and I have like ponytail and you

36
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:46,199

37
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:49,320

38
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,359
dwarf is Garden but I will open up I

40
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:56,920
I think before this video goes out it

42
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,560

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,438
know I opened the rock two months ago

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,959
with you guys uh for me still I live in

45
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:12,318
a place that is uh um very much illegal

46
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:15,159
to flower Canabis uh you can grow it but

47
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:18,199
you cannot flower it you know right so

48
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:21,000
um that kind of area and uh it's very

49
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:23,238
interesting times for for uh

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,400
decriminalization and legalization in

51
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:29,319
Europe now it's it's it's going up and

52
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,840
down man uh it's you know when you to

53
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:34,560
look to Germany now in this moment is

54
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,719
very very very difficult situation

55
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,878
because we don't know in this moment if

56
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:43,959
they going to uh make it illegal

57
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:46,719
again they are talking about it that

58
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:50,239
they will forbid it again actually I

59
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:52,680
cannot even uh think about how how can

60
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,920
this you know how people will go on the

61
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,120
street it will be a riots you know this

62
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,679
will be this will be problem because

63
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,480
they allowed people to grow at home

64
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,680
three plants they can possess like 50 g

65
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:10,039
a month um this is in Germany this is in

66
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,959
Germany yeah yeah uh so now the because

67
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:16,359
of the government is not there it's it's

68
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,598
like the the there you know building the

69
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:23,480
government which is not it's not going

70
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:25,839
well now and now the the parties are are

71
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:28,639
on the r which is actually against the

72
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,400
legalization so they want to make it uh

73
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:33,238
illegal again sure uh which is

74
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,840
Impractical I don't know how it's

75
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,680
possible to do that now uh but let's see

76
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,039
okay and I will not talk about it we

77
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,879
have guests who Vincent we was on the on

78
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:47,400
the on the show a few weeks ago we we'll

79
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:50,598
do another show with him in soon so he

80
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,200
maybe can tell much more than me but I

81
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:55,438
hear something you know because I'm in

82
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:58,158
Austria but I live in Slovenia but uh I

83
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:00,438
have a business in Austria with clones

84
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:03,438
so we are quite dependent on the German

85
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:06,199
Market also so it's like right maybe in

86
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:09,039
a few months I cannot ship anymore there

87
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:10,919
again you know that would be crazy that

88
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,639
would be really unfortunate yeah I will

89
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:16,079
keep you updated about this definitely

90
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:18,680
so for sure well you know we know that

91
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,879
you know you have this uh awesome clone

92
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,800
business where you're selling uh unique

93
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:25,000
genetics that are sought after in the

94
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,199
European market uh from some of our

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,319
previous talks and so I would definitely

96
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,840
suggest the guests go back and listen to

97
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:33,038
those uh so that we don't have to

98
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:34,719
retouch on too much of that here because

99
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:37,159
I really want to get into your growing

100
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,039
style knowing that you are in a

101
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:43,120
completely different Market than what

102
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:46,079
the US uh is and that you know you have

103
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,840
some let's call it past experience with

104
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:52,758
growing flower out um you know in

105
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:55,439
different scenarios and settings uh

106
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,800
so what were some of like so I always

107
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,279
like to start this uh show with talking

108
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,600
about some of your first experience with

109
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:04,599
plants um and I do feel like we talked

110
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,600
about that before but if you don't mind

111
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,039
kind of taking it back just a little bit

112
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,680
for some of the newer listeners and

113
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:14,199
telling us a little bit about your um

114
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,759
your personal history with plants where

115
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:19,319
it all started and how it evolved into

116
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:22,479
cannabis or if it evolved from Cannabis

117
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:25,600
into you know uh a desire to grow

118
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:27,360
vegetables or other um other things in

119
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,199
general just to kind of take us a little

120
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,120
bit along your growing story good

121
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:35,199
question actually that you mentioned uh

122
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:39,079
if vegetables were my first inspiration

123
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:42,240
definitely yes uh I grew up in a garden

124
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:44,879
of my grandmother which uh in that time

125
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,400
in Yugoslavian time it was in the 50s

126
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:53,879
60s she everybody after the second World

127
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:58,079
War uh grew food at home because um it

128
00:05:53,879 --> 00:06:00,399
was you know after Wars normally

129
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:03,120
everything is destroyed all the economy

130
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:06,799
is gone so you are depending on your own

131
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,918
few meters of garden to have maybe

132
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,000
better food than you know you can do

133
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,439
what you do so I grew up in a very

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,800
beautiful beautiful garden which my

135
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:20,918
grandmother carried so much about and uh

136
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,598
she she gave this knowledge to my mother

137
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:24,639
and my mother also to me but my

138
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:26,439
grandmother actually was more of a

139
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,759
because you know I grew up and my

140
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:30,079
grandmother's still alive and she

141
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:32,479
actually

142
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,598
uh let me play in her garden all the

143
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:36,839
time and I had to do work also you know

144
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:39,639
my first experiences with with plants is

145
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:44,239
is potato tomato

146
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:46,639
salad uh you know herbs a lot of herbs

147
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,439
uh I have you know my grandmother even

148
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,360
let me have my own patch when I was like

149
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:54,439
5 years old that's cool yeah she she

150
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:59,000
said you do you remember what you grew

151
00:06:54,439 --> 00:07:02,918
yeah uh carrots um it was carrots and

152
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,199
some Sal got one tomato nice but you

153
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:08,120
have to understand that in these times

154
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,080
you we did not buy seeds all of the

155
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,879
seeds were made by my grandmother for

156
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:17,758
that you took you take because this is

157
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:20,960
heirloom varieties you know today we we

158
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,038
know that this is a weom Tom but at that

159
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:26,918
time we didn't know about anything else

160
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:29,918
we just take you have one uh uh variety

161
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:31,878
of tomato or two maybe uh and one

162
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:35,198
variety of carrots one variety of

163
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:38,280
cabbage one variety of of of potato or

164
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,840
two maybe sure not a lot but all of

165
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:44,359
these were very stable and they

166
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:49,158
performed in uh the you know the teroa

167
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:52,080
you know the the the it was the um um

168
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:55,199
the stuff that grew here for 50 years

169
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:58,359
already before they select they selected

170
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:02,560
so much it was acclimated to the climate

171
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:04,240
and to the yeah that's awesome yeah and

172
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,639
this is also the basic knowledge for

173
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,960
cannabis after okay we talking about it

174
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,918
right now because this is the basic

175
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:15,399
knowledge how you select yeah sure uh

176
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:17,719
because outdoor growing uh you know you

177
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:22,758
have to understand until 2003 I never

178
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:26,360
saw a plant growing indoors okay yeah uh

179
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:31,439
from my childhood from the end of' 70s

180
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:34,879
uh until the 2000 three I never saw a

181
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:38,639
plant grow under light never okay always

182
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:41,559
under Sun always which with all the

183
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:45,159
envir environment which means uh very

184
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:48,679
good soil very good soil means for me I

185
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:51,159
live on a river very near a river and

186
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:53,559
the river bed you know when the river

187
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:57,319
this river is very big and it's not

188
00:08:53,559 --> 00:09:00,679
controlled 100 years ago and it went you

189
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:03,440
know it how you say it uh flood a lot

190
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:05,958
yeah like overflowed overflowed yeah so

191
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,880
it is a lot of sediment the river is

192
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:13,078
Alpine River it has a lot of uh

193
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:15,480
magnesium calcium a lot of iron a lot of

194
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:18,359
Tracee Trace elements already in the

195
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,839
water so it's like and the the river is

196
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:24,200
like few M away from my house here it's

197
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:27,000
a big big river it's a yeah it's called

198
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:30,278
mura and uh yeah

199
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,399
so to go to kabes then you know like

200
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:35,240
growing up in a garden um in Yugoslavia

201
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:38,320
at my grandmother's place you know we

202
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:42,120
have also we have animals we have pigs

203
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:45,560
we have chicken we had rabbits uh we

204
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:48,320
grew I mean one of very near there was a

205
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:51,159
Butchery here it's like there is a lot

206
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:55,160
of you know it's like a farm you know

207
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:57,838
like we yeah so I saw a lot of reality

208
00:09:55,159 --> 00:10:00,719
in the beginning food production was for

209
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,640
me very very normal uh when I was 10

210
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:08,160
years old I knew everything you know

211
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:13,360
about food about food about the plant to

212
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:16,078
to the ripeness of a of a fruit and

213
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,759
produce that fruit or even if it's not

214
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:21,319
vegetable it's meat I saw everything you

215
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:24,759
know traditionally in Slovenia at that

216
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:27,720
time when I grew up we used to kill two

217
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:31,120
pigs uh and in the in the winter time

218
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,639
like No And as kids we were all there

219
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,919
you know to see that you know how an

220
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,278
animal was opened and everything was

221
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:40,479
taken out and all the meat was used and

222
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:42,838
every part of the animal was used really

223
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:47,800
every every part not a lot was thrown

224
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:49,120
away um so um it is like that you know

225
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:52,120
when you grow up in this kind of

226
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,839
environment that you actually use

227
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,600
everything you produce

228
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,519
yourself and then when the first kabus

229
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:03,560
came when I was

230
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,560
years old you know and because it was

231
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:08,319
not was that the first time you smoked

232
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:11,518
or the first time that you saw it grow I

233
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:15,440
first time I smoked okay was when I was

234
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:18,839
12 or 13 years old okay and then because

235
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,680
I saw it is a flower and it has seeds

236
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,800
inside for me was of absolutely the

237
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,958
first thing I did was take out the seeds

238
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:30,599
and plant it sure I wanted to see it at

239
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:35,159
once you know absolutely yeah this was

240
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:37,959
1993 1993 yeah all right yeah so I

241
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:39,879
planted them so of course something grew

242
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:43,319
but you know in the beginning was like

243
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:47,320
you know 1993 and then

244
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:50,360
1994 I got seeds from my cin um and he

245
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:53,360
got it from a guy that came from India

246
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:57,000
okay yeah we have a lot of land races

247
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:00,560
here so it's like yeah everybody that

248
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,600
grew here we call it domach which means

249
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:07,638
hom grown you know domma means home

250
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,480
right like doile yeah yeah yeah have

251
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:12,278
like this is homegrown so homegrown

252
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:16,240
means you did it yourself on your garden

253
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:19,198
yeah and domach was really like uh the

254
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,240
average week with was maybe 5 6% THC

255
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:26,599
only yeah sure uh but it was land rais

256
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:30,120
but already acclim it you know okay yeah

257
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,639
uh so then in '96 I I got some seeds

258
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,039
from

259
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:38,759
Amsterdam and those were like you know

260
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:42,639
we grew all the time from 93 296 so are

261
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:44,958

00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:47,519
yeah so I went to lublana which is back

287
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,240
to Slovenia you know okay so I was in

288
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,600
Austria and I way back to Slovenia now

289
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,879
I'm back in Austria again for for my

290
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,800
company because they they allow growing

291
00:13:54,879 --> 00:14:00,958
cannabies uh until you flower uh but

292
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:04,479
let's jump back yeah

293
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:06,838
um the the before anything came from

294
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,560
Amsterdam uh the things that were grown

295
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,399
here were very uh

296
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:13,439
phenotypically very different from each

297
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:17,198
other and all of the stuff was grown

298
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,519
outdoors in compost you know compost

299
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:22,198
gardening style that we do you know when

300
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,519
you do vegetables when you do everything

301
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:27,359
else you know how to do anything it's

302
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:31,839
the same thing with konomis sure it's

303
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:34,959
the same code that the the the uh plants

304
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,240
speak the same language definitely and

305
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:39,638
and I'm assuming you're doing this in

306
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:44,159
some sort of either like raised bed or

307
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:48,480
uh like hugle culture uh sort of um like

308
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:50,639
well tilt or well cared for uh plots of

309
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,399
of land or little patches of Earth yeah

310
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,759
so yeah like you're you're applying

311
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,000
compost to replenish all of your organic

312
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:59,519
matter and making sure that the

313
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,879
microbial colonies there are healthy and

314
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:05,720
you have good vermac compost activity in

315
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:08,720
there and um so I mean yeah but then

316
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:11,040
still you know then still it's uh from

317
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,278
plant to plant it's uh different you

318
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:17,039
know the same plant in the same bed one

319
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:18,559
will perform one will not and why

320
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,679
because they have a different background

321
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,719
for feeding you know they have a

322
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:25,078
different background from parental uh

323
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,959
side and then they have because of that

324
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:32,838
they have this different demand for the

325
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:34,599
food mhm an OG from Pakistan uh and know

326
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:36,959
I say always that the ogs come from

327
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,440
Pakistan Afghanistan region it is

328
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:42,518
Afghanistan it is not Inda it's not

329
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:46,399
sativa it's not ruderalis it's the

330
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:49,600
Afghanistan the the base of of this uh

331
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:53,480
family of plants it has it does not

332
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:56,600
demand a lot of nitrogen it it does not

333
00:15:53,480 --> 00:16:00,560
but if you lack calcium magnesium and

334
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:04,959
iron with this with this OG related

335
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:06,679
plants you always have problems OG OG

336
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:09,599
always want to feed on the trace

337
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:12,039
elements so much and my assumption is

338
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,519
because it's coming from these regions

339
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:17,639
where there is not a lot of nitrogen at

340
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:19,560
all in the ground

341
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,560
nitrogen you know there is a lot of

342
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:25,559
other stuff but nitrogen is not so much

343
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:28,359
present there's not yeah you know um so

344
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:31,239
with other strains like sativa related

345
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:34,480
or more to the equator let me say of

346
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:37,039
course a lot of uh rich soil yeah

347
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,000
because everybody knows equator is

348
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:42,000
volcanic activity is high so you have

349
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,958
even the trace elements you all have

350
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,039
this comp composting which is really all

351
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:50,479
the time there is like layer of compost

352
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:53,439
there which is unbelievable yeah

353
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,199
microbal microbal life always I say to

354
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,199
people when you know a plant is outdoors

355
00:16:56,198 --> 00:17:01,758
planted in the ground not in the plastic

356
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:04,519
container but outdoors in the ground it

357
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:08,640
is like communicating with the with the

358
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:10,798
base again you know uh and uh there is

359
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,319
like this taale of you know there is

360
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:15,160
enzymes and they live in these cities

361
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:17,720
you know the roots go and there is

362
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,839
cities around those roots and some of

363
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,519
these cities are producing for example

364
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:24,599
there is enzymes there and these enzymes

365
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:28,960
go to work and the plants one day says

366
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:31,798
to them today today I need a lot of zinc

367
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,240
and they go to work and they gather the

368
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:36,400
zinc and and the microle it's

369
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,519
transporting the zinc to the to the

370
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,600
veins and it's going up to the plant

371
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:44,279
yeah for sure the ne the next day the

372
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:48,399
same or the other or other uh you know

373
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:52,879
uh organisms are uh uh trying to get

374
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:56,640
iron or trying to get mden or trying to

375
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,880
get uh you know uh you know sulfur for

376
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,799
for the plant you know but it's what

377
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:05,840
what the plant tells those things it

378
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:08,200
comes right yeah in containers signals

379
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:11,519
yeah yeah yeah yeah I think that's great

380
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,798
I mean it makes so much sense in

381
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:17,158
a like in a in a limited Amendment sort

382
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:20,440
of way where you're you're kind of just

383
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:22,919
maintaining a a we we've talked about it

384
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:26,120
before with other guests where if you

385
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:28,480
look at an organic substrate that's you

386
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:30,479
know high in organic matter you have

387
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,519
sand silt and Clay as your main

388
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,360
constituents of the soil right and then

389
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:36,839
you have whatever else is in there

390
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:39,079
whether it be like Leaf litter more

391
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:42,439
organic matter if there's any sort of

392
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:44,279
like pmus or stones in the soil that

393
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:48,360
allow for drainage you know a higher

394
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:52,038
sand percentage in your in your soil um

395
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:54,439
you have this like battery and the the

396
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:57,240
more that you care for it or the larger

397
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,440
it is then that like battery has like a

398
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,279
a greater potential for the plan so it

399
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,840
the plant can tap that battery and get

400
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:06,599
all that energy it needs um even though

401
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:09,319
it's not energy it's the nutrients that

402
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:11,879
supply for the the energy Cycles from

403
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:13,798
the Sun but it's uh it's a I feel like

404
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,360
it's a good analogy to look at it where

405
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:18,679
you are like you care for the substrate

406
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:20,918
substrate takes care of the plant versus

407
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:22,798
in like a hydroponic setting you just

408
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:24,880
need to make sure that your hydroponic

409
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:26,440
nutrients are correct and that the ph

410
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,159
and the EC are where you want it and

411
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,440
then your irrigation practices are in

412
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:31,320
place

413
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,640
um not saying that you don't need

414
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:36,918
irrigation practices in place for

415
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,038
especially if you're in like this uh

416
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:40,200
like directly in the ground you don't

417
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:43,519
want to oversaturate and create some

418
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,080
muddy or anerobic condition no exactly

419
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,839
and that is very good point because

420
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,519
people ask me when they come to my

421
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,678
facility and they

422
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:54,720
see they see the M plants like growing

423
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,640
more than six months like sometimes I

424
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,000
have two plants in a one 11 lit pot it

425
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,600
depends on the strain yeah we have one

426
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,240
Garanimals clone which is also from

427
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:09,038
finest you know American clone uh we we

428
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,159
put two plants in 11 lit container it

429
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:13,000
grows

430
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:15,280
up and it's you can get a lot of clones

431
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,880
like that you know and you have to feed

432
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:20,359
it a lot and then people ask me how do

433
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,400
you do that you know like in 11 L

434
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:25,359
because they are looking like trees

435
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,960
really dark green and I mean dark green

436
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:30,959
green as lime green some strains is not

437
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,480
to be dark too dark because then they

438
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,840
they are too overfit right you have to

439
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:39,440
you have to know your strains to know

440
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:41,439
that right uh the dark green are

441
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,038
normally the ogs that I have in my

442
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,880
company and but the the lighter green

443
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:50,879
are more the sativa is the plank and you

444
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:53,840
know the big butt and the yeah but but

445
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:57,360
the thing is um with

446
00:20:53,839 --> 00:21:00,879
feeding which people always forget is

447
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:03,678
that the roots need a lot of

448
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:07,679
oxygen if you grow in soil which is

449
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:10,919
actually a mix of light mix with we have

450
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,559
which is speed based uh a lot of perlite

451
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:16,200
is inside it's actually very near

452
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:19,839
Hydroponics already because it's not

453
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,919
this is not living soil what we use to

454
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:25,839
do because we need for

455
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:31,400
production and uh if I would grow at

456
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:35,319
home uh when I do uh I I never do any uh

457
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:37,480
live uh I do living soil I don't do live

458
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:40,439
not alive soil you know what I mean but

459
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,319
in but in the company where there is a

460
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,798
schedule and protocol and it's a

461
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:48,359
different story if you go to to this big

462
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:50,798
scales it's it's a total different story

463
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:54,199
it always people are fighting each other

464
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:57,480
against you know if you're organic or uh

465
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:00,159
you know ecological grower or if you are

466
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:03,038
hydr grower and you know but but

467
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:06,360
actually it's not right to to

468
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:09,038
actually it depends on your environment

469
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:11,240
and depends on your demands you know

470
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:13,319
right it's it's uh it's setting

471
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,480
dependent absolutely you can't just say

472
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:18,200
that one style needs to work for

473
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:21,640
everyone that's a little

474
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:24,960
um Centric I guess I it it just doesn't

475
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,440
really work um cuz yeah people have

476
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,960
different demands in their Gardens and

477
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,159
they have different uh desires for their

478
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,798
outcomes so you can't just say that one

479
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:37,000
is the only way to get it done

480
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:39,440
um but let's take it back a little bit

481
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,159
so cuz I want to I want to kind of learn

482
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,759
about your transition from you know it

483
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,159
sounded like you had your one outdoor

484
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:48,359
crop a year of whatever was growing

485
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,278
there you save seeds from it grow some

486
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:53,278
more maybe get some seeds in from

487
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:55,079
Amsterdam or something like that um so

488
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:57,880
what was your first experience then when

489
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:59,798
you really went into it with intention

490
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,520
where you were like I want to make sure

491
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:03,798
that I get really good flower out of

492
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:07,200
this and was that in an outdoor setting

493
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:09,278
or um was it in your first indoor

494
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,960
setting uh and then you know kind of

495
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:12,720
talk about the transition between those

496
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,960
two and what you what you did as a

497
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:20,120
grower okay uh until I went to study in

498
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,079
lublana for you know to study I studied

499
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:24,079
German language and literature and

500
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:28,240
gistic I'm a professor for German

501
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:31,319
language which I don't do know but uh

502
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,679
the the thing is when you go to study to

503
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:35,759
University you have you know a time in

504
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,840
your life that you will never have again

505
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:41,119
you know just doing your studies for me

506
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:44,678
it was very simple I I I choose this and

507
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:48,639
I went to live uh for six years for free

508
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:52,240
you know to be free travel whenever I

509
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,960
want uh it was easy living uh cheap

510
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,440
living uh a lot of friends I made a lot

511
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,038
of friends all around the world um it

512
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,440
was really good time

513
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:04,798
so in this time I realized that people

514
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,640
grow for example in luo there was this

515
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:08,918
guy who grew indoor wheat and I saw that

516
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,559
in

517
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:14,200
2001 I never saw IND IND whe I heard

518
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:17,480
about it but never saw

519
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:20,519
it because we grew so much outside but

520
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,839
even before that you know uh it is like

521
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:25,759
that we were Growers you know because we

522
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:27,480
come from rural areas we live in very

523
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:30,200
you know there's a lot of forest and a

524
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,360
lot of patches and and we were Guerilla

525
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:35,919
like you call it Guerilla growing this

526
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:37,959
what we were uh and today it's like that

527
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,320
that still these kind of people exist

528
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,079
and are still my friends they provided

529
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:45,359
clones also for my

530
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:48,439
facility um these people are still

531
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:51,278
living this kind of way uh and uh

532
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:53,159
through this kind of people I saw that

533
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,038
thing what you asked me when did you

534
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:59,520
realize I realized when we started to

535
00:24:55,038 --> 00:25:02,519
buy seeds from a specific cultivar

536
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:05,398
and then try to find uh between those

537
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:09,960
seeds to try to find uh something that

538
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:13,678
you would like to have again yeah so

539
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:17,079
those people already uh cloned so

540
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:20,320
cloning was on the end of the '90s 98 I

541
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:22,359
think I saw cloning right okay but we

542
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:25,200
did it for outdoor first we didn't

543
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:27,199
flower indoors but indoors under high

544
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,679
pressure sodium lights I saw it first

545
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:33,038
time on 2 one I saw

546
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:34,840
it what what was your impression of that

547
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:38,038
when you when you first saw I was I was

548
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:40,639
blown away it was it was purple wheat

549
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,960
what I saw oh really okay yeah no I

550
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,159
first first thing that I saw on lights

551
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:49,720
it was really purple Wheat really purple

552
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:51,960
yeah it was wow it was Shaman by Dutch

553
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:55,120
Passion The Strain okay which is

554
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:58,000
actually outdoor strain and we we used

555
00:25:55,119 --> 00:26:00,119
to grow it a lot of outdoor after that

556
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,839
uh but those guys already had the moms

557
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:03,798
and during the you know in the winter

558
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:07,240
time when the the month is not there for

559
00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:10,359
those clones they were flowering them

560
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:13,120
indoors yeah so they already made those

561
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:15,639
selections and I actually saw that they

562
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,599
they did it like you know from few packs

563
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:21,120
they popped they have this numbering and

564
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:23,879
then fewers the winners you know which

565
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:25,599
they were reproducing reproducing all

566
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,520
the time and you have you know when you

567
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:29,038
buy wheat from them you have the same

568
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,679
weed for years

569
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:33,839
which is like you buy wheat and it's the

570
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,880
same and you buy wheat it's the same you

571
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:38,319
buy another wheat half a year later it's

572
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:41,360
the same cuz they were doing the clones

573
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:44,278
and that's how we realized it's it's

574
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:46,240
standardized and the standardization

575
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:48,240
standardization of something that is

576
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,440
very much good chosen you know somebody

577
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,278
that choose really good at that times it

578
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,759
was like you could be the master of

579
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:58,000
ceremony you know people you know the

580
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:01,240
whole scene you know the whole concert

581
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,079
scene I was in music business man when

582
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,120
whole people everybody knew about the

583
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:06,879
strain because everybody was smoking it

584
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:08,479
because it was like so prevalent you

585
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,399
know the when the Amnesia the Shiva

586
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,519
Super Silver Haze cut came it was so

587
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:16,678
obvious it's like smelling like incense

588
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:19,200
stick all around you know it's like yeah

589
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:22,919
you know so when when you first

590
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,038
encountered this um realization of this

591
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:28,000
of the

592
00:27:24,038 --> 00:27:30,278
standardization um by using clones and

593
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,679
and reproducing in the same environment

594
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:34,398
and you know reproducing in an indoor

595
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:36,240
environment rather than in an outdoor

596
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:38,839
environment where you know if you get

597
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,480
one crop per year maybe you use a bunch

598
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:43,839
of clones for it but the quality of that

599
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,679
product one month after harvest versus

600
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:48,000
10 months after harvest is going to be

601
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,840
pretty different and you probably know

602
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,079
that as a consumer as well just having

603
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:54,639
the different uh progressions of if it

604
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:56,278
was an outdoor crop versus an indoor

605
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,440
crop where then in the indoor crop you

606
00:27:56,278 --> 00:28:01,398
know F you get five four or five

607
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,320
different harvests a year so you know

608
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:06,319
you're maybe having stuff that's 3

609
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:09,639
months old at the most four months old

610
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:12,158
yeah and and so you have a much uh

611
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,880
higher level of like a standard of what

612
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,320
you're expecting um so when you when you

613
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,840
experienced this where were you at in

614
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:23,079
your growing career like what were you

615
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:25,359
doing at that time actually the thing is

616
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:28,879
what I want to tell you is like a friend

617
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:32,199
of mine was growing orange bot which is

618
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:36,080
Californian orange skk uh for a long

619
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:38,399
time like six years in a row through

620
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:41,240
from seeds all the time buying seeds and

621
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:44,599
doing it yeah so in the first two years

622
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:47,240
he had really good crops and I mean the

623
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:50,678
the the the weed was the same almost

624
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:53,319
like really all from seed all from seeds

625
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:54,798
but then it changed he bought the same

626
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:57,678
packet

627
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:59,119
packs somehow the weed was not the same

628
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,080
anymore

629
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:03,038
uh and it was not depending on the

630
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:04,398
season of the weather it was weather

631
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:07,278
weather was the

632
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:10,398
same but the quality was

633
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:13,159
lower and he always relied on seeds

634
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:14,798
always the seed form of it always

635
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:18,240
because it's stronger plants it has a

636
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:20,158
better root it has it it's true it it's

637
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,278
stronger plants it has better root

638
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:27,480
system it's more uh uh uh uh strong in

639
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:32,278
sense of against pred it's predatory in

640
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:36,159
the sense of um no no uh issues with how

641
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:38,798
you call pests yeah uh it's much more

642
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:41,200
like that if you have a good line but if

643
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:43,720
the line gets bad and you sell it as a

644
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,240
producer which is Big producer in Europe

645
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:49,600
actually today very well known

646
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:52,079
company um that you do that and most of

647
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:53,959
those companies are like that if you're

648
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:56,599
not a small breeder anymore you you

649
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:59,679
don't have that anymore uh because they

650
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:03,639
all rely on white lab production which

651
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:07,240
means uh it change uh you cannot have in

652
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:10,720
your menu 150 strains and tell me that

653
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:14,960
you are producing them in house that

654
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:17,798
that is absolutely impossible to the the

655
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,120
HVAC system alone to be able to handle

656
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:22,720
all those different pollen sources

657
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:24,839
without there being any potential of

658
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,159
cross-pollination is a little bit

659
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:32,158
ridiculous you're you're talking about

660
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:34,399
like multi-million dollar facility alone

661
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,159
just to be able to have the

662
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:40,278
infrastructure in place to handle that

663
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:42,120
and sure there might be like lab grade

664
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:44,398
facilities in different parts of the

665
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:47,158
world that are seed producers you know

666
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:51,719
that produce uh like row crops right

667
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:54,519
like wheat or um corn or uh other things

668
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:58,519
like that where it needs a high level of

669
00:30:54,519 --> 00:31:01,278
standardization and um uh safety

670
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:03,440
protocols to make sure there's no

671
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:06,480
contamination but no one's doing that

672
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,480
with canvas seeds like you can't you

673
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,159
wouldn't be able to find the backers for

674
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,120
the infrastructure for something like

675
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:15,519
that just due to the legality reasons

676
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:18,439
yeah cuz you're still producing flour

677
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:20,638
yeah yeah and you know you asked me when

678
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:25,600
I did realize you know I realize you

679
00:31:20,638 --> 00:31:28,879
know when my crop got stolen in

680
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:31,638
2000 and my father called me

681
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,360
I was in lublana start you know with my

682
00:31:31,638 --> 00:31:37,119
guys I was in radio I was a radio

683
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:38,798
journalist and I was working in radio my

684
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:41,079
dad called me like you know hey I

685
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:44,079
remember the day I was crying man he

686
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:46,720
told me hey your Duran poisons are gone

687
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:50,079
there were trees at home here I have't

688
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:53,159
in Gard I was crying man on the phone

689
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:56,480
was like my my dad called me like he was

690
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:58,080
crying also yeah that's how we were were

691
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,639
you know like we were depending this

692
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:03,480
[ __ ] you know and we have a crisis in

693
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:05,519
you know there were some heroine junkies

694
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,440
in the town here you know they needed it

695
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,480
you know more than us you know so they

696
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,600
were stealing it yeah but all of these

697
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,480
guys are already gone you know you know

698
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:18,439
because karma comes back and you know

699
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:21,159
they're not alive anymore these people

700
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,159
but uh you know I realized that time

701
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:26,039
that people come to my place to steal my

702
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:30,200
ganja so I have to move to another

703
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:34,038
strategy to get the ganja on so we moved

704
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:39,880
indoors and uh me and my dad made a

705
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:43,398
indoor room and I flowered in this room

706
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:47,799
from 2003 till

707
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:50,518
2019 until when I opened my facility in

708
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:53,000
Austria I stopped FL well I mean let's

709
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:56,558
keep it as Anonymous as we need to or uh

710
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,038
you know uh so I have a few questions

711
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:01,960
though so this the first time you grew

712
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:05,038
indoor was this before or after you saw

713
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:08,919
the uh High Press sodium setup while you

714
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:12,519
were in Luana I grew before because we

715
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:15,440
used to make the cloning uh we go to the

716
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:18,960
clones and we put them under artificial

717
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:21,320
you know CFL lights sure you know to

718
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,880
grow them a little bit so that was my

719
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:27,079
first experience with growing but I you

720
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:29,519
know it was like just like maybe one two

721
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:31,319
years just to to prepare the plant a

722
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,200
little bit before you put them outside

723
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:37,240
to not flow to not flower too too soon

724
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:40,159
in the season right if I get them in

725
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:43,038
March I have I can put them out in May

726
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,480
not not in March because it's too cold

727
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:48,158
and the the flowering time would be too

728
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:51,399
L too too too short so it would flower

729
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:55,519
so we knew that yeah already uh because

730
00:33:51,398 --> 00:34:00,079
we we read the books you know like uh

731
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:03,679
some some guy have this uh Clark book uh

732
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:06,519
one one other guy had hor cantes book

733
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:09,000
some other guy had Ed rosental book you

734
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:10,800
know sure so you just cross referenced

735
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,119
it found out the information yeah we

736
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,839
found out the because it was no internet

737
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,760
yeah so we also had the like these

738
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,199
magazines we have this grow magazine

739
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,399
which we have also but there was no

740
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:25,719
internet there was no phones man so it's

741
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:28,000
like from season to season we saw more

742
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:30,959
than the this this when the the

743
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,280
magazines came and the this internet and

744
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,000
everything we already knew that you know

745
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,200
what I mean you already know that from

746
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,440
experience because you see it all all

747
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:42,559
the time and then you were like okay I'm

748
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,599
so interested because other people have

749
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:46,960
the same experience like overgrow you

750
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:49,559
know I was watching overgrow man it was

751
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,119
like yeah man that was my community was

752
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:53,320
overgrow you know because at that time

753
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,760
you have nobody to talk to about it sure

754
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,000
and then as soon as you see someone else

755
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,320
write something down that you've already

756
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,119
been experiencing you're like oh it

757
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,920
confirmed it hell yeah I was doing the

758
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,240
right thing and has a picture with it

759
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,960
you know like and they have like a good

760
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:07,919
explanation versus the the anecdotal

761
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,838
evidence you know I feel like even with

762
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,800
like the photo periodism of the plants

763
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:13,838
right like you were saying you can't

764
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,240
just throw a clone outside and March

765
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:17,679
even if you have a good climate you're

766
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:19,799
lighting depending on where you are in

767
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:21,879
the world you're going to have uh you

768
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,519
know probably close to 122 lighting and

769
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,280
you're going to initiate flowering and

770
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:27,880
then you're going to go into a reveta

771
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,599
stage of the plant and then it's going

772
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,000
to flower out again and you know some

773
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,359
people might say oh that works but it

774
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,320
works with some strains right but some

775
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:39,838
strains I mean it's not it's not the

776
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,039
method to to rely on no yeah no we've

777
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:44,078
we've even found growing Outdoors that

778
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:48,480
sometimes we'll just we won't start the

779
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:53,240
outdoor plants until you know Late July

780
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,960
MH yeah or mid July mean yeah idea you

781
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:58,279
just throw the Small Clone out there and

782
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,199
it has two three weeks of uh vegetative

783
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:02,640
growth and then boom F flips the flower

784
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:05,199
but also has like this robust amount of

785
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,480
root growth at the same time so you get

786
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:08,879
this kind of

787
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,920
synergistic growth where the roots are

788
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,000
vigorous the upper growth is vigorous

789
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:16,240
and you get these huge plants from

790
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,880
nothing and the pests have no time to to

791
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:20,919
to be you know like that's part less

792
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,519
pests have you seen that when you do

793
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:26,960
this L Late July crop like you say uh

794
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:29,599
that you put out side vegetative state

795
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,440
clones which really hardening but then

796
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:35,359
it's like much less

797
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,440
problems Les less pressure overall cuz

798
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:39,920
if if pressure builds up on a day-by-day

799
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,240
basis and you can only do so much

800
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:46,079
through spraying or applications of uh

801
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:47,479
beneficial insects or otherwise you know

802
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,560
before it becomes either cost

803
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,039
prohibitive or too late in flower where

804
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:54,880
you don't want to affect the final

805
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:57,838
product then you know if you're adding

806
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,160
on a month or two that's a lot more

807
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:02,480
pressure to be built up and one thing

808
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:06,399
we've also found is sometimes your your

809
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:09,639
yields can almost be the same in certain

810
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:12,039
cases depending on how uh close you're

811
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:14,879
planting if you're doing like uh either

812
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:17,480
a row of of plants with some sort of

813
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,559
drip irrigation or something um you know

814
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:23,318
if you have them at a 5ft center like a

815
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:27,719
one one and A2 meter Center between

816
00:37:23,318 --> 00:37:29,039
plants then you have uh you know if you

817
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:30,399
give them those extra two months of

818
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:32,079
growth they're going to just grow into

819
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,200
each other in The Roots as well they're

820
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,480
going to sense that they have now

821
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:39,919
limited space to grow and their yields

822
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:43,159
aren't going to be like you know if you

823
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,079
if you have three weeks of veg versus

824
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:47,440
two or three months worth of veg you're

825
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:50,280
not going to have three times the amount

826
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,679
of yield for that extra veg time and

827
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,720
you're going to have all the extra pest

828
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:56,039
problems like you're talking about so

829
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:57,879
that's something that you know as a as a

830
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:59,599
grower I always thought you know if

831
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,680
you're growing big plants Outdoors you

832
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,960
need more a lot more veget time and in

833
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:07,838
some cases sure but in other cases it's

834
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,838
almost not advantageous you know it's

835
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:14,679
very simple to make a giant plant

836
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:17,119
actually it's not it's not difficult you

837
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:20,199
know it's like you put it all you sprout

838
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:23,599
it in February and then grew it in

839
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:25,598
inside as if you can and then in I saw

840
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,039
that in March they already put putting

841
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:31,318
them in tunnels and they are prolong the

842
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:33,480
light of course for six 4 to 6 hours you

843
00:38:31,318 --> 00:38:37,318
have like HPS lights that give a little

844
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:39,440
bit of uh heat and uh you know then in

845
00:38:37,318 --> 00:38:42,639
may they already have these big plants

846
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,240
which actually then outgrow everything

847
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:48,960
there but actually man you know how much

848
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:51,078
waste it is to do that like this is only

849
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,480
for the eye to to to do something like

850
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:55,880
that is not e economical that is not

851
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:58,559
economical it was in the time when in

852
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:01,640
America you had this plant count right

853
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:03,199
because of that it still do yeah well

854
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:05,519
and it's also if you look at it from

855
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:07,879
like an agronomic standpoint as well the

856
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:10,400
the nutrient assimilation from the

857
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:15,480
grounds to create this huge plant all

858
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:17,960
this biomass like the actual yield from

859
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,838
that total biomass the percentage or

860
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,838
like the fraction of the total biomass

861
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:26,519
is going to be a lot less than if you

862
00:39:22,838 --> 00:39:28,318
have smaller plants with really healthy

863
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:30,920
robust growth

864
00:39:28,318 --> 00:39:32,318
uh you know the the fraction of of that

865
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,358
total biomass that's going to be your

866
00:39:32,318 --> 00:39:37,838
end product is going to be way greater

867
00:39:34,358 --> 00:39:39,400
in a smaller plant so yeah you're right

868
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:41,279
it doesn't it doesn't make sense but it

869
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:44,559
is impressive you know we see these

870
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,079
people like the Mendo Dope Boys or these

871
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:47,559
different groups that are like we're

872
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,240
going to grow the world's biggest

873
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:50,960
cannabis plant and flower it out and

874
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:54,639
it's like all right you know like that's

875
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,838
fun actually it's it's not like a a

876
00:39:54,639 --> 00:40:00,279
production purpose it's not a production

877
00:39:56,838 --> 00:40:02,000
purpose no definitely but you I mean I

878
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,839
appreciate everything some people do

879
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,199
that you know over the stone have you

880
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,920
saw that man they they grow something

881
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:11,279
over Stones like a bonsai like a bonsai

882
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:14,720
you know and I've done that it's fun

883
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:17,160
it's fun I mean that is some cool [ __ ] I

884
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:19,519
I mean I like that you know but it's not

885
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:22,399
yeah it's not like monocropping in a in

886
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:24,639
a setting to produce a bunch of flow no

887
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,480
no you know what is very very much

888
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:30,960
important what I I wanted also to touch

889
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:33,240
on a little bit the quality of the water

890
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,400
that you are using

891
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:38,799
is I think this is something you know

892
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,760
when you say you need light you need

893
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,839
soil and you need water you don't even

894
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:46,240
need soil you need a medium yeah what

895
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:50,679
the medium is it can be r w yeah it can

896
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:55,479
be yeah so uh but the water

897
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:59,879
quality to bind the nutrients in the way

898
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:03,519
yeah arated water Living Water you know

899
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:07,119
drinkable water it's like we have a lot

900
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:08,559
of luck here in my country where I live

901
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,119
especially I

902
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:13,000
mean my place is like you drink the

903
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,920
water you know it's not so it's

904
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,119
drinkable but it's not that good as in

905
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,760
the mountain region right they have it

906
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:23,000
from the tap man yeah it's drink it's

907
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:26,040
drinkable water everywhere

908
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,400
here it's so good that it's drinkable

909
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:32,599
from the TB I don't buy bottled water

910
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,519
ever here ever I don't buy it I have to

911
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:36,519
buy bottled water here it's uh we're on

912
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:41,599
this well and the electrical

913
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:41,599
conductivity of our tap water is uh

914
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:52,318
1.7 so oh my God you know like 950 parts

915
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:55,599
per million or so I have

916
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:59,400
0.4 from the top man I always check it

917
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:02,800
it just blows me away oh my God we only

918
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,838
use it for cooking or stuff uhhuh the

919
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,440
thing is with water and the people don't

920
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:09,480
realize here how easy it is to grow

921
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,200
actually the water is drinkable water so

922
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:14,838
if I can drink it the plants will drink

923
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:18,279
I have always have to put a pH minus

924
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:22,759
here always because of uh it's it's

925
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:25,559
seven so I go to 6.3 6.2 for the for the

926
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,839
pit based plants and when I do cloning

927
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:31,240
on rock wool and

928
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:35,279
on easy plug which is speed based I for

929
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:39,358
the PED based I do 60 6 61 and for rock

930
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,160
wool I do 5'7 you know uh when you

931
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:42,598
actually you have to with rock wool you

932
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:46,159
have to always do a

933
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:48,838
preo uh for 12 hours minimum because you

934
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:50,920
know the rock wool itself has a pH so

935
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:54,239
when you put it in water it has to

936
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:57,760
balance out this pH so the water is I

937
00:42:54,239 --> 00:43:00,479
put in 5.0 and I from my t

938
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:03,319
I have to put 5 fo0 the water to put in

939
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:08,240
the Rock wol so next day when we come to

940
00:43:03,318 --> 00:43:14,358
work to to do the cloning it's

941
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:18,000
5.7 5.6 5.8 you know the RO W and you do

942
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:21,279
this pre soak and it's working fine uh

943
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
but I already also saw that you know

944
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,920
it's the medium

945
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,559
only yeah so the water is so much

946
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,440
important water I want to touch on that

947
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:34,079
the water quality will bind the

948
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:37,200
nutrients and uh you have a lot of more

949
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:40,280
playroom to do with this water if you

950
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:42,799
have a water uh uh EC of 1 point

951
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:45,280
something from the tab you know you

952
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,519
don't have a lot of room you know right

953
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:50,519
cuz you you have to know what is in the

954
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:54,639
water already right so so you don't add

955
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:56,838
it you know but here here is like I I

956
00:43:54,639 --> 00:44:00,480
like I know that the economist likes a

957
00:43:56,838 --> 00:44:02,400
lot of iron right many don't many people

958
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,960
don't know I mean don't know don't talk

959
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,800
about it they know but they don't talk

960
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:12,760
about it that iron is as much when they

961
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:16,359
always say km km km you can add kmak no

962
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:20,480
problem yeah but the if lack of iron

963
00:44:16,358 --> 00:44:23,078
comes then no no carmar will help you no

964
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,440
NPK will help nothing will help you

965
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:28,559
right because there is locks you know

966
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,159
she will lock down all of all of these

967
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:33,760
Trace elements are so much important to

968
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:36,000
know about them and to be careful what

969
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:39,119
kind of medium you are working on and to

970
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,199
be U kind of aware that with some

971
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,760
cultivar you need to add them with some

972
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:46,000
maybe you don't need to but you know

973
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,960
it's it's depending a lot of this uh

974
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,559
because people always then think that

975
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:53,760
some brands of fertilizers don't don't

976
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:56,119
work all of them work it's very simple

977
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,200
to do a fertilizer you know you make it

978
00:44:56,119 --> 00:45:00,640
you make it from scratch actually for

979
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:03,919
told us already how it's you know it's

980
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:06,199
very easy to do a fertilizer but um to

981
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,960
make to make a good fertilizer and to

982
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:11,598
balance it right and that's another

983
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:14,440
story yeah right absolutely well so um

984
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:16,559
you know speaking of fertilizing and uh

985
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,519
uh kind of the grow style in general so

986
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:21,359
when when you and your dad first then

987
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:23,880
started having to grow indoors because

988
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:26,400
you were worried about losing your crop

989
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:28,318
either to theft or um I don't know if

990
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,280
you had any sort of crop failure just

991
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:33,599
due to weather um or otherwise before

992
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,160
that but you know indoor growing kind of

993
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:41,079
does limit a lot of those issues or

994
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:44,679
potential issues um and so what was your

995
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:46,720
first setup like it sounds like you used

996
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:48,719
some of the CFL bulbs that you were

997
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:50,558
already using to keep your veg plants

998
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:53,118
alive that were going into the outdoor

999
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:55,960
Garden um but when you when you first

1000
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:57,480
set up your indoor garden for flowering

1001
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:00,760
what did that look like what was your

1002
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:03,039
media um how did you decide how to keep

1003
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,960
your plants uh fertilized whether that

1004
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:07,279
be through the medium as like a living

1005
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:10,159
soil did you just pull some soil in from

1006
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:13,760
one of the beds outside um tell me about

1007
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:16,799
it okay I mixed my own soil first you

1008
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:19,160
know I knew about the the soil but we

1009
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:22,359
did not buy soil at that time we we

1010
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:26,519
mixed our own and that means I I bought

1011
00:46:22,358 --> 00:46:28,759
so pit based stuff uh in back everything

1012
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:31,239
must be sterilized right so we could not

1013
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:35,200
take some good compost from outside and

1014
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:38,318
bring it in that's not possible right so

1015
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:43,960
uh my secret additive was warm compost

1016
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:46,679
warm uh drippings from from red worms uh

1017
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:52,039
yeah and they sold them here for like a

1018
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:55,679
50 lit bags or 20 lit bags uh and we mix

1019
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:58,719
this inside and we mix the guano the the

1020
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:01,558
bird and the B guano inside and you have

1021
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:07,159
to understand that was 2003 you know

1022
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:09,519
2004 2005 and we let it sit for 2 weeks

1023
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:11,920
before we planted and we were not

1024
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:14,920
putting them in pots we were putting

1025
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:17,240
them in beds so you had beds inside we

1026
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:20,880
have beds Inside Man so what were these

1027
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:23,679
beds built out of they were built

1028
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,280
from it was plastic bed it was like you

1029
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:28,879
can buy it you know you it was like this

1030
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:31,760
plastic container which can hold on each

1031
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:34,280
side and you can carry it right okay and

1032
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,200
you we just drain

1033
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:41,359
whole but it was like we we put two or

1034
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:45,439
three plants in one bed sure and we saw

1035
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:49,558
this technique with s you know s

1036
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:53,000
Amsterdam s seats he he wrote articles

1037
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:55,599
for the German uh magazine and he has

1038
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,838
this that has don't use pots use the

1039
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:03,039
beds and so the the plants connect with

1040
00:47:58,838 --> 00:48:06,558
the the roots and we had clones already

1041
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:10,000
in the beginning we never put seeds in

1042
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:12,440
indoor in the beginning we we have we

1043
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,039
have this access to to these PE people

1044
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:19,200
my friends who having this uh

1045
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:22,279
standardized clones right the the

1046
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:23,960
super in Lana the friends in lublana

1047
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,319
which is not actually from lublana but

1048
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:28,400
all of them are from all around Slovenia

1049
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:32,558
but are in lubl because there are

1050
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:34,960
students sure and all of them are living

1051
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:38,079
every from the mountains from the

1052
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:40,838
seaside from the you know all of these

1053
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:44,640
are still my guys you know still Growers

1054
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:47,679
still still doing their [ __ ] still still

1055
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:52,558
really good people I love them my family

1056
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:55,399
you know uh so still it's like uh you

1057
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:57,359
know some Growers uh I will not talk

1058
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:01,440
about them now I will talk about you

1059
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:04,519
asked me what was the the light man at

1060
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:09,400
that time you could only get HPS it was

1061
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:14,440
not or MH yeah metal halight for the

1062
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:18,318
vegetative time and HPS yeah uh and

1063
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:21,280
after they put out the Phillips uh put

1064
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:24,318
out the osam osam put out a light that

1065
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,760
is can be used for vegetative state and

1066
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:29,358
the flower stage at once do you need

1067
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:34,040
need to change it anymore yeah we use

1068
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:37,239
that one you know the ostram now T4

1069
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:39,279
Epsilon something you know it was 400

1070
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:42,439
wat lights you know and then we changed

1071
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,480
to 600 you know and we use the old tro

1072
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,559
you know the magnetic one the really

1073
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:50,079
heavy sheet you know you cannot carry it

1074
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:53,480
it's so heavy we use that one so after

1075
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:56,400
that you know when the first uh ballast

1076
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:59,599
came that are uh digital you know we

1077
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:02,400
were so ah you it's so light man you can

1078
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:05,200
carry two of them in your hands because

1079
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:08,079
otherwise first of all the ballast man

1080
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:11,679
was so heavy and it started to broom

1081
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:13,519
after 2 3 years when you use it it start

1082
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:17,919
to make this sound

1083
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:20,679
like it was like broom sound you know

1084
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:23,559
like and it is not good sign because it

1085
00:50:20,679 --> 00:50:27,358
uses more electricity for Less

1086
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:30,040
efficiency yeah you see it was always

1087
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:33,838
and then you know when the the light uh

1088
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:37,880
came to we we saw the uh keramic metal

1089
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:40,599
highlight you know the caramic TM

1090
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:44,798
uh did what we tried this it was good

1091
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:47,599
for vegetation but maybe not for FL I

1092
00:50:44,798 --> 00:50:49,838
mean I never went into it so much that I

1093
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:52,920
could tell but I saw it and I worked

1094
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:55,838
with it a little bit uh and now I work

1095
00:50:52,920 --> 00:51:00,119
with lead lights you know it's a it's so

1096
00:50:55,838 --> 00:51:04,239
cost efficient to to the HPS right I

1097
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:06,838
still have HPS at home somewhere hidden

1098
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:09,239
you know when I use it maybe one you

1099
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:13,719
know because it produced a really really

1100
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:16,759
good flower too U it has it had its own

1101
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:19,118
qualities even if it's 40y old

1102
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:20,799
technology right what were um what were

1103
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:22,838
some of those first harvests like that

1104
00:51:20,798 --> 00:51:26,639
you that you and your dad

1105
00:51:22,838 --> 00:51:29,239
had um not so good the first one I mean

1106
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:33,358
but it was clones so it was like we

1107
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:35,879
instantly knew something is wrong okay

1108
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:39,078
you know because we saw the product from

1109
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:41,640
my people and we saw it from indoor and

1110
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:43,519
from outdoor and we saw the same plant

1111
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:46,798
like it how we behaves and then we

1112
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:50,159
wanted to reproduce it like them and uh

1113
00:51:46,798 --> 00:51:51,880
it was like uh the first round was a

1114
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:53,239
disaster and you know what was the

1115
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:56,720
problem

1116
00:51:53,239 --> 00:51:59,598
ventilation I was going to ask yeah we

1117
00:51:56,719 --> 00:52:02,239
did not put uh the strong we then on the

1118
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:04,400
second round we have it was like a

1119
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:07,479
revelation even the the second round was

1120
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,639
so much better it was so much better

1121
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:13,400
than anything uh and then we tried to

1122
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:16,639
keep this level for some time and then

1123
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:20,920
you add a little bit more and we we

1124
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:23,318
adjust the wing uh the the you know um

1125
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:26,358
the wings were better because before we

1126
00:52:23,318 --> 00:52:29,239
had the small ones and sure pool tubes

1127
00:52:26,358 --> 00:52:32,318
and and uh [ __ ] [ __ ] you know some

1128
00:52:29,239 --> 00:52:35,000
[ __ ] like that uh at the end from round

1129
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:36,599
to round from strain to

1130
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,039
strain

1131
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:44,119
uh you get better and it was like we

1132
00:52:40,039 --> 00:52:46,639
have five crops indoor crops a year mhm

1133
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:51,200
so we were like you know each year five

1134
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:55,000
so 10 years it's like 50 crops yeah 15

1135
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:57,318
years is like 75 crops right you know

1136
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,880
like after 100 crops

1137
00:52:57,318 --> 00:53:06,400
you know your you know what you're doing

1138
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:08,760
yeah oh absolutely I um so like when

1139
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:13,119
you when you first noticed that you

1140
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:15,359
needed more ventilation did um what were

1141
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,838
you seeing in in some of that in that

1142
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:19,440
first crop where like did you did you

1143
00:53:17,838 --> 00:53:23,639
realize that they were like heat

1144
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:26,880
stressed or um was was it a uh a

1145
00:53:23,639 --> 00:53:30,159
humidity issue or was it both um it was

1146
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:33,280
it was like a condense was starting to

1147
00:53:30,159 --> 00:53:36,480
to to put the walls were condensing you

1148
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:38,440
know dripping dripping oh my gosh yeah

1149
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,519
man it's like what the [ __ ] you know cuz

1150
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:44,519
my dad was like I said to him like

1151
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:46,639
ventilation but he got some small 20

1152
00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:49,358
watt you know think like small

1153
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:51,679
ventilation but is that is nothing you

1154
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:53,598
know I mean but you have to understand

1155
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:55,159
that time you cannot get just into a

1156
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:57,240
grow shop you know there was no Grow

1157
00:53:55,159 --> 00:53:59,399
shops here so

1158
00:53:57,239 --> 00:54:01,399
you have to get this [ __ ] you know like

1159
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:04,599
even carb we have no carbo filter the

1160
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:09,400
first two years cuz we living the room

1161
00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:11,440
like 90° 100% humidity the first yeah

1162
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:15,760
but then on the second man it was

1163
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:18,599
already like 50 60 the uh per of of

1164
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:21,040
humidity and uh temperature wise was

1165
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:23,400
much better we got a heater then you

1166
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:26,440
know and then everything went much

1167
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,880
better uh and the ventilation after we

1168
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:30,119
because we were very focused on

1169
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:34,000
ventilation because one time in the

1170
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:37,039
first year I think we get powdery Milo

1171
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,838
right and we didn't first time I saw it

1172
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:42,159
I mean I saw it on wine grapes I know

1173
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:46,759
what powder Milo is and you know how we

1174
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:50,679
cure it at that time H with

1175
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:55,040
milk we we we we have uh Farmers here

1176
00:54:50,679 --> 00:54:57,078
who have cows so when you put 100% cow

1177
00:54:55,039 --> 00:55:02,558
milk on

1178
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:05,359
processed milk you dilute it 10 to one

1179
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:08,079
you spray your plants with it and the

1180
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:10,759
powdery Milo is gone yeah I've heard

1181
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:13,160
that as well but but it's really stinky

1182
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:16,839
it's so stinky man I don't want to

1183
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:18,358
repeat it ever in my life ever no so

1184
00:55:16,838 --> 00:55:21,119
this you spread this on your indoor

1185
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:23,759
plants and uh and then it yeah you just

1186
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:26,079
had like rancid milk smell after a while

1187
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:29,240
it was like yeah but the crop was really

1188
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:31,880
good good at the end man really good

1189
00:55:29,239 --> 00:55:34,919
yeah I mean really good it was it was I

1190
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:37,920
mean we have just a little bit of powder

1191
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:41,000
mildo we sold it and after that we

1192
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:43,159
really got into what was the reason the

1193
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,880
reason was that we got the powder mildo

1194
00:55:43,159 --> 00:55:48,719
with a clone that we acquired from GRS

1195
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:50,318
from aan facility it already had that

1196
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:53,159
cuz other stats you know the powder

1197
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:57,279
mildo plant the New York City Diesel

1198
00:55:53,159 --> 00:56:01,519
plant was like leaning on the Cy Star

1199
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:03,720
plant which had no powdery mildo but the

1200
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:06,079
the New York City Diesel plant was like

1201
00:56:03,719 --> 00:56:08,279
white it was like somebody would put

1202
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:10,680
flour over it you know like so this is

1203
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:12,880
so this is the the true story of how

1204
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:15,118
sour diesel was created then right you

1205
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:18,240
just took New York Diesel and sprayed it

1206
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:18,240
with milk and let it go

1207
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:26,440
sour but but this clone new New York

1208
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:27,599
City Diesel at that time it it was uh

1209
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,358
produced by

1210
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:33,559
S but it has nothing to do with your

1211
00:56:30,358 --> 00:56:35,838
sour diesel or nothing to do with Kim or

1212
00:56:33,559 --> 00:56:37,240
nothing to do with anything like that it

1213
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:39,440
just like their version of what they

1214
00:56:37,239 --> 00:56:41,798
were trying to get close to yeah but I

1215
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,798
think someone just made up a name you

1216
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:47,599
know for for that specif specific cut he

1217
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:50,440
made s is a great breeder for other

1218
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:54,119
stuff I know but for this cut I mean it

1219
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:56,838
was very specific wheat I mean it was so

1220
00:56:54,119 --> 00:57:00,039
smelly that this sheet when it GRE I

1221
00:56:56,838 --> 00:57:03,119
mean it was it had so this Aroma was

1222
00:57:00,039 --> 00:57:05,319
like I don't know I mean people in

1223
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:07,960
Austria will know about that cut it was

1224
00:57:05,318 --> 00:57:12,239
in the '90s and in the early 2000s New

1225
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:16,920
York City Diesel cut it it was I was

1226
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:20,399
puking you know like to to for me strong

1227
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:22,400
yeah the aroma the aroma was like

1228
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:25,039
whether you like it you don't like it I

1229
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:27,720
never liked it I just got one clone one

1230
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:31,079
time and it had powdery Milo it infested

1231
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:33,639
my crop it was like not good relation

1232
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:36,000
with this plant with me in the beginning

1233
00:57:33,639 --> 00:57:39,159
you know sure something I don't like

1234
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,559
right but doesn't matter I know that

1235
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:43,038
some people liked it because they

1236
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:46,200
produced it and it worked for them but

1237
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:50,359
in my place it was infested with with PM

1238
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:51,598
so I I saw PM then and I from that time

1239
00:57:50,358 --> 00:57:54,159
I was

1240
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:56,519
really uh trying to you know fight

1241
00:57:54,159 --> 00:58:00,159
against PM all the time but it's like

1242
00:57:56,519 --> 00:58:04,000
it's all about the VPD uh the vapor

1243
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:06,838
pressure deficit uh powder milu has no

1244
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,960
chance if you create an environment that

1245
00:58:06,838 --> 00:58:12,920
is not possible to connect to the plant

1246
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:16,318
absolutely I um I like to explain to

1247
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:19,400
people that uh powdery mildew is a it's

1248
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:24,318
a mushroom basically right it's just a

1249
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:29,838
it's just it's just like other um fungal

1250
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:33,038
uh organisms where you need uh a wet dry

1251
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:36,599
cycle as well as like a hot cold cycle

1252
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:39,640
in order to Spate the the the Milo

1253
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:43,318
spores and so if you think about it like

1254
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:45,078
the the forest floor right where you

1255
00:58:43,318 --> 00:58:47,358
would get edible mushrooms or something

1256
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:49,200
from if you were out foraging you you're

1257
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:51,358
going to have all this Leaf litter on

1258
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:55,078
the top of the forest floor so below

1259
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:57,759
that where the melal colony um is is

1260
00:58:55,079 --> 00:59:00,680
growing it's going to be cooler it's

1261
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:03,640
going to be wet right and then when it

1262
00:59:00,679 --> 00:59:05,519
pushes up its fruiting body above the

1263
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:07,318
leaf litter on the floor it's going to

1264
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:10,159
be a little drier and a little bit

1265
00:59:07,318 --> 00:59:13,480
warmer and so if you have cold wet

1266
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:16,440
nights and dry warm days you're going to

1267
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:18,559
have this sporulation event in your grow

1268
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,880
area where you're going to allow for cuz

1269
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,240
because powdery mildew spores are

1270
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:23,960
everywhere right you're not going to be

1271
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:25,598
able to reduce powdery mil spores unless

1272
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:28,480
you have a completely sterile

1273
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:30,640
environment with like HEPA filters and

1274
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:33,440
uh UV filters and all these different

1275
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:34,879
things right so if you but if you're

1276
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,280
creating the environment for it where

1277
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,760
it's like wet cold then hot dry then wet

1278
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,559
cold then hot dry you're going to have

1279
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:43,520
all these spores just love and life

1280
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:45,599
because they're the melium can grow at

1281
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:47,358
night and then it can Spore it can

1282
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:49,079
produce its fruiting bodies in the day

1283
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:50,920
which produce more spores and then those

1284
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:52,839
sporulate at night and then they produce

1285
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:55,680
more fruiting bodies in the day so it's

1286
00:59:52,838 --> 00:59:58,000
just this and Nick you know why actually

1287
00:59:55,679 --> 01:00:00,919
because uh there is this SP the this

1288
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,880
spora on the leaf the the you know the

1289
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:06,280
when you look at the microscopic way of

1290
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:09,039
the leaf it has this spora and it has St

1291
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:13,240
stomata and it has wax around the

1292
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:17,480
stomata when you have this dry hot

1293
01:00:13,239 --> 01:00:19,679
instead of wet cold uh the the wax is

1294
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:22,199
dry out and it's

1295
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:26,038
crumbling and it makes the belief

1296
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:28,960
susceptible for the Spore to connect to

1297
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:31,359
the leaf it can ENT it can enter the

1298
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,119
plant through this gate after that

1299
01:00:31,358 --> 01:00:34,639
that's a great point cuz you always

1300
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:37,760
notice when you have a really good

1301
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:39,558
steady VPD like um cuz you know you want

1302
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,039
a temperature differential day and night

1303
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:43,440
but that means you also need to adjust

1304
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:46,079
your humidity day and night so that the

1305
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:49,240
overall V vapor pressure deficit kind of

1306
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:51,039
remains um uniform day to night without

1307
01:00:49,239 --> 01:00:53,159
having too much fluctuation you you can

1308
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:55,440
have some but not a lot but when you

1309
01:00:53,159 --> 01:00:57,838
have that limited fluctuation and all

1310
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:00,440
your param are set you get that awesome

1311
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:04,078
waxy cuticle where the the leaves are

1312
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:05,960
shiny almost right and healthy and happy

1313
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:08,880
absolutely you can you can see it on

1314
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:10,400
like tomato plants too right uh like a

1315
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:13,079
really nice healthy tomato plant is

1316
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:15,358
going to look waxy and shiny and then

1317
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:17,599
you know if you uh allow for that tomato

1318
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:19,358
plant to maybe go too long or get

1319
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:22,760
unhealthy then you start to get powdery

1320
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:25,279
Milo on it so um yeah it's very very

1321
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:27,400
similar things where yeah vapor pressure

1322
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:29,519
deficit is huge huge and it sounds like

1323
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:31,760
you had a huge experience early on to

1324
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:35,079
see that ventilation is one of your

1325
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:37,960
friends if you don't have um like air

1326
01:01:35,079 --> 01:01:40,559
control or air conditioning uh and air

1327
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:43,639
Handling Systems like that um for

1328
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:46,079
example you know you in my facility when

1329
01:01:43,639 --> 01:01:48,719
I uh moved my first facility to the

1330
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:51,680
second one when where I am I always have

1331
01:01:48,719 --> 01:01:56,358
this this calculation in my head I have

1332
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:59,440
to uh remove uh the air from the room

1333
01:01:56,358 --> 01:02:02,960
eight times an

1334
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:05,240
hour I I can be able to do that eight

1335
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:08,318
times or 10 times an hour if I can

1336
01:02:05,239 --> 01:02:12,519
remove the whole air space sure to

1337
01:02:08,318 --> 01:02:14,038
change it then the the VPD is okay right

1338
01:02:12,519 --> 01:02:16,679
you know what I mean you never have

1339
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:18,278
problems well before we get into too

1340
01:02:16,679 --> 01:02:20,000
much of what you're doing currently I

1341
01:02:18,278 --> 01:02:21,960
just want to wrap up a few questions

1342
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,920
about kind of some of these earlier

1343
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:29,000
experiences with indoor settings um so

1344
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:31,519
did you run this living soil that the

1345
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,159
substrate that you would create um and

1346
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:36,440
put into these beds is that what you ran

1347
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:39,358
the entire time that you did your uh

1348
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:42,200
homeg growing or did you ever move into

1349
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:45,960
Hydroponics I never did Hydroponics

1350
01:02:42,199 --> 01:02:48,759
instead of Coco I tried Coco okay I

1351
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:51,960
liked it but the other the the stuff was

1352
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:55,119
uh at that time I had no you know it's

1353
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:59,240
always the thing that you have to learn

1354
01:02:55,119 --> 01:03:02,240
and you learn by mistakes sure always

1355
01:02:59,239 --> 01:03:04,558
always you learn by mistakes and uh

1356
01:03:02,239 --> 01:03:07,919
because if you cannot question something

1357
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:09,599
that you did wrong what is the problem

1358
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:12,000
you always have to ask what is the

1359
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:15,599
problem why is this thing and you always

1360
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:18,239
is your fault it you have to get rid of

1361
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:20,440
the of the ego think that somebody give

1362
01:03:18,239 --> 01:03:22,439
you a sick plant and that the plant was

1363
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:25,119
in the beginning when you got got it it

1364
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:29,599
was already okay but now it's not good

1365
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:32,039
so the Gen itics must be it wrong wrong

1366
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:34,000
you are the problem you know what I mean

1367
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:37,960
it's always the Grower's fault first of

1368
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:40,960
all 99% right let me say like that yeah

1369
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:44,880
so let when you go through this concept

1370
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:48,119
uh then by mistake uh you make all the

1371
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:51,039
mistakes right you you don't you know

1372
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:54,119
with and then of of course when you C

1373
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:57,640
cultivate clones instead of seeds you

1374
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:59,440
always have the same plant

1375
01:03:57,639 --> 01:04:03,118
and with the same plant you can

1376
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:04,920
masterize the process very much quickly

1377
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:06,599
very much better because this plant is

1378
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:10,119
always the same genetic

1379
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:13,240
material uh of course it's depending on

1380
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:15,119
how the mother was cut and how was yeah

1381
01:04:13,239 --> 01:04:18,759
the Clone sometimes is better sometimes

1382
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:20,920
is worser but it is the same cut so if

1383
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:24,440
you're good you have a good environment

1384
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:27,440
even from very very bad clones you still

1385
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:31,639
can make really good plants if you put

1386
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:36,400
all the dedication into it and take time

1387
01:04:31,639 --> 01:04:40,199
and uh don't rush things you know uh so

1388
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:44,639
actually it is always been a lot of a

1389
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:47,078
lot of empiric work that means grow grow

1390
01:04:44,639 --> 01:04:49,318
grow all the time indoor outdoor you

1391
01:04:47,079 --> 01:04:52,079
know I was doing indoor but in these

1392
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:55,960
times man we doing outdoor too because

1393
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:58,599
to do to do uh indoor in the summer was

1394
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:00,278
never an option no it would you would

1395
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:02,640
need like all the sorts of air

1396
01:05:00,278 --> 01:05:04,679
conditioning and yeah and we don't have

1397
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:08,199
this air conditioning we don't buy this

1398
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:11,798
[ __ ] it's like I mean and you know all

1399
01:05:08,199 --> 01:05:14,798
the crops uh that I got from this time

1400
01:05:11,798 --> 01:05:16,679
you know from these years I tried many

1401
01:05:14,798 --> 01:05:19,920
many many different genetics from

1402
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:22,358
Austrian clone Market you know I buy I

1403
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:25,039
mean there was there was so much

1404
01:05:22,358 --> 01:05:27,318
genetics that you know trying did the

1405
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:28,799
Austrian Market open up like when was

1406
01:05:27,318 --> 01:05:33,239
that uh

1407
01:05:28,798 --> 01:05:36,920
available uh around 2000 it's even even

1408
01:05:33,239 --> 01:05:40,598
before yeah it took 25 years yeah yeah

1409
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:42,119
cool Sorry Sidra but yeah yeah but it's

1410
01:05:40,599 --> 01:05:45,680
so long you know actually the Clone

1411
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:47,920
Market is there and my guys before that

1412
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:50,159
are were working on it already you know

1413
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:52,039
because they didn't get those clones

1414
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:53,719
from Austria but they made them

1415
01:05:52,039 --> 01:05:57,720
themselves but

1416
01:05:53,719 --> 01:06:00,919
it's but in the sense of of uh the aan

1417
01:05:57,719 --> 01:06:02,759
club Market is so big now and U we don't

1418
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:04,440
want to get too much into it now don't

1419
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:07,680
want to talk about it too much but it's

1420
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:10,240
like I'm a part of it you know gens

1421
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:12,558
production by atics is a part of it

1422
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:14,598
we're quite a big wholesaler now and

1423
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:17,440
people know us and genetics we have to

1424
01:06:14,599 --> 01:06:21,559
represent them and this is the story how

1425
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:24,318
I got to those genetic actually because

1426
01:06:21,559 --> 01:06:26,798
without all this work when you ask me as

1427
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:29,519
a hom grower to see all the other clones

1428
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:33,719
in the market I could not I could not

1429
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:35,559
even have any um ability the ability to

1430
01:06:33,719 --> 01:06:37,919
think about the

1431
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:41,480
genetics it is like for me when you say

1432
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:44,880
to me orange bot orange bot is the same

1433
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:47,079
[ __ ] as Californian orange skunk

1434
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:50,160
Tangerine Dream

1435
01:06:47,079 --> 01:06:54,318
Tangi uh everything with orange orange

1436
01:06:50,159 --> 01:06:56,719
punch it is all based in the same family

1437
01:06:54,318 --> 01:07:01,358
of plants the parent

1438
01:06:56,719 --> 01:07:03,679
genome sure or purple you know the we

1439
01:07:01,358 --> 01:07:05,798
have a clone which is ice cream runs

1440
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:08,000
actually it's like purple urle it's the

1441
01:07:05,798 --> 01:07:10,278
same it's the same thing a little bit

1442
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:14,000
variation of it but it's the same thing

1443
01:07:10,278 --> 01:07:18,960
as purple lle it grows the slowest plant

1444
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:23,838
to grow ever produces very dense purple

1445
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:26,798
BS very spicy uh no issue with mold no

1446
01:07:23,838 --> 01:07:29,558
issue with paste it outside performer

1447
01:07:26,798 --> 01:07:32,038
totally you know that how you know the

1448
01:07:29,559 --> 01:07:36,519
plants because uh through the years of

1449
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:39,880
growing as a home grower years and years

1450
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:42,639
uh and trying different cultiv until you

1451
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:45,160
try to make your own crosses of course

1452
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:48,358
you know you end up there yeah you make

1453
01:07:45,159 --> 01:07:52,318
your own cres but then you know it all

1454
01:07:48,358 --> 01:07:55,199
ended for me when I uh you know I have a

1455
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:57,798
family man I have two k children and I

1456
01:07:55,199 --> 01:08:00,960
have to feed them and uh the thing is

1457
01:07:57,798 --> 01:08:02,960
that I needed a a a real job you know I

1458
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:05,880
mean I was working a lot of stuff in my

1459
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:08,880
life I we didn't talk about that but I

1460
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:11,960
was involved in the music industry I was

1461
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:14,760
involved into theater but big theater

1462
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:17,158
you know I was translator for a very big

1463
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:19,520
director who was working in German

1464
01:08:17,158 --> 01:08:22,278
Market we were doing very big

1465
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:24,759
Productions so I was paid I was paid

1466
01:08:22,279 --> 01:08:26,040
very good there so I could actually be a

1467
01:08:24,759 --> 01:08:27,640
hom grower

1468
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:29,560
and you know coming from a production

1469
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:32,119
and living for 6 months without a

1470
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:35,600
problem you know from that money yeah

1471
01:08:32,119 --> 01:08:37,798
it's like that but after you know uh

1472
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:41,039
then it turned out you know time time

1473
01:08:37,798 --> 01:08:43,640
tells so now I started my own company in

1474
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:45,920
Austria and after that I knew that I

1475
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:48,838
have to quit

1476
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,279
flowering right this is the story that

1477
01:08:48,838 --> 01:08:53,600
how I stopped

1478
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:56,120
flowering I know it's like uh yeah I

1479
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:58,159
started a legal business so I had to

1480
01:08:56,119 --> 01:09:02,198
stop the flower yeah let's talk about

1481
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:05,198
that I mean uh as someone who I I think

1482
01:09:02,198 --> 01:09:05,198
cloning is one of

1483
01:09:05,838 --> 01:09:11,399
the it's such an essential stage of the

1484
01:09:08,679 --> 01:09:15,319
Cannabis life cycle if you're growing

1485
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:18,399
for production and the different methods

1486
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:19,920
of cloning all seem you know there's

1487
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:23,278
ones that work really well but then

1488
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:26,039
there's some that might just be uh you

1489
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:27,960
know like a hom grower uh in a couple

1490
01:09:26,039 --> 01:09:29,519
plants here and there where you know

1491
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:31,079
they they can be a little L Fair they

1492
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:34,199
don't necessarily need to produce the

1493
01:09:31,079 --> 01:09:36,439
nicest clones but with some of the

1494
01:09:34,198 --> 01:09:40,479
standards that you've mentioned before

1495
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:45,039
on previous shows uh when dealing with

1496
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:47,439
the European market where you have a uh

1497
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:49,640
different Regulators coming in and

1498
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:53,358
telling you how you have to do certain

1499
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:55,079
things and uh certain precautions and

1500
01:09:53,359 --> 01:10:00,280
standards that you have to have in order

1501
01:09:55,079 --> 01:10:02,079
to ship clones uh over country borders

1502
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:04,119
which is something that you know I feel

1503
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:06,238
like a lot of American listeners will

1504
01:10:04,119 --> 01:10:07,760
kind of be blown away by that that's

1505
01:10:06,238 --> 01:10:11,599
just something that's part of your

1506
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:14,239
regular business model um how did you

1507
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:15,760
develop your grow Style and what are

1508
01:10:14,238 --> 01:10:18,599
some of the things that you do there

1509
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,800
that you um like what are some of the

1510
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:21,560
things that you do there that you feel

1511
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:24,079
are are working really well for your

1512
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,679
your cloning operation and where do you

1513
01:10:24,079 --> 01:10:27,679
feel as though there might even be some

1514
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:29,960
hindrances due to these different

1515
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:35,039
regulatory bodies that you're beholden

1516
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:38,198
to okay uh good question man it is to

1517
01:10:35,039 --> 01:10:42,198
transit to from hom growing to a

1518
01:10:38,198 --> 01:10:45,759
facility is a very big thing you you

1519
01:10:42,198 --> 01:10:48,279
many Growers who are home Growers now

1520
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:50,920
maybe think that their model of Home

1521
01:10:48,279 --> 01:10:54,599
grow could work in a big facility

1522
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:57,600
normally it's not the Sops are so you

1523
01:10:54,600 --> 01:11:00,560
know we you go out from homegrown and

1524
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:03,039
you don't have no experience in

1525
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:06,719
industry and actually I did work for

1526
01:11:03,039 --> 01:11:10,679
some other people in the industry here

1527
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:15,679
but they have no Sops it was all it was

1528
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:18,679
all Anarchy you know yeah I've seen like

1529
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:22,039
and I saw that and I didn't want to work

1530
01:11:18,679 --> 01:11:25,880
for them anymore no and I opened my own

1531
01:11:22,039 --> 01:11:28,479
[ __ ] and I created my own system you

1532
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:31,039
know and the system is like that that

1533
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:33,039
you keep mod plants of specific

1534
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:35,719
strains specific

1535
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:40,238
cultivars uh that is actually personal

1536
01:11:35,719 --> 01:11:42,560
connected I'm I am uh that is my opinion

1537
01:11:40,238 --> 01:11:44,559
is is very high qualiity one from the

1538
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:47,199
beginning already because they were

1539
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:50,560
really selected for years already they

1540
01:11:47,198 --> 01:11:52,638
were not a clone from last year what I

1541
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:54,920
got in my company from my people you

1542
01:11:52,639 --> 01:11:58,600
know they were like already clones that

1543
01:11:54,920 --> 01:12:01,359
are like 8 to 10 years old at that time

1544
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:04,920
and now they are like almost 15 20 year

1545
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:07,238
old you know it's like and the thing is

1546
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:09,800
I did not go to the Australian market

1547
01:12:07,238 --> 01:12:11,638
and get clones from other shops and open

1548
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:14,639
my own business with those

1549
01:12:11,639 --> 01:12:15,480
clones because normally people do that

1550
01:12:14,639 --> 01:12:19,639
it's

1551
01:12:15,479 --> 01:12:22,039
like 90% of people did that at that you

1552
01:12:19,639 --> 01:12:25,600
curated your own Library I curated my

1553
01:12:22,039 --> 01:12:29,319
own Library you know no of course I got

1554
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:31,880
a few strains which I got from from a

1555
01:12:29,319 --> 01:12:35,039
library that is in Austria also but this

1556
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:37,079
is a friend of mine you know and it was

1557
01:12:35,039 --> 01:12:39,279
it was classical strains which I needed

1558
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:41,960
for my customers at that time Still

1559
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:45,279
Still I need but now I have additions

1560
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:47,800
which I only I have and the people that

1561
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:50,000
they have those strains they got it from

1562
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:53,320
me and I have no problem with it when

1563
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,960
they sell it it's not of course it's a

1564
01:12:53,319 --> 01:12:58,519
free world man what you want you know

1565
01:12:55,960 --> 01:13:00,639
it's like I'm not I'm not having no

1566
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:05,239
problem with that if you resell the

1567
01:13:00,639 --> 01:13:06,880
genetics that I got of course it's it is

1568
01:13:05,238 --> 01:13:09,399
like that comp let's compete with

1569
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:11,199
quality of the of the Clone then you

1570
01:13:09,399 --> 01:13:13,519
know how it's rooted you know how the

1571
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:16,559
mod plant how you shape it how you how

1572
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:19,239
you produce it the thing is that uh I

1573
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:22,719
tried uh in the facility that I was

1574
01:13:19,238 --> 01:13:26,279
working before I open my my my own

1575
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:29,198
facility with the business yeah is uh

1576
01:13:26,279 --> 01:13:31,399
all they all also used

1577
01:13:29,198 --> 01:13:33,759
Hydroponics which I am not really

1578
01:13:31,399 --> 01:13:36,399
professional in I'm really more

1579
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:41,320
professional in sense of pit based stuff

1580
01:13:36,399 --> 01:13:44,039
and soil cocoa mixes and uh uh you know

1581
01:13:41,319 --> 01:13:47,479
mother plants which are grown for like

1582
01:13:44,039 --> 01:13:50,399
half a year or 7 months and then I

1583
01:13:47,479 --> 01:13:53,198
change them all the time I don't I don't

1584
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:56,198
grow old mother plants I don't want to

1585
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:59,359
have my mother plants to be old and

1586
01:13:56,198 --> 01:14:01,839
Woody woodiness woodiness is not a good

1587
01:13:59,359 --> 01:14:03,599
thing with clothes so are you saying you

1588
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:06,400
you you still keep mothers around for 6

1589
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:08,840
months or you've lowered that time now I

1590
01:14:06,399 --> 01:14:13,319
I still have some strains you can keep

1591
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:16,880
for 6 months others you can't I mean to

1592
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:19,198
have a you can obviously you can keep

1593
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:21,560
them for years you know right some some

1594
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:24,559
shops did like when I started my

1595
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:28,120
business some shops had mod plans for a

1596
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:30,760
year or more they were also bragging

1597
01:14:28,119 --> 01:14:33,800
with it you know like like we have this

1598
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:37,159
you you can make do you can make D do

1599
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:38,920
from the stem man like wow yeah what

1600
01:14:37,158 --> 01:14:41,039
about you know it's really funny to

1601
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:44,600
think about it too knowing what we do

1602
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:47,760
know now uh about how somaclonal

1603
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:52,239
variation and

1604
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:55,960
um uh like pathogen buildup or other uh

1605
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:58,959
buildup of uh exogenous source es on the

1606
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:00,359
plant that are causing it to express

1607
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,520
differently than

1608
01:15:00,359 --> 01:15:06,238
its uh unadulterated genetic version

1609
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:10,679
let's say and how those can build up

1610
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:12,479
over time in older plant tissue and how

1611
01:15:10,679 --> 01:15:14,440
I I've even worked for some people at

1612
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:16,279
one point that they you know they wanted

1613
01:15:14,439 --> 01:15:18,238
to keep mothers around for as long as

1614
01:15:16,279 --> 01:15:20,800
possible because the idea behind it was

1615
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:24,000
that that mother the Clones they get off

1616
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:26,199
of it are going to be uniform to the

1617
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:30,319
product that they were using used to

1618
01:15:26,198 --> 01:15:32,559
growing and that product changed over

1619
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:34,559
time because that one mother was around

1620
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:37,480
for like a year and a half right so the

1621
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:41,000
Clones you were getting off of it at 30

1622
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:45,000
days out from the transplant versus you

1623
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:47,399
know uh 360 days after the transplant

1624
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,198
they're going to just be lacking almost

1625
01:15:47,399 --> 01:15:51,439
in a little bit and so they thought that

1626
01:15:49,198 --> 01:15:54,158
they were doing it to keep the genetics

1627
01:15:51,439 --> 01:15:56,279
at a specific level whereas using

1628
01:15:54,158 --> 01:15:59,799
Healthy Growth in recreating new

1629
01:15:56,279 --> 01:16:02,439
moms uh successively and uh you know on

1630
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:04,000
a on a regular schedule keeps the plant

1631
01:16:02,439 --> 01:16:05,678
in more Health as long as you're

1632
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,000
choosing your healthiest clones from

1633
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:09,800
those batches and and making sure that

1634
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,158
you're taking care of the the mothers

1635
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:15,000
and the root system of the plants so

1636
01:16:12,158 --> 01:16:16,559
that they maintain Health um and so you

1637
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,880
know as someone who does have to keep

1638
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:23,800
plants alive and to keep these genetics

1639
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:26,279
um you know in in a sense stable uh

1640
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:27,760
where you have you know very consistent

1641
01:16:26,279 --> 01:16:29,479
results with the Clones that you're

1642
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:31,400
shipping out what are some of the

1643
01:16:29,479 --> 01:16:36,158
practices that you're using to maintain

1644
01:16:31,399 --> 01:16:39,479
those mothers uh at a very healthy um at

1645
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:41,679
a very at very healthy growth as well as

1646
01:16:39,479 --> 01:16:43,678
what and then from there talk about some

1647
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:47,920
of your cloning practices that you feel

1648
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:51,119
as they'll create your best clones okay

1649
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:54,359
uh mother plants as I said not to be uh

1650
01:16:51,119 --> 01:16:55,960
too old but not cut them too early for

1651
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:58,439
you know you have to cut them for

1652
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:00,880
structure for sure but some of those

1653
01:16:58,439 --> 01:17:02,638
clones are like like you saw this these

1654
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:05,119
big steams and you think it's going to

1655
01:17:02,639 --> 01:17:08,480
be the you know some of them you can

1656
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:10,359
root very good some of them you can't um

1657
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:12,799
it depends on strains because when you

1658
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:15,319
keep like 35 different

1659
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:19,360
cultiv it depends it depends on

1660
01:17:15,319 --> 01:17:24,198
strengths so sure uh but the thing is

1661
01:17:19,359 --> 01:17:25,679
normally it is very simple don't do not

1662
01:17:24,198 --> 01:17:27,000
overw

1663
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:31,679
your

1664
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:34,079
moms my first rule do not overwater it's

1665
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:37,239
very important that's something that a

1666
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:41,399
machine doesn't know a pump doesn't know

1667
01:17:37,238 --> 01:17:45,399
when to stop pumping you know uh that's

1668
01:17:41,399 --> 01:17:47,439
why I have uh two gardeners for the moms

1669
01:17:45,399 --> 01:17:51,238
two guys that are paid for their jobs to

1670
01:17:47,439 --> 01:17:53,158
do that like every third day you know

1671
01:17:51,238 --> 01:17:55,799
and even before they have to go through

1672
01:17:53,158 --> 01:17:59,279
because regular checking because we have

1673
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:03,320
different size of pots but do not over

1674
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:05,439
over overwater your mothers ever because

1675
01:18:03,319 --> 01:18:09,319
if you do

1676
01:18:05,439 --> 01:18:12,599
that it's a very big big you know two

1677
01:18:09,319 --> 01:18:16,158
two steps back yeah uh the the second

1678
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:18,840
thing is do not keep your moms too old

1679
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:21,238
the third thing is experiment with

1680
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:24,079
different mediums when you clone for

1681
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:27,079
different cultiv okay we just we just

1682
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:30,960
realized that for example very old

1683
01:18:27,079 --> 01:18:34,519
cutting from White Widow uh very old

1684
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:38,439
cutting new cutting from uh America the

1685
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:42,280
ice cream runs are uh rooting much

1686
01:18:38,439 --> 01:18:45,559
better on rock wool instead of uh easy

1687
01:18:42,279 --> 01:18:47,599
PL easy PL is a pit based yeah but rock

1688
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:51,400
wool is rock wool we have

1689
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:55,360
Gro the grodon has it advantages but you

1690
01:18:51,399 --> 01:18:59,039
have to keep a lower pH for the grodon

1691
01:18:55,359 --> 01:19:02,559
than than for the uh Rock uh then for

1692
01:18:59,039 --> 01:19:05,238
the easy PL the two different mediums

1693
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:09,120
different strains react better in

1694
01:19:05,238 --> 01:19:11,559
different mediums also maybe not many

1695
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:15,359
producers talk about it a lot but when

1696
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:18,280
you have uh a variety of exotic strains

1697
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:19,920
like me have like you know all the

1698
01:19:18,279 --> 01:19:23,679
American strains they work much better

1699
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:25,800
on easy BL now than they do on groon you

1700
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:29,560
know for me

1701
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:32,239
I use yeah and I use now very uh I I

1702
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:35,159
experiment now with different kind of

1703
01:19:32,238 --> 01:19:36,759
rooting hormones okay I use I use

1704
01:19:35,158 --> 01:19:40,238
powdery rooting hormone which is

1705
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:43,480
phosphorus actually uh which is actually

1706
01:19:40,238 --> 01:19:46,718
for I buy it here in Slovenia uh and

1707
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:50,718
it's actually you know for all kind of

1708
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:54,319
cuttings you know for soft for uh half

1709
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:56,760
uh uh hard stems and for Woody stems you

1710
01:19:54,319 --> 01:20:00,679
can root everything with this one you

1711
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:06,280
know it's called corx yeah

1712
01:20:00,679 --> 01:20:09,119
okay corx oh corx corx yeah and the

1713
01:20:06,279 --> 01:20:12,119
producer is in Slovenia so okay cool

1714
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:16,319
yeah and uh we use now a one that is

1715
01:20:12,119 --> 01:20:18,599
clone 91 we got this product clone 91 it

1716
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:22,559
smells like ethanol which is like

1717
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:26,840
strange I use it first time last week to

1718
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:29,760
try it yeah it is it is liquid you pull

1719
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:32,159
liquid and you can root you know before

1720
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:35,280
you plug them you have like a hand full

1721
01:20:32,158 --> 01:20:39,759
of clones and you put them into soak for

1722
01:20:35,279 --> 01:20:43,119
20 seconds okay yeah we try this now so

1723
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:45,079
I I always tell people never be because

1724
01:20:43,119 --> 01:20:47,399
I work with different stuff a long time

1725
01:20:45,079 --> 01:20:51,880
until you know I try something else and

1726
01:20:47,399 --> 01:20:54,759
sometimes never be uh two stop born on

1727
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:57,039
something that okay something works but

1728
01:20:54,760 --> 01:21:00,320
don't be stop born that only this is the

1729
01:20:57,039 --> 01:21:03,359
the it and over because that that that

1730
01:21:00,319 --> 01:21:05,920
goes into a narrow Point uh sometimes

1731
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:07,920
it's not available you know you want to

1732
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:10,239
buy the material that your production

1733
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:13,000
goes on and it's not there it's like

1734
01:21:10,238 --> 01:21:15,718
what what oh what should I do now you

1735
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:18,079
know sure you have to have a second

1736
01:21:15,719 --> 01:21:20,319
pathway you know to go ah this works too

1737
01:21:18,079 --> 01:21:23,039
so all the time you have you have a

1738
01:21:20,319 --> 01:21:25,399
solution right yeah you have to I like

1739
01:21:23,039 --> 01:21:27,880
to point out to people what some of

1740
01:21:25,399 --> 01:21:29,439
these active ingredients are like in uh

1741
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:32,319
rooting Solutions and stuff you'll

1742
01:21:29,439 --> 01:21:35,919
usually have uh it'll say IBA or endel

1743
01:21:32,319 --> 01:21:38,599
3ic acid or maybe NAA which is

1744
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:40,679
napthalene acetic acid and you can find

1745
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:42,639
those different components in other

1746
01:21:40,679 --> 01:21:44,719
products and you can look for the ratio

1747
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:48,199
at which they're put into your favorite

1748
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:50,439
product and either dilute to that Ratio

1749
01:21:48,198 --> 01:21:52,000
or find something with a similar Ratio

1750
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:53,960
or maybe just like you're saying try

1751
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,279
something else don't be too stubborn to

1752
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:57,600
to not want to try something else

1753
01:21:55,279 --> 01:21:58,679
because a lot of these different things

1754
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:02,159
especially when it comes to

1755
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:04,560
Horticultural practices like cloning

1756
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:09,238
right we've been cloning plants for over

1757
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:12,080
a hundred years at production levels in

1758
01:22:09,238 --> 01:22:14,198
around the world and there's plenty of

1759
01:22:12,079 --> 01:22:18,600
information out there on what to do for

1760
01:22:14,198 --> 01:22:20,559
it right so being stubborn in one way is

1761
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:23,079
yeah you can't you can't do that we also

1762
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:25,320
we also did experiment I tell you this

1763
01:22:23,079 --> 01:22:28,279
in my facility we did the guys did the

1764
01:22:25,319 --> 01:22:31,960
experiment without any rooting hormone

1765
01:22:28,279 --> 01:22:35,519
at all to plug it into the the easy

1766
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:39,079
plugs we did it you know 50 of those we

1767
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:42,400
did without hormone 20

1768
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:45,519
rooted without hormone just because the

1769
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:48,879
mom was so healthy also right the plant

1770
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:51,360
itself but with with hormone almost

1771
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:54,079
everything will root right so it's well

1772
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:59,000
and even like like the IBA and the NAA

1773
01:22:54,079 --> 01:23:00,960
are just different uh oxin and cyto

1774
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:03,880
right and those are already produced uh

1775
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:06,359
endogenously in cannabis plants for you

1776
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:07,679
know apical growth root growth all these

1777
01:23:06,359 --> 01:23:10,839
different things that we're like

1778
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:15,359
applying them to

1779
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:17,600
um that you know it's already uh it's

1780
01:23:15,359 --> 01:23:21,319
already there we're just applying extra

1781
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:24,719
to try and promote something and so yeah

1782
01:23:21,319 --> 01:23:26,840
it's that's it's important to know that

1783
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:29,039
there's different ways to get to it and

1784
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:32,760
you know the as you asked me before you

1785
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:35,679
know about the agencies come into your

1786
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:38,000
facility to get uh the paperwork done

1787
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:41,319
for you that you have a European planed

1788
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:44,039
passport at the end of the day yeah and

1789
01:23:41,319 --> 01:23:47,198
those agencies are actually there to

1790
01:23:44,039 --> 01:23:50,279
have an insight and have a control uh

1791
01:23:47,198 --> 01:23:54,079
over pests and diseases that can Ure on

1792
01:23:50,279 --> 01:23:55,960
the market you know and actually it's a

1793
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:58,600
I have actually very good relation to

1794
01:23:55,960 --> 01:24:01,480
them and I work with them closely for

1795
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:04,159
exports which is outside which is

1796
01:24:01,479 --> 01:24:07,559
European exports I don't need to to to

1797
01:24:04,158 --> 01:24:10,960
extra to talk to them but if I export

1798
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:13,639
outside of Europe I have to organize uh

1799
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:15,960
meeting and they have to come to make

1800
01:24:13,639 --> 01:24:18,560
you know always is a different if uh one

1801
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:20,760
country demands something that they need

1802
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:24,120
to step inside they will always you know

1803
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:26,239
sure it is uh they paperwork is done

1804
01:24:24,119 --> 01:24:28,279
like if somebody from outside of Europe

1805
01:24:26,238 --> 01:24:31,759
wants clones from my facility it's very

1806
01:24:28,279 --> 01:24:35,359
simple you give me an import permit and

1807
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:38,639
with this import permit I go to to Aus

1808
01:24:35,359 --> 01:24:41,399
to this agency and they come to my

1809
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:44,480
facility and uh go through this import

1810
01:24:41,399 --> 01:24:45,439
permit what H what is the demand on the

1811
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:49,000
import

1812
01:24:45,439 --> 01:24:50,678
permit from this demand uh they will

1813
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,840
check all the

1814
01:24:50,679 --> 01:24:56,158
facility uh and even Beyond of that and

1815
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:59,239
you know if the DeMont is checking for

1816
01:24:56,158 --> 01:25:01,599
all kind of viruses they it is there I

1817
01:24:59,238 --> 01:25:04,399
already did it so it's it's it's a deep

1818
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:06,800
scan uh people call you know you have

1819
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:10,399
this Tumi genomics stuff right you know

1820
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:13,880
have this kind of data it is all valid

1821
01:25:10,399 --> 01:25:16,359
valid but it is also uh very unaccurate

1822
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:20,199
also on the same point sure it's not

1823
01:25:16,359 --> 01:25:23,599
it's not U this thing the the the

1824
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:25,279
standard for shipment outside of borders

1825
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:28,039
of cont

1826
01:25:25,279 --> 01:25:30,920
let me say it's much more different

1827
01:25:28,039 --> 01:25:32,960
standard sure absolutely I mean it has

1828
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:36,399
to be right we don't want to spread

1829
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:38,760
pathogens or invasive species or other

1830
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:43,759
things like that that could potentially

1831
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:45,440
harm crops or other uh like native

1832
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:47,920
species of plants or other things like

1833
01:25:45,439 --> 01:25:50,759
that that can that can be devastating

1834
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:54,079
and so it's you know there's a part of

1835
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:57,840
like the level of bureaucracy behind

1836
01:25:54,079 --> 01:26:00,960
that that much oversight I'm sure can be

1837
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:04,119
a hindrance in some people's eyes but

1838
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:07,639
then the ability to also help

1839
01:26:04,118 --> 01:26:09,799
prevent issues like catastrophic sort of

1840
01:26:07,639 --> 01:26:12,840
events potentially from occurring

1841
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:14,279
brother um like could you imagine like

1842
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:16,480
let's just say something with hops Laton

1843
01:26:14,279 --> 01:26:19,920
vroid right if something like that

1844
01:26:16,479 --> 01:26:22,319
entered into a market where there's a

1845
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:25,118
like a CBD manufacturer and it somehow

1846
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:28,599
makes its way into that fac fa due to

1847
01:26:25,118 --> 01:26:32,079
mislabeling or something from LAX

1848
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:34,360
standards it could it could ruin you

1849
01:26:32,079 --> 01:26:36,719
know destroy let's say it just ruins one

1850
01:26:34,359 --> 01:26:39,799
crop but this crop is over a 100,000

1851
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:43,239
acres or something that's that's crazy

1852
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:45,400
amounts of wasted resources and wasted

1853
01:26:43,238 --> 01:26:47,919
time and all these different things that

1854
01:26:45,399 --> 01:26:51,118
could have you know gone into a

1855
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:52,920
productive crop so yeah that's I think

1856
01:26:51,118 --> 01:26:54,399
it's really valid to have stuff like

1857
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:57,800
that especially when you are shipping

1858
01:26:54,399 --> 01:27:00,039
over country or continent borders which

1859
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:01,800
is something that again I don't think

1860
01:27:00,039 --> 01:27:04,639
that a lot of people in the US market

1861
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:07,199
are thinking about how much

1862
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:08,719
standardization and oversight will be

1863
01:27:07,198 --> 01:27:10,158
required if something like that were to

1864
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:12,840
happen it's already it already happens

1865
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:15,118
if we're shipping other production crops

1866
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:19,319
that are through some sort of clonal

1867
01:27:15,118 --> 01:27:21,559
tissue like whether it be like apple or

1868
01:27:19,319 --> 01:27:23,639
other Orchard crops things like this

1869
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:26,159
oranges you know all these things that

1870
01:27:23,639 --> 01:27:29,239
are they're they're single cultivars you

1871
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:32,879
know they're they're uh cloned onto

1872
01:27:29,238 --> 01:27:35,359
existing root stocks or you know it it's

1873
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:38,920
a whole Market in and of itself that has

1874
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:41,039
extremely high levels of uh oversight

1875
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:43,000
because it you know you if you ruin

1876
01:27:41,039 --> 01:27:46,439
something like the orange market it not

1877
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:48,880
just ruins you know the the capitalistic

1878
01:27:46,439 --> 01:27:51,039
sense of it where you have nobody

1879
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:52,840
gaining money from their oranges anymore

1880
01:27:51,039 --> 01:27:55,920
but you also lose a lot of that

1881
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:57,440
potential neut source for however many

1882
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:00,920
millions of people that that would

1883
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:04,279
provide it for so it is it's important

1884
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:07,760
but it it requires so many different

1885
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:07,759
angles to look

1886
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:15,079
at yeah man it is um actually you know

1887
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:17,280
the the these agency people who are

1888
01:28:15,079 --> 01:28:20,639
officials government

1889
01:28:17,279 --> 01:28:23,118
officials that's very helpful people for

1890
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:24,800
my facility for example you know I

1891
01:28:23,118 --> 01:28:28,198
always followed

1892
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:31,560
their advice their advice was for

1893
01:28:28,198 --> 01:28:36,638
example I was shipping to Israel one

1894
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:41,600
time few years ago and uh they told

1895
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:47,118
me uh that two years ago one Austrian

1896
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:49,520
farmer tried to ship apples into Israel

1897
01:28:47,118 --> 01:28:53,439
and just just apples themselves right

1898
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:55,440
apples apples man and all the apples

1899
01:28:53,439 --> 01:28:58,759
when they arrive in t

1900
01:28:55,439 --> 01:29:00,839
aiv were

1901
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:02,639
destroyed cuz they didn't pass this

1902
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:04,639
standard because they didn't pass the

1903
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:05,679
standard and what was the problem he

1904
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:08,560
told

1905
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:11,639
me because it was like when I contact

1906
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:15,039
them because I have a from Israel the

1907
01:29:11,639 --> 01:29:17,359
the inquiry you know and um they give me

1908
01:29:15,039 --> 01:29:20,079
the import permit so on the import

1909
01:29:17,359 --> 01:29:24,238
permit there was listing of stuff that I

1910
01:29:20,079 --> 01:29:28,000
have to check for before I send it

1911
01:29:24,238 --> 01:29:30,799
man that was like a list that was like a

1912
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,639
list is when you talk about whole plate

1913
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:34,320
and virus you there was not only whole

1914
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:36,639
plate and virus there was stuff written

1915
01:29:34,319 --> 01:29:39,880
there I still have this paper it is

1916
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:43,480
stuff written there all all viruses I

1917
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:47,039
know like tobac virus latent something

1918
01:29:43,479 --> 01:29:49,799
virus then mosaic virus from some

1919
01:29:47,039 --> 01:29:52,719
different mosaic virus again some like

1920
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:55,239
beat curly top virus I don't know man

1921
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:57,039
it's like every [ __ ] fuing thing that is

1922
01:29:55,238 --> 01:29:58,599
possible to check for they they wanted

1923
01:29:57,039 --> 01:30:01,920
to have it

1924
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:05,840
checked and we did that then you know

1925
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:07,920
and actually he asked he told me that U

1926
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:11,880
the thing is why the apples were

1927
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:15,880
destroyed from this farmer because he

1928
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:19,279
was using uh some stuff for uh

1929
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:20,760
prevention you know some oh you know

1930
01:30:19,279 --> 01:30:23,198
like a pesticide or something like a

1931
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:26,960
pesticide or something that was allowed

1932
01:30:23,198 --> 01:30:30,399
in Austria but not allowed in Israel

1933
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:33,118
yeah that's a that's a big one yeah yeah

1934
01:30:30,399 --> 01:30:36,439
this is like the thing is that wow he

1935
01:30:33,118 --> 01:30:37,920
used that you know for you they give you

1936
01:30:36,439 --> 01:30:39,638
this checklist what you are allowed to

1937
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,399
use and what are not allowed to

1938
01:30:39,639 --> 01:30:43,118
everything you get everything these are

1939
01:30:41,399 --> 01:30:44,839
these are really documents man this is

1940
01:30:43,118 --> 01:30:47,039
like you have to go through and you have

1941
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:50,199
to check what is actually on your Market

1942
01:30:47,039 --> 01:30:53,238
because most of that stuff on the list

1943
01:30:50,198 --> 01:30:55,879
is not there on your Market but you have

1944
01:30:53,238 --> 01:30:59,039
to find stuff that is there on your on

1945
01:30:55,880 --> 01:31:00,760
your Market in your country to check for

1946
01:30:59,039 --> 01:31:02,158
it because Israel is a different

1947
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:04,920
environment man it's like they have

1948
01:31:02,158 --> 01:31:08,759
different it makes me think of in the US

1949
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:11,039
every state that has a a legal like a

1950
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:13,440
recreational or a medical market for

1951
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:16,439
cannabis has different standards for

1952
01:31:13,439 --> 01:31:18,960
testing some of them will test for

1953
01:31:16,439 --> 01:31:21,919
pesticides some of them won't some of

1954
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:24,000
them will test for mot toxins like from

1955
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:26,158
a mold or something like that that could

1956
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:29,479
have been produced on the flower some of

1957
01:31:26,158 --> 01:31:33,879
them don't yeah some of them test for

1958
01:31:29,479 --> 01:31:36,158
THC percentage using one protocol some

1959
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:37,679
of them use another protocol all these

1960
01:31:36,158 --> 01:31:40,759
different things where it's not

1961
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:43,199
standardized at all but some people are

1962
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:44,840
still wanting to use the

1963
01:31:43,198 --> 01:31:47,960
standardizations we have in place and

1964
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:51,400
then open up interstate commerce or

1965
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:53,239
International Commerce and how how can

1966
01:31:51,399 --> 01:31:54,879
you do that when the product from your

1967
01:31:53,238 --> 01:31:56,718
Market is is going to go to this other

1968
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:58,400
Market if it gets tested it's going to

1969
01:31:56,719 --> 01:32:01,880
fail and it's going to get either

1970
01:31:58,399 --> 01:32:03,679
trashed or returned but still all that

1971
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:06,118
shipping cost is going to then fall on

1972
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:09,800
the initial Nick it will not get it will

1973
01:32:06,118 --> 01:32:12,679
not get returned no way no it's get

1974
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:14,800
itest Destro it's going to get destroyed

1975
01:32:12,679 --> 01:32:16,359
onto the black market you know destroyed

1976
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:20,719
right it's going to get destroyed yeah

1977
01:32:16,359 --> 01:32:23,238
absolutely destroyed so it's it's not

1978
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:25,319
something where I feel like we're uh

1979
01:32:23,238 --> 01:32:27,519
mature enough within the market to be

1980
01:32:25,319 --> 01:32:29,319
able to even start to think about that

1981
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:30,480
stuff until we start creating a little

1982
01:32:29,319 --> 01:32:33,759
bit more

1983
01:32:30,479 --> 01:32:36,118
standardization and less of this sort of

1984
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:37,880
fog that is the Cannabis Market where

1985
01:32:36,118 --> 01:32:41,519
you can't necessarily know how it's

1986
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:44,760
going to even be tested within your own

1987
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:47,719
States Market you have different uh

1988
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:50,800
standards of testing for each facility

1989
01:32:47,719 --> 01:32:53,880
within a specific state so you can't

1990
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:56,760
even you know like one one company might

1991
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:59,920
might test your your product and come

1992
01:32:56,760 --> 01:33:01,400
out at 20% THC another company might

1993
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:03,639
test your product and it'll come out at

1994
01:33:01,399 --> 01:33:05,079
35 THC and the only difference is is

1995
01:33:03,639 --> 01:33:07,520
that they pulled it from the top of the

1996
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:09,920
bag versus the bottom of the bag yes you

1997
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:13,920
know it's it's stuff like that where

1998
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:17,158
it's uh like how how can we use those

1999
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:19,760
that level of uh discrepancy within our

2000
01:33:17,158 --> 01:33:21,759
standards and say well we can apply this

2001
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:24,880
to a larger market it just doesn't make

2002
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:26,560
a lot of sense to me and you're making a

2003
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:28,239
very valid point that you know within a

2004
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:30,159
market like you're operating in where

2005
01:33:28,238 --> 01:33:33,198
you have to have all these standards

2006
01:33:30,158 --> 01:33:34,920
something as simple as using one

2007
01:33:33,198 --> 01:33:37,879
pesticide that's totally fine within

2008
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:40,440
your Market it causes the entire

2009
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:42,639
shipment to get destroyed all that money

2010
01:33:40,439 --> 01:33:45,359
gone all that production gone all that

2011
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:48,199
time and effort gone right all because

2012
01:33:45,359 --> 01:33:51,000
you didn't read somebody else's

2013
01:33:48,198 --> 01:33:53,158
standards two papers you know your you

2014
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:55,158
know what is allowed in your country

2015
01:33:53,158 --> 01:33:58,000
what is allowed in those this country

2016
01:33:55,158 --> 01:34:00,158
where you try to export you have to have

2017
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:03,439
two papers and then you have to you

2018
01:34:00,158 --> 01:34:06,000
measure you like what you know and then

2019
01:34:03,439 --> 01:34:08,000
you find this cross like oh [ __ ] we

2020
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,880
using this and they're not allowing it

2021
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:13,000
oh [ __ ] you know yeah this is the [ __ ]

2022
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:16,359
you know yeah that's I mean that's a lot

2023
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:19,118
to deal with the thing is that I always

2024
01:34:16,359 --> 01:34:22,399
you know I I'm a locky one that I I

2025
01:34:19,118 --> 01:34:26,158
really don't use a lot of pesticide in

2026
01:34:22,399 --> 01:34:28,399
my facility I right my thing is you know

2027
01:34:26,158 --> 01:34:33,238
of course I use some but it's really

2028
01:34:28,399 --> 01:34:36,719
soft one uh plant wash also um but the

2029
01:34:33,238 --> 01:34:40,879
most important thing most most important

2030
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:44,520
thing clean your [ __ ]

2031
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:47,079
floors yep walk in with the shoes that

2032
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:50,639
you are walking into your facility have

2033
01:34:47,079 --> 01:34:54,439
a changing you you change your clothes

2034
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:56,840
change your shoes always do use bath or

2035
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:58,919
anything like a shoe bath we have we

2036
01:34:56,840 --> 01:35:01,239
have a mat which is like you step on it

2037
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:03,840
and it's like disinfecting stuff right

2038
01:35:01,238 --> 01:35:07,238
but most most of it this will not

2039
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:09,440
prevent uh anything if you don't use

2040
01:35:07,238 --> 01:35:12,158
extra your shoes in the company is your

2041
01:35:09,439 --> 01:35:15,000
shoes you don't you don't walk with

2042
01:35:12,158 --> 01:35:18,079
those shoes anywhere else and when the

2043
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:21,238
floors of the facility has to be so

2044
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:23,238
clean that I can I can lick it boy you

2045
01:35:21,238 --> 01:35:27,638
know absolutely that is the thing that

2046
01:35:23,238 --> 01:35:29,718
is most uh I think you can M maintain uh

2047
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:33,039
the most past free environment through

2048
01:35:29,719 --> 01:35:35,239
this first absolutely yeah because when

2049
01:35:33,039 --> 01:35:37,439
the clean clean floor is there then

2050
01:35:35,238 --> 01:35:39,718
there is no more uh there is no more

2051
01:35:37,439 --> 01:35:41,759
room for these things to to be really

2052
01:35:39,719 --> 01:35:43,880
impacted you know like right they're not

2053
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:47,199
they don't have hiding places you know

2054
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:47,199
you can so

2055
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:52,719
um we already talked a little bit about

2056
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:55,119
your mother practices and your uh

2057
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:57,359
cloning practices is so what are some of

2058
01:35:55,118 --> 01:36:00,079
the other parts of your facility that

2059
01:35:57,359 --> 01:36:01,960
are either unique to your setup or that

2060
01:36:00,079 --> 01:36:04,639
you really feel as though you have

2061
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:06,960
dialed in cuz I think you're in a mixed

2062
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:09,520
light setting correct you have a it's a

2063
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:12,279
greenhouse with supplemental

2064
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:15,480
lighting actually it's not a greenhouse

2065
01:36:12,279 --> 01:36:17,880
but it's like a it's like a u you know

2066
01:36:15,479 --> 01:36:20,919

01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:32,000
they uh the bar style arrays where

2093
01:37:30,079 --> 01:37:34,479
you're dropping them right down you know

2094
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,560
18 to 20 in above the can you can do

2095
01:37:34,479 --> 01:37:40,079
both with those light actually when you

2096
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:42,560
do the vegetation vegetation like I do I

2097
01:37:40,079 --> 01:37:44,800
always keep them very high sure I don't

2098
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:46,159
I don't go but when you do flowering

2099
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:49,400
with these lamps cuz they are full

2100
01:37:46,158 --> 01:37:51,920
spectrum lamps uh you go close you can

2101
01:37:49,399 --> 01:37:55,439
go close and this facilities in

2102
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:57,639
Switzerland and all I mean this facility

2103
01:37:55,439 --> 01:37:59,879
really big facilities they they are

2104
01:37:57,639 --> 01:38:02,440
providing facilities with these lights

2105
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:05,319
for years now and uh they are really

2106
01:38:02,439 --> 01:38:08,359
like you know you will see now actually

2107
01:38:05,319 --> 01:38:10,840
they will come to your market now so um

2108
01:38:08,359 --> 01:38:13,759
and they are actually like Steve Jobs

2109
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:16,079
one guy made it you know Martin is his

2110
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:19,119
name yeah he's a guy that made you know

2111
01:38:16,079 --> 01:38:21,359
he was a grower and that guy produced

2112
01:38:19,118 --> 01:38:23,118
his own lead lead lamps but because he

2113
01:38:21,359 --> 01:38:26,039
was not satisfied with the lead lamps

2114
01:38:23,118 --> 01:38:29,158
what that was on the market at the time

2115
01:38:26,039 --> 01:38:33,920
and he was in a garage you know and from

2116
01:38:29,158 --> 01:38:35,879
that garage a million million company uh

2117
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:38,118
came to light now you know and they are

2118
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:41,000
really good producers and we have a good

2119
01:38:38,118 --> 01:38:42,639
relation uh I was supporting them in a

2120
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:46,000
time when they were not so known

2121
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:48,760
actually and uh I bought all the B stock

2122
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:51,719
from those lamps yeah they had you know

2123
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:53,239
I bought these lamps U which is perfect

2124
01:38:51,719 --> 01:38:56,880
you know the same lamps that they sell

2125
01:38:53,238 --> 01:38:59,158
now evoline but thing is that the glass

2126
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:02,599
because the protection is

2127
01:38:59,158 --> 01:39:04,158
e65 that means you can spray in this

2128
01:39:02,599 --> 01:39:07,279
environment with this lamps yeah that

2129
01:39:04,158 --> 01:39:09,799
you can they are waterproof lead lamps

2130
01:39:07,279 --> 01:39:12,158
and you can spray sulfur sulfur also

2131
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:14,520
they have like Co coating for because

2132
01:39:12,158 --> 01:39:17,118
lead lamps you can destroy with sulfur

2133
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:19,320
so yeah maybe people don't know that and

2134
01:39:17,118 --> 01:39:22,839
they spray and then they are wondering

2135
01:39:19,319 --> 01:39:26,000
why the lamps are going off at a certain

2136
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:28,800
point yeah because sulfur will eat your

2137
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:33,520
doodas you know it's like it's like that

2138
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:38,800
you know so actually with these lamps uh

2139
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:41,280
I produced most quality moms because HPS

2140
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:43,199
was good also before that but in a

2141
01:39:41,279 --> 01:39:45,439
certain time you know in winter time

2142
01:39:43,198 --> 01:39:48,839
when you don't need so much eating then

2143
01:39:45,439 --> 01:39:51,759
but now it's like the electricity went

2144
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:54,840
so high and you need sufficient light uh

2145
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:57,639
you need a setting when the the light

2146
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:59,800
the density of the light is so that you

2147
01:39:57,639 --> 01:40:02,279
can see it on the internodal spacing of

2148
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:06,520
the moms you can see it on the on the

2149
01:40:02,279 --> 01:40:09,880
stem uh how you you can see it but the

2150
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:13,080
thing is they need more feet they you

2151
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:17,599
need to feed them more calcium magnesium

2152
01:40:13,079 --> 01:40:20,000
iron sulfur sink mongan Bon mden you

2153
01:40:17,599 --> 01:40:22,199
know Trace elements and all those stuff

2154
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:24,880
because they will eat up more because to

2155
01:40:22,198 --> 01:40:27,879
use all of this these photons that come

2156
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:30,639
down right now lead light some people

2157
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:33,239
will tell that it's not so good for them

2158
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:36,560
I understand it why because they were

2159
01:40:33,238 --> 01:40:39,799
used to grow 30 years under HPS and

2160
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:42,440
metalight and the product was really

2161
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:45,199
good and now with lead lights the

2162
01:40:42,439 --> 01:40:46,638
product is not there for them cuz they

2163
01:40:45,198 --> 01:40:48,678
they went from one facility where they

2164
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:51,639
had HPS and they're like okay I have all

2165
01:40:48,679 --> 01:40:53,319
this uh air conditioning right and I

2166
01:40:51,639 --> 01:40:55,199
don't have a lot of dehumidification

2167
01:40:53,319 --> 01:40:58,118
won't need that and then they go to LEDs

2168
01:40:55,198 --> 01:40:59,879
and it's the inverse right you have less

2169
01:40:58,118 --> 01:41:02,759
heat production so you don't need as

2170
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:05,159
much HVAC in terms of the the cooling

2171
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:06,280
but you need a lot more dehumidification

2172
01:41:05,158 --> 01:41:09,759
because your

2173
01:41:06,279 --> 01:41:11,559
transpiration uh under LEDs is just way

2174
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:13,960
higher because your photosynthetic

2175
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:17,719
Potential from that led is it's just

2176
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:20,520
more ideal light than HPS for um for

2177
01:41:17,719 --> 01:41:23,000
cannabis growth so you just I I've seen

2178
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:25,159
other people run into that problem where

2179
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:27,039
they go from one to the other and they

2180
01:41:25,158 --> 01:41:29,158
say oh LEDs don't work that well and

2181
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:31,639
it's like just keep your temperatures a

2182
01:41:29,158 --> 01:41:33,039
little higher keep your humidity a

2183
01:41:31,639 --> 01:41:36,118
little higher but make sure that it's

2184
01:41:33,039 --> 01:41:39,479
not getting out of whack yeah yes yes

2185
01:41:36,118 --> 01:41:42,639
always like this there is always balance

2186
01:41:39,479 --> 01:41:44,238
of things you know the the metastas of

2187
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:46,359
your body you know is the same with

2188
01:41:44,238 --> 01:41:47,799
those things right yeah yeah like the

2189
01:41:46,359 --> 01:41:50,279
the metabolic

2190
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:52,520
rate yeah yeah the yeah the metabolic

2191
01:41:50,279 --> 01:41:53,840
rate yeah yeah you know absolutely yeah

2192
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:56,320
it just goes up when you have more

2193
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:58,760
energy input so for example you know

2194
01:41:56,319 --> 01:42:02,198
when I caught a mom that is that has

2195
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:04,440
been reving for the last three weeks but

2196
01:42:02,198 --> 01:42:06,678
I was not cutting her for three weeks

2197
01:42:04,439 --> 01:42:09,559
and she's like putting out these really

2198
01:42:06,679 --> 01:42:14,560
branches you know like w and then I CAU

2199
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:16,199
her the next time I I'm not going to

2200
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:20,719
feed her a

2201
01:42:16,198 --> 01:42:23,319
lot you know I cut her I when she's dry

2202
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:28,480
I give her a normal pedigree and then

2203
01:42:23,319 --> 01:42:30,399
the next time when I uh uh uh water her

2204
01:42:28,479 --> 01:42:34,118
then she gets a lot of food but I need

2205
01:42:30,399 --> 01:42:39,039
to cut out the ba the basic of her from

2206
01:42:34,118 --> 01:42:42,920
from beneath to up just to leave the few

2207
01:42:39,039 --> 01:42:46,359
uh uh Nas that I want to shoot right

2208
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:49,399
that one so that is how I create good

2209
01:42:46,359 --> 01:42:52,719
stems with clones that you don't have a

2210
01:42:49,399 --> 01:42:55,439
lot of when you have too much density

2211
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:58,158
the all these small branches underneath

2212
01:42:55,439 --> 01:43:00,960
they eat away the energy for the Clones

2213
01:42:58,158 --> 01:43:02,559
that you want to cut from your mobs yeah

2214
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:04,520
what are you um what are you typically

2215
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:06,320
feeding uh like what strength of

2216
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:09,040
electrical conductivity for your normal

2217
01:43:06,319 --> 01:43:10,559
moms what are you feeding your clones uh

2218
01:43:09,039 --> 01:43:11,960
you said you cut it back a little bit

2219
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:14,480
after you cut moms what are some of

2220
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:18,800
those different parameters you run yeah

2221
01:43:14,479 --> 01:43:22,598
uh the water from the tab is 0.4 0.5

2222
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:23,639
right with my place uh normally have a

2223
01:43:22,599 --> 01:43:28,360
regime

2224
01:43:23,639 --> 01:43:31,118
of uh for the the Clones in the in the

2225
01:43:28,359 --> 01:43:33,920
chamber for the first 10 days I don't

2226
01:43:31,118 --> 01:43:37,719
feed them at all from the time they are

2227
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:42,679
cut they don't feed them uh and from the

2228
01:43:37,719 --> 01:43:44,279
10th day on they gave I give them 0.3 AC

2229
01:43:42,679 --> 01:43:49,359
so

2230
01:43:44,279 --> 01:43:52,359
0 0.7 0.8 when you when you measure it

2231
01:43:49,359 --> 01:43:56,519
yeah and I use a very specific uh you

2232
01:43:52,359 --> 01:43:57,880
know uh bio NOA company Bova yeah I

2233
01:43:56,520 --> 01:44:01,360
think I've heard of that before green

2234
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:03,760
green one and they have hydro super mix

2235
01:44:01,359 --> 01:44:05,799
it's a specific uh it's a specific uh

2236
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:07,599
product which is working really good

2237
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:10,599
it's is it just like a one part

2238
01:44:07,599 --> 01:44:13,400
vegetative uh applic one part vegetative

2239
01:44:10,599 --> 01:44:16,880
application and you you use it like it's

2240
01:44:13,399 --> 01:44:19,759
mpk and you use it as that and you just

2241
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:22,319
you know it's like made for made for uh

2242
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:24,880
hydroponic systems sure just like it's a

2243
01:44:22,319 --> 01:44:27,599
mineral do do you find that you have to

2244
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:29,840
add any additional calcium or

2245
01:44:27,599 --> 01:44:32,639
micronutrients or anything like that I

2246
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:36,279
add also from con you know the

2247
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:39,279
ronic ronic is always uh it's a root

2248
01:44:36,279 --> 01:44:42,479
root B root booster or or

2249
01:44:39,279 --> 01:44:44,960
from what's in the booster again risot

2250
01:44:42,479 --> 01:44:47,678
tonic it's called and it's you know the

2251
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:50,520
tree that is made that is growing next

2252
01:44:47,679 --> 01:44:52,399
to rivers it's very if you cut a branch

2253
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:53,760
from that tree and you stick it into the

2254
01:44:52,399 --> 01:44:56,960
ground it will

2255
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:59,320
root Willow Tree okay Willow Tree yes

2256
01:44:56,960 --> 01:45:02,679
willow tree and the willow tree is the

2257
01:44:59,319 --> 01:45:04,880
base of that product that that is what

2258
01:45:02,679 --> 01:45:07,840
guy the guy told me from K you know that

2259
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:12,239
he said actually the concept of of the

2260
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:15,679
risot tonic of the of the uh product of

2261
01:45:12,238 --> 01:45:19,479
root enhancer sure uh it it is actually

2262
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:22,679
from willow trees you know and they got

2263
01:45:19,479 --> 01:45:24,279
it things like like it it things like

2264
01:45:22,679 --> 01:45:26,000
you know

2265
01:45:24,279 --> 01:45:28,920
it it does not smell very good when you

2266
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:31,840
open the bottle yeah but uh Willow was

2267
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:34,399
where yeah Willow was where people found

2268
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:36,039
um what was it aspirin I believe

2269
01:45:34,399 --> 01:45:38,479
initially was like Willow shoots you

2270
01:45:36,039 --> 01:45:40,198
could you found like the the same

2271
01:45:38,479 --> 01:45:43,759
component for aspirin and then I think

2272
01:45:40,198 --> 01:45:47,960
it also even has a significant amount of

2273
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:51,400
uh IBA the indo3 buic acid in it and so

2274
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:53,399
people could use that for um giving to

2275
01:45:51,399 --> 01:45:55,920
their their plants to help promote

2276
01:45:53,399 --> 01:45:57,879
health and one thing that uh I found out

2277
01:45:55,920 --> 01:46:00,719
recently that I know a lot of people

2278
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:03,840
don't know but you can use aspirin if

2279
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:05,359
like if your plants have like a a vroid

2280
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:07,760
like hops lighten vroid or something

2281
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:10,319
like that if you add aspirin like just

2282
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:12,039
your regular aspirin to your nutrient

2283
01:46:10,319 --> 01:46:16,759
solution and I don't know the exact

2284
01:46:12,039 --> 01:46:20,439
amount so look it up people but um

2285
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:24,360
it'll promote a healthy plant and reduce

2286
01:46:20,439 --> 01:46:26,359
some of those viral symptoms which is

2287
01:46:24,359 --> 01:46:28,319
like if you need to limp along to a

2288
01:46:26,359 --> 01:46:30,118
harvest or if you need to keep something

2289
01:46:28,319 --> 01:46:31,799
alive just long enough to make sure you

2290
01:46:30,118 --> 01:46:33,399
can get healthy cuttings off of it and

2291
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:35,960
then either put it through tissue

2292
01:46:33,399 --> 01:46:39,479
culture or something if it is a viral uh

2293
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:41,880
pressure you can use things like aspirin

2294
01:46:39,479 --> 01:46:44,039
to to do that and with a willow extract

2295
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:47,400
you're getting both right you're getting

2296
01:46:44,039 --> 01:46:50,118
uh the promotion of this oxin for heavy

2297
01:46:47,399 --> 01:46:53,158
root development as well as this

2298
01:46:50,118 --> 01:46:56,598
potential pathogen suppression overall

2299
01:46:53,158 --> 01:46:58,679
Health tonic I guess you could say so

2300
01:46:56,599 --> 01:47:00,520
that that's really fascinating I I could

2301
01:46:58,679 --> 01:47:02,880
see how especially for moms if you're

2302
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:06,480
feeding that you know you're maybe

2303
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:08,560
raising the overall oxen count in the

2304
01:47:06,479 --> 01:47:12,359
plant so that you're rooting uh your

2305
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:15,760
cuting root fast you know and and

2306
01:47:12,359 --> 01:47:18,000
vigorously they have to be hungry yeah

2307
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:20,079
you know not hungry that they start to

2308
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,238
yellow on the Le because they start to

2309
01:47:20,079 --> 01:47:23,760
to get the nitrogen from the leaves they

2310
01:47:22,238 --> 01:47:25,279
will suck it

2311
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:27,960
because sometimes when you root it on

2312
01:47:25,279 --> 01:47:30,039
rock wool it happens much earlier right

2313
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:32,679
because there is no uh you know there is

2314
01:47:30,039 --> 01:47:35,439
a it's neutral medium it has no food

2315
01:47:32,679 --> 01:47:37,399
inside you know the speed based stuff

2316
01:47:35,439 --> 01:47:40,158
the easy plugs they have a little bit of

2317
01:47:37,399 --> 01:47:42,679
nitrogen inside and so but this stuff

2318
01:47:40,158 --> 01:47:44,839
doesn't so if you don't use the hydro

2319
01:47:42,679 --> 01:47:49,000
super mix stuff you know some some kind

2320
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:52,440
of mpk uh you get faster yellowing but

2321
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:54,319
the root is still there so as as as soon

2322
01:47:52,439 --> 01:47:57,279
as you put it into a medium which has

2323
01:47:54,319 --> 01:47:58,679
some nutrients it will work right yeah

2324
01:47:57,279 --> 01:48:00,800
but the thing with the mom that you

2325
01:47:58,679 --> 01:48:04,520
asked me before where do I go with the

2326
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:05,840
EC it's very interesting for years I

2327
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:09,000
have in a

2328
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:14,880
regimen a regime that would be between

2329
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:18,520
1.0 to 1.3 EC for the vegetative moms

2330
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:20,840
you know sometimes now where I go until

2331
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:26,560
2.2 or

2332
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:29,800
2.5 but I do it once uh every 14 days

2333
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:33,199
only fascinating yeah but you have to

2334
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:38,239
know what I put inside to get this

2335
01:48:33,198 --> 01:48:40,319
2.5 not Nitro not nitrogen and not

2336
01:48:38,238 --> 01:48:43,879
phosphorus it is

2337
01:48:40,319 --> 01:48:46,319
all uh iron calcium

2338
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:50,159
magnesium uh uh and all the trace

2339
01:48:46,319 --> 01:48:54,559
Elements which is zinc Boron mongan mden

2340
01:48:50,158 --> 01:48:58,759
uh uh it is you know it all the trace

2341
01:48:54,560 --> 01:49:02,039
elements with the microe elements yeah

2342
01:48:58,760 --> 01:49:04,679
mcro elements is NPK this is the macro

2343
01:49:02,039 --> 01:49:08,238
elements the micro elements is calcium

2344
01:49:04,679 --> 01:49:11,319
magnesium iron uh yeah and then you have

2345
01:49:08,238 --> 01:49:15,359
this zinc and Al all the trays but the

2346
01:49:11,319 --> 01:49:18,118
trays is so important for the mom heal

2347
01:49:15,359 --> 01:49:20,679
that normally you have to give her a

2348
01:49:18,118 --> 01:49:23,479
decent amount of those stuff every 14

2349
01:49:20,679 --> 01:49:26,480
days when she's getting older because if

2350
01:49:23,479 --> 01:49:29,359
you don't do that she cannot eat

2351
01:49:26,479 --> 01:49:32,799
anything else she cannot if she doesn't

2352
01:49:29,359 --> 01:49:36,519
have this she cannot eat the phosphorus

2353
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:39,119
and nitrogen and [ __ ] and nothing she she

2354
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:40,880
will lock you will lock it down you will

2355
01:49:39,118 --> 01:49:43,679
add the the nitrogen but she will not

2356
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:47,560
eat it so you found that with your mom's

2357
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:49,520
the the limiting factors are usually the

2358
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:51,320
micro elements rather than the macro

2359
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:53,080
elements you feel as though you can you

2360
01:49:51,319 --> 01:49:55,399
can provide a steady amount of macro

2361
01:49:53,079 --> 01:49:57,920
elements to them but by increasing the

2362
01:49:55,399 --> 01:50:01,000
micro elements you sustain Healthy

2363
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:05,118
Growth over a longer period of time yeah

2364
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:08,800
cuz you keep keep up the you keep uh you

2365
01:50:05,118 --> 01:50:12,079
unlock uh because if you don't have the

2366
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:14,599
micro elements the mcro elements are not

2367
01:50:12,079 --> 01:50:16,599
available to the plant sure yeah it's

2368
01:50:14,599 --> 01:50:19,920
just limiting the whole like rabisco

2369
01:50:16,599 --> 01:50:21,960
cycle and absolutely a chain yeah

2370
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:25,560
absolutely well you know that's that's

2371
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:28,639
super fascinating cuz I um we we've just

2372
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:30,840
kind of slowly increased the EC of our

2373
01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:33,199
mother feed over time because we've just

2374
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:37,199
found that in because we we're under

2375
01:50:33,198 --> 01:50:39,598
LEDs for all of our plants indoors and

2376
01:50:37,198 --> 01:50:41,279
once we reached the certain level the

2377
01:50:39,599 --> 01:50:44,719
limiting factor seemed to always be the

2378
01:50:41,279 --> 01:50:48,118
nutrient load because we had like high

2379
01:50:44,719 --> 01:50:51,840
ppfd really nice uh vapor pressure

2380
01:50:48,118 --> 01:50:55,439
deficit um air flow was great high CO2

2381
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:57,639
levels when needed um and so we just we

2382
01:50:55,439 --> 01:50:59,319
like well they just need more food and

2383
01:50:57,639 --> 01:51:03,800
we've now gone all the way up to I think

2384
01:50:59,319 --> 01:51:05,960
it's like 3.8 to 4.0 EC on our on our

2385
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:07,960
mother feed and they're just healthi as

2386
01:51:05,960 --> 01:51:12,279
can be flowering right yeah no no no

2387
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:14,960
just on the mothers for ineng w very

2388
01:51:12,279 --> 01:51:18,078
because they we just get these super

2389
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:20,760
thick piy stems now where there's you

2390
01:51:18,078 --> 01:51:23,118
know there's no Hollow stems and I know

2391
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:24,920
that's a whole debate Within the the

2392
01:51:23,118 --> 01:51:27,359
Cannabis scene as well as Hollow stems

2393
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:29,399
versus non Hollow problem to to root

2394
01:51:27,359 --> 01:51:31,198
definitely Hollow stems are are a

2395
01:51:29,399 --> 01:51:32,519
problem in general because it just means

2396
01:51:31,198 --> 01:51:34,598
that you're missing something in the

2397
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:36,400
overall plant food there's there's no

2398
01:51:34,599 --> 01:51:38,078
benefit to the plant to having a hollow

2399
01:51:36,399 --> 01:51:39,879
stem people will be like oh it's a it's

2400
01:51:38,078 --> 01:51:41,599
a nutrient straw they're they're just

2401
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:44,800
stucking water up that's not where the

2402
01:51:41,599 --> 01:51:48,319
water goes no uh Nick we call also it's

2403
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:50,800
like a hemp tra we call it the hemp tra

2404
01:51:48,319 --> 01:51:53,039
hemp plants make that right because

2405
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:55,239
that's which which is cannabis but

2406
01:51:53,039 --> 01:51:57,479
but hemp we don't like to have it hemp

2407
01:51:55,238 --> 01:51:59,118
way you know no well cuz like the Flo

2408
01:51:57,479 --> 01:52:01,319
and xylm right those are going to be

2409
01:51:59,118 --> 01:52:03,399
contained within the outer part of the

2410
01:52:01,319 --> 01:52:05,639
stock of the plant whereas the inner

2411
01:52:03,399 --> 01:52:06,879
pith is just kind of like the bones if

2412
01:52:05,639 --> 01:52:08,760
you think about it right it's just

2413
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:11,078
building structure so that the plant can

2414
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:13,880
hold itself up so if you want healthy

2415
01:52:11,078 --> 01:52:16,519
plants in flower or in veg you want a

2416
01:52:13,880 --> 01:52:18,319
lot of of pith in it but if you're you

2417
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:19,760
know growing for fiber alone then yeah

2418
01:52:18,319 --> 01:52:22,158
you don't want pith you want it to put

2419
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:25,880
all that energy into fast vertical

2420
01:52:22,158 --> 01:52:28,839
upward growth all in the syum and flum

2421
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:31,440
um so yeah I've heard that before that

2422
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:34,360
it is a hemp trait and that it you know

2423
01:52:31,439 --> 01:52:36,559
if we're looking for drug cannabis then

2424
01:52:34,359 --> 01:52:39,319
hemp traits aren't necessarily what you

2425
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:43,639
want to be promoting and one secret uh

2426
01:52:39,319 --> 01:52:47,399
wolf one secret is if you pick males and

2427
01:52:43,639 --> 01:52:50,920
Gabby would disagree now but I it's my

2428
01:52:47,399 --> 01:52:53,279
version if you pick males never pick the

2429
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:58,440
first flowering ones because they carry

2430
01:52:53,279 --> 01:53:01,238
a hemp trade interesting yes don't it it

2431
01:52:58,439 --> 01:53:03,238
will not people say like yeah the the

2432
01:53:01,238 --> 01:53:06,399
faster flowering males will be the

2433
01:53:03,238 --> 01:53:08,598
faster flowering females it's not right

2434
01:53:06,399 --> 01:53:10,000
it's not it has nothing to do with that

2435
01:53:08,599 --> 01:53:12,639
that's so funny it will not it will not

2436
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:16,279
relate you can have a late flowering

2437
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:18,199
mail which will be much more drug tra

2438
01:53:16,279 --> 01:53:20,319
but that's fascinating I've never heard

2439
01:53:18,198 --> 01:53:23,279
that as a drug versus hemp trait I've

2440
01:53:20,319 --> 01:53:25,198
heard it as a uh potential for interex

2441
01:53:23,279 --> 01:53:27,639
trait where if you choose males that

2442
01:53:25,198 --> 01:53:30,399
flower too early it means that they

2443
01:53:27,639 --> 01:53:33,920
really want to show that as well yeah

2444
01:53:30,399 --> 01:53:36,839
yeah but but Nick interex trades are

2445
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:39,840
actually hemp trades also because sure

2446
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:42,159
interex trades are wanted in the hemp

2447
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:43,760
industry right you just need to produce

2448
01:53:42,158 --> 01:53:46,960
uh homogeneous crop so if there's

2449
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:50,119
intersex traits that means that it's no

2450
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:51,800
longer what dious right it's it's almost

2451
01:53:50,118 --> 01:53:53,238
more manous at that point so it's going

2452
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:54,880
to be very

2453
01:53:53,238 --> 01:53:56,759
production you know you have it all in

2454
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:58,599
one plant you have the male and female

2455
01:53:56,760 --> 01:54:00,440
parts on one plant you have it seeded

2456
01:53:58,599 --> 01:54:02,159
already you can drive through the

2457
01:54:00,439 --> 01:54:04,399
machine through it and you harvest it

2458
01:54:02,158 --> 01:54:07,000
and you have seeds that's it that's

2459
01:54:04,399 --> 01:54:09,479
industry yeah y so but we don't we are

2460
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:13,158
not industry we are craft so so this

2461
01:54:09,479 --> 01:54:15,198
craf thing is let's let's uh I I can

2462
01:54:13,158 --> 01:54:18,519
just tell people that if they looking

2463
01:54:15,198 --> 01:54:21,479
for males from one line uh try to find

2464
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:24,360
the middle to late ones those are the

2465
01:54:21,479 --> 01:54:25,959
ones those are for sure yeah it's very

2466
01:54:24,359 --> 01:54:28,519
fascinating cuz I whenever I've looked

2467
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:31,560
for males I've always uh looked for the

2468
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:33,199
first flowers because I like to have the

2469
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:35,560
flower initiation happen early

2470
01:54:33,198 --> 01:54:39,039
especially if I'm going to grow outdoors

2471
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:41,800
in uh Northern latitude I want to make

2472
01:54:39,039 --> 01:54:43,639
sure that I have a fast initiation of

2473
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:45,199
flower so that I have a faster finish

2474
01:54:43,639 --> 01:54:48,800
potentially as long as I'm still

2475
01:54:45,198 --> 01:54:52,399
shooting for those um those traditional

2476
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:53,920
indica or like Himalayan Afghanistan VAR

2477
01:54:52,399 --> 01:54:57,158
Idols that are going to have a shorter

2478
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:58,319
flowering time um so that's really

2479
01:54:57,158 --> 01:55:00,638
fascinating I think it's really

2480
01:54:58,319 --> 01:55:02,920
interesting how everyone has their

2481
01:55:00,639 --> 01:55:05,560
unique approach to what males they look

2482
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:08,199
for I I will not tell that I'm right you

2483
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:11,079
know this is not this is but this is my

2484
01:55:08,198 --> 01:55:13,158
theory only I I'm in love with cannabis

2485
01:55:11,078 --> 01:55:15,960
like you are also and so sometimes it's

2486
01:55:13,158 --> 01:55:19,319
like people have too much of uh you know

2487
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:21,800
seriousness in Insight of like no you're

2488
01:55:19,319 --> 01:55:23,519
not right and you know he hates you now

2489
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:26,119
and

2490
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:29,400
man I don't hate nobody it's like it's

2491
01:55:26,118 --> 01:55:31,679
it's up to the person how you approach a

2492
01:55:29,399 --> 01:55:34,039
thing and what is your own experience

2493
01:55:31,679 --> 01:55:35,679
with it you know why I would lie now

2494
01:55:34,039 --> 01:55:39,000
here to you you know it's like

2495
01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:41,359
absolutely I don't care about you know

2496
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:43,679
how much anybody hates me now because I

2497
01:55:41,359 --> 01:55:47,000
said something that he's not uh agreeing

2498
01:55:43,679 --> 01:55:49,480
with but I like to have kind of people

2499
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:51,319
also to be invited into the show to have

2500
01:55:49,479 --> 01:55:53,439
a different opinion than me that would

2501
01:55:51,319 --> 01:55:55,719
be great you know I

2502
01:55:53,439 --> 01:55:57,799
like if we all had the same opinion it

2503
01:55:55,719 --> 01:56:00,399
would be an echo chamber we don't need

2504
01:55:57,800 --> 01:56:02,239
that we don't need the Yes man you know

2505
01:56:00,399 --> 01:56:03,598
always say you say something and I say

2506
01:56:02,238 --> 01:56:06,118
yes

2507
01:56:03,599 --> 01:56:08,159
yes there would be no conversation you

2508
01:56:06,118 --> 01:56:10,479
know and honestly like I don't even look

2509
01:56:08,158 --> 01:56:12,118
at flowering times as my first indicator

2510
01:56:10,479 --> 01:56:14,439
of a male when I'm looking for it I'm

2511
01:56:12,118 --> 01:56:17,719
looking at structure you know I want I

2512
01:56:14,439 --> 01:56:21,118
want healthy side branches big vigorous

2513
01:56:17,719 --> 01:56:25,480
you know giant leaves healthy green

2514
01:56:21,118 --> 01:56:26,639
growth all on my uniform uh feeding

2515
01:56:25,479 --> 01:56:28,638
schedule you know I'm not going to

2516
01:56:26,639 --> 01:56:30,000
change something for one male or another

2517
01:56:28,639 --> 01:56:35,520
I'm going to be like which one does the

2518
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:37,479
best at this standard um it's is UN

2519
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:40,199
sometimes it's this theme R you know I

2520
01:56:37,479 --> 01:56:42,919
choose between I had to choose sometimes

2521
01:56:40,198 --> 01:56:46,319
between two you know I I Pinn it down

2522
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:48,960
already to two males and then I had to

2523
01:56:46,319 --> 01:56:51,479
choose one of those males you know how

2524
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:53,679
how the the last thing that I did

2525
01:56:51,479 --> 01:56:56,000
because sniff it or everything what you

2526
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:59,118
said now is was there with those two

2527
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:01,158
Mals but then how how it's like rob it

2528
01:56:59,118 --> 01:57:03,238
Rob it Rob it smell it smell smell it

2529
01:57:01,158 --> 01:57:05,000
it's like this one or this one this one

2530
01:57:03,238 --> 01:57:08,000
or this one yeah it's going to be this

2531
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:09,439
one and that's it you know and then it's

2532
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,760
funny because the next year you might

2533
01:57:09,439 --> 01:57:13,039
have had a different a different choice

2534
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:14,560
because your pallets going to change

2535
01:57:13,039 --> 01:57:16,719
maybe next day would have a different

2536
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:18,599
choice you know cuz maybe you were not

2537
01:57:16,719 --> 01:57:21,399
smelling that right that day you know

2538
01:57:18,599 --> 01:57:24,000
that's like but some do you think that

2539
01:57:21,399 --> 01:57:26,279
people that are uh high class breeders

2540
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:30,039
today that all of these people are able

2541
01:57:26,279 --> 01:57:33,198
to just find males like that you know no

2542
01:57:30,039 --> 01:57:36,000
it's like I don't think so no it's like

2543
01:57:33,198 --> 01:57:38,359
it it is like you know nobody can really

2544
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:41,078
tell I would just say like that nobody

2545
01:57:38,359 --> 01:57:44,039
can really tell and uh people should try

2546
01:57:41,078 --> 01:57:46,880
try it out why not you

2547
01:57:44,039 --> 01:57:49,319
know even now that I said the early had

2548
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:51,920
warn that they don't should be used use

2549
01:57:49,319 --> 01:57:54,880
it now so you will see and you can go

2550
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:56,679
and [ __ ] me up you know like say Sasha

2551
01:57:54,880 --> 01:57:58,760
you were so wrong when you told this

2552
01:57:56,679 --> 01:58:00,560
look I got this Elite clone now from

2553
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:03,000
that male that was too early you know

2554
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:05,079
look how nice this plant is yeah that's

2555
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:06,639
funny I mean it it is something where

2556
01:58:05,078 --> 01:58:08,158
people have to have their own experience

2557
01:58:06,639 --> 01:58:09,520
to make their opinion on something like

2558
01:58:08,158 --> 01:58:10,759
that and you know you have your

2559
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:12,320
experience that's why you have your

2560
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:14,119
opinion I have my experience that's why

2561
01:58:12,319 --> 01:58:15,880
I have my opinion but it's not like

2562
01:58:14,118 --> 01:58:17,598
either one of them is correct or wrong

2563
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:21,639
or you know it's it's just our own

2564
01:58:17,599 --> 01:58:25,039
opinions right yes yes definitely so you

2565
01:58:21,639 --> 01:58:27,719
know since you you know you've grown for

2566
01:58:25,039 --> 01:58:30,639
I don't know more than 20 years right

2567
01:58:27,719 --> 01:58:36,520
you've uh done outdoor crops indoor

2568
01:58:30,639 --> 01:58:38,480
crops pivoted into a um a clone company

2569
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:40,639
from where you were making you know your

2570
01:58:38,479 --> 01:58:42,000
own flour for your own consumption so

2571
01:58:40,639 --> 01:58:43,480
you've seen a lot of the different

2572
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:46,238
aspects of the industry especially

2573
01:58:43,479 --> 01:58:48,598
working with these European European

2574
01:58:46,238 --> 01:58:51,158
Standard committees that require you to

2575
01:58:48,599 --> 01:58:53,239
have uh you know one set of standards

2576
01:58:51,158 --> 01:58:54,679
for one country that shipping to another

2577
01:58:53,238 --> 01:58:56,439
set of standards for another country

2578
01:58:54,679 --> 01:58:58,158
that you're shipping to so you have to

2579
01:58:56,439 --> 01:58:59,638
tie all those together and make your own

2580
01:58:58,158 --> 01:59:02,000
set of Standards to make sure that

2581
01:58:59,639 --> 01:59:03,639
you're compliant you know you you have a

2582
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:05,439
lot of experience witnessing these

2583
01:59:03,639 --> 01:59:07,279
different sides of the industry and we

2584
01:59:05,439 --> 01:59:08,960
didn't even get into it on this podcast

2585
01:59:07,279 --> 01:59:10,599
but from previous episodes that we've

2586
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:14,198
had you on you know we know that you

2587
01:59:10,599 --> 01:59:17,480
travel to events like spannabis or the

2588
01:59:14,198 --> 01:59:18,598
um the German uh cannabis Exposition all

2589
01:59:17,479 --> 01:59:21,039
these

2590
01:59:18,599 --> 01:59:22,760
different uh all these different things

2591
01:59:21,039 --> 01:59:26,479
that you've seen that you've had

2592
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:27,840
experience with makes you I feel like I

2593
01:59:26,479 --> 01:59:30,359
I always say this but it makes you a

2594
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:32,639
great person to ask this question where

2595
01:59:30,359 --> 01:59:36,118
do you want to see the Cannabis industry

2596
01:59:32,639 --> 01:59:39,000
go over the next 5 to 10 years and let's

2597
01:59:36,118 --> 01:59:42,118
make it more specific about your area

2598
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:44,118
not necessarily on a global uh stage but

2599
01:59:42,118 --> 01:59:45,639
like within your Market what would you

2600
01:59:44,118 --> 01:59:48,519
like to see change or where would you

2601
01:59:45,639 --> 01:59:51,279
like to see it go I would definitely

2602
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:52,679
like to see it being decriminalized you

2603
01:59:51,279 --> 01:59:55,439
know

2604
01:59:52,679 --> 01:59:58,639
uh I you know in Austria where I have

2605
01:59:55,439 --> 02:00:00,638
this business is still illegal uh in my

2606
01:59:58,639 --> 02:00:03,480
country where I live it's absolutely

2607
02:00:00,639 --> 02:00:07,000
illegal everything even clones are not

2608
02:00:03,479 --> 02:00:10,319
allowed to do you can only grow hemp

2609
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:11,719
yeah but the thing is uh the industry as

2610
02:00:10,319 --> 02:00:15,439
itself you

2611
02:00:11,719 --> 02:00:18,520
know my problem with it is that

2612
02:00:15,439 --> 02:00:21,399
um the big players will take over you

2613
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:24,360
know like there will be no this kind of

2614
02:00:21,399 --> 02:00:27,198
I My Wish would be to have a craft uh

2615
02:00:24,359 --> 02:00:30,519
flower dispensary you know one day you

2616
02:00:27,198 --> 02:00:33,359
know behind what I do as a business of

2617
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:36,679
my library that all of this Library

2618
02:00:33,359 --> 02:00:39,359
would be available to people that come

2619
02:00:36,679 --> 02:00:42,399
to my place like all of these clones are

2620
02:00:39,359 --> 02:00:45,598
also in flower form here and with good

2621
02:00:42,399 --> 02:00:48,118
wine and good beer and something to eat

2622
02:00:45,599 --> 02:00:50,279
you know right and like a touristic

2623
02:00:48,118 --> 02:00:53,238
stuff you know like Spa think you know

2624
02:00:50,279 --> 02:00:55,078
like enjoy your life think yeah uh but

2625
02:00:53,238 --> 02:01:00,039
industry as itself I would like to see

2626
02:00:55,078 --> 02:01:03,960
it to be decriminalized in the sense so

2627
02:01:00,039 --> 02:01:08,158
to be to be able to grow your own wheat

2628
02:01:03,960 --> 02:01:12,078
at home for your personal use and then

2629
02:01:08,158 --> 02:01:15,759
the industry that uh would allow people

2630
02:01:12,078 --> 02:01:18,920
from all kind of you know areas to join

2631
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:21,119
it which will not be possible actually I

2632
02:01:18,920 --> 02:01:23,319
know this is all like this is all like

2633
02:01:21,118 --> 02:01:26,719
fairy tals what I tell now what the

2634
02:01:23,319 --> 02:01:30,439
corporations are taking over it's like

2635
02:01:26,719 --> 02:01:32,800
here like even more than us Market it

2636
02:01:30,439 --> 02:01:35,919
here is even more specific they don't

2637
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:38,400
even want the people to to to to get

2638
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:40,560
access you know like they they want

2639
02:01:38,399 --> 02:01:44,359
straight to the

2640
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:47,119
hardcore pharmaceutical wheat and it's

2641
02:01:44,359 --> 02:01:50,238
there is no social clubs there is no uh

2642
02:01:47,118 --> 02:01:52,679
coffee shops there is no uh hom growing

2643
02:01:50,238 --> 02:01:55,598
there is no you can just buy it you know

2644
02:01:52,679 --> 02:01:58,118
for big money you know y but actually

2645
02:01:55,599 --> 02:02:00,639
it's so problem that uh people grow it

2646
02:01:58,118 --> 02:02:03,439
already so much and it's so embedded

2647
02:02:00,639 --> 02:02:07,279
into the culture already that is

2648
02:02:03,439 --> 02:02:09,598
actually then it's even more uh you know

2649
02:02:07,279 --> 02:02:13,000
the citizen will even more protest and

2650
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:15,679
even more he will be self sufficient you

2651
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:19,238
know he will even more try to get his

2652
02:02:15,679 --> 02:02:22,760
own good stuff so because hom Growers

2653
02:02:19,238 --> 02:02:25,039
will always produce better weed than the

2654
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:27,800
industry remember that that is with

2655
02:02:25,039 --> 02:02:30,118
tomatoes the same thing sure yeah

2656
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:32,199
tomatoes from your own garden will

2657
02:02:30,118 --> 02:02:35,118
always taste better than the one from

2658
02:02:32,198 --> 02:02:38,638
from Supermarket absolutely it is the

2659
02:02:35,118 --> 02:02:42,039
same analogy actually it is very simple

2660
02:02:38,639 --> 02:02:45,159
yeah the industry will the industry

2661
02:02:42,039 --> 02:02:48,439
beside us you know it will if it start

2662
02:02:45,158 --> 02:02:50,879
to legalize here then after few years

2663
02:02:48,439 --> 02:02:53,960
like Kevin JRE already told and I agree

2664
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:57,960
with him that you US market will come

2665
02:02:53,960 --> 02:03:01,039
here absolutely it we we we stand no

2666
02:02:57,960 --> 02:03:05,118
chance here against your Market we have

2667
02:03:01,039 --> 02:03:07,118
we have no chance but we can have little

2668
02:03:05,118 --> 02:03:10,198
islands of

2669
02:03:07,118 --> 02:03:12,920
craft Productions that will be

2670
02:03:10,198 --> 02:03:16,238
maintained I can tell you this until I

2671
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:18,920
leave I I will maintain this but uh this

2672
02:03:16,238 --> 02:03:21,799
will be something interesting yeah but

2673
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:24,000
it's not for the masses like good news

2674
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:26,800
music was not for the masses in the

2675
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:29,118
beginning right you know but then the

2676
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:32,520
people realize the truth and then again

2677
02:03:29,118 --> 02:03:35,319
we come back to you know it's history

2678
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:37,440
repeats itself again yeah right I

2679
02:03:35,319 --> 02:03:40,359
couldn't agree more I feel like there's

2680
02:03:37,439 --> 02:03:41,879
just too much stigma still and we need

2681
02:03:40,359 --> 02:03:44,519
to be able to break that down a little

2682
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:48,800
bit podcasts like this help because we

2683
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:52,920
provide a more uh more insight to just

2684
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:54,920
each of Our Lives how we go about

2685
02:03:52,920 --> 02:03:58,039
you know promoting this plant caring for

2686
02:03:54,920 --> 02:04:01,319
this plant uh producing this plant and

2687
02:03:58,039 --> 02:04:02,760
you know I feel every day brother and

2688
02:04:01,319 --> 02:04:05,000
there is so many people that still look

2689
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:07,679
at it as this criminal activity but

2690
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:09,880
normalizing the conversation like this

2691
02:04:07,679 --> 02:04:12,000
is very important because we allow for

2692
02:04:09,880 --> 02:04:15,760
people to see that these are just two

2693
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:20,439
people out there growing you know clones

2694
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:22,360
for you flower for me all the like we're

2695
02:04:20,439 --> 02:04:23,719
just doing it right that's it's nothing

2696
02:04:22,359 --> 02:04:25,639
it's not that big of a deal it's just

2697
02:04:23,719 --> 02:04:27,920
like any other any other crop and we're

2698
02:04:25,639 --> 02:04:31,520
trying to make sure that our what we're

2699
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:33,679
making is not I don't know if we want to

2700
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:35,360
say it's the best but it's the best

2701
02:04:33,679 --> 02:04:39,279
version that we want to put out there

2702
02:04:35,359 --> 02:04:41,880
right and uh so I I do feel as though

2703
02:04:39,279 --> 02:04:44,000
you know a little bit more uh or a

2704
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:46,920
little yeah more decriminalization not

2705
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:50,279
necessarily legalization with standards

2706
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:52,840
and rules and laws let's be realistic

2707
02:04:50,279 --> 02:04:55,279
you know because

2708
02:04:52,840 --> 02:04:58,039
you know it's like legalize it yeah I I

2709
02:04:55,279 --> 02:05:02,158
I always lived like this you know but

2710
02:04:58,039 --> 02:05:04,960
now man after so many years of listening

2711
02:05:02,158 --> 02:05:08,479
to legalize it it's like hey first of

2712
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:10,520
all let's decriminalize it let's put a

2713
02:05:08,479 --> 02:05:12,359
foot in the door first right you know

2714
02:05:10,520 --> 02:05:15,360
what I mean it shouldn't be a question

2715
02:05:12,359 --> 02:05:17,399
of legality and illegality it's a plant

2716
02:05:15,359 --> 02:05:20,439
we should just be able to grow it you

2717
02:05:17,399 --> 02:05:23,839
know absolutely if if that's if if the

2718
02:05:20,439 --> 02:05:27,000
need is to make some sort of dichotomous

2719
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:29,400
key of legality versus illegality then

2720
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:32,479
we're already kind of fighting a losing

2721
02:05:29,399 --> 02:05:35,960
battle um at least that's how I I feel

2722
02:05:32,479 --> 02:05:39,238
about it me too man it's like I I've

2723
02:05:35,960 --> 02:05:42,840
been born into illegal Market already

2724
02:05:39,238 --> 02:05:46,359
and it was always illegal right so for

2725
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:48,039
my grandfathers maybe it was not but uh

2726
02:05:46,359 --> 02:05:51,679
that was in the beginning of the century

2727
02:05:48,039 --> 02:05:55,439
you know before it was illegal you know

2728
02:05:51,679 --> 02:06:00,039
Ed you know you know that uh that

2729
02:05:55,439 --> 02:06:03,319
footage of Henry Fort banging a hammer

2730
02:06:00,039 --> 02:06:06,118
on a on a Ford car have you saw that see

2731
02:06:03,319 --> 02:06:09,479
made of hemp yeah and that was before it

2732
02:06:06,118 --> 02:06:12,960
was illegal right because right after

2733
02:06:09,479 --> 02:06:16,238
that because he wanted to make cars bu

2734
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:20,359
built from hemp material uh fueled by

2735
02:06:16,238 --> 02:06:22,959
hemp fuel you know he was crazy guy and

2736
02:06:20,359 --> 02:06:27,078
uh actually the whole system you know

2737
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:31,760
Dupont came you know which made nylon

2738
02:06:27,078 --> 02:06:37,399
right nylon pent and Dupont sent Henry J

2739
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:39,520
anslinger to be the head of the daa

2740
02:06:37,399 --> 02:06:43,638
right what we know today is the the drug

2741
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:46,760
drug enforcement agency right and Henry

2742
02:06:43,639 --> 02:06:49,279
J hensinger is the guy and his people

2743
02:06:46,760 --> 02:06:52,159
that actually turned cannabis into this

2744
02:06:49,279 --> 02:06:55,238
kind of stuff that we know today right y

2745
02:06:52,158 --> 02:06:59,279
absolutely very and but behind him is

2746
02:06:55,238 --> 02:07:02,839
Dupont and Dupont is the corporation

2747
02:06:59,279 --> 02:07:05,319
that owns the pent on nylon which is

2748
02:07:02,840 --> 02:07:08,960
plastic right and they didn't want to

2749
02:07:05,319 --> 02:07:12,319
have uh hemp Plastics no at at that

2750
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:16,480
moment we lost the war we lost the war

2751
02:07:12,319 --> 02:07:19,920
because nylon was created and destroyed

2752
02:07:16,479 --> 02:07:23,399
our planet our o oceans are are polluted

2753
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:27,279
with it instead of hemp Plastics which

2754
02:07:23,399 --> 02:07:30,799
would be the second option and we [ __ ]

2755
02:07:27,279 --> 02:07:32,920
we [ __ ] up it is interesting to look

2756
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:34,559
back at history and see these inflection

2757
02:07:32,920 --> 02:07:37,239
points where something changed and

2758
02:07:34,559 --> 02:07:40,079
you're like it could have been different

2759
02:07:37,238 --> 02:07:42,399
You Know Jack herrer was the guy that

2760
02:07:40,078 --> 02:07:45,039
came up with the video you saw that H

2761
02:07:42,399 --> 02:07:49,439
for victory it is a video that he

2762
02:07:45,039 --> 02:07:52,039
actually get from some some archives and

2763
02:07:49,439 --> 02:07:54,759
he released it as you know that can see

2764
02:07:52,039 --> 02:07:58,359
that in 199

2765
02:07:54,760 --> 02:08:02,239
1943 uh the government of USA legalized

2766
02:07:58,359 --> 02:08:05,839
hemp again like they really legalized

2767
02:08:02,238 --> 02:08:08,238
wheat just to make uh materials for for

2768
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:10,760
the Army you know again for the wars you

2769
02:08:08,238 --> 02:08:12,558
know I didn't know that yeah hemp for

2770
02:08:10,760 --> 02:08:15,119
victory that is Jack I have look I have

2771
02:08:12,559 --> 02:08:18,480
to look back into that yeah man hemp for

2772
02:08:15,118 --> 02:08:21,719
victory you will see it's a they it was

2773
02:08:18,479 --> 02:08:23,439
illegal wheat was illegal for 1925 or

2774
02:08:21,719 --> 02:08:27,078
something like that right

2775
02:08:23,439 --> 02:08:30,319
1926 and then it was legal between

2776
02:08:27,078 --> 02:08:30,319
1943 and

2777
02:08:30,439 --> 02:08:39,839
1945 yeah for production of of uh fiber

2778
02:08:36,439 --> 02:08:43,919
for the Navy and for you know and it was

2779
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:45,760
that and and Jack found that video first

2780
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:47,559
they don't want to give him you know

2781
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:49,320
that would be a story man maybe somebody

2782
02:08:47,559 --> 02:08:52,279
in the community knows about this story

2783
02:08:49,319 --> 02:08:55,039
but I know as a Slovenian guy that I

2784
02:08:52,279 --> 02:08:58,198
know that this video this footage was

2785
02:08:55,039 --> 02:09:00,238
found by Jack and he released it and

2786
02:08:58,198 --> 02:09:02,719
first they didn't want to give it to him

2787
02:09:00,238 --> 02:09:04,399
and then he released it that that he

2788
02:09:02,719 --> 02:09:07,399
actually showed how corrupt the

2789
02:09:04,399 --> 02:09:10,399
government actually how hypocritic it is

2790
02:09:07,399 --> 02:09:13,000
to actually allow something in a certain

2791
02:09:10,399 --> 02:09:15,879
time and then forbid it again you know

2792
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:17,599
like they they did they make it illegal

2793
02:09:15,880 --> 02:09:19,760
then make it legal again then make it

2794
02:09:17,599 --> 02:09:21,960
illegal again and now make it legal

2795
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:24,760
again that's how it is

2796
02:09:21,960 --> 02:09:27,239
absolutely it's it's a giant hypocrisy

2797
02:09:24,760 --> 02:09:28,880
it's it's very frustrating at times you

2798
02:09:27,238 --> 02:09:32,519
know when you smoke your first joint you

2799
02:09:28,880 --> 02:09:36,679
know that y exactly I've seen those

2800
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:39,079
experiences happen real time um well

2801
02:09:36,679 --> 02:09:41,599
with again with all of your experience

2802
02:09:39,078 --> 02:09:43,558
uh one of the questions I do like to ask

2803
02:09:41,599 --> 02:09:45,440
is what would be some advice that you

2804
02:09:43,559 --> 02:09:47,520
would give to new Growers if there was

2805
02:09:45,439 --> 02:09:50,960
something like one little piece of

2806
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:53,760
advice that you think is uh up there

2807
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:56,359
amongst the highest value advice that

2808
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:59,079
could be given to a new grower uh to a

2809
02:09:56,359 --> 02:10:02,920
new grower now in this time I would that

2810
02:09:59,078 --> 02:10:06,039
my advice would be Google [ __ ] you know

2811
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:08,319
Google Google because at our time we

2812
02:10:06,039 --> 02:10:10,439
don't have Google we don't have the

2813
02:10:08,319 --> 02:10:13,479
internet we don't have no source of

2814
02:10:10,439 --> 02:10:16,519
information we had to make all the

2815
02:10:13,479 --> 02:10:19,638
mistakes you don't need to make all the

2816
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:23,920
mistakes right but be be patient and try

2817
02:10:19,639 --> 02:10:25,960
to to be focused on information not not

2818
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:28,679
try you know it's not the way that

2819
02:10:25,960 --> 02:10:32,480
everything should be thrown at you and

2820
02:10:28,679 --> 02:10:35,719
then you have to absorb information like

2821
02:10:32,479 --> 02:10:38,359
what you know of course plant seeds yeah

2822
02:10:35,719 --> 02:10:40,520
and then of course try it yeah and also

2823
02:10:38,359 --> 02:10:43,598
not only cannabis try to grow your own

2824
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:46,280
food that would be my advice also it's

2825
02:10:43,599 --> 02:10:47,960
it's all the same thing yeah just get

2826
02:10:46,279 --> 02:10:49,800
into the garden start doing it get into

2827
02:10:47,960 --> 02:10:52,359
the garden start also if you're living

2828
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:53,800
in big cities no problem have a balcony

2829
02:10:52,359 --> 02:10:57,000
if you don't have a balcony you have a

2830
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:59,800
you have a on the south side of the if

2831
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:02,679
you have a southide window you can plant

2832
02:10:59,800 --> 02:11:05,880
anything just do it it's so beneficial

2833
02:11:02,679 --> 02:11:07,599
for you it's a it's for the mind you

2834
02:11:05,880 --> 02:11:09,039
know we are built for that you know I

2835
02:11:07,599 --> 02:11:11,319
know that one thing people don't think

2836
02:11:09,039 --> 02:11:13,519
about especially when it's just like

2837
02:11:11,319 --> 02:11:16,719
those within the Cannabis Community is

2838
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:18,760
you can take your uh extra grow tent set

2839
02:11:16,719 --> 02:11:20,319
up and grow some Tomatoes or some

2840
02:11:18,760 --> 02:11:22,800
cucumbers or something else in there

2841
02:11:20,319 --> 02:11:25,198
it's yeah and you'd be surprised at how

2842
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:27,320
well it's going to grow uh oh yeah you

2843
02:11:25,198 --> 02:11:29,919
know it's going to cannabis is such a

2844
02:11:27,319 --> 02:11:32,279
heavy feeder that when you do something

2845
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:34,158
you know a little a little easier like a

2846
02:11:32,279 --> 02:11:36,238
a cucumber like a lemon cucumber or

2847
02:11:34,158 --> 02:11:38,399
something that just grows very

2848
02:11:36,238 --> 02:11:40,759
vigorously and prolifically you're going

2849
02:11:38,399 --> 02:11:42,399
to not know what to do with all of that

2850
02:11:40,760 --> 02:11:44,760
all those cucumbers all those Tomatoes

2851
02:11:42,399 --> 02:11:46,719
or Peppers you know definitely and it

2852
02:11:44,760 --> 02:11:49,639
can be like a whole another uh outlet

2853
02:11:46,719 --> 02:11:51,800
for the hobby if if it is like a a homeg

2854
02:11:49,639 --> 02:11:54,199
growing hobby that you're developing and

2855
02:11:51,800 --> 02:11:56,800
so yeah just start growing something

2856
02:11:54,198 --> 02:12:00,000
it's not that hard and it it's really

2857
02:11:56,800 --> 02:12:03,239
rewarding it is for the for the mental

2858
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:06,158
thing we need we need this as people we

2859
02:12:03,238 --> 02:12:10,158
it is we are connected to this stuff so

2860
02:12:06,158 --> 02:12:13,598
long absolutely yeah I wish everybody

2861
02:12:10,158 --> 02:12:16,839
that uh you know you know we don't live

2862
02:12:13,599 --> 02:12:19,520
in very easy times you know it's a lot

2863
02:12:16,840 --> 02:12:22,639
of things are going on in the world and

2864
02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:27,199
we will not get into it now me and Nick

2865
02:12:22,639 --> 02:12:30,319
and uh it's like we all should be aware

2866
02:12:27,198 --> 02:12:32,399
that your your neighbor is your brother

2867
02:12:30,319 --> 02:12:34,679
don't treat him as somebody because

2868
02:12:32,399 --> 02:12:37,598
maybe will be a situation that you will

2869
02:12:34,679 --> 02:12:40,520
need your neighbor you know don't be

2870
02:12:37,599 --> 02:12:42,559
don't be like stop born and look just

2871
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:46,440
like that in your life money is not

2872
02:12:42,559 --> 02:12:48,840
everything yeah you should actually uh

2873
02:12:46,439 --> 02:12:51,879
human relations are much more wor than

2874
02:12:48,840 --> 02:12:54,000
anything yeah y absolutely that's a I

2875
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:57,078
mean that's a great sentiment to sort of

2876
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:58,880
wrap up the podcast on um I do have a

2877
02:12:57,078 --> 02:13:01,479
couple of last minute questions that I

2878
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:03,639
like to ask uh and I feel like you might

2879
02:13:01,479 --> 02:13:05,198
have heard them before from me so we'll

2880
02:13:03,639 --> 02:13:08,520
just get right into them but what is

2881
02:13:05,198 --> 02:13:08,519
your favorite strain of all

2882
02:13:09,359 --> 02:13:12,679
time well

2883
02:13:12,719 --> 02:13:18,559
[ __ ] [ __ ] as a librar and you have too

2884
02:13:16,118 --> 02:13:22,238
many options I'm sure it's a pro yeah

2885
02:13:18,559 --> 02:13:25,159
that's a big problem uh one of those

2886
02:13:22,238 --> 02:13:28,479
would be the headband and one of those

2887
02:13:25,158 --> 02:13:31,279
would be the the super silver haze man

2888
02:13:28,479 --> 02:13:33,678
that are so very different strains right

2889
02:13:31,279 --> 02:13:36,198
that's so funny that you said that cuz

2890
02:13:33,679 --> 02:13:39,199
headband uh is my partner's favorite

2891
02:13:36,198 --> 02:13:41,399
strain and Super Silver Haze is the

2892
02:13:39,198 --> 02:13:44,759
first strain we ever smoked

2893
02:13:41,399 --> 02:13:48,279
together so the odds that those are your

2894
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:51,239
two favorite strains is really

2895
02:13:48,279 --> 02:13:54,359
funny yeah but they are combining the

2896
02:13:51,238 --> 02:14:00,238
the thing about kab is what I really

2897
02:13:54,359 --> 02:14:05,799
love the energetic racy sativas and the

2898
02:14:00,238 --> 02:14:07,638
head stone couch lock body like like

2899
02:14:05,800 --> 02:14:10,679
golf ball

2900
02:14:07,639 --> 02:14:13,078
smell you know like I'm not really

2901
02:14:10,679 --> 02:14:15,359
really into skunks you know I was and

2902
02:14:13,078 --> 02:14:19,679
skunks are okay

2903
02:14:15,359 --> 02:14:21,679
but it's not my thing I mean you know I

2904
02:14:19,679 --> 02:14:24,078
always like

2905
02:14:21,679 --> 02:14:26,118
do you like uh you know how the market

2906
02:14:24,078 --> 02:14:28,840
has kind of changed into this whole like

2907
02:14:26,118 --> 02:14:31,118
purple candy gas thing where that's all

2908
02:14:28,840 --> 02:14:32,880
the people want I am one of I feel like

2909
02:14:31,118 --> 02:14:35,158
I'm one of the few people that has no

2910
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:37,639
problem with that because you know if

2911
02:14:35,158 --> 02:14:40,679
it's sweet and gassy all at the same

2912
02:14:37,639 --> 02:14:42,078
time that sounds delicious and oh yeah

2913
02:14:40,679 --> 02:14:44,760
the fact that we're going for all this

2914
02:14:42,078 --> 02:14:46,880
photogenic quality to the the buds that

2915
02:14:44,760 --> 02:14:48,520
we're growing just makes it that much

2916
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:51,279
more enjoyable cuz there's always a

2917
02:14:48,520 --> 02:14:53,760
visual aspect of picking up up the

2918
02:14:51,279 --> 02:14:56,800
flower breaking it apart grinding it up

2919
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:59,159
rolling a joint looking at it you know

2920
02:14:56,800 --> 02:15:01,520
that's it's a whole part of the The

2921
02:14:59,158 --> 02:15:05,158
Experience one of my favorite smokes in

2922
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:07,159
the last uh time now is American cut

2923
02:15:05,158 --> 02:15:10,920
that I got from finest it is called

2924
02:15:07,158 --> 02:15:14,238
cross and it's uh Sunset sheret sherbet

2925
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:18,118
biscotti sunde cross sounds good and

2926
02:15:14,238 --> 02:15:21,238
it's like it's it's candy gassy which is

2927
02:15:18,118 --> 02:15:26,198
normally it's gassy but can it's very

2928
02:15:21,238 --> 02:15:28,759
fru sure very very like fruit it's un

2929
02:15:26,198 --> 02:15:29,960
unbelievable smoke yeah I I I do find it

2930
02:15:28,760 --> 02:15:32,199
really funny when people are like I

2931
02:15:29,960 --> 02:15:33,840
don't want that I want something you

2932
02:15:32,198 --> 02:15:37,319
know I want some old good green wheat

2933
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:39,000
I'm like feel free you know I don't I

2934
02:15:37,319 --> 02:15:42,639
don't mind that at all

2935
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:45,039
but the stuff is really tasty it is it

2936
02:15:42,639 --> 02:15:47,880
is but sometimes when you then get this

2937
02:15:45,039 --> 02:15:49,920
super silver haze again which is really

2938
02:15:47,880 --> 02:15:51,920
light like green you know like light

2939
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:53,520
green

2940
02:15:51,920 --> 02:15:56,078
and then you smoke that like it's like

2941
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:58,199
the instant somebody comes into the room

2942
02:15:56,078 --> 02:15:59,880
it will he will be like instantly you

2943
02:15:58,198 --> 02:16:02,598
were smoking the

2944
02:15:59,880 --> 02:16:04,239
Amnesia everybody here in this area they

2945
02:16:02,599 --> 02:16:08,078
will tell you it's

2946
02:16:04,238 --> 02:16:10,919
Amnesia uh Amnesia is super silver ha

2947
02:16:08,078 --> 02:16:13,719
that don't not many people know that but

2948
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:16,078
Amnesia is just a coffee shop name for

2949
02:16:13,719 --> 02:16:19,480
the wheat for sure there was there was

2950
02:16:16,078 --> 02:16:21,880
no Amnesia I mean s will be angry now if

2951
02:16:19,479 --> 02:16:25,359
if I tell it like this s released

2952
02:16:21,880 --> 02:16:27,639
Amnesia Haze but Amnesia ha is just a

2953
02:16:25,359 --> 02:16:30,399
super silver haze version I mean it's

2954
02:16:27,639 --> 02:16:33,359
super silver haze cross to some hazes

2955
02:16:30,399 --> 02:16:36,439
but it's the the super silver was always

2956
02:16:33,359 --> 02:16:40,760
shorter on the flowering time for hazes

2957
02:16:36,439 --> 02:16:43,280
because hazes go more than 13 weeks and

2958
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:46,359
the super silver hazes that we grew here

2959
02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:51,000
are like 10 weers

2960
02:16:46,359 --> 02:16:56,280
10 11 weeks maybe maybe

2961
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:59,760
nobody goes to 12 weeks yeah yeah here

2962
02:16:56,280 --> 02:17:02,519
some some some people do but in general

2963
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:06,200
people who grow for a market they they

2964
02:17:02,519 --> 02:17:08,120
use to if if they grow H they go for the

2965
02:17:06,200 --> 02:17:12,920
for the amnesia for the super silver

2966
02:17:08,120 --> 02:17:15,559
because it has this some even uh get it

2967
02:17:12,920 --> 02:17:17,638
in nine weeks you can put it on the

2968
02:17:15,558 --> 02:17:20,438
market in N weeks you can actually some

2969
02:17:17,638 --> 02:17:23,318
people will think that it's right cuz it

2970
02:17:20,439 --> 02:17:26,719
has that effect it has the quality but

2971
02:17:23,318 --> 02:17:30,558
if you go over 10 or 11 week you have

2972
02:17:26,718 --> 02:17:34,839
top shelf you know you have the that's

2973
02:17:30,558 --> 02:17:37,558
it and that is you know still long you

2974
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:39,719
know 10 or 11 weeks for uh for

2975
02:17:37,558 --> 02:17:42,879
commercial production is a problem yeah

2976
02:17:39,718 --> 02:17:46,159
yeah absolutely and you can't cuz it

2977
02:17:42,879 --> 02:17:48,518
like for the most part you can if you

2978
02:17:46,159 --> 02:17:50,159
produce really really nice sativa versus

2979
02:17:48,519 --> 02:17:51,599
really really nice indicia and just

2980
02:17:50,159 --> 02:17:55,799
using those terms terms as a

2981
02:17:51,599 --> 02:17:58,239
representation of the flowering time um

2982
02:17:55,799 --> 02:18:00,398
so like an 8 we versus a 12 week right

2983
02:17:58,239 --> 02:18:03,679
you can't then charge one and a half

2984
02:18:00,398 --> 02:18:07,879
times for the 12 week right if you're

2985
02:18:03,679 --> 02:18:11,920
getting $1,000 per kilo let's say right

2986
02:18:07,879 --> 02:18:13,920
mhm uh you can't then of of you know a

2987
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:15,398
runs or a candy or something like that

2988
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:16,920
right you then can't say well I have

2989
02:18:15,398 --> 02:18:20,239
this super silver haze that I grew for

2990
02:18:16,920 --> 02:18:22,000
12 weeks I want $1,500 per kilo no you

2991
02:18:20,239 --> 02:18:23,439
can do can't do that no no one's going

2992
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,959
to say oh it's worth that much more

2993
02:18:23,439 --> 02:18:26,280
because you grew it that much longer

2994
02:18:24,959 --> 02:18:29,039
they'll say this is still a pound of

2995
02:18:26,280 --> 02:18:31,359
weed I can only sell it for so much per

2996
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:32,880
gram right there is only you know in

2997
02:18:31,359 --> 02:18:36,079
this area here where we live in the

2998
02:18:32,879 --> 02:18:39,558
Balkans and Austria and here this areas

2999
02:18:36,079 --> 02:18:44,478
uh the Amnesia cut uh of they call it

3000
02:18:39,558 --> 02:18:46,638
the core cut core cut because a guy from

3001
02:18:44,478 --> 02:18:50,199
England named

3002
02:18:46,638 --> 02:18:53,279
core his his synonym on the Forum is

3003
02:18:50,200 --> 02:18:56,599
core mhm and he put out some

3004
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:58,880
Cuts that's why it's the core cut

3005
02:18:56,599 --> 02:19:02,398
because one guy named core put out the

3006
02:18:58,879 --> 02:19:05,438
cut so it's the Amnesia core cut which

3007
02:19:02,398 --> 02:19:08,358
is high pro seeds it's a Holland based

3008
02:19:05,439 --> 02:19:11,840
company but actually the genetics as

3009
02:19:08,359 --> 02:19:15,359
itself as a parental genome is the super

3010
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:17,960
silver H yeah yeah and basically just

3011
02:19:15,359 --> 02:19:22,359
super silver but they they they popped a

3012
02:19:17,959 --> 02:19:25,839
lot of seeds to get this 9 to 10 weaker

3013
02:19:22,359 --> 02:19:29,760
right phenotype which is so popular

3014
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:32,159
since 15 20 years it's around here wow

3015
02:19:29,760 --> 02:19:34,599
and yeah it's still it's still people

3016
02:19:32,159 --> 02:19:37,558
still grow that and uh it's still around

3017
02:19:34,599 --> 02:19:39,359
it's still sold in many shops uh but you

3018
02:19:37,558 --> 02:19:42,398
have to understand that this is a very

3019
02:19:39,359 --> 02:19:45,280
rare pheno type of super silver haze

3020
02:19:42,398 --> 02:19:48,478
it's very rare because normally it's

3021
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:51,399
it's very productive and very fast

3022
02:19:48,478 --> 02:19:53,358
finishing for us for a super silver sure

3023
02:19:51,398 --> 02:19:55,920
I mean normally the super silver ha will

3024
02:19:53,359 --> 02:20:00,040
give you in 12 or 13 weeks a product

3025
02:19:55,920 --> 02:20:02,600
like this one wow you know yeah it's

3026
02:20:00,040 --> 02:20:04,359
yeah I mean that's also why you can't

3027
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:05,600
change your your price per pound on

3028
02:20:04,359 --> 02:20:07,680
those things because no one's going to

3029
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:09,760
say oh like how prove it that you grew

3030
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:11,120
it for 12 weeks you know like I found

3031
02:20:09,760 --> 02:20:13,359
someone that grew this for nine weeks

3032
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:16,160
it's the same thing so why why

3033
02:20:13,359 --> 02:20:18,559
shoulds you know the col trains came and

3034
02:20:16,159 --> 02:20:20,680
they actually they dropped the the

3035
02:20:18,559 --> 02:20:23,799
production of Amnesia here this the

3036
02:20:20,680 --> 02:20:26,760
Shiva cut the the the the super silver

3037
02:20:23,799 --> 02:20:29,398
haze cut the super it's very it's grown

3038
02:20:26,760 --> 02:20:32,920
very very much less than it was before

3039
02:20:29,398 --> 02:20:34,680
just because of col Trends sure because

3040
02:20:32,920 --> 02:20:35,719
they took over the market here in the

3041
02:20:34,680 --> 02:20:38,800
last three

3042
02:20:35,719 --> 02:20:42,398
years it is the last two years it's

3043
02:20:38,799 --> 02:20:46,519
crazy 3 years ago it started the first

3044
02:20:42,398 --> 02:20:49,559
col STS came yeah and now it's like it's

3045
02:20:46,520 --> 02:20:51,520
going everywh yeah it's everywhere and

3046
02:20:49,559 --> 02:20:53,920
it's going to go back also

3047
02:20:51,520 --> 02:20:56,159
which is which is okay it's okay yeah

3048
02:20:53,920 --> 02:20:57,840
the market fluctuates it's you know the

3049
02:20:56,159 --> 02:20:59,239
the demand for what people want is all

3050
02:20:57,840 --> 02:21:01,000
based on what I feel like is

3051
02:20:59,239 --> 02:21:04,239
commercialized you know like what is

3052
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:07,280
popularized through Instagram or Reddit

3053
02:21:04,239 --> 02:21:09,359
or all these other different forums uh

3054
02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:12,399
or even you know in pop culture right

3055
02:21:09,359 --> 02:21:15,720
you can have a a uh an artist of some

3056
02:21:12,398 --> 02:21:17,920
band uh or or you know rap group or even

3057
02:21:15,719 --> 02:21:19,840
rock and roll just all these different

3058
02:21:17,920 --> 02:21:22,840
um music genres where well they'll

3059
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:24,439
mention some sort of cannabis strain in

3060
02:21:22,840 --> 02:21:25,920
their music because it's just what's

3061
02:21:24,439 --> 02:21:27,720
popular to them at the time and all of a

3062
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:29,280
sudden the demand for it goes up and

3063
02:21:27,719 --> 02:21:31,079
everyone's got to start producing that

3064
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:33,319
because there's just you know increased

3065
02:21:31,079 --> 02:21:35,398
demand within the market so it's it is a

3066
02:21:33,318 --> 02:21:38,478
Fickle market and it just it is going to

3067
02:21:35,398 --> 02:21:40,599
continue to fluctuate um and I think

3068
02:21:38,478 --> 02:21:44,358
that headband and Super Silver Haze are

3069
02:21:40,600 --> 02:21:45,800
also some of those uh you know they they

3070
02:21:44,359 --> 02:21:46,800
have a good foundation where I don't

3071
02:21:45,799 --> 02:21:48,119
think they're going to go anywhere

3072
02:21:46,799 --> 02:21:49,639
people are always going to want them

3073
02:21:48,120 --> 02:21:51,079
because they have good experiences with

3074
02:21:49,639 --> 02:21:52,680
them um

3075
02:21:51,079 --> 02:21:54,398
and so with those being your favorite

3076
02:21:52,680 --> 02:21:55,600
strains who would you say is your

3077
02:21:54,398 --> 02:21:58,358
favorite

3078
02:21:55,600 --> 02:22:01,079
breeder Shanti

3079
02:21:58,359 --> 02:22:02,318
Bobo right off the bat what uh what

3080
02:22:01,079 --> 02:22:06,239
makes him your favorite

3081
02:22:02,318 --> 02:22:09,760
breeder he's he's uh down to earth

3082
02:22:06,239 --> 02:22:12,478
mentality he's uh when you meet him you

3083
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:15,520
look him in the eye you ask a question

3084
02:22:12,478 --> 02:22:18,239
he will tell you straight away cool with

3085
02:22:15,520 --> 02:22:21,200
no with no

3086
02:22:18,239 --> 02:22:23,600
uh I mean I love this kind kind of

3087
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:25,720
persons you know down to earth so much

3088
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:28,000
and the accomplishment I mean there will

3089
02:22:25,719 --> 02:22:30,599
always be beefs again you know people

3090
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:33,398
will some people will don't like him or

3091
02:22:30,600 --> 02:22:37,520
something I don't care I met that guy

3092
02:22:33,398 --> 02:22:40,959
and I talked to him and uh I really

3093
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:43,840
loved the conversation really Co I mean

3094
02:22:40,959 --> 02:22:47,559
there is other there is others yeah but

3095
02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:49,960
straight away to say how much uh he is

3096
02:22:47,559 --> 02:22:53,239
influential to me and how much he has

3097
02:22:49,959 --> 02:22:55,519
done for the community and that he still

3098
02:22:53,239 --> 02:23:00,079
is producing keeping a low

3099
02:22:55,520 --> 02:23:03,840
profile uh and having uh much more love

3100
02:23:00,079 --> 02:23:07,318
for his family than his business yeah

3101
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:09,318
that is very impressive for sure I mean

3102
02:23:07,318 --> 02:23:12,478
sometimes you know breeding cannabis

3103
02:23:09,318 --> 02:23:14,680
isn't it isn't rocket science right you

3104
02:23:12,478 --> 02:23:16,639
know no you can just have a little

3105
02:23:14,680 --> 02:23:18,040
pollen chucking event and create some

3106
02:23:16,639 --> 02:23:20,239
seeds find something great and all of a

3107
02:23:18,040 --> 02:23:23,040
sudden you call yourself a breeder right

3108
02:23:20,239 --> 02:23:25,239
so so and you know they they they asked

3109
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:27,720
this Shanti you know they asked him few

3110
02:23:25,239 --> 02:23:29,199
years 10 years ago they asked him so

3111
02:23:27,719 --> 02:23:30,760
what are you doing because this time it

3112
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:32,800
was already you know Autoflower

3113
02:23:30,760 --> 02:23:34,840
feminized was taking over the market

3114
02:23:32,799 --> 02:23:36,679
everywhere and what are you doing what

3115
02:23:34,840 --> 02:23:38,920
are your new strains you know and he was

3116
02:23:36,680 --> 02:23:42,159
looking like that new trains you know

3117
02:23:38,920 --> 02:23:43,960
like I'm he did the CBD crew at that

3118
02:23:42,159 --> 02:23:46,959
time right he had some new trains but it

3119
02:23:43,959 --> 02:23:49,799
was really scientific based uh company

3120
02:23:46,959 --> 02:23:53,839
which produced CBD based trains one:1

3121
02:23:49,799 --> 02:23:56,519
ratios like 3 to1 ratio like really CBD

3122
02:23:53,840 --> 02:23:58,680
strains they produced it so he knows

3123
02:23:56,520 --> 02:24:01,720
about breeding right so when this guy

3124
02:23:58,680 --> 02:24:04,479
was asking about new strains he was like

3125
02:24:01,719 --> 02:24:08,760
same old story you know same old we we

3126
02:24:04,478 --> 02:24:11,119
do uh uh no feminize still and we we use

3127
02:24:08,760 --> 02:24:13,279
males and females you know so the old

3128
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:16,680
breathing techniques what we use you

3129
02:24:13,279 --> 02:24:18,880
know and that's that the base why why

3130
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:21,760
you know you know you have so much tools

3131
02:24:18,879 --> 02:24:24,398
now today Labs that can preest if it's

3132
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:26,559
male if it's female sex testing you have

3133
02:24:24,398 --> 02:24:30,278
carabin you have everything more

3134
02:24:26,559 --> 02:24:33,639
accessible today so why not stay on the

3135
02:24:30,279 --> 02:24:36,079
stable uh systems that provide good

3136
02:24:33,639 --> 02:24:38,920
stable genetics sure you know and

3137
02:24:36,079 --> 02:24:41,239
thentics to it just apply to analytics

3138
02:24:38,920 --> 02:24:44,079
for breeding purposes then to have like

3139
02:24:41,239 --> 02:24:46,920
for feminized production okay it's okay

3140
02:24:44,079 --> 02:24:49,318
but don't you know for for breeding for

3141
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:51,960
purposes of collection and

3142
02:24:49,318 --> 02:24:55,600
preservation ization is not the point

3143
02:24:51,959 --> 02:24:58,679
you know you you you pin it down to one

3144
02:24:55,600 --> 02:25:00,559
phenotype self thing you know that's

3145
02:24:58,680 --> 02:25:02,840
that's not preservation you know

3146
02:25:00,559 --> 02:25:06,600
preservation would mean open pollination

3147
02:25:02,840 --> 02:25:09,520
and a lot of genome hidden in a group of

3148
02:25:06,600 --> 02:25:12,040
family right I mean that is Preservation

3149
02:25:09,520 --> 02:25:15,200
and I think real breeding has to do with

3150
02:25:12,040 --> 02:25:17,920
preservation more than it has to do with

3151
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:19,600
uh pinning down to specific phenotype

3152
02:25:17,920 --> 02:25:21,000
right I mean they are two different

3153
02:25:19,600 --> 02:25:23,040
goals right

3154
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:25,799
one if you're trying to preserve

3155
02:25:23,040 --> 02:25:28,920
genetics then open pollinating using

3156
02:25:25,799 --> 02:25:30,879
large ver large uh populations of plants

3157
02:25:28,920 --> 02:25:34,398
to provide uh

3158
02:25:30,879 --> 02:25:36,679
large uh phenotypic variants uh so that

3159
02:25:34,398 --> 02:25:39,398
you're not bottlenecking your breeding

3160
02:25:36,680 --> 02:25:42,680
projects um that's one style and then if

3161
02:25:39,398 --> 02:25:44,920
you're you know inline breeding reverse

3162
02:25:42,680 --> 02:25:47,559
back Crossing back Crossing trying to

3163
02:25:44,920 --> 02:25:49,840
lock down certain traits for production

3164
02:25:47,559 --> 02:25:52,000
qualities or for desirable qualities for

3165
02:25:49,840 --> 02:25:54,120
an end product that's a totally

3166
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:56,520
different thing and both they're valid

3167
02:25:54,120 --> 02:25:58,880
right you know because we like our drug

3168
02:25:56,520 --> 02:26:01,159
cannabis so it's going to require some

3169
02:25:58,879 --> 02:26:03,000
very intensive breeding practices to get

3170
02:26:01,159 --> 02:26:06,119
to something that people are really

3171
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:07,478
excited about versus you know if it's

3172
02:26:06,120 --> 02:26:10,200
just something where we're trying to

3173
02:26:07,478 --> 02:26:12,920
make sure that we don't lose the access

3174
02:26:10,200 --> 02:26:15,880
to a genetic pool for maybe future

3175
02:26:12,920 --> 02:26:18,318
breeding practices or just for

3176
02:26:15,879 --> 02:26:20,318
preservation sake just for the sake of

3177
02:26:18,318 --> 02:26:24,398
preserving uh what what's in that

3178
02:26:20,318 --> 02:26:26,760
genetic pool then yeah goals one other

3179
02:26:24,398 --> 02:26:28,519
it's it's it it really depends on what

3180
02:26:26,760 --> 02:26:30,478
you're trying to do and I I agree so I

3181
02:26:28,520 --> 02:26:32,239
agree with what you're saying it's when

3182
02:26:30,478 --> 02:26:37,079
you have somebody like Shanti Baba who

3183
02:26:32,239 --> 02:26:40,079
is um he's kind of sticking to what he

3184
02:26:37,079 --> 02:26:44,120
knows doing it as best as he can and

3185
02:26:40,079 --> 02:26:48,359
trying to perfect those practices

3186
02:26:44,120 --> 02:26:51,079
versus creating or chasing some hype

3187
02:26:48,359 --> 02:26:52,559
right yes yes yes yes yes again those

3188
02:26:51,079 --> 02:26:54,559
are just two different mentalities and

3189
02:26:52,559 --> 02:26:56,840
two different mindsets so I that's

3190
02:26:54,559 --> 02:26:58,639
really I see why you have a lot of

3191
02:26:56,840 --> 02:27:01,040
respect for him in terms of trying to

3192
02:26:58,639 --> 02:27:03,559
maintain stuff especially as yourself as

3193
02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:06,120
a librarian of cannabis maintaining

3194
02:27:03,559 --> 02:27:09,439
things that are 20 years old it's hard

3195
02:27:06,120 --> 02:27:11,760
work and lot people that want to do it

3196
02:27:09,439 --> 02:27:15,800
yeah and also not a lot of people want

3197
02:27:11,760 --> 02:27:19,000
it right now no I still keep yeah they

3198
02:27:15,799 --> 02:27:21,000
will and always it's the same thing

3199
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:22,959
people come back and they ask you then

3200
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:25,520
you know why you kept it for so long

3201
02:27:22,959 --> 02:27:28,000
again because from time to time you have

3202
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:30,880
these deals for these cuts and then

man it's the real thing right like for

3207
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:43,799
the plank cut for example I got a few

3208
02:27:41,318 --> 02:27:46,239
months ago I got like hey man thank you

3209
02:27:43,799 --> 02:27:49,119
so much we got a plank cut back again

3210
02:27:46,239 --> 02:27:52,439
from you it is the same thing that we

3211
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:54,920
used to smoke 20 years ago yeah it is

3212
02:27:52,439 --> 02:27:57,120
like that's it that's it this the cut

3213
02:27:54,920 --> 02:27:59,520
you know that's it and that was for me

3214
02:27:57,120 --> 02:28:02,800
was like yes if I have one of that kind

3215
02:27:59,520 --> 02:28:05,120
of customers I'm sa you it's worth it

3216
02:28:02,799 --> 02:28:08,358
yeah absolutely well I just have one

3217
02:28:05,120 --> 02:28:10,560
more question for you then um what is

3218
02:28:08,359 --> 02:28:12,559
the most memorable cannabis related

3219
02:28:10,559 --> 02:28:14,639
experience that you have whether it be

3220
02:28:12,559 --> 02:28:17,079
smoking or growing or just anything

3221
02:28:14,639 --> 02:28:17,079
cannabis

3222
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:23,520
related wow for example definitely will

3223
02:28:21,040 --> 02:28:27,520
be more than smoking

3224
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:31,319
growing it is even more a virus to me

3225
02:28:27,520 --> 02:28:33,840
than using it as a drug recreational

3226
02:28:31,318 --> 02:28:37,600
drug it is actually

3227
02:28:33,840 --> 02:28:39,840
more the growing part was always more uh

3228
02:28:37,600 --> 02:28:42,640
infectious for me than than anything

3229
02:28:39,840 --> 02:28:45,559
else it's like and a specific memory of

3230
02:28:42,639 --> 02:28:49,119
conies would be for example you know

3231
02:28:45,559 --> 02:28:52,039
smoking it in Spain like you know the

3232
02:28:49,120 --> 02:28:55,240
best sativas in Spain the bubble H the

3233
02:28:52,040 --> 02:28:59,080
Moroccan har that that was imported the

3234
02:28:55,239 --> 02:29:02,318
the the you know the the Mongolian ditch

3235
02:28:59,079 --> 02:29:04,279
weat the all these kind of memories that

3236
02:29:02,318 --> 02:29:05,879
you you you were smoking economies all

3237
02:29:04,279 --> 02:29:08,680
around the world but then the best

3238
02:29:05,879 --> 02:29:13,039
homegrown wheat it was always here for

3239
02:29:08,680 --> 02:29:15,479
me uh I I never met I never saw better

3240
02:29:13,040 --> 02:29:18,160
wheat that I could produce it myself for

3241
02:29:15,478 --> 02:29:20,159
sure so it sounds just like you know the

3242
02:29:18,159 --> 02:29:22,318
growing aspect of it like it's just a

3243
02:29:20,159 --> 02:29:24,159
large memory all with a bunch of aspects

3244
02:29:22,318 --> 02:29:25,519
tied together that you know this just

3245
02:29:24,159 --> 02:29:27,478
been something that's been such a part

3246
02:29:25,520 --> 02:29:29,520
of your history that maybe there's not

3247
02:29:27,478 --> 02:29:31,879
just one that stands out but kind of the

3248
02:29:29,520 --> 02:29:33,760
overall aspect of there's been so many

3249
02:29:31,879 --> 02:29:36,318
good memories but the ones that always

3250
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:38,960
bring me back are the the

3251
02:29:36,318 --> 02:29:41,359
Homegrown one I have you know my late

3252
02:29:38,959 --> 02:29:44,278
dad you know he died like 13 years ago

3253
02:29:41,359 --> 02:29:46,200
my father and he was really uh one of

3254
02:29:44,279 --> 02:29:48,200
the first hippie Generations in

3255
02:29:46,200 --> 02:29:51,800
Yugoslavia know they smoked hashish in

3256
02:29:48,200 --> 02:29:56,240
the' 70s you know uh imported from from

3257
02:29:51,799 --> 02:29:58,478
turkey and um he was like also he told

3258
02:29:56,239 --> 02:30:01,159
me about LSD and those stuff you know

3259
02:29:58,478 --> 02:30:03,920
like he he he his idols were Jimmy

3260
02:30:01,159 --> 02:30:05,799
Hendrick and Janice Joplin and you know

3261
02:30:03,920 --> 02:30:09,000
that that stuff you know I grew up with

3262
02:30:05,799 --> 02:30:12,639
that kind of music so and actually when

3263
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:16,398
he found the first Riza that I was like

3264
02:30:12,639 --> 02:30:21,039
12 years old 13 years old and he found a

3265
02:30:16,398 --> 02:30:24,318
Rea in my room what's a rea ARA is the

3266
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:26,640
paper the smoking paper the big one the

3267
02:30:24,318 --> 02:30:29,119
big one you know not the small one for

3268
02:30:26,639 --> 02:30:31,719
tobacco he found the big one and he said

3269
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:35,399
he asked me what are you using them for

3270
02:30:31,719 --> 02:30:38,639
and and I I said for tobacco and he said

3271
02:30:35,398 --> 02:30:42,398
are you smoking big cigarettes right now

3272
02:30:38,639 --> 02:30:45,799
huh so next day man he waited with a

3273
02:30:42,398 --> 02:30:47,840
rolled joint and he smoked with me the

3274
02:30:45,799 --> 02:30:50,199
old joint I was 13 years old my father

3275
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:52,840
you know it's like you will first smoke

3276
02:30:50,200 --> 02:30:56,159
with me and then you can smoke with

3277
02:30:52,840 --> 02:30:58,439
other people that's cool and if you need

3278
02:30:56,159 --> 02:31:00,439
wheat you come to me first and that

3279
02:30:58,439 --> 02:31:02,159
that's what I did after that you know

3280
02:31:00,439 --> 02:31:05,318
it's like cuz he knew what was good not

3281
02:31:02,159 --> 02:31:06,959
yeah yeah that's awesome I I had a

3282
02:31:05,318 --> 02:31:08,920
similar experience and I'll I'll get

3283
02:31:06,959 --> 02:31:10,519
into that in a in a future episode but I

3284
02:31:08,920 --> 02:31:12,559
think you know when you have your first

3285
02:31:10,520 --> 02:31:14,600
experience or uh one of the really

3286
02:31:12,559 --> 02:31:16,079
memorable experiences if it's with like

3287
02:31:14,600 --> 02:31:17,680
a a parent or something that's pretty

3288
02:31:16,079 --> 02:31:19,559
cool I think that's awesome because he

3289
02:31:17,680 --> 02:31:22,479
had you know that is not bad parenting

3290
02:31:19,559 --> 02:31:25,398
actually he was he was he cared so much

3291
02:31:22,478 --> 02:31:28,760
right he cared as a parent that I would

3292
02:31:25,398 --> 02:31:31,079
not get into bad circles right cuz there

3293
02:31:28,760 --> 02:31:33,840
was there was a lot of heroin there was

3294
02:31:31,079 --> 02:31:36,039
a lot of cocain was not at that time but

3295
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:40,159
there's a lot of drugs man it was really

3296
02:31:36,040 --> 02:31:42,520
hardcore you know so better was that he

3297
02:31:40,159 --> 02:31:44,920
you know to know what your kids are up

3298
02:31:42,520 --> 02:31:47,479
to is better than not knowing right

3299
02:31:44,920 --> 02:31:50,760
absolutely when there's a lot of um you

3300
02:31:47,478 --> 02:31:53,119
know set and setting in terms of how you

3301
02:31:50,760 --> 02:31:56,079
experience almost everything right you

3302
02:31:53,120 --> 02:31:58,680
know whether it be a drug or food or uh

3303
02:31:56,079 --> 02:32:00,840
alcoholic beverage or even just you know

3304
02:31:58,680 --> 02:32:03,318
uh a concert right something just like

3305
02:32:00,840 --> 02:32:06,680
an experience if you're in the right

3306
02:32:03,318 --> 02:32:09,000
mindset and the setting around you has

3307
02:32:06,680 --> 02:32:11,600
maybe an energy that you're looking for

3308
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:14,159
or you know if if it's like an upbeat

3309
02:32:11,600 --> 02:32:16,079
positive thing then you're going to

3310
02:32:14,159 --> 02:32:17,760
experience it one way if it's you know

3311
02:32:16,079 --> 02:32:19,959
negative angry you're going to

3312
02:32:17,760 --> 02:32:22,880
experience it another way and so to have

3313
02:32:19,959 --> 02:32:26,438
someone who has as much care for you as

3314
02:32:22,879 --> 02:32:28,959
you know a a parent potentially could

3315
02:32:26,439 --> 02:32:31,239
then you you might just the maybe the

3316
02:32:28,959 --> 02:32:33,358
idea behind it is to provide that set in

3317
02:32:31,239 --> 02:32:37,239
setting where it's not going to be

3318
02:32:33,359 --> 02:32:39,318
a a a problem and not an unenjoyable

3319
02:32:37,239 --> 02:32:44,000
experience you know the sentence would

3320
02:32:39,318 --> 02:32:46,239
be do not deny your kids the education

3321
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:49,000
ever fair enough ever you know what I

3322
02:32:46,239 --> 02:32:50,879
mean if if it's like rolling a joint you

3323
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:52,318
know like don't deny your kids the

3324
02:32:50,879 --> 02:32:55,039
education you

3325
02:32:52,318 --> 02:32:57,439
know look at teach

3326
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:59,720
them I love that you know a little bit

3327
02:32:57,439 --> 02:33:03,398
of joke aside but it's a lot of Truth in

3328
02:32:59,719 --> 02:33:05,639
that no absolutely be be honest to your

3329
02:33:03,398 --> 02:33:08,000
kids be honest you oh I mean if you li

3330
02:33:05,639 --> 02:33:10,079
to them they're going to yeah if telling

3331
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:11,879
them not to do something is the easiest

3332
02:33:10,079 --> 02:33:14,840
way to get them to do something right

3333
02:33:11,879 --> 02:33:17,639
absolutely yeah so I mean by by showing

3334
02:33:14,840 --> 02:33:20,079
them that it's safe that there is or

3335
02:33:17,639 --> 02:33:23,719
that there is safe ways to conse assume

3336
02:33:20,079 --> 02:33:25,719
cannabis that there is um you know

3337
02:33:23,719 --> 02:33:28,639
different products on the market some

3338
02:33:25,719 --> 02:33:31,599
that are benef you know that are good

3339
02:33:28,639 --> 02:33:34,358
some that are potentially bad harmful

3340
02:33:31,600 --> 02:33:36,200
you know these are things that yeah I I

3341
02:33:34,359 --> 02:33:38,680
don't think that it necessarily needs to

3342
02:33:36,200 --> 02:33:43,240
come from a parent but someone who's

3343
02:33:38,680 --> 02:33:44,760
experienced older uh with care you know

3344
02:33:43,239 --> 02:33:48,239
and they're and they're doing it from a

3345
02:33:44,760 --> 02:33:51,079
a place of care and concern versus

3346
02:33:48,239 --> 02:33:52,398
punishment and Authority right yes I

3347
02:33:51,079 --> 02:33:55,239
think that that's a really important

3348
02:33:52,398 --> 02:33:57,879
thing um well Sasha this has been a
